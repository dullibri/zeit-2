RESTAURANT menus. Price tags. Caller-ID.
These are among the first things to become harder to read as people slide further into middle age and their eyes lose their ability to focus. What can begin as a gentle blur might end with not being able to make out the peas on your plate.
This condition, known as presbyopia, is the slow deterioration of close vision and is most commonly attributed to aging. It is caused by a loss of elasticity of the crystalline lens, the structure behind the iris that enables the eye to focus on objects at various distances.
The arrival of presbyopia can be ''one of those 'Whoa, I'm aging' moments,'' said Randy Savin, 50, president of an insurance agency in Solon, Ohio. 
For Mr. Savin, that moment came two years ago when he realized he had to hold the newspaper at a distance to read it. At the time, he could count on both hands the number of prescription glasses he used for distance: he had eight pairs that floated between his two cars, home and office.
''I just couldn't handle the thought of adding readers to my life,'' Mr. Savin said.
Until recently, there wasn't much more one could do than to succumb to a pair of reading glasses, or try to correct the problem with either monovision contact lenses (one eye is corrected for distance, one for up close) or laser surgery.
But Mr. Savin didn't want bifocals (or to wear glasses all the time) or contact lenses (too complicated). And he never considered Lasik surgery, which carries a risk of vision loss and would likely require additional surgeries to correct for progressing presbyopia.
Instead, he opted to join a study two years ago for a new presbyopia treatment called the transscleral light therapy system in which a laser device emits a low level of light aimed at strengthening the ciliary muscle (which bends and straightens the lens) under the whites of the eyes.
The treatment is still in early trials with the Food and Drug Administration, said Jim Ohneck, the chief executive of Oculatek, the company developing the system. Mr. Ohneck said he expected that the therapy would not become widely available for at least another year or two.
Of the study, Mr. Savin said, ''At first, I was skeptical.''
But after undergoing weekly 10-minute sessions at an ophthalmologist's office for five consecutive weeks, followed by periodic tune-up sessions about every six months, Mr. Savin said he has not needed reading glasses and only occasionally uses his distance glasses for driving at night.
With the last of the baby boomers turning 45 this year, experts in the eye care industry say the potential for the presbyopia correction market is huge.
Dave Harmon, president of Market Scope, an eye care research company, said that 85 million Americans have presbyopia; 35 million of them wear reading glasses, 16 million wear multifocal or monovision contact lenses; and 34 million wear bifocals or other multifocal spectacles.
This translates into a lot of people searching for other optical options.
''Finding a solution to presbyopia is the golden opportunity that ophthalmic companies, venture capitalists and ophthalmologists are all chasing,'' Mr. Harmon said.
In addition to transscleral light therapy, there are several surgical options available today, including refractive lens exchange. This outpatient surgery, which is typically performed on cataract patients in an ophthalmologist's office, involves replacing the natural crystalline lens with an artificial one, of which three have recently been approved by the F.D.A. to correct for presbyopia.
''All the surgical options include some compromises, and not all presbyopes are good candidates for the procedures,'' Mr. Harmon said. ''Surgical correction will always be a more costly solution when compared to reading glasses and contact lenses.''
But even though refractive lens exchange is only covered by insurance if a patient has cataracts, last year about 38,000 Americans chose to have their natural lenses replaced with lenses that correct for vision problems, including presbyopia, Mr. Harmon said.
People with presbyopia who may not be candidates for eye surgery such as Lasik (because of cornea irregularities, for example) can find great improvement with the refractive lens exchange, said Dr. Marguerite MacDonald, an ophthalmologist in Lindbrook, N.Y., and spokeswoman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology.
''But, the candidates tend to be mostly well-heeled boomers because of the cost,'' she said. ''And, in this economy, who knows?''
Laura Hershkowitz wore thick-tinted Chanel glasses for years, working at the crystal and china store she owns with her husband in Rockville Center, N.Y. Disappointed after finding out she wasn't a candidate for Lasik surgery because of corneal irregularities, Ms. Hershkowitz was told she was a good candidate for refractive lens exchange, which would correct for her poor distance vision and enable her to perform up-close tasks glasses-free.
''My husband and mother chipped in and got it for my 50th birthday,'' Ms. Hershkowitz said. ''To not have to wear glasses after a lifetime of them is such a thrill.''
The cost of having both eyes done in October (her right lens was exchanged first, then her left two weeks later) was $8,000. With a minimum of downtime, which she described as ''a couple of days of dark glasses,'' her vision, she said, is now ''wonderful.''
Dr. Jay Bansal, an ophthalmologist in Santa Rosa, Calif., said: ''It's really almost a word-of-mouth alternative for presbyopes, but I think we're on the threshold of it being an exciting treatment option.
''Monovision has been available for a long time, but a lot of people don't want to do it. The sacrifices are too great. They don't get good stereo vision. And yet, people are highly motivated to get out of their glasses and contacts.''
He said many of his patients with cataracts are willing to pay the $900 per lens upcharge for presbyopia correcting lenses, in order to lessen their reliance on reading glasses.
Karen Eisenman, 63, of Calistoga, Calif., who works in the payroll department of a Napa Valley winery, wore bifocal contact lenses that corrected for distance and presbyopia for 15 years. But her doctor told her that contact lenses were not allowing enough oxygen through to her eyes and that she should either switch to glasses, or consider surgery.
Even though Ms. Eisenman didn't have cataracts, she thought that at her age Lasik surgery wasn't a long-term solution. Instead, she chose refractive lens exchange.
''Yes, it was expensive,'' she said -- in her case, over $10,000. ''But when you don't see well, you don't really want to do anything with the money anyway.''
Look, No More Glasses
SINCE the surgery in October, she still has a bit of a haloing effect: a mild haze around objects in low light, a common complaint of refractive lens exchange post-operative patients. But she was told it is likely to clear up within six months to a year of the surgery.
''It's better than it was,'' she said. ''And, to wake up, first thing in the morning and see everything near and far with such crispness and breadth, to me it's totally worth it.''
Here are several options for those with presbyopia.
Progressive Addition Lenses The lenses offer a more gradual visual transition between the two prescriptions, with no visible lines between them. Usually worn all day.
Bifocal and Multifocal Contact Lenses These carry a prescription for nearsightedness or farsightedness, with a stronger prescription for close work. The brain makes the correct choice depending on how close or far you are trying to see.
Monovision Lenses One eye wears a lens with a distance prescription, the other wears a lens for near vision. The brain learns to favor one eye or the other for different tasks.
Monovision and Conductive KeratoplastyThis three-minute outpatient surgical procedure uses low-level radio-frequency energy to shrink collagen in the periphery of the cornea. This steepens the central cornea, in effect lengthening a too-short eyeball. The procedure is used to help one eye see better up close, while the other eye is untouched.
Monovision Lasik Surgery One eye is corrected for distance vision and one for near vision. It is a 10- to 15-minute procedure per eye, and is usually done in one visit. As presbyopia progresses, additional surgeries may be required.
Refractive Lens Exchange or Clear Lens Extraction This 15-minute outpatient procedure is usually done one eye at a time with a couple of weeks between surgeries. It involves removing the eye's natural lens and inserting an artificial one in a procedure identical to cataract surgery.

HEADLINE: A Gift Good Enough to Give, Over and Over Again

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Good stories abound in ''Re-Gifting: You Shouldn't Have. But if You Did, Here's How to Get Away With It'' (House & Home, Dec. 25). But Junette John's insight about her mother stood out for me. 
 ''She never appreciates what I do,'' Ms. John realized, discovering that her gift to her mother of cologne with a handbag had been re-gifted by her younger brother to a family friend. 
 Given my own experience, I wonder if there's a better reaction than shocked silence when parents re-gift to another sibling things that don't even belong to the parents. 
 This happened long ago. But I still remember feeling diminished and unappreciated, after a youthful divorce, upon noticing my aqua-blue bookcase, my collection of childhood books and a fine selection of my wedding gifts, including a brand-new Osterizer blender -- all stored at my parents' house, waiting for me to furnish my own apartment -- adorning a sibling's house.

 To the Editor:
 In a time of financial crisis, when families are losing their homes, accomplished people are losing jobs and families of all classes and races are being stressed to the breaking point, wouldn't it have been better to offer an alternative to gift-giving, period? 
 At Hedge Funds Care/Preventing and Treating Child Abuse, we suggest that people make a donation to this cause in exchange for some cards that say, ''A donation has been made in your honor to Hedge Funds Care.'' 
 The cards can be slipped into a holiday card and mailed, or even put into a box and elaborately wrapped. 
 We are not the only charity that does this. It is a meaningful, valued way to spend money, contribute to a worthy cause and honor someone. 
 As far as I know, not once have we been re-gifted. Kathryn Conroy

 To the Editor:
 The House & Home article on re-gifting was a masterpiece of storytelling, practical advice and subtle humor. 
 I would recommend a sequel on the subject of ''re-stocking'' or ''re-shelving'' gifts, often done by young adults. 
 This consists of returning gifts to the store where they were bought, and using the gift receipt, which often comes with the package, for cash or alternative gift choices within the store. 
 In addition, I notice that there is an increasing tendency of young adults to sell most of their gifts on various Web sites as another way to make money.

HEADLINE: Who Can Afford a Bottle of Champagne? I'll Take a Case of the Red

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
It may not have been the year to buy a $150 bottle of Dom Perignon. But perhaps it was the year to buy four $35 bottles of Korbel.
 In response to the economic downturn, alcohol retailers and industry experts say, consumers have been trading down for less expensive wines and spirits. But what they have saved per bottle, many have almost made up for in quantity. 
 ''People are loading up on a lot more of the things that cost less,'' said Michael Cappadona, the assistant store manager at Total Wine in West Orange, N.J. ''People that would normally come in and might buy five or six bottles are now wanting to buy something cheaper by the case.'' 
 Costly wines have languished on shelves for months as consumers have opted for cheaper substitutes. On New Year's Eve, one of the busiest sales days of the year for many wine stores, retailers reported consumers giving up last year's $70 bottles of Champagne -- which technically refers only to bubbly wine from the Champagne area of France -- for $10 or $20 sparkling wines from California, Italy and Spain. 
 ''Everybody's trading down,'' said Chris Adams, executive vice president of Sherry-Lehmann, a wine and spirits store in Manhattan. 
 But Mr. Adams, like Mr. Cappadona, says his revenue has been largely unchanged because the quantity of bottles sold has increased. At Wine.com, a large online alcohol retailer, the average price of a bottle of wine sold in December 2008 was 17 percent below the average price of a bottle sold in December 2007 -- but the number of bottles sold was 15 percent higher than a year ago. 
 Why might consumers be purchasing more bottles from these outlets? There are a couple of theories.
 ''People might be buying more in retail stores since they're not spending as much in restaurants,'' said Jon Fredrikson, of Gomberg, Fredrikson & Associates, a wine industry consulting company in the San Francisco Bay Area. Perhaps they are trying to replicate the restaurant experience by uncorking at home.
 Of course, people may also be drinking away their troubles. While the research is mixed, some scholars say that poor economic conditions can lead to heavier drinking, and some retailers attest to such a trend. Mr. Adams said, for example, that spirits sales --especially vodka -- skyrocketed in October, as the market plunged. 
 ''We don't want to speculate about why people were buying more vodka, though there was a spike in sales,'' he said. ''So are people now perhaps seeking a nice glass of red wine to take the edge off? I hope so.''
 Changes in corporate gifts may also have been a small factor. Some wine sellers said their business customers had spent roughly the same amount of money on each corporate gift as last year, but they chose multiple bottles of less expensive wines for each recipient rather than one big flashy bottle that might ''send the wrong message.''
 ''With Dom Perignon, it's not the most expensive Champagne we sell, but there probably isn't a bigger brand name when it comes to Champagne,'' said Michael Osborn, founder of Wine.com. ''Sending a bottle of Dom Perignon this Christmas sends a whole different message, whereas you wouldn't think for a second about some bottles of a Napa cabernet, no matter what the expense. That Dom Perignon is like taking the Learjet to Washington.''
 That does not mean customers have given up occasionally treating themselves.
 ''The people who have been splurging have been doing it surreptitiously,'' said Jesse Salazar, the wine director at Union Square Wines in Manhattan. 
 ''There's the secret pour and the pour for the guests at large,'' he said. ''I was at a Christmas party recently where there was a substantial amount of wine being purchased. But there was a party case, and then there was the host case back in the kitchen. The host was drinking Bordeaux; the guests were drinking Chianti.''

HEADLINE: Ways to Discourage Illegal Immigrants

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Call Off the Immigrant Hunt,'' by Jorge G. Castaneda (Op-Ed, Dec. 28):
 Without disagreeing with Professor Castaneda's plea for more humane treatment of illegal immigrants, I would like to ask what he did while he was a member of the Mexican cabinet to improve the economic lot of his people and so stem the tide of illegal immigration into the United States. Human rights organizations rightly monitor and condemn abuses like censorship and persecution of political opponents. Isn't a government's failure to provide its citizens with sanitation, basic education and the means of feeding their families also an abuse of human rights?
 The United States is good at putting pressure on Iran, India, Pakistan and Korea on various issues, and at calling to account nations where coca and opium poppies are grown. Why does the United States not engage countries that compel their citizens to leave or die? 
 It seems to me that illegal immigration is not principally an enforcement failure. It is a foreign policy failure. 
 Alma Suzin Flesch
 New York, Dec. 28, 2008
 To the Editor:
 We must support our government's efforts to finally enforce our immigration laws. At a time of rising unemployment and financial uncertainty, we must protect United States workers from the wage competition brought on by mass immigration.
 With state and local budgets stretched beyond repair, we cannot continue to provide benefits for anyone who wants to sneak into the country. If we want to create a sustainable society, we must recognize that there are limits to the number of people we can employ, house, feed and provide health care for.
 Current legal immigration levels are far higher than our historical average and are causing dramatic long-term problems for our basic infrastructure, resources and environment. Think of the impact if we add an unlimited number of illegal immigrants.
 As a nation we must get serious about enforcing our immigration laws and returning to historical immigration rates. Christopher Brigham
 Somerville, Mass., Dec. 28, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Jorge G. Castaneda, the former foreign minister of Mexico, should worry more about the mess in his own country than about United States policy toward illegal immigrants.
 Mexico is actually relatively wealthy by world standards and used to have a substantial middle class, but corruption has changed that. In fact, our crackdown on illegal immigrants, which Mr. Castaneda opposes, might help Mexico deal with these problems. 
 Why? Because those who are willing to risk so much to sneak across the border are the same people who would be most likely to push for change in their own country should we continue to eliminate the incentives for them to come here.
 By functioning as a safety valve, we are enabling our southern neighbor's bad policies. David C. Holzman
 Lexington, Mass., Dec. 29, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Your editorial ''Getting Immigration Right'' (Dec. 26) states that the Bush administration ''mocked the American tradition of welcoming and assimilating immigrant workers.'' 
 President Bush ran on a platform of immigration reform. He, along with Labor Secretary Elaine Chao, herself an immigrant, actively campaigned for the Senate's Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, which would have given legal status to undocumented immigrants without criminal records and allowed them to work while waiting to become citizens.
 Immigration reform failed because of Congressional opposition, not because of the Bush administration.

HEADLINE: In the Cold

 BODY:
This winter day begins a new year of the mortgage crisis. Nothing is certain about the miseries ahead except that they are growing. It is, for example, a freezing morning on Long Island -- a national symbol of the single-family suburb. Its two counties, Nassau and Suffolk, boast well-run governments, an educated work force and a long history of stability and affluence. Comfort and consumption are the twin strands of their DNA. But the struggle there is acute.
 In Nassau County, New York State's richest one, the foreclosure whirlwind hit hard. Shelters are filling up and food pantries are emptying. More than 500 people sought emergency housing from the county in a recent December week. Most were families with children. 
 Connie Lassandro, Nassau's director of housing and homeless services, said the need had risen 30 percent to 40 percent over 2007, as the face of poverty changed. More overburdened homeowners and the elderly are coming forward now -- often bewildered and ashamed. 
 Private outreach organizations, too, are buried under an avalanche of need. Alric Kennedy, director of community resources for the Long Island Council of Churches, said the council used to be able to help some clients with a month's rent or mortgage but the money ran out last October. It referred people to other agencies until those funds dried up, too. More people than ever are coming to its emergency food centers -- 40 to 60 on a typical day in Freeport, in Nassau; 100 or more seek help in Riverhead, in eastern Suffolk. They are desperate for food, diapers, cooking oil and baby formula.
 These are not the chronic homeless. ''Our donors are now our clients,'' Mr. Kennedy said. ''People who gave us food are now asking us to help them.''
 As people lose not only homes but also jobs, pain is cascading to the bottom rungs of the economy. The Workplace Project, a longstanding defender of immigrant workers' rights in Hempstead, has seen an alarming rise in reports of unpaid wages, said Nadia Marin-Molina, its executive director. Contractors are cutting costs by missing payrolls and are counting on an undocumented work force not to complain.
 Domestic workers are seeing wages cut in half, Ms. Marin-Molina said, as their bosses tell them to come back to clean house every other week. 
 When the undocumented lose their jobs and homes, there is no government agency they can turn to. Some of that need is being met by charitable organizations. The Huntington Interfaith Homeless Initiative is a network of church volunteers who give homeless men, mostly Latino immigrants, an alternative to sleeping -- and freezing -- in the woods. In cold months, they take them into church halls and basements, offering meals, winter coats and hot showers. They do this into the spring. But this economic chill won't be gone by then.
 Nassau County's comptroller announced this week that sales taxes -- a mainstay of county revenue -- could fall for the first time in nearly 20 years, which would blow a $24 million hole in the 2008 budget. Other local governments and nonprofits are looking to the federal government for help and for billions that might refill empty coffers and loosen tightened belts. But there are no assurances that the aid will be enough -- only uncertainty in a place that has been shaken to the core.
 ''I've been doing this for over 30 years, and I've never seen it like this,'' Ms. Lassandro of Nassau County said. ''Nobody's exempt from it.'' 
 Ms. Marin-Molina was astounded by the turnout for The Workplace Project's annual Christmas party. ''An incredible number of people came,'' she said. ''At least a hundred.'' Most were men who needed help and were grateful to go home after a hot meal with donated sweatshirts, hats and gloves.

HEADLINE: In Shaky Job Climate, Busy Days for a Public Workers' Newspaper

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
When World War II ended in August 1945, and millions poured into the streets to celebrate the end of the conflict, The Chief, New York City's civil service weekly, responded to the news with a banner headline: ''How V-J Day Affects U.S. Employees.'' The lead article cited job openings in federal agencies helping veterans to adjust to civilian life.
 One then might wonder how The Chief, now in its 112th year as a newspaper devoted to public employees, their unions and the municipal bureaucracy, and known for its comprehensive listings of government job openings and civil service exams, is holding up during what many regard as the worst economic crisis in decades. 
 This much can certainly be said: There has been no shortage of news.
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg eliminated some night shifts at firehouses and wants to cancel an entire Police Academy class. Gov. David A. Paterson is moving to make pensions less generous and cut education financing. Unions are restive, but hope that President-elect Barack Obama will increase federal aid to cities.
 ''It hasn't come to the point where people are being laid off,'' Richard Steier, The Chief's editor, said of the budgetary pressures faced by the state and city. ''And you haven't felt a direct impact yet in terms of a shortage of cops, or firehouse closings. These are all exercises at this point -- simply budgetary maneuvers that haven't become reality.''
 Civil service jobs, so far, have been an anchor of stability at a time when Wall Street and private employers are slashing jobs. 
 New York City has some 280,000 employees, and even during the worst moments of its fiscal crisis in the mid-1970s, the city's work force shrank only by modest amounts. Someone needs to patrol the streets, pick up the trash and fix the potholes, and severe cuts in city services seem, at least for now, to be less likely than tax increases. 
 The Chief, which is based in Cass Gilbert's Broadway Chambers Building in Lower Manhattan, embraces the description ''old-fashioned.'' Its nameplate features the red silhouette of a rising sun. Nearly every issue, 12 to 16 pages, contains long lists of hirings and promotions, professional certifications and exam deadlines -- the kind of raw data rarely found in print anymore. 
 The Chief, owned by one family since 1919, has seen a slight drop in advertising and reported an average weekly paid circulation of 29,457 as of September, down from more than 50,000 a decade ago, according to its publisher, Edward B. Prial.
 Each issue goes on sale on Tuesdays, carrying the following Friday's date, and newsstand sales make up about half of its circulation. The price rose to 75 cents, from 50 cents, in 2004. 
 In May, The Chief completed a subtle redesign, switching to six columns of text, from eight, and changing its headline typeface. More photographs -- black-and-white, single-column headshots of union leaders and city officials -- now grace the front page. 
 But little else has changed. ''People are reading the paper for what's in it,'' Mr. Prial said. ''We've been around a long time, and we shouldn't try to look like we were born yesterday.'' 
 By tradition, the lead article each week is about opportunities to apply for government jobs or take civil service exams. Recent lead articles concerned the hiring of correction officers, construction managers, adult-services caseworkers, traffic enforcement agents and sewage treatment workers, all city jobs. 
 Tommy Hallissey, 30, the reporter who compiles the lead article, consults the Web site of the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, and other official sources, for ideas. Occasionally he highlights federal or state positions. (The Nov. 28 issue reported that United States Customs and Border Protection was looking to hire thousands of Border Patrol agents willing to move to the West and Southwest for jobs starting at $36,000 a year.) 
 Other articles concern labor disputes, contract negotiations, union politics and legislation affecting civil servants. The newspaper thoroughly covers awards to civil servants for heroism, graduations of rookie police officers and on-the-job deaths.
 David Sims, 22, one of three reporters, used to cover celebrities as a freelance writer for People magazine. Now he writes about District Council 37, a Teamsters local, and unions representing teachers, principals and City University professors. Asked to compare the assignments, he said, diplomatically, ''There are celebrities within every sphere.'' 
 The Chief began on April 24, 1897, as a periodical for firefighters and soon broadened its focus to include police officers. By the time a union leader named Frank J. Prial bought the paper in 1919, The Chief had defined itself as the voice of New York's civil servants. 
 Mr. Prial, a Democratic activist who ran unsuccessfully for city comptroller in 1933, published the paper until his death in 1948. Since 1980, when it acquired its only rival, The Leader, the paper has been officially The Chief-Leader. But everyone still calls it The Chief. 
 Early on, the paper published citizenship guides for new immigrants, advocated equal pay for women, opposed veterans' preferences for civil service exams and noted with approval the promotions of black firefighters to officer level. The paper, a bastion of Democratic politics, endorsed Rudolph W. Giuliani for mayor in 1993 and 1997 and another Republican, Michael R. Bloomberg, for re-election in 2005. 
 But above all, Mr. Steier wrote in a series of articles commemorating the paper's centennial, The Chief stands ''for the merit system and against any attempt by elected officials -- reformer or clubhouse, liberal or conservative -- to weaken it.'' And if major layoffs are now in store, Mr. Steier vowed, The Chief will be there to cover them.

HEADLINE: The Enlightened Path, With a Rubber Duck

BYLINE: By ABBY ELLIN

 BODY:
MUST the road to enlightenment be paved in sincerity? Can only the super-earnest attain spiritual salvation?
Some yoga teachers have been pondering these mysteries with the gravity of an economic summit. And they are chanting in unison, ''Nooohhhhm.''
''I do think there's a trend toward lightening up in the yoga community,'' said Kelly McGonigal, 31, the editor in chief of the International Journal of Yoga Therapy (found at iayt.org). ''Mostly around the rigidity and humorlessness of doing things 'the one right way' -- always having to get better, feeling like every yoga practice has to be one big self-improvement project.''
One stereotype of yoga is of a reed-thin, baggy-panted guru gravely pontificating on the meaning of life while a sitar strains in the background. But now some teachers are poking holes in this austere image, infusing levity into classes in an effort to appeal to more students. They are cracking jokes, chanting to pop lyrics, posting humorous videos online and putting a uniquely Western stamp on asanas, or poses. 
The yoga community appears ready for it. A spoof of a student who comes to class to pick up women, ''The Inappropriate Yoga Guy'' -- which, at the same time, mocks the holier-than-thou attitude of some yoga followers -- has been viewed more than two million times on YouTube, according to the Web site's counter. Amanda Wegner, 28, a yoga teacher in Madison, Wis., often demonstrates a variation of standing-knee-to-chest that she calls ''Captain Morgan pose,'' like the rum. ''Not exactly yogic, but it keeps it interesting, and most often, the students know exactly what I mean,'' she said.
Sadie Nardini, the director of yoga at East West Yoga in Manhattan, calls herself ''reverently irreverent,'' and said she runs a kind of ''punk rock'' practice (never mind the inherent sanctimony in the word ''practice''). ''People are moving away from what I call the Madame Tussauds yogi, frozen in a super-serious face, and instead want to rediscover the joy of living, even on the mat,'' said Ms. Nardini, 37, who has been teaching for 10 years and practicing for 15.
Her cheekiness is on display on her YouTube video, ''The Bon Jovi Chant'' which features a close-up of Ms. Nardini, fingers clasped, leading a hearty rendition of the noted sage Jon Bon Jovi's ''Living on a Prayer.'' (It's hard to feel self-important when the mantra is ''Whooooa! We're halfway there! Whooooa! Livin' on a prayer!'')
''People laugh at first and then get teary chanting Bon Jovi,'' she said. There are yogic benefits, too: ''When you laugh, you open your heart to reality,'' she said. ''Truth is there, deep in that laughing place.''
Finding truth was one of the original goals of yoga, which dates to the Upanishads (Hindu scriptures) between 5000 to 1000 B.C., scholars estimate, with the first yoga-specific Upanishads closer to 500 B.C.
Back then, yoga was a spiritual practice intended to lead practitioners to a form of insight. Today, many Western devotees cite the tranquillity they have found after twisting their bodies into pretzel-like contortions (not to mention excuses to visit India, yoga's birthplace). But others say it is simply a form of exercise, a gateway to physical relaxation.
With that in mind, many teachers introduce their own spiritual teaching, some less solemn than others.
Erin Motzenbecker, 21, has been teaching a combination of yoga, Pilates and tai chi for about three years. Her policy is to ''not say anything in my classes that doesn't sound like me in real life,'' she said, recalling an instructor who talked about ''allowing your heart to open like a lotus flower and find your quiet place of enlightenment.''
Instead of tiptoeing into the studio and silently waiting for her students to set up their mats, Ms. Motzenbecker prefers to share incidents from her own life: how her sister thought Tina Fey was actually John McCain's running mate; how she dressed her dog as Shrek for Halloween.
''I teach a class of suburban housewives who want to do something good for themselves without being knocked over the head with a bunch of spiritual hokey-pokey,'' she said. ''This is not to say that I am against the spiritual side of it, because personally I enjoy those types of classes, too. But you have to cater to the people you're teaching.''
Luann Udell, 56, an artist in Keene, N.H., refuses to take classes that are too ''authoritarian'' or ''martial.''
''Some teachers treat yoga like a church service -- solemn, unworldly, mystical,'' she said. ''I know it can be those things, but yoga also can teach us to simply enjoy being in this moment, in this body. It can open our hearts to the gifts right in front of us that we take for granted. And being in this moment, in this body, means being in a body that burps, creaks, aches and laughs.''
Havi Brooks, 31, a yoga teacher in Portland, Ore., tries to lighten the mood by using a rubber duck named Selma that she refers to as her co-teacher.
If students seem to be a too uptight during, say, breathing exercises, Ms. Brooks might have them balance Selma on their heads. ''I wanted to make yoga accessible for people who think chakras are a bunch of bull and that yoga people are hippie-dippie gullible fools,'' Ms. Brooks said.
''As soon as you bring out a duck and say this is my co-teacher, people know this is a different kind of yoga.''
Sarah Court's way of poking fun at overly earnest practitioners was to create satirical videos called Yoga Thugs, which she posted on YouTube. The videos address everything from Yoga-induced body odor to students texting during downward-facing dog (inspired by her own experiences).
''I don't want people to think I don't take yoga seriously, because I absolutely do, but I just think there's room for humor as well,'' said Ms. Court, 34, a yoga instructor in New York. ''Does it make me better at yoga if I take myself really seriously? No.''
Some attempts at taking yoga lightly might still come across as being heavy.
Karen B. Cohen, 46, of Lexington, Va., said she is a ''master'' yoga instructor, and holds the ''highest designation'' in the national Yoga Teachers' Registry, maintained by the Yoga Alliance, an industry organization. Her credentials notwithstanding, she said she rejects the ''serious'' yoga approach.
''The ability to cultivate joy and lightness in our lives is one of the principal aims of true yoga: the bringing of opposing qualities into a productive harmony,'' she said. ''Our desire to do our best, our concentrated effort -- abhyasa -- needs to be balanced with the letting go of perfectionism, being happy with what 'is': vairagya.'' Most classes today, she said, seem to be too heavy on the abhyasa and not focused enough on the vairagya, which leads to self-acceptance, more fun, and peace.
''Laughing is healthy,'' she said. ''Joy is healthy. A bit of goofy is good. Seeing and experiencing the humor in tough situations -- that is yoga. Yoga teaches us to enjoy and embrace paradox.''
Others explain their thinking in less, well, lofty terms.
''What gets the biggest laughs in my classes are when I say out loud some of the stuff that's going on in people's heads, but nobody really talks about,'' said Ms. McGonigal, who teaches at Avalon Art and Yoga Center in Palo Alto, Calif. ''Like in the middle of the usual instruction for a pose, slip in, 'Please inspect your toenail polish and wonder if class is almost over.'
''Everyone laughs, it gets the point of mindfulness across, but there's no judgment, and we aren't taking ourselves too seriously. Ego is the enemy of both humor and yoga.''

HEADLINE: For Buyout Firms, More Pain in 2009

BYLINE: By LAUREN SILVA LAUGHLIN

 BODY:
For Buyout Firms,
 More Pain in 2009
 The new year didn't come fast enough for buyout firms. In 2008, deals imploded and portfolio companies went bankrupt. It was nearly impossible to sell a company, and struggling investors started complaining about capital calls. Problems cropped up throughout the industry. 
 Unfortunately, buyout bosses don't have much to look forward to this year. Debt markets aren't likely to rebound much. Restructuring opportunities might pop up, but traditional leveraged buyouts will be scarce and difficult to pull off. And many buyout firms have to repair strained relationships with their bankers and investors. 
 In fact, the leveraged buyout business has screeched nearly to a halt. Deal volume fell around 70 percent in 2008 from the previous year's levels, according to Dealogic. Buyout firms sold companies worth only around $6 billion in the fourth quarter, a tiny fraction of the $110 billion of sales in the second quarter of 2007, at the peak of the boom. Portfolio companies started to succumb to the economic malaise and credit crisis. Several big-name L.B.O.'s toppled under the weight of their debt, including Linens 'n Things, which liquidated, and the Tribune Company, which filed for bankruptcy protection. 
 The slowdown in new deal activity was mostly a result of the frozen debt markets. This, along with plummeting equity markets, made it hard to sell portfolio companies. Deal volumes will probably remain anemic this year. 
 Some private equity firms might try to keep busy by buying troubled companies on the cheap. Or they could team up with strategic buyers on mergers. But neither type of deal will keep them busy enough. In fact, buyout firms, along with the so-called financial sponsors groups that serve them at banks, are already beginning to cut staff. 
 Even if private equity firms want to snap up distressed companies, they might have trouble getting financing. Their investors are running short on cash. Permira's biggest investor, SVG Capital, recently cut private equity commitments by 40 percent.
 The country's largest public pension fund, Calpers, is seeking more liquid investments. TPG is letting investors cut their commitments by 10 percent. Even so, if other asset classes don't rebound, pension funds seeking to keep their portfolio allocations stable could be forced to sell more buyout investments at big discounts. 
 This year may be worse. Valuations of private equity investments tend to lag others, because they don't need to be valued on a market basis each quarter. So investors may endure drastic drops in their portfolio valuations well into this year from losses made in 2008. 
 Even if things rebound, private equity firms will need to repair their relationships with banks before a raft of new deals can struggle to market. Lenders took huge losses on loans because of aggressive L.B.O. structures and pricing. Standard & Poor's Leveraged Commentary and Data pegged L.B.O. loan values at only 66 cents on the dollar in late December, meaning banks have suffered severe losses on the few deals that remain on their books. Some big private equity firms have faced off against their lenders in court. All this means banks are going to be much more careful about the terms of the deals they cut in the future. 
 Fees charged by the firms may also come under scrutiny. Private equity investors suffer losses incurred by fund managers. But those managers can still get rich from the fees they collect for finding and executing deals, as well as for managing investors' money -- no matter how unsuccessfully.
 Deal fees, in particular, could become a point of contention. Buyout shops collected nearly $400 million, in total, for the acquisitions of Harrah's Entertainment and Freescale Semiconductor. They typically pay some of that cash to investors, but also take a big chunk for themselves. Both of those companies are struggling. If investors end up losing money on aggressive deals where buyout managers made big windfalls from fees, they will question managers' motives as well as their judgment. 
 Publicly listed private equity firms are even worse off. Their increasingly aggrieved shareholders limit their flexibility. They don't have the luxury of closing shop for a while or making concessions on fees or investor funding commitments. That's in addition to the daily embarrassment of seeing how far their stock prices have fallen. 
 The financial crisis has taught the buyout barons who strutted the earth a mere 18 months ago important lessons in humility. Their education will no doubt continue in 2009. LAUREN SILVA LAUGHLIN

HEADLINE: Ominous Cutbacks At Chanel

BYLINE: By ERIC WILSON

 BODY:
IN the scope of dismal events unfolding at luxury fashion companies, the news this week that Chanel would cut 200 jobs in Paris calls to mind a certain apres moi sentiment of Louis XV. 
 If Chanel is cutting back, what's next?
 Luxury brands were once thought of -- or self-styled -- as immune to economic pitfalls, but the precipitous decline in sales at retailers like Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue has shown how serious an impact the global recession has had on all parts of the marketplace. Still, Chanel, with its array of tweedy clothes, quilted handbags and fruitful fragrances that approach $5 billion in annual sales, was considered the paradigm of luxury brands, so its retrenchment is seen as especially ominous.
 ''Everyone is looking at their business right now,'' said Robert Burke, a fashion consultant, who nonetheless said he was surprised to see cutbacks at Chanel.
 ''What we're seeing is not necessarily isolated just to the high-end companies or the midprice or mass,'' he said. ''It's a time when everyone is re-evaluating.''
 The 200 affected jobs were estimated by The Guardian in London to represent 10 percent of Chanel's production work force and include 16 positions at the Chanel store on the Rue Cambon. Chanel executives did not return calls this week, but the losses were attributed by the workers' union in France to a steep decline in sales.
 Two weeks ago, the company also said it would cancel events that had been planned around its touring museum called Mobile Art, a shell-like pavilion designed by Zaha Hadid that was last seen in New York, in Central Park, and included works inspired by a handbag. Chanel attributed the move to the economy, but Karl Lagerfeld, the label's designer, said it was an artistic choice: he had tired of the art inside. (''Today, everyone can say that something is for financial reasons when they want,'' he told Women's Wear Daily. ''For me, artistic reasons are more important.'')
 That decision caused speculation that the company, one of the last French brands to present its collections in splendorous settings with elaborately constructed stages, might also trim its budget for such promotions. What's the good of showing another Chanel purse, if the wallet is empty?

HEADLINE: Sunny Time for Bikes Hits a Chilly Zone

BYLINE: By JAN ELLEN SPIEGEL

 BODY:
After a summer of their dreams, bicycle store owners are facing a grim reality this winter. 
 Big increases in business this year led some shop owners to think that they were largely insulated from a slowing economy. But the economy has continued to spiral downward, taking bicycle sales and much else with it. 
 The question now is whether all the bicyclists who appeared last summer will be back next summer. 
 ''This is not like the rest of the recessions we've been through,'' said Jay Graves, who owns six Bike Gallery stores in Portland, Ore., the first of which his father started in 1974. 
 Business skyrocketed last summer along with gasoline prices, Mr. Graves said, especially sales of hybrid bikes that can be used for recreation and transportation. So Mr. Graves ordered plenty of cold weather gear for what he believed would be legions of new bike commuters.
 ''We wished we hadn't gone in quite as heavy,'' Mr. Graves said. ''Business is not growing at the rate it was earlier in the year.''
 Summer is high season anyway for bicycle store sales; Christmas sales are minuscule comparatively. And double-digit increases in revenue for the stores last summer only underscored the unpredictability of the business.
 Industry analysts like Jay Townley, a partner with the Gluskin Townley Group, bicycle industry consultants in Wisconsin, were skeptical even last summer that small bike stores would sustain their surge in the off-season. 
 They said even then that bicycle store owners and managers who had made the same inventory decision as Mr. Graves were misreading the indicators. What owners perceived to be a commuter trend was probably not. The analysts argued that bicycle commuters were generally a fixed group. These riders account for less than 1 percent of commuters in the United States; in isolated pockets like Portland, they might account for about 6 percent.
 Mr. Townley is even more skeptical now, predicting a flat to slightly down year for small bicycle stores. Declining gas prices are one reason. He also cited major price increases in bicycles and accessories resulting from the rising cost of materials and shipping -- 98 percent of bicycles are manufactured overseas -- which cut into profits. He said data showed that wholesale sales of new bicycles to shops for the first nine months of the year were down more than 4 percent. 
 ''More people riding bikes has not translated into any improvement in bike business,'' he said.
 He said data going back to the 1960s showed that the bicycle industry did suffer during recessions. ''Is a consumer going to buy bikes or do anything the way they did in 2008 in the summer of 2009?'' Mr. Townley asked. ''I don't know.''
 Since 1999, sales of bicycles in the United States have held steady at about 18 million a year, including bicycles for children, according to data compiled by Gluskin Townley. Counting sales of related parts and accessories, that adds up to about $6 billion a year. 
 In those same years, the number of small specialty bicycle stores dropped to about 4.300 now from a little more than 6,000 in 2000. While those small stores account for only 17 percent of the bicycles sold (the rest are sold by chain stores, mass merchants or on the Internet), they represent about 50 percent of the revenue.
 The number of bicycles sold may surpass sales of motor vehicle this year, mainly because of the big drop in demand for cars and trucks. The last time bicycle sales were stronger than motor vehicle sales was in the early 1970s, in the midst of another recession, which was set off by the Arab oil embargo.
 Surveys by Bikes Belong, a group in Boulder, Colo., that advocates more bicycle riding, and Gluskin Townley echoed observations of bicycle store owners and managers that the most pervasive, and possibly the biggest, contributor to the summer bicycle business boom was in repairs. People were dragging long-forgotten bikes out of basements and garages and fixing them up for recreation because they were staying home instead of traveling.
 Many stores said that they had to hire more mechanics. The most curious development was an influx of bicycles so old that they caused a run on 27-inch tires, once an industry standard but largely out of use since the early 1980s. 
 Peter Clark, 38, of Branford, Conn., brought his 1993 Trek, complete with duct-taped seat, to Zane's Cycles, a nationally known store among serious cyclists, and grabbed his not-quite-trim midsection when asked why he was getting his bike fixed. ''I could go out and buy a new bike,'' he said, but added, ''I don't want to commit to a bike and then not ride it.''
 In interviews, store owners said they had trouble last summer keeping up their stock of accessories, especially bike bags, car racks, tires and tubes. That told industry observers that people were actually using the bikes they had fixed up.
 ''The question is,'' Mr. Townley said, ''will they take the bike out of the basement, inflate the tires and ride it again? My gut says no.''
 Tim Blumenthal, executive director of Bikes Belong, disagreed. ''I believe that last summer's spike in gas prices and the reaction of Americans was different from any previous spike and any previous reaction,'' he said. ''It wasn't just about sticker shock at the pumps. When people ride bikes, lots of good things happen.''
 At Zane's, Tom Girard said that in his 15 years as general manager, he could not remember a comparable summer, with business up 30 percent over the previous year. Three months later, he said that business has stayed strong and that his gamble to increase cold weather gear inventory 25 percent was paying off, though at the low end of what he had hoped. An employee he hired in the fall -- an unusual time to add a worker in a seasonal business like biking -- is still on staff.
 ''It's like package stores,'' he said. ''When the economy's bad, people drink. When the economy is good, people drink. When the economy's bad, people still need to do something. So they ride their bikes.''
 But Mr. Girard hastened to add that no one is recession-proof. ''If you're a good store and have a good business plan,'' he said, ''I think that makes you more recession-proof than what you're selling.''
 The experts say surviving in this economic climate means small bicycle stores must choose products carefully to keep inventory low and cash flow high. Mike Hamannwright, a 20-year veteran of the business and co-owner of four Revolution Cycles stores in the Washington area, said he had cut back on cold weather gear even though he saw plenty of stay-at-home people, especially couples, buying bicycles last summer. 
 ''Some bike shops are going to go out of business,'' he said he had told his staff. ''Not every bike shop is going to go out of business, and if we don't want to be one, we've got to be great.
 ''Anybody who was a little weak, this is going to be the crushing blow,'' he added.
 One view contends that the sluggish coda to the summer bicycling boom is not the end of the refrain.
 ''I don't think any of us are fools that $1.89-a-gallon gasoline is really going to be the way it will be from here on out,'' said Fred Clements, executive director of the National Bicycle Dealers Association. ''I don't want to appear to be too bullish, but some of the longer term trends -- how we get out of an economic recession like this -- don't necessarily put bicycles in a bad spot. Bicycles are part of a solution to the problem.''

HEADLINE: Move to Increase Logging on Oregon Land

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
The Interior Department announced a controversial decision late Wednesday to double the rate of logging on 2.6 million acres of federally owned forests in southwestern Oregon. In doing so, it brushed aside the objections of the governor and two federal agencies charged with guarding the quality of the area's water and the health of the fish that depend on it. 
 The decision, which was posted on the Web sites of the Bureau of Land Management's Oregon offices, has revived the battle lines formed during the fight over the extensive logging of old-growth timber in the 1980s, a practice blamed for the rapid decline in populations of the northern spotted owl.
 The economies of the timber industry and Oregon's rural southwestern counties took a major hit when logging on federal lands in the area was cut back by 80 percent under the terms of the Northwest Forest Plan, which took effect about 15 years ago. Representatives of both groups applauded Wednesday's decision, saying it would revive local mills and timber companies.
 But environmental groups condemned the decision and gave notice that they would challenge the plan in federal court. The group Earthjustice called the decision a ''massive giveaway at the expense of salmon spawning streams, healthy old-growth forests and habitat for rare birds such as the northern spotted owl and marbled murrelet.''
 Michael Campbell, a spokesman for the Bureau of Land Management's office in Portland, Ore., said Wednesday that the plan was a blueprint and that there would be additional chance for environmental review and public comment as various tracts of land are prepared for sale.
 ''We're not saying anywhere in the plan that you need to log X piece of land at X location,'' he said. ''That's going to come later.'' 
 In a Dec. 8 letter that faulted the plan on several grounds, Gov. Theodore R. Kulongoski of Oregon, a Democrat, said it could interfere with any future wilderness designations in the areas around the Rogue River. Because of environmental and public concerns, he wrote, harvest increases should be carefully phased in.
 Tom Partin, president of the American Forest Resource Council, said any increase in logging ''will happen gradually with this plan,'' thanks in part to the requirements that local Bureau of Land Management offices must follow to prepare lands for sale to loggers.

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER

 BODY:
EAST LANSING, Mich. -- When Ryan T. Muneio was tailgating with his parents at a Michigan State football game this fall, he noticed a big tent emblazoned with a Bank of America logo. Inside, bank representatives were offering free T-shirts and other merchandise to those who applied for credit cards and other banking products.
''They did a good job,'' Mr. Muneio, 21 and a junior at Michigan State, said of the tactic. ''It was good advertising.''
Bank of America's relationship with the university extends well beyond marketing at sports events. The bank has an $8.4 million, seven-year contract with Michigan State giving it access to students' names and addresses and use of the university's logo. The more students who take the banks' credit cards, the more money the university gets. Under certain circumstances, Michigan State even stands to receive more money if students carry a balance on these cards. 
Hundreds of colleges have contracts with lenders. But at a time of rising concern about student debt -- and overall consumer debt -- the arrangements have sounded alarm bells, and some student groups are starting to push back.
The relationships are reminiscent of those uncovered two years ago between student loan companies and universities. In those, some lenders offered universities an incentive to steer potential borrowers their way.
Here at Michigan State, the editors of the student newspaper wrote this fall that ''it doesn't take a giant leap for someone to ask why the university should encourage responsible spending when it receives a cut of every purchase.''
At Arizona State University, students set up a table on campus last spring to warn of the danger of debt and urge students to support limits on on-campus marketing.
The contracts, whose terms vary but usually involve payments to colleges or alumni associations that agree to provide lists of students' names, have come under harsh criticism in Washington.
''That is absolutely outrageous, the sharing of students' information with the banks,'' Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York, who oversaw a June hearing on campus credit card marketing, said in a recent interview. ''That should be outlawed.''
College campuses are one place that young Americans are introduced to credit and the possibility of spending beyond their means, a problem now confronting the nation as a whole. For banks, the relationships are a golden marketing opportunity. For colleges, they are a revenue source at a time of declining public funding. And for students, they help pay the bills and allow more shopping.
But debt incurred in college becomes a serious burden at graduation, especially in a recession in which jobs are scarce. A survey of more than 1,500 college students by US PIRG in Washington found that two-thirds had at least one credit card. Seniors with balances had an average debt of $2,623 on their cards.
University officials say that their agreements with card issuers comply with the law and bring in valuable revenue.
''It provides money for scholarships and other programs,'' said Terry R. Livermore, manager of licensing programs at Michigan State. He said that the program was aimed primarily at alumni and the university would not include sharing student information in future credit card contracts. ''The students are such a minuscule portion of this program.''
Jennifer Holsman, executive director of the alumni association at Arizona State, said the association tried to teach students about responsible uses of credit. ''We work closely with Bank of America to provide educational seminars to students in terms of being able to get information about how to pay off credit cards, how not to keep balances,'' she said.
Credit card issuers say that they try to educate students to use cards responsibly and that the cards they offer on campus have more restrictive terms than cards offered to alumni.
''The available credit for undergraduates is capped at $2,500,'' said Betty Riess, a spokeswoman for Bank of America. ''We want to take a fair and responsible approach to lending because we want to build the foundation for a longer-term banking relationship.''
Ms. Riess said the bank had agreements with about 700 colleges and alumni associations, making it one of the biggest, if not the biggest, card issuer on campuses. She said that only 2 percent of the open accounts under those agreements belonged to students, but also said it was not possible to determine what percentage of program revenue resulted from fees and charges on those student cards.
Stephanie Jacobson, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan Chase, wrote in an e-mail message that the bank had fewer than 25 contracts with colleges or alumni associations and that while some of the contracts gave it the right to ask for and use lists of student names and addresses, the bank had not done so since 2007.
That may be because football games present a marketing opportunity that requires no address information. Abigail D. Molina, a second-year law student at the University of Oregon, applied in 2007 for a Chase Visa offered at a tent outside a football game. In exchange, she received a blanket.
''I mostly wanted the blanket,'' Ms. Molina said. She added that this was her second university credit card. In 1994, when she was an undergraduate at the university, she applied for a card at a booth on campus and then accumulated about $30,000 in debt, almost all of it on the card. In 2001 she filed for bankruptcy. Looking back, she said it was ''shockingly easy'' to get the card, even as a first-year student.
Mr. Muneio, the Michigan State student, said he did not apply for a Bank of America card because he already had two Visa cards. ''The last thing I need is another account to keep track of.''
Many students are unaware of the contracts that universities have with credit card issuers and do not question the presence of marketers on campus or applications in their mailboxes, despite recent protests on a few campuses.
Sometimes, the contracts have confidentiality provisions. Universities may try to distance themselves, stating that the contracts are only between alumni associations and banks. But the universities provide alumni groups with lists of current students' names, addresses and telephone numbers, which the groups pass on to banks.
The New York Times obtained information about and, in some cases, copies of contracts between lenders, public colleges and their alumni associations using open records requests. Because private colleges are not subject to open records laws, they are not included.
While most universities contacted for this article did not provide detailed financial information on the contracts -- the University of Pittsburgh, for example, confirmed only that it had an agreement -- two did share numbers.
The alumni association of the University of Michigan is guaranteed $25.5 million over the term of its 11-year agreement with Bank of America. Under the agreement, the association agreed to provide lists of names and addresses of students, alumni, faculty, staff, donors and holders of season tickets to athletic events.
Much of the money goes toward scholarships, said Jerry Sigler, vice president and chief financial officer of the alumni association. He was unsure what students were told about the program.
''Students are generally told how they can opt out of having their information publicly displayed in directories or provided in response to requests like this,'' Mr. Sigler added. ''But it's not to my knowledge specific to the credit card program.''
Michigan State University gets $1.2 million a year but is guaranteed at least $8.4 million over seven years, according to its agreement. The contract calls for a $1 royalty to the university for every new card account that remains open for at least 90 days, $3 for every card whose holder pays an annual fee, and a payment of a half percent of the amount of all retail purchases using the cards.
For cards that do not have an annual fee, the bank pays $3 if the holder has a balance at the end of the 12th month after opening an account, a provision that appears to give the university an incentive to get cardholders into debt.
A few schools have adopted policies that prohibit sharing student contact information.
Ball State University's alumni association, which has a contract with JPMorgan Chase, does not provide information on students, said Ed Shipley, executive director of the association. ''Who we market to is our alumni because that's our purpose,'' he said. However, the bank is permitted to set up marketing tables at athletic events.
The University of Oregon, whose alumni association also has a marketing agreement with Chase, stopped providing student addresses as concern grew about student debt, according to Julie Brown, a university spokeswoman. The university still permits marketing booths at athletic events.
Some research suggests that students may be using credit cards less frequently, in favor of debit cards linked to their bank accounts. A survey last spring by Student Monitor, a Ridgewood, N.J., company that tracks trends on campus, found that 59 percent of undergraduate students had debit cards, up from 51 percent in 2000.
But universities have arrangements with banks that offer debit cards too, perhaps raising some of the same issues that the credit card deals do.
At New Mexico State University, for example, students are given the option of opening a bank account with Wells Fargo if they want to convert their campus identification into a debit card.
The accounts are not mandatory, said Angela Throneberry, assistant vice president for auxiliary services at the university. But, she said, ''There's some revenue sharing that happens as part of this.''
The Debt Trap: Articles in this series are examining the surge in consumer debt and the lenders who made it possible.

HEADLINE: Juggernaut In Exports Is Withering In China

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- At the docks here, the stacks of shipping containers that used to loom above the highway overpass are gone. Logistics managers say they negotiate deeper discounts every week on ships that are leaving half empty.
In nearby Guangdong province, so many factories are shuttering without paying employees that some workers are resigning pre-emptively and demanding immediate pay before their employers go bankrupt.
In Sichuan and other interior provinces, municipal officials are desperately searching for ways to provide jobs for millions of out-of-work migrant laborers whose families no longer need them for farming.
Those are the effects of millions of Americans losing their confidence in the economy, feeling poorer and, as a result, pulling back on their spending. American retailers, after suffering a dismal holiday shopping season, are delaying payment for Chinese goods 90 or even 120 days after shipping, in contrast to the usual 30 to 45 days, forcing their suppliers to try to borrow more money to cover the difference. Some Chinese suppliers who cannot raise the money -- many already operate on thin margins -- are going out of business. 
At the same time, retailers are demanding that exporters show that they have strong balance sheets and will not go bankrupt before completing orders. Exporters, worried the retailers will fail before paying for their purchases, are reluctant to let goods be loaded on ships. And banks, for the same reason, have cut back on guaranteeing retailers' payments to exporters.
''Trade finance is collapsing,'' said Victor K. Fung, the chairman of the Li & Fung Group, the giant supply chain management company that connects factories in China with retailers in the United States and Europe. ''We've got orders we can't ship right now.''
Mr. Fung estimates that 10,000 of the 60,000 factories in China owned by Hong Kong interests have closed or will close in the coming months. Other business leaders say the toll may be even higher and that factory closings are an even bigger problem among mainland Chinese businesses because these tend to be smaller and more poorly capitalized than those owned by Hong Kong businesses.
Government statistics show that Chinese exports slipped 2.2 percent in November when calculated in dollars, after seven years of rapid growth. But figures in dollars do not come to close to capturing the real depth of the downturn.
Convert the export figures into China's own currency, a much better measure of the effect on China's economy, and exports plunged 9.6 percent last month. Factor in inflation over the last year and the plunge was 11.4 percent.
Indications are that the December data will be even worse.
Consumer electronics manufacturers have been hit the hardest, according to customs data. ''No one has any money any more, so demand for our mini hi-fi systems has declined a lot,'' said Lion Yuan, the sales manager at the Shenzhen Yidashi Electronics Company, where exports have dropped 30 percent in the last year.
In the last two weeks, Chinese officials have announced a series of measures to help exporters. State banks are being directed to lend more to them, particularly to small and medium-size exporters. Government research funds are being set up. The head of the government of Hong Kong, Donald Tsang, plans to seek legislative approval by late January for the government to guarantee banks' issuance of $12.9 billion worth of letters of credit for exports.
Particularly noteworthy have been the Chinese government's steps to help labor-intensive sectors like garment production, one of the industries China has been trying to move away from in an effort to climb the ladder of economic development with more skilled work that pays higher wages. But now China has become reluctant to yield the bottom rungs of the ladder to countries with even lower wages, like Vietnam, Indonesia and Bangladesh.
China has been restoring export tax rebates for its textile sector, for instance, which it had been phasing out. Municipal governments have also stopped raising the minimum wage, which doubled over the last two years in some cities, peaking at $146 a month in Shenzhen.
''China will resort to tariff and trade policies to facilitate export of labor-intensive and core technology-supported industries,'' Li Yizhong, the minister of industry and information technology, said at a conference on Dec. 19.
Increased export incentives by China have the potential to create a trade issue for President-elect Barack Obama, particularly regarding textiles.
American quotas on the import of a wide range of Chinese garments are set to expire on Thursday. Even before the Chinese began announcing their latest programs for exporters, the United States filed a legal challenge on Dec. 19 at the World Trade Organization, accusing China of having already provided illegal subsidies to exporters in a long list of industries as part of a program of trying to build recognizable export brands.
China denied on Dec. 23 that there were any illegal subsidies, saying that many countries tried to help exporters and that its actions were no different.
In a letter to the National Council of Textile Organizations on Oct. 24, Mr. Obama stopped short of promising any protection from Chinese imports but said that he favored close monitoring of China imports. ''China must change its policies, including its foreign exchange policies, so that it relies less on exports and more on domestic demand for its growth,'' he wrote.
But shifting toward a greater reliance on domestic demand is not easy. Chinese households have one of the world's highest savings rates because the country's social safety net is in tatters, with families receiving scant government help with education costs, medical care and retirement; the average hospital stay costs the equivalent of two years' wages for the average Chinese worker.
Important bureaucratic obstacles also exist. Chinese factories are allowed to import equipment while paying little or no duty, provided that the equipment will be used only to produce goods for export. Obtaining approval to switch the same equipment to making goods for the domestic market can take two years and require the payment of much of the import duties that were previously avoided, a payment that many factories cannot afford.
China's measures to help exporters are starting to cause concern in other Asian countries that compete with it, and raise the risk of a protectionist reaction against China. Indonesia, one of Asia's largest markets, is preparing to impose a series of administrative measures on Thursday that are meant to reduce smuggling but will have the practical effect of making it harder to import Chinese goods.
In Indonesia, the third most populous country in Asia after China and India, the government is already acting to limit imports of garments, electronics, shoes, toys and food -- five large categories in which Indonesian producers are struggling to compete with China.
Starting in the new year, importers of these products will have to be registered with the government, use only five designated ports for their shipments, arrange for a detailed inspection of goods before they are loaded on a ship or plane bound for Indonesia and then have every single container exhaustively inspected on arrival by Indonesia's notoriously slow customs bureaucracy. The plan, intended to comply with W.T.O. rules, was adopted after heavy lobbying by Indonesian manufacturers and labor unions.
Boediono, the governor of Indonesia's central bank, who uses only one name, said that Indonesia would be watching China's policies but added that he hoped Indonesia could stay competitive. At less than $120 a month, industrial wages in export zones near Jakarta, Indonesia's capital, are slightly below those in coastal regions of China, and have not shown the same steep increases in wages.
''I'm not sure they can compete with us again by moving down the ladder,'' Mr. Boediono said, ''because I think they have already moved up the ladder.''

HEADLINE: As Resolutions Go, Spending Less May Actually Stick

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
Jolene Siana, a writer in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, plans to spend time with friends at their homes rather than in wine bars, bringing a $12 bottle rather than blowing $12 on a glass. Nelson Murphy, a maintenance worker at a Manhattan hospital, is determined that 2009 will be the year he finally gives up smoking -- it is bad for his health, and, at $9 a pack, his wallet.
 And Felicia Jackson, 23, is promising herself a healthier lifestyle -- physically and financially. She will take peanut butter and jelly sandwiches to work instead of frequenting McDonald's for lunch (and sometimes breakfast), and walk to the subway instead of hopping in a town car. 
 ''It's $5 each way, so that's $50 a week,'' said Ms. Jackson, who lives in Brooklyn and works at Paragon Sports in Union Square. ''I'm going to make a tighter budget this year with the economy the way it is.''
 The resolutions may sound the same, but in this New Year of Recession, the reasons driving them are different. Who can afford to pay $100 a month for a gym membership that goes unused? Walking more sounds a lot like saving on gas. Appreciating the little things is about maybe not having big fancy things around.
 The annual Marist College end-of-year resolution poll showed that 12 percent of Americans nationwide are vowing to spend less, the third most popular response after losing weight (20 percent) and quitting smoking (16 percent). Economic pressures are so heavy that ''spend less money -- save more'' replaced ''be a better person,'' which dropped to seventh place in the survey of 1,003 people nationwide during the second week of December.
 ''When you ask about New Year's resolutions, it's usually a fun thing, part of the holiday nostalgia,'' said Lee M. Miringoff, the director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion. ''So when you're getting the answers that we're getting, it suggests that there's a lot of serious concerns that are overwhelming the typical tradition. It's a little bit more of a sobering time for people.''
 New Year's resolutions are at least as old as calendars. More than four millennia ago, the Babylonians had an 11-day new year festival and started anew by returning borrowed farm equipment. The Romans honored the god Janus -- who looked backward and forward -- by designating January as the start of the year. They reflected on the past year while promising to do better in the new one.
 But interviews around New York this week found that the typical year-end hopefulness about fresh starts and brighter days ahead is largely being overshadowed by fear that the economically calamitous 2008 could become an even rougher 2009. In dozens of conversations with people boarding trains at Grand Central Terminal, eating lunch in Bryant Park, shopping at Atlantic Center in Prospect Heights or walking through Union Square, worries about dollars and cents seeped into otherwise predictable promises to shed pounds and spend more time with friends and family.
 Take Ms. Siana, who is 39, works as a waitress at a private dining club and in 2005 published a memoir of her troubled youth (''Go Ask Ogre: Letters From a Deathrock Cutter''). When asked about her goals for 2009, she first professed a desire to live healthier by using microwave ovens less, eating more organic food and taking more walks. But then she said she would be eating out less often as well. More than two dozen co-workers were recently laid off, she said, which has made her anxious about her job security.
 So for socializing in 2009, Ms. Siana plans to opt for dive bars, not wine bars -- or, better yet, gatherings at someone's apartment. Sushi dinners will be less frequent, too.
 ''I'll be cooking more instead of eating out, and cutting down on entertainment,'' she said while munching on a vegetable sandwich outside a Subway store in Atlantic Terminal.
 Chris Walling, 26, a financial analyst, wants to break the cycle of losing weight in the winter only to gain it back when the weather warms and his tendency to fall off the wagon of twice-weekly workouts at the gym. ''I'm paying the money, so I might as well go,'' he said of his gym membership. (Mr. Walling also resolved to get a ''really cool girlfriend,'' which could definitely have a negative effect on his finances.)
 Kevin Cooper, 22, a glassblower from New London, Conn., said he intended to commute more by bicycle to his studio in Stonington, a two-hour ride that would not only help him keep his trim frame intact, but also reduce wear and tear on his car.
 ''It's mostly to stay in shape,'' he said, while hawking his vases at an arts show in Grand Central Terminal. ''But there's also the mileage on the car and the gas.''
 Some people are setting goals that take advantage of the bad news. Ali Boddy, 30, a salesman for T-Mobile, is banking on home prices falling further so he will be able to afford a house on Long Island, perhaps in Deer Park, North Babylon or Northport. Homes there, he said, are half the price of what he would pay in Flushing, where he lives now with his in-laws.
 Katie West, 14, who was visiting New York with her family this week from their home near Syracuse, also seems to have gotten the austerity bug. 
 ''I want to save more than $100,'' Katie said as she watched the holiday light show on the cavernous ceiling of Grand Central. ''I get $20 allowance a week. Normally I spend the whole thing.''
 She said she did not know yet what she would do with the money.

HEADLINE: Fans Who Can't Get Enough Are Getting More

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR. 
E-mail: sportsbiz@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The MLB Network springs to life Thursday evening, with a hot stove studio show followed by the first national rebroadcasting of Don Larsen's 1956 World Series perfect game, which will be augmented by new interviews of Larsen and Yogi Berra with Bob Costas.
 So begins baseball's lavish $54 million network venture, direct from Secaucus, N.J. 
 Major League Baseball is the fourth major sports league to start a channel and will open with 50 million cable and satellite subscribers -- more than any of the others. And thanks to some angst-filled deal-making in 2007 that nearly backfired, M.L.B. avoided the distribution and legal woes that have prevented the NFL Network from fulfilling its manifest destiny. 
 To guarantee that it will have tens of millions of subscribers from Big Cable and satellite, baseball swapped a total of one-third of the network to Comcast, Time Warner, Cox and DirecTV, a solution that the National Football League has refused. 
 A major intent of the MLB Network is to feed fans who ostensibly can't get enough baseball from local TV outlets, from ESPN, Fox and TBS, or from Web sites. Harold Reynolds, the best-known of the MLB Network's corps of analysts, said when he began working at MLB.com in 2007 that he recognized the rapid and continuous flow of news.
 ''I said, man, I've got to work year-round, every day on this because there's something new all the time,'' he said by telephone between rehearsals Wednesday. ''It really opened my eyes. With the network, it's 24-hour baseball; if you want to see baseball, it's there, you don't have to worry that it won't be there.''
 During the season, the network's central program, ''MLB Tonight,'' will be shown Monday through Saturday, from 6 p.m. until the last out of the final West Coast game. The studio show, with hosts Matt Vasgersian and Victor Rojas, will give analysis, highlights and live cut-ins to the games -- a jumbo version of ESPN's ''Baseball Tonight.'' 
 ''We own the network, so we can be there as long as we have to be,'' said Reynolds, who worked for the Mets-owned SNY and for TBS last season. ''We can go a lot deeper than 'Baseball Tonight' did. If we want to get into something, there's no rush to get out.''
 Until late in spring training, the hourlong ''Hot Stove'' program will begin at 6 p.m. In that show, Reynolds said that he and his fellow analysts Barry Larkin and Al Leiter, along with a guest, the Phillies' Jimmy Rollins, have taped a demonstration and analysis of the World Series play in which Jackie Robinson stole home and an angry Berra leaped in protest. Yogi's still angry.
 The network will also carry old games; original series (countdown shows, stadium celebrations, season retrospectives); a replay of Ken Burns's ''Baseball'' documentary, which starts Tuesday night; 16 games of the World Baseball Classic, which starts March 5; and simulcasts of local broadcasts of regular-season games on Thursday nights.
 ''Local baseball is covered well across the country, but we'll be the consistent place to get caught up nationally,'' said Tony Petitti, the president and chief executive of the network. ''We're meant to complement how you watch baseball. This is about 30 teams, not one. We won't do 14 cut-ins a night to one team's game; we're looking across all the games.'' 
 Petitti, a former executive at CBS Sports, added, ''It's like the way we bounced around during March Madness, giving people a taste of each game.''
 Joel Feld, an executive vice president at NESN, which carries the Boston Red Sox, said he was not worried that the new network would distract fans from watching Big Papi. 
 ''There are a lot of places to get national coverage, but we're only focused on Boston,'' he said. ''The natural flow is fans sit down and watch their local teams.''
 This is not a propitious time to start a channel. Traditional sports advertisers, like automakers and banks, are staggering. Petitti said he hoped that some of baseball's national sponsors would buy commercial time. One of them is General Motors, which has cut back heavily on its sports commitments. 
 ''Sponsors have to want to step up,'' he said. He expected some pending deals to be done in a few weeks. 
 ''We built our business plan knowing this,'' Petitti said, alluding to the last six months of building up the network as the economy collapsed. ''We've been watching.'' 
 But the network can survive without much, if any, advertising. With 50 million subscribers paying an estimated monthly fee of 25 cents, gross revenues could reach $150 million.
 Asked if the network could break even with no advertising at all, Petitti paused and said, ''Our subscriber fees can support us.''

HEADLINE: House Doctor Comes Calling, Wielding Grins And Glue Guns

BYLINE: By NEIL GENZLINGER

 BODY:
Each episode of HGTV's ''Dear Genevieve,'' the latest offensive in Genevieve Gorder's campaign to remodel every home in the United States to suit her personal tastes, begins with a letter from a homeowner. These letters all basically say: We have an interior-design catastrophe that only you are smart enough to fix. And Ms. Gorder and crew show up and redo the offending space. 
 Watch a few of these adventures in renovation -- the first is Thursday -- and you may feel like writing Ms. Gorder some letters of your own. You may, for instance, wonder about her pathological bubbliness, first evident in her work on TLC's ''Trading Spaces,'' another rip-rooms-apart show, and later on ''Town Haul.''
 Dear Genevieve: How come you're so darn cheery in these shows? Whenever I try a home-renovation project, within minutes something goes horribly wrong, and I'm spouting four-letter words. Or, if I hire professionals, they're surly and slovenly, never cheery.
 You may also wonder about some of the choices Ms. Gorder makes, both in which projects she takes on and in what she does with the rooms.
 Dear Genevieve: Any chance you could revisit the Osses, that child-filled family in the first episode? A friend and I have a bet: We think their great room, a high-traffic, undifferentiated space that you reapportioned but left still pretty undifferentiated, was just as messy an hour after you and your crew left as it was before you came, because kids will be kids. 
 Also, about the Mancinis' kitchen, which you spend a subsequent episode bad-mouthing mercilessly and then gut: it was four times the size of my kitchen, and four times nicer, before you attacked it. So shut up.
 But the bigger question you might want to ask Ms. Gorder is: Who is this program for? It's decidedly not a do-it-yourself show. Though the homeowners are compelled to put in an embarrassing few minutes with a paint brush or floor sander, the work here is primarily done by professionals. And it's extensive. Which means that anyone who can actually afford to undertake projects like this can also afford a designer to plan them and thus has no need for input from a TV chatterbox.
 Sure, there will always be an audience for stuff like this. Plenty of people get a charge out of poking their noses into strangers' homes. But this already-tired genre (must we endure those orchestrated screams of delight when the finished product is unveiled?) feels vaguely offensive amid the current economic distress. No one here is impoverished, ill or otherwise in need, and cost appears to be no object in these renovations to spaces that already look perfectly livable. Who has the luxury of such indulgences these days?
 DEAR GENEVIEVE

HEADLINE: Oil Prices Rise on Inventory Report

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Oil prices rebounded from a sharp drop Wednesday and moved higher after the latest government report showed a smaller-than-expected gain in fuel stockpiles in the United States.
 The trading came a day before the OPEC cartel planned to cut production by another 2.2 million barrels a day, its latest attempt to shore up the plummeting price. The price of light, sweet crude in New York was up 5 cents a barrel to $39.04 a barrel. 
 The weekly report by the Energy Information Administration showed that the inventory of commercial crude oil stocks rose 500,000 barrels to 318.7 million barrels in the week to Dec. 26. Stocks were expected to be down 1.5 million barrels. 
 Prices had been down more than a dollar a barrel earlier Wednesday as investors seemed to be skeptical about pledges from Kuwait, Iran and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to stick with new quotas, after having ignored previous production cuts.
 ''The market seemed to be building in a lot of skepticism that OPEC would not adhere to the quotas that they agreed on,'' said Tom Bentz, an energy analyst at BNP Paribas. ''The reality is that demand is down so much that there's a good possibility that OPEC could surprise and actually come closer to meeting their agreed upon cuts.''
 Oil prices, which peaked above $145 a barrel in July, have tumbled more than 70 percent as the spreading economic slowdown slashed the global demand for oil, and analysts said that prices are likely to remain near their current levels if the recession lingers through 2009. 
 In an effort to put a floor on falling oil prices, OPEC agreed a couple of weeks ago reduce production by 2.2 million barrels a day, the group's largest cut ever. It was the third time producers have agreed to reduce output in three months. Since September, members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have pledged cuts totaling 4.2 million barrels a day, or nearly 12 percent of their capacity, a record in such a short time. 
 On Wall Street, the last trading day of the year could not end soon enough for investors.
 Stock markets opened higher in light volume on Wednesday as investors started counting down the minutes until 4 p.m., hoping that the close of markets would allow them to turn the page on a year that obliterated trillions in wealth and dragged down markets by a third or more.
 ''Like every other trader I know, I want nothing more than that bell to ring at 4 o'clock and put an end to this year,'' the director of trading at Rydex Investments, Steve Sachs, said. 
 At 1 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average was up about 110 points while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was 1.2 percent higher. The technology-heavy Nasdaq was 1.5 percent higher.
 Even though 2008 was one of Wall Street's worst years since the Depression, stocks have rallied in December, giving hope to investors that the worst gyrations of the financial markets may be a thing of the past. 
 The S.&P. index is up 9 percent so far this month, and the Dow is 6 percent higher, and the markets have not re-tested the five-year lows they set in mid-November.
 ''Those are positive signs,'' Mr. Sachs said.

HEADLINE: Early Results Show a 2.3% Decline in Holiday Sales

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
The latest numbers in a slowly unspooling string of gloomy holiday shopping data show that customer traffic during Christmas week fell 4.9 percent compared with 2007, according to ShopperTrak, a research company. 
 ShopperTrak is still compiling numbers from the holiday season, with its final report expected Jan. 14. Releasing interim data on Wednesday, ShopperTrak said the full report would most likely show that customer traffic for the full holiday season plummeted 16 percent, and that total retail sales sank 2.3 percent. Those are darker than previous estimates, of a 9.9 percent drop in traffic and a 0.1 percent increase in sales.
 In the last few weeks, various retailing groups have reported holiday sales figures, including ShopperTrak; the International Council of Shopping Centers; and SpendingPulse, a report by MasterCard Advisors. The methodology and results varied, but they all pointed to the same conclusion: a dismal holiday season for the nation's stores. 
 Just how bad it was for individual stores will be known on Jan. 8, when retailers report their own December sales figures. 
 Michael P. Niemira, chief economist and director for research at the International Council of Shopping Centers, said the group expected that December sales at stores open at least a year, a measure of retail health, ''will decline by at least 1 percent with only a few bright spots amid double-digit declines among a broad swath of the industry.'' 
 One of those bright spots, perhaps the only one, will no doubt be Wal-Mart Stores, the huge retailer with rock-bottom prices. It has picked up business during the recession. 
 The council said Tuesday that the recession, heavy discounting and winter storms ''coalesced to produce the weakest holiday season since at least 1970'' -- not in absolute dollar sales, but in terms of sales growth. Only a few weeks ago, the group predicted that holiday retail sales would rise 1.7 percent. 
 But the surge of shoppers that retailers and industry professionals had hoped for never came, and in the last few weeks most analysts and trade groups stopped believing the season could be saved. 
 Analysts at Standard & Poor's Equity Research said this week that December sales would most likely fall 9.5 percent for its index of 14 apparel retailers and 2.7 percent for its broader measure of 25 retailers, including warehouse stores. 
 The grim predictions come after holiday sales through Dec. 24 fell by double digits in several closely watched categories, including apparel, luxury goods, furniture and electronics and appliances, according to SpendingPulse, the MasterCard report, which estimates retail sales from all forms of payment, including checks and cash. Excluding gasoline, total retail sales were down 2 percent in November and 4 percent in December compared with the same periods a year ago. 
 While retailers are glad to put the holiday season behind them, the new year is not causing any sighs of relief. 
 Bill Martin, co-founder of ShopperTrak, said he expected that ''retail performance will dive over the next couple of weeks'' as tantalizing holiday sales begin to fade and shoppers retreat from stores, as they usually do in January.
 In the last days of 2008, analysts at Standard & Poor's Equity Research were already talking about the likely bad news for the new year: an estimated overall retail sales decline of 5 percent. That would be enough to wipe out the profit margins of many retailers, possibly leading to a wave of bankruptcies.

HEADLINE: Markets Limp Into 2009 After a Bruising Year

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
There was almost no place to hide from the crash of 2008.
 When the New York Stock Exchange bell rang out the year on Wednesday, it tolled for virtually anyone with money in the stock market.
 The final, grim tally only confirmed what investors had known for months: it was a very bad year to own stocks, any stocks -- indeed, one of the worst ever. 
 In a mere 12 months, the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 4,488.43 points, or 33.8 percent, its most punishing loss since 1931. Blue chips like Bank of America, Citigroup and Alcoa lost more than 65 percent of their value. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index sank 39.5 percent, almost exactly matching its decline in 1937. 
 All told, about $7 trillion of shareholders' wealth -- the gains of the last six years -- was wiped out in a year of violent market swings. 
 But what is striking is not just the magnitude of the declines, staggering as they are, but also their breadth. All but two of the 30 Dow industrials, Wal-Mart and McDonald's, fell by more than 10 percent. Almost no industry was spared as the crisis that first emerged in the subprime mortgage market metastasized and the economy sank into what could be a long recession. 
 As the new year dawns, Wall Street is looking to Washington, where the balance of financial power has tipped in recent months. Analysts and investors are focusing on what the incoming Obama administration and the Federal Reserve will do to revive the economy and the financial system. 
 It is a remarkable turnabout from the mid-1990s, when Wall Street traders helped drive economic policy. Back then, bond investors flexed their financial muscle and urged the Clinton administration and a Republican Congress to reduce the federal budget deficit.
 These days, the market in ultra-safe United States Treasury securities seems like a refuge, even as the deficit balloons from the cost of bailing out banks, insurers and the Detroit auto companies. Many investors, having lost stocks and other investments, are buying up Treasuries that offer little or no return. They are content simply to get their money back.
 ''The only willing risk taker is the government,'' said William H. Gross, the chief investment officer of the Pacific Investment Management Company, or Pimco, the giant bond trading firm. Speaking of the epicenter of the financial world, he added: ''It is no longer New York, it's Washington.''
 Like many money managers, Mr. Gross is a conservative -- he describes himself as a ''Reagan fan from way back'' -- who generally prefers limited government involvement in the markets. But he and others say that the government's sweeping intervention into private industry and in the markets, though sometimes flawed, is necessary to prevent a collapse of the financial system. They are hoping that policy makers do even more to stimulate the economy and revive moribund financial markets.
 Given the damage in the markets, however, policy makers face daunting challenges. 
 ''When we have bear markets, they usually take twice as long to get down this far,'' said Robert C. Doll, vice chairman of BlackRock, the big investment firm. 
 The markets have become incredibly volatile, especially since Lehman Brothers sank into bankruptcy in September. Since then, the S.& P. has moved more than 5 percent in either direction on 18 days. There were only 17 such days in the previous 53 years, according to calculations by Howard Silverblatt, an index analyst at S.& P.
 Diversification -- the idea that it is unwise to put all your eggs in one basket -- did not pay off for investors in 2008, casting doubt over this cornerstone of modern investing. The American market was far from the worst hit in 2008. Stocks fell 55 to 72 percent in the so-called BRIC economies -- Brazil, Russia, India and China -- that were darlings of the late, great boom. Stocks in developed European and Asian markets also fell sharply, though less than their emerging counterparts. Many commodities like oil and copper crashed.
 Losses in the credit markets, which are at the heart of this financial crisis, appear small relative to the devastation in other markets. The International Monetary Fund estimated in October that banks and other investors would suffer $1.4 trillion in losses on loans and securities, a loss of just 6 percent. Financial institutions globally have already reported $1 trillion in write-downs, according to Bloomberg.
 The I.M.F.'s estimate, however, does not count losses on derivatives, those complex instruments that derive their value from other assets. Losses on these instruments could outstrip those in the so-called cash markets because they are much bigger than their underlying assets. 
 A spokeswoman for the I.M.F. said the fund's estimates did not include those losses because they were transfers of wealth from one party of a transaction to another. For example, when the insurer American International Group loses $1 billion on a credit-default swap, a type of derivative, it makes payments to customers like investment banks.
 These complex financial instruments will pose one of the biggest challenges to policy makers in the year ahead. Many investors have lost confidence in banks, insurers and other financial intermediaries, in part because they do not know whether these companies are valuing opaque instruments properly. Some firms may be carrying enough toxic sludge to sink them, while others may be relatively unscathed.
 ''Until those assets can be removed from the balance sheets of the bank, or until the owners get a better understanding of what these assets are worth, we will have uncertainty,'' said Douglas M. Peta, an independent market analyst. 
 A broader focus for policy makers will be reviving the economy. Most financial and political analysts expect the Obama administration to enact a stimulus package that could approach $1 trillion. The effort will aim to create three million jobs by spending money on infrastructure, green energy technology, aid to states and other initiatives. 
 Many analysts say such an effort will help revive the economy, but not immediately. Infrastructure spending, for instance, can have a powerful impact by stimulating demand and creating jobs but, like much else in the economy, it often takes years to work.
 Some are looking to efforts by the Treasury and Fed to jump-start lending by lowering mortgage rates and improving the market for bonds backed by small-business, auto and credit card loans. A recent drop in mortgage rates has already set off a refinance boom, but analysts say home prices in many parts of the country are still too high for many would-be buyers. Furthermore, employment and household savings will most likely have to climb for some time before consumers have enough confidence to buy homes and enough money for down payments.
 ''Across the board, they can potentially prevent a further slide, and they deserve a lot of credit if they achieve that,'' Martin S. Fridson, chief executive of Fridson Investment Advisors, a bond trading firm, said about policy makers. ''I just don't think that they can push a button and have the economy and the stock market turn around.''
 Thomas J. Lee, the chief equity strategist at JPMorgan Chase, said a recovery early in the year could give way to another sell-off before the stock market finally bottoms later in the year. Mr. Lee said his forecast reflected ''how unconventional the current recession is.'' Unlike in the past, policy makers cannot rely on consumers to push the economy ahead by borrowing and spending, he said.
 ''This is a recession where households are net debtors,'' he said. ''They have lost money on houses and equities. That has rarely happened, at least since the 1950s.''
 Mr. Doll of BlackRock agreed that consumers would not ''run back and power the economy ahead.'' But he nonetheless contends that several important markets, including stocks, may be close to their bottom. The Fed, he argued, has taken on a more activist role in the markets and the new administration is likely to push through a huge stimulus. 
 Such sentiments have probably helped drive the S.& P. 500 index up by 20 percent since Nov. 20 and investment-grade corporate bonds up by nearly 10 percent since October.
 ''Perhaps we have seen a bottom,'' Mr. Doll said. But he added that like the economy, ''the stock market recovery will be more muted as well.''

HEADLINE: Sen. Webb's Call for Prison Reform

 BODY:
This country puts too many people behind bars for too long. Most elected officials, afraid of being tarred as soft on crime, ignore these problems. Sen. Jim Webb, a Democrat of Virginia, is now courageously stepping into the void, calling for a national commission to re-assess criminal justice policy. Other members of Congress should show the same courage and rally to the cause. 
 The United States has the world's highest reported incarceration rate. Although it has less than 5 percent of the world's population, it has almost one-quarter of the world's prisoners. And for the first time in history, more than 1 in 100 American adults are behind bars. 
 Many inmates are serving long sentences for nonviolent crimes, including minor drug offenses. It also is extraordinarily expensive. Billions of dollars now being spent on prisons each year could be used in far more socially productive ways.
 Senator Webb -- a former Marine and secretary of the Navy in the Reagan administration -- is in many ways an unlikely person to champion criminal justice reform. But his background makes him an especially effective advocate for a cause that has often been associated with liberals and academics.
 In his two years in the Senate, Mr. Webb has held hearings on the cost of mass incarceration and on the criminal justice system's response to the problems of illegal drugs. He also has called attention to the challenges of prisoner re-entry and of the need to provide released inmates, who have paid their debts to society, more help getting jobs and resuming productive lives.
 Mr. Webb says he intends to introduce legislation to create a national commission to investigate these issues. With Barack Obama in the White House, and strong Democratic majorities in Congress, the political climate should be more favorable than it has been in years. And the economic downturn should make both federal and state lawmakers receptive to the idea of reforming a prison system that is as wasteful as it is inhumane.

HEADLINE: Governor Relents on Loan to Continue South Carolina Jobless Benefits

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

DATELINE: COLUMBIA, S.C. 

 BODY:
Just hours before the unemployment benefits fund was to run out in South Carolina, the state with the nation's third-highest jobless rate, Gov. Mark Sanford relented Wednesday and agreed to apply for a $146 million federal loan to shore it up, after weeks of refusing to do so.
 The governor's position had drawn rebukes even from fellow Republicans in the Legislature, one of whom denounced Mr. Sanford as ''heartless,'' and from newspaper editorial pages. On Wednesday, The State, the daily newspaper here in Columbia, accused the governor of playing ''chicken with the lives of the 77,000'' who are unemployed in South Carolina. 
 For weeks, Mr. Sanford, newly elected as head of the Republican Governors Association and known for being a fierce free-market foe of government spending, stuck to his stand, questioning the probity of the South Carolina Employment Security Commission and demanding a new audit of the agency. 
 He has said in the past that he did not trust the commission's calculation of the state's unemployment rate, though a spokesman at the Bureau of Labor Statistics said it was calculated the same way as in every other state. 
 Mr. Sanford is now demanding that South Carolina's Commerce Department, whose director he appoints, be given access to the state unemployment agency's numbers, including where applicants are from, their ages, genders and occupations. 
 The back-and-forth dueling between the conservative governor and the unemployment agency has gone on for weeks, and its executive director, Roosevelt T. Halley, warned that he would have to stop issuing benefit checks to the jobless beginning Jan. 1 if Mr. Sanford did not back down and ask the federal government for the loan. 
 ''It's absolutely unheard of, it's insane, for a governor of any state not to request those funds,'' State Senator Hugh K. Leatherman, a Republican who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said last week. ''I can't believe anybody would be this heartless, and create such a heartless act on these people.''
 On Wednesday morning, at nearly the last minute, Mr. Sanford relented and said at a news conference in his office at the State House that he would request the money. South Carolina is one of three high-unemployment states, along with Michigan and Indiana, to ask for a loan from the federal government to ensure the unemployed continue to receive benefits.
 ''We will not punish the unemployed for this agency's incompetence,'' the governor said in a statement. But Mr. Sanford continued to insist that he would demand another, more stringent audit of the unemployment office, though Mr. Halley noted that the agency was audited every year by an accounting firm and had been given a clean bill of health. 
 Late Wednesday, Mr. Halley said he was not opposed to a further audit, and indeed the principal sticking point appears to have been whether state legislators -- who have the authority, and many of whom have been sharply critical of the governor -- would request it. 
 ''We've been asking for over a year, could we get information as to where the unemployment is taking place?'' Mr. Sanford said at the news conference. ''Nothing's been done.''
 He said, however, that the Commerce Department was aware of where layoffs occurred in the state. 
 Mildly rebuking the news media here, he said that ''you can find any number of people, particularly around the holiday season, who have the most unfortunate circumstances, they've lost their job, and those are compelling personal stories.''
 Mr. Sanford, a wealthy real estate investor, is often mentioned as a potential Republican presidential candidate in 2012, in part because he is seen as an exemplary adherent of the party's low-government, antispending philosophy. He recently wrote an op-ed article in The Wall Street Journal saying he was opposed to a ''bailout'' for states. 
 His stand on unemployment benefits was consistent with his contentious six-year tenure as governor and his philosophy, which is described as ''basically libertarian'' by William V. Moore, a political scientist at the College of Charleston. He has continuously sparred with members of his own party in the Legislature over spending, limiting his record of accomplishment. 
 ''His inability to work with the Legislature has made it difficult for him to achieve any sort of agenda,'' Mr. Moore said. ''His major proposals have gone nowhere and will go nowhere.'' 
 Mr. Moore added that the governor was using the unemployment money to get an audit of a state agency, leaving the unemployed caught in the middle.
 Mr. Sanford once carried two piglets onto the floor of the House chamber to symbolize his opposition to what he considered wasteful spending. One of the piglets promptly defecated; lawmakers were not amused. Indeed, though Republicans dominate both chambers, they have overriden hundreds of his vetoes on spending over the years, including, in one recent session, money to expand children's health insurance, indigent defense, and to provide cost-of-living adjustments for retired state employees. 
 After one special session last year, the legislators overrode 228 out of 243 of the governor's vetoes, restoring money Mr. Sanford had rejected for H.I.V. prevention and health programs, and for state parks and beach reconstruction. 
 Indeed, one leading Republican in the state, the Senate president pro tempore, Glenn F. McConnell, was sharply critical of Mr. Sanford's stand on the unemployment benefits issue. 
 ''Part of it has to do with how high the unemployment rate is, and that is not looking good for his administration,'' Mr. McConnell said. ''I criticize him on the timing of this right here at Christmastime.'' 
 Up until now Mr. Sanford's antispending stance has, if anything, appeared only to enhance his popularity in this conservative state. But recent letters to the editor have criticized him for holding up the unemployment benefits, and at a state jobless center here this week there was anger directed at the governor. 
 ''He's going to make the people of this state suffer for his agenda,'' said Henry Wright, 53, a laid-off carpenter who said he was on the verge of being evicted from his home. ''The only thing I got to live on'' was his unemployment check of $207 a week, Mr. Wright said. 
 Cynthia Bruce, 52, an unemployed mobile-home saleswoman, was also critical. ''He's turned a deaf ear to the needs of the people of this state,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Green Zone, Heart of U.S. Occupation, Reverts to Iraqi Control

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON and STEPHEN FARRELL; Abeer Mohammed, Suadad al-Salhy and Riyadh Mohammed contributed reporting.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD 

 BODY:
For nearly six years, the Green Zone has become such an enduring shorthand for a willfully sequestered occupation of Iraq that it is easy to forget it is an actual place. 
 But it is a real, or surreal, village of Peruvian and Ugandan guards, Filipino launderers, British military contractors, American soldiers and diplomats, and Iraqi politicians, a place with areas so drastically different that it seems as if they were lifted whole from other countries and dropped in the center of Baghdad. 
 On Thursday, as part of the recent security agreement with the United States, the 5.6-square-mile Green Zone -- or the International Zone -- will revert to Iraqi control. The Iraqis will decide, with input from the Americans, who gets which buildings, what parts should be opened up to the rest of Baghdad and who can go in and out. 
 Americans will even begin paying rent. 
 Several committees have been set up, consisting of both Iraqi and American officials, to study and administer these matters, though it appears that little will be done immediately. Because of the immense strides in security, the reality outside -- in the Red Zone, or, as soldiers call it, ''on the economy''-- is inching toward equilibrium with the reality inside, but it is not quite there yet.
 So while Iraqi soldiers now stand at checkpoints, Americans are still watching from nearby, and intelligence about a possible terrorist attack has made the checkpoints more stringent than usual this week, an Iraqi military spokesman said. 
 Plans to shrink the zone or open major thoroughfares, which could go a long way toward reducing Baghdad's strangling traffic, are promised but could be months away. 
 Americans have been moving out of buildings since 2006, though it has not been decided in many cases who is taking their place.
 No real estate transfer is as significant as that involving the Republican Palace, Saddam Hussein's lavish showpiece, captured and occupied in April 2003 by American troops. It was home to the Coalition Provisional Authority and, later, the American Embassy.
 The American diplomats have moved into the enormous yet austere new embassy nearby, but the decision on who gets the valuable palace is still under discussion. It will probably be Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, said several Iraqi officials. Or President Jalal Talabani, said several others. Or both. 
 Neither occupant -- one a Shiite, the other a Kurd, both involved in armed resistance against the Hussein government -- would be an agreeable sight for the man depicted on the huge portrait in relief that still remains, covered by a tarp, in the lobby of the palace.
 This portrait of Mr. Hussein as master architect is not the only reminder of his rule that has lingered in the nerve center of the new government. The country's most famous monument, though now inaccessible to most Iraqis, still dominates the Green Zone's skyline: the towering arches of crossed swords held aloft by forearms sculptured to resemble Mr. Hussein's own. Much less noticed is the tomb of Michel Aflaq, the founder of Mr. Hussein's Baath Party, which for a while was used by American troops as a gym and barracks.
 Despite the Green Zone's symbolic association with the American occupation, life inside the bubble is far from homogeneous.
 There are the American military and State Department minizones, where joggers, golf carts and duck-and-cover bunkers proliferate and parties take place, though with less abandon than in the early years. But there are also Iraqi high schools, an often startling firing range and a chaotic Iraqi taxi lot. 
 Alongside the Tigris lies Little Venice, a well-tended neighborhood of minicanals where senior Iraqi government officials live in residences once occupied by Mr. Hussein's closest aides. Other officials have made their homes in the rooms of the Hotel Rasheed, or in Green Zone neighborhoods where driveways are guarded by dark sport utility vehicles and civilian Humvees. 
 Many of the officials have complained that while they can come and go, relatives and guests cannot visit them without the same body searches and metal detectors awaiting every non-V.I.P. But that very complaint worries many of the other Iraqis who live and work in the Green Zone. 
 Some were already living in the area when their homes became engulfed by the zone; others moved in after 2003 as poor squatters or high officials; still others lived in violent neighborhoods in Baghdad and lined up for work every morning at the frequently bombed checkpoints.
 Despite repeated mortar and rocket attacks, the Green Zone has been a sanctuary for these Iraqis, who number in the thousands. Hearing from relatives during the worst years about life in Baghdad -- bloody and increasingly Islamist -- was like hearing news from another planet. 
 ''It feels like Kurdistan,'' said Nabez Jamal Shahrazurri, 35, a Kurd who works for the Presidency Council. With the transfer of control, he is doubtful it will stay that way.
 The impersonal efficiency of the American checkpoints, which has angered countless Iraqis, is, in Mr. Shahrazurri's view, the chief reason that security has been so well maintained. 
 ''The American forces only deal with badges,'' he said. ''They have no friends. The Iraqis have friends.''
 Iraqis in the zone tend to view Americans more positively than their counterparts who live or work outside it, but many have kept their association a secret for years, as a matter of survival. In interviews, they expressed a deep fear that the transfer of the Green Zone would leave them in danger.
 Some families are so terrified they are considering moving elsewhere, said Adeer Kadim, 20, a taxi driver who has lived in the zone since 2003. Others say they are worried that they will be forced out. 
 But the Iraqi government has been pushing for this day, and it seems natural that a security agreement that gives Iraq control of its radio frequencies and airspace would also include the seat of its government. 
 ''Even if the Iraqi side is not as professional as the Americans, I still believe that it's better to be transferred,'' said Nawal al-Samarrai, the Iraqi minister for women's affairs and the sole cabinet member to vote against the agreement.
 ''They are Iraqis, and this is their home,'' she said. ''They are not foreigners, not occupiers.''

HEADLINE: Music Sales Fell in 2008, But Climbed On the Web

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO

 BODY:
Sales of recorded music fell sharply in 2008, as consumers continued to migrate away from the CD format, large retailers reduced floor space for music and the recession dampened consumer spending during the critical year-end holiday shopping period.
Total album sales in the United States, including CDs and full-album downloads, were 428 million, a 14 percent drop from 2007, according to data from Nielsen SoundScan. Since the industry's peak in 2000, album sales have declined 45 percent, although digital music purchases continue to grow at a rapid rate. 
The year's biggest seller was Lil Wayne's album ''Tha Carter III'' (Cash Money/Universal Motown), which sold 2.87 million copies, followed by Coldplay's ''Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends'' (Capitol), with 2.14 million. ''Fearless'' (Big Machine), the second album by the 19-year-old country star Taylor Swift, was third, with 2.11 million. (Ms. Swift also scored the sixth-highest seller this year, for her self-titled debut, released in 2006, which sold 1.6 million copies in 2008.)
The music industry has grown accustomed to dismal sales numbers, and this year even the good news comes with disappointment. ''Tha Carter III'' is the first release in SoundScan's 17-year history to top the year-end list with sales of less than 3 million.
Sales of digital music continued to rise steeply last year. Just over a billion songs were downloaded, a 27 percent increase from 2007, and some record companies say they are finally beginning to wring significant profits from music on Web sites like YouTube and MySpace.
But analysts say that despite the growth and promise of digital music -- in 2003 just 19 million songs were purchased as downloads -- the money made online is still far from enough to make up for losses in physical sales.
''As the digital side grows, you get a different business model, with more revenue streams,'' said Michael McGuire, an analyst with Gartner, a market research firm. ''But do we get back to where the revenue that the labels see is going to be fully replacing the CD in the next four to five years? No.'' Gartner recently issued a report urging record companies to put their primary focus on downloads.
Record companies counter that album sales alone do not give a full picture of the complex new economics of the industry. Rio Caraeff, the executive vice president of Universal Music Group's digital division, eLabs, said other income, like the fees collected when users stream a video online, had become an essential part of the pie. Twenty percent of Rihanna's revenue, he said, has come from the sale of ring tones.
''We don't focus anymore on total album sales or the sale of any one particular product as the metric of revenue or success,'' Mr. Caraeff said. ''We look at the total consolidated revenue from dozens of revenue lines behind a given artist or project, which include digital sales, the physical business, mobile sales and licensing income.''
Even as most of the industry pushes for greater online sales, two of the biggest albums of the year were by artists who have been vocal opponents of downloading. Kid Rock's ''Rock N Roll Jesus'' (Atlantic) reached No. 4 with just over 2 million sales, and AC/DC's ''Black Ice'' (Columbia), sold through an exclusive deal with Wal-Mart, was No. 5 with 1.92 million.
Neither act sells its music through Apple's iTunes, the dominant online seller. AC/DC has said that selling individual tracks breaks up the continuity of a full album. But a la carte downloads are also far less lucrative than full CDs.
At least one sector of the music industry has continued to enjoy robust success: the concert business. Ticket sales in North America in 2008 rose at least 7 percent, to $4.2 billion, according to Pollstar, the touring-industry trade magazine. But in keeping with the trend of recent years, slightly fewer tickets were sold for more money: attendance for the top 100 tours dropped 3 percent, but the average ticket price climbed 8 percent, to $66.90.
The record industry has been eager to share in touring's bull market, and many of the major labels' new contracts are for so-called 360 deals, which give the company a much wider share in an artist's income, from touring to merchandising to product endorsements. But those types of contract are still far from the norm.
Despite the growth of online music sales, CDs remain by far the most popular format, although that hold is slipping; 361 million CDs were sold in 2008, down almost 20 percent from the previous year. About 84 percent of all album purchases were CDs, down from 90 percent the year before.
And since CDs remain the record industry's biggest profit engine, many analysts worry that the industry will be particularly vulnerable to inventory reductions at retail stores. Big-box stores like Wal-Mart and Best Buy account for up to 65 percent of all retail purchases, and many of those stores are sharply reducing the floor space allotted to music, said Richard Greenfield, a media analyst at Pali Research in New York.
''CDs no longer drive somebody into a store on Tuesday,'' Mr. Greenfield said, referring to the day new CDs usually go on sale. ''So the big risk for 2009 is that you will see even more rapid contraction of floor space, as CDs really go out of sight, out of mind for the consumer.''

HEADLINE: The State Of Courts, And a Plea For a Raise

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The state of the economy and vigorous prosecution of immigration offenses and sex crimes are shaping the federal courts' dockets, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote on Wednesday in his annual year-end report on the federal judiciary. 
 The chief justice devoted much of his report, as he has every year, to a plea for increased judicial salaries.
 The overview of the federal courts' workload, presented as an appendix to the chief justice's report, reflected relatively modest growth in most areas. Both civil and criminal filings in federal district courts, for instance, increased by 4 percent in the most recent fiscal year, which ended in September. 
 But bankruptcy filings rose by 30 percent, to more than a million, and cases in which the government sued over student loans in default rose by 10 percent.
 Filings concerning criminal charges in immigration cases jumped by 27 percent, to more than 21,000. The cases were concentrated in the Southwest.
 Prosecutions in sex offense cases grew by 9 percent, Chief Justice Roberts said, stemming from ''cases involving sexually explicit material and sex offender registration.''
 But the number of drug cases in the federal trial courts dropped by 7 percent. ''Those reductions occurred,'' the chief justice wrote, ''when investigative agencies shifted their focus from drugs to terrorism and sex offenses.''
 The number of cases filed in the Supreme Court in the last term also dropped 7 percent, to 8,241. The court decided 67 cases with signed opinions -- the same number as the year before and about half the number in an average year two decades ago. 
 Chief Justice Roberts noted that ''the nation faces pressing economic problems, resulting in business failures, home foreclosures and bankruptcy,'' and he said the federal judiciary was doing its part to conserve resources. The federal judiciary's budget of $6.2 billion, he said, ''represents a mere two-tenths of 1 percent of the United States' total $3 trillion budget.''
 ''Two-tenths of 1 percent!'' the chief justice wrote. ''That is all we ask for one of the three branches of government -- the one charged 'to guard the Constitution and the rights of individuals,' '' he added, quoting Alexander Hamilton.
 He then renewed his call for higher judicial salaries.
 ''I suspect many are tired of hearing it, and I know I am tired of saying it,'' Chief Justice Roberts wrote, ''but I must make this plea again -- Congress must provide judicial compensation that keeps pace with inflation.'' 
 ''Judges knew what the pay was when they answered the call of public service,'' he wrote. ''But they did not know that Congress would steadily erode that pay in real terms by repeatedly failing over the years to provide even cost-of-living increases.''
 This year, he said, every other federal employee, including members of Congress, received a cost-of-living increase. Only federal judges missed out.
 Wielding an exclamation point for a second time, Chief Justice Roberts renewed what he called ''the judiciary's modest petition: Simply provide cost-of-living increases that have been unfairly denied!''

HEADLINE: A Good Pick, or a Tainted One?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''The Latest From Illinois'' (editorial, Dec. 31), about Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich's appointment of Roland W. Burris to the vacant Senate seat: 
 Mr. Burris must have taken complete leave of his senses to accept the appointment.
 Even if the Supreme Court were to order him seated, what then? Mr. Burris would become a pariah, banished from the Democratic caucus and denied service on any Senate committee. His office would doubtless be next to the main boiler room.
 If he has one gram of common sense left, he should reject this appointment, run home and stay there. 
 Lewis B. Shrady Irvington, N.Y., Dec. 31, 2008
 To the Editor:
 I understand everybody's disappointment in Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich's performance of his duties, anger over the alleged fraud and frustration over the governor's refusal to resign his position during the continuing investigation. But I am perplexed at hearing President-elect Barack Obama, our elected officials in Washington and this newspaper calling for the rejection of his selection of Roland W. Burris to replace Mr. Obama in the United States Senate.
 Mr. Blagojevich is the governor of Illinois until such time as he is impeached by the Legislature or is convicted of the charges that have been leveled against him. Thus, he has the duty of choosing a replacement for Mr. Obama.
 I cannot envision the lieutenant governor's not certifying and the United States Senate's not promptly seating his selection. The rules should not be changed in the middle of the game, especially when that entails squandering the taxpayers' money in lengthy court proceedings in the midst of an economic recession.
 Edouard Coupet Dolton, Ill., Dec. 31, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Your subscription to conventional wisdom at the expense of a pragmatic solution to a thorny problem is disappointing, to say the least. The only real ''principle'' involved is the fear that Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich would do the wrong thing. 
 Take a step back and recognize that he has done the right thing: He has selected a man of integrity, a man of color (who would be the only one in the Senate) and a tried and true Democrat who would be of legislative assistance to the new president.
 The appointment also puts to rest the only real national dilemma posed by the situation in Illinois. If you think it through, you will realize that the governor may have unwittingly defused the situation so that the legal system can deal with him in an orderly and fair way with minimal disruption to the nation's business.
 Lewis Seagull Westfield, N.J., Dec. 31, 2008
 To the Editor:
 The willingness of Roland W. Burris to accept the senatorial appointment by Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich taints such appointment without anything more.

Capital Question 
 For Small Nations
 A crucial question for emerging market countries in 2009 is whether they have access to capital. Those countries that do may prosper. As for those that do not, it might be better not to ask. 
 This year is not going to be easy for the developing world. Lower commodity prices and slumping Western economies will limit growth. With the United States, Western Europe and Japan all in recession and unlikely to emerge quickly, whatever meager growth there is will be concentrated in emerging markets. 
 Economic momentum, high savings and relatively clean banking systems should allow some countries to flourish nonetheless. China, Taiwan, South Korea, Malaysia and Brazil, for example, do not rely heavily on foreign capital and have large reserves of foreign currency. Malaysia has a savings rate of 37 percent. Those countries can use that capital to stimulate their economies. Continued growth in China and India, even at a slower rate, should keep commodity prices from collapsing entirely, providing support for exporters. 
 But life will be hard for countries that need to borrow. Spreads on emerging market bonds, according to the J.P. Morgan EMBI Global index, have tripled since January. For countries with junk credit ratings it is hard to get financing at any price. 
 Emerging markets with large current account deficits are especially vulnerable, even if their total foreign debt is moderate. Until June, these countries benefited from enormous inflows of foreign capital, so that even the export success story of Vietnam ran a trade deficit of 30 percent of gross domestic product. Such gaps create economies that are seriously out of kilter. With foreign inflows drying up, those countries now have to find a better balance -- in a hurry. 
 In the old days, the International Monetary Fund would ease the pain of transition. It is trying again, with bailouts in Ukraine, Hungary, Iceland and Pakistan. But the Ukrainian experience, where the funds were nearly exhausted in a few weeks, suggests that the cash drain may be too great for bailouts to be effective. 
 The leaders of the borrowing countries will be busy fighting off troubles in 2009. But if they have a few spare moments, they might spend them contemplating the rewards harvested by their more prudent brethren. 
 Golden Prospects
 A huge United States government deficit, low interest rates and rapidly growing money supply all add to the likelihood of renewed inflation -- and a rising gold price. How high? Very. 
 The United States money supply grew slowly for a while in early autumn, but in the two months to Dec. 1 the St. Louis Federal Reserve's ''money of zero maturity'' measure, essentially cash and similar instruments, increased at an 11.7 percent annual rate. That's a return to the trend that lasted from 1995 to 2008, when the measure grew 3.6 percentage points faster than nominal gross domestic product. 
 The United States is not alone. Around the world, governments have implemented large stimulus packages. If they don't want the borrowings to fund these to crowd out the private sector, they must be financed by creating more money. 
 That monetary expansion is not supposed to be inflationary, since the governments promise to take any money away before it can push up prices. Investors can be forgiven for skepticism. Higher inflation is at least possible once the global recession bottoms out.
 Gold provides good insurance. Investment demand for it has increased rapidly in 2008, despite a falling price since June. The dollar value of gold demand was 45 percent higher in the third quarter than in the second, and 51 percent higher than the previous year, according to the World Gold Council. Supply has failed to keep up, with mine output up only 2 percent from the previous year and central bank sales down sharply. 
 Weak supply, strong demand and fears of inflation constitute a perfect mix of ingredients for a gold rally. Any surge into gold by hedge funds and other speculators could overwhelm the market, turning the rally into a bubble. 
 In January 1980, just before the Federal Reserve avoided an inflationary catastrophe, the gold price peaked at $875. That is $2,430 in today's dollars. But the pools of speculative capital are much larger now than in 1980. A true gold bubble could well leave this benchmark far behind.

HEADLINE: Home on the Corner of Boom and Bust

BYLINE: By JOHN STRAUSBAUGH

 BODY:
THE skies above Wall Street were overcast, and the mood down below was equally stormy. From the steps of Federal Hall National Memorial at Wall and Nassau Streets, Ralph Nader, the independent presidential candidate, railed against the ''casino capitalism'' of the neighboring New York Stock Exchange. Protesters paraded a large inflated pig down Wall Street. Others stood outside the stock exchange chanting, ''Jump! Jump!'' Traders on their lunch breaks stood on the fringes with amused expressions, while news crews and tourist groups trained their cameras on the rowdy scene.
Standing on the corner of Wall and Broad that mid-October day, Steve Fraser, a historian and the author of the book ''Wall Street: America's Dream Palace,'' said that in some ways the stock market meltdown of 2008 was nothing new.
''The stock market is by its very nature prone to periodic bouts of irrational ecstasies and depressive panics,'' Mr. Fraser said. It has cycled through those booms and busts since it first got organized in the late 18th century. 
Geographically and historically, New York City begins in the small space below Wall Street. And when disaster strikes the area, as it has often done, it can seem as if the city will end there too. But if the nearly four centuries of history there tell anything, it's a story of survival. As it grew from the tiny Dutch outpost of New Amsterdam to today's forest of skyscrapers, lowest Manhattan outlived military occupation, enormous fires, terrorist massacres and a long string of stock-market crises.
Bowling Green, the small park at the foot of Broadway's roaring canyon, is where the seed of today's metropolis was planted in the 1620s when the Dutch West India Company dropped off a few dozen families to establish a trading post. Those first settlers lived ''in pits they dug in the ground and then covered over with wood,'' explained Mark Caldwell, a Fordham University professor and the author of ''New York Night: The Mystique and Its History.'' ''It was the quickest shelter for the winter.''
Bowling Green has been open public space all along, Mr. Caldwell said. The original Dutch fort, Fort Amsterdam, stood where the 1907 Alexander Hamilton United States Custom House is today. (It is now the New York branch of the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian.)
Bowling Green was then part of ''a parade ground where soldiers practiced maneuvers,'' he continued. ''That very quickly turned into a market space where farmers in outlying districts brought their produce to sell. It became a famous place for prostitutes to haunt in the evening. And in the early 18th century it was where people played lawn bowling.''
From the start, Mr. Caldwell said, it was a party town, known for its many taverns, ''the all-purpose repositories of night life. There were theatrical performances, dancing, gambling and concerts.''
In 1979 and 1980 archaeologists dug for the remains of two famous taverns that had stood on Pearl Street near Coenties Slip. Transparent panels in the plaza along Pearl Street display part of the stone foundation they found of the King's House tavern (also known as Lovelace Tavern), built in 1670. Light-colored paving stones nearby outline the modest footprint of the City Tavern (Stadt Herbergh), built in 1641. In 1653 it also became the first City Hall, the Stadt Huys. And it contained a jail.
''So you could, in one day, go from sitting on a court case to a drunken debauch to jail, without ever leaving this little place where we're standing,'' Mr. Caldwell noted.
A few blocks north, at what was then the edge of the city, the Dutch built a defensive wall across the island in 1653. Like Fort Amsterdam, it proved of no use when the British seized New Amsterdam in 1664 and renamed it New York.
''It was essentially an earthwork with a wooden palisade on top,'' explained Steve Laise, the National Parks Service's chief of cultural resources for Federal Hall National Memorial, a Greek Revival landmark on Wall Street. Today's Wall Street follows the dirt lane that was just inside this defense. ''When you walk on Wall Street, you're literally walking in the footsteps of the burghers of New Amsterdam,'' Mr. Laise said.
The wall came down in 1699, and a new City Hall was built at Wall and Nassau Streets. In 1789, expanded and remodeled, it was renamed Federal Hall. George Washington was inaugurated president there on April 30 of that year, and the first Congress met there. Alexander Hamilton, the first secretary of the Treasury and the founding father most often associated with Wall Street, ''was in and out of that building all the time,'' Mr. Laise said.
It was unceremoniously torn down in 1812 and sold for scrap, Mr. Laise said. ''They got $425 for the first Capitol of the United States.''
The current building went up in 1842 as the Treasury Department's Custom House. After several other uses, it is now a museum administered by the Parks Service.
Standing on Wall Street amid bustling traders and tourists, Mr. Fraser explained that in the 1700s ''merchants, brokers, traders and small bankers would congregate out here to do their deals.'' In the 1790s they started meeting in area coffeehouses, like the Tontine Coffee House on the northwest corner of Wall and Water Streets. ''And almost immediately, they began to do the kind of speculation that we are so painfully familiar with today,'' Mr. Fraser said. ''In 1792, in fact, was the first Wall Street panic.''
William Duer worked under Hamilton at the Treasury Department and used his insider's information to collude with others in speculating on government bonds. When that scheme went bust, ruining many investors, ''there was no bailout,'' Mr. Fraser said. ''Instead, because the collapse of his insider-trading scam produced an immediate local depression, the populace of New York was outraged. They chased Duer through the streets right here where we're standing, and would have probably disemboweled him had they caught him.''
The Wall Street area came under terrorist attacks well before 9/11. On Sept. 16, 1920, as lunchtime crowds filled the intersection of Wall and Broad Streets, 100 pounds of TNT on a horse-drawn wagon exploded outside the J. P. Morgan & Company offices, sending fragmented lead sash weights flying as shrapnel. Thirty people were killed instantly, and many more were injured, some fatally. The facade of the Morgan building still wears pockmarks from the flying metal shards. Although anarchists were suspected, no one was ever prosecuted.
In 1975, another lunchtime bomb ripped through Fraunces Tavern, at 54 Pearl Street, killing four and injuring more than 50 others. The F.A.L.N., a Puerto Rican separatist group, claimed responsibility.
Built as a home in 1719, the tavern had already seen a lot of history. At the end of the Revolutionary War in 1783, Washington gave his farewell address to his officers in a room there, recreated in the museum above the current restaurant. The building went through several fires and much alteration in the 1800s. Its Colonial appearance today is the result of a 1907 reconstruction.
Lowest Manhattan has also survived a few cataclysmic fires. In 1776, soon after the British Army routed Washington's troops and occupied Manhattan, an enormous blaze consumed the western side of the city.
Among the buildings lost was Trinity Church, built in 1698, at Wall Street and Broadway. Its burning was ''an eerie pre-echo of 9/11,'' Mr. Caldwell said. The spire ''was the tallest structure in the city; Washington and his troops could see it from the Harlem Heights,'' where the British had just chased them. ''They saw the spire go up in flames and then collapse,'' he added. Much of the city was still a charred ruin when the British left in 1783.
The current Trinity Church was completed in 1846. Its spire was again the tallest structure in the city, and it remained so until the advent of skyscrapers in the late 19th century.
Huge fires in 1835 and 1845 destroyed much of the city below Wall Street. Both spurred building booms that transformed the downtown cityscape.
At the New York City Police Museum, located in the former First Precinct building on Old Slip, Michael Cronin, a retired detective and former curator, explained that today's police and fire departments both evolved from the Dutch Rattle Watch, a force of eight men formed in the 1650s to patrol the streets at night. They carried lanterns, sometimes swords or pistols, and large wooden rattles, examples of which are on display. (Policemen did not use whistles until the 1800s.) They kept an eye out not just for crime but also for fire, invading British, Indians and pirates.
The fortresslike First Precinct building, which has housed the museum since 2001, was built in 1911.
''Being a cop back then was like being in the army,'' Mr. Cronin said. Precinct houses held dormitories where off-duty cops slept in rotation, to be on hand in case of emergency in the days before telephones or radios. ''The Police Department gave you a locker and a bed frame. You had to supply the mattress,'' Mr. Cronin said. Policemen's widows washed the bedclothes.
The jail cells were below. Precinct houses also served as homeless shelters, nicknamed green-light hotels for the distinctive lamps hung outside them.
The museum's three floors of exhibits describe law enforcement's evolution from the Rattle Watch to the New York Police Department's post-9/11 transformation ''from a reactive civil police force to a proactive intelligence agency,'' Mr. Cronin said.
Although we may think of it as all business and finance, lowest Manhattan also has a lot of history as a residential area. Wealthy families built fine homes on Wall Street in the 1700s; Hamilton lived in one.
Greenwich and Washington Streets were once lined with town houses, tenements and storefronts. In 1844 Edgar Allan Poe and his frail wife, Virginia, lived briefly in a boarding house at 130 Greenwich Street, near Cedar Street.
In the 20th century the area became a compact immigrant neighborhood called Little Syria. After World War II it was demolished in stages to make way for the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel at one end and the World Trade Center at the other. One fragmentary remnant is the jewel-like St. George's Chapel at 103 Washington Street, a tenement that was converted to a small church in 1929. It now houses a restaurant.
Over the last decade lowest Manhattan has seen a renaissance as a residential area, after many abandoned office buildings were converted from commercial spaces to apartments and condominiums.
When the stock market was plummeting in the fall of 2008, Mr. Fraser noted that booms and crashes came ''with extraordinary regularity'' through the 19th and early 20th centuries, leading up to the great crash of 1929. Under new federal regulations after that, Wall Street experienced half a century of relative calm. But since the late 1980s, he said, ''the booms and busts come much more frequently,'' fueled by deregulation ''and the invention of all sorts of new and unpredictable investment instruments.''
At Federal Hall, Steve Laise conjectured that Hamilton would have approved of the federal government's current bailout of Wall Street.
''I think he would have felt that part of the government's responsibility is to maintain a stable economic environment,'' Mr. Laise said. ''The unbridled boom and ensuing bust are destabilizing, and that's the worst thing, in Hamilton's opinion, that can happen.''

HEADLINE: Awash in Milk And Headaches

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN

DATELINE: FOWLER, Calif. 

 BODY:
The long economic boom, fueled by easy credit that allowed people to spend money they did not have, led to a huge oversupply of cars, houses and shopping malls, as recent months have made clear. Now, add one more item to the list: an oversupply of cows.
 And it turns out that shutting down the milk supply is not as easy as closing an automobile assembly line.
 As a breakneck expansion in the global dairy industry turns to bust, Roger Van Groningen must deal with the consequences. In a warehouse that his company runs here, 8 to 20 trucks pull up every day to unload milk powder. Bags of the stuff -- surplus that nobody will buy, at least not at a price the dairy industry regards as acceptable -- are unloaded and stacked into towering rows that nearly fill the warehouse.
 Mr. Van Groningen's company does not own the surplus milk powder, but merely stores it for the new owners: the taxpayers of the United States. To date, the government has agreed to buy about $91 million worth of milk powder. 
 ''The thing is, they are going to produce it because they have to milk the cows,'' Mr. Van Groningen said. ''It's like a river. It keeps coming.'' In addition, dairy farmers are all too aware that, unlike industrial machinery, cows cannot be turned off and stored until economic conditions improve; they must be fed and cared for, at continuing expense. 
 The bags of milk powder represent a startling reversal of fortune for the dairy industry, which flourished in recent years in part because of a growing appetite for milk, cheese, ice cream and pizza in places like Mexico, Egypt and Indonesia. Many of those countries were benefiting from a global economic boom led by free-spending consumers in the United States.
 As American dairy farmers increased their shipments of powdered milk, cheese and other dairy ingredients to foreign markets, their incomes rose. And the demand surge helped drive up the price of milk for American families. The national average for whole milk peaked at $3.89 a gallon in July, up from an average of $3.20 a gallon in 2006.
 But now, demand for dairy products is stalling amid a global economic slowdown and credit crisis, even as supplies have increased. The result is a glut of milk -- and its assorted byproducts, like milk powder, butter and whey proteins -- that has led to a precipitous drop in prices.
 The price of powdered skim milk, used in infant formula, dairy products and processed foods, has fallen to roughly 80 cents a pound today from about $2.20 in mid-2007. Other dairy products have declined as well. Whole milk at grocers has not declined as rapidly as wholesale powdered milk, but it has dropped to $3.67 a gallon, down nearly 6 percent from the peak. 
 While consumers are undoubtedly pleased by the lower prices, dairy farmers are struggling.
 ''Everything was going great,'' said Joaquin Contente, a farmer in Hanford, Calif. ''The product was moving. Then this financial crisis came along and shoot, the whole thing came to a halt.''
 Logic might suggest that dairy farmers would simply sell some of their cows to a hamburger plant to cut the milk supply and raise prices. Indeed, the dairy industry has a cooperative effort under way to cull the herd.
 But farmers are reluctant to do that if they expect a demand recovery, since rebuilding a herd can take years. The culling program is relatively small, and at least so far, most farmers are holding onto their cows.
 ''People don't want to panic,'' said Brian W. Gould, an agricultural economist at the University of Wisconsin, adding that farmers were receiving $20 for 100 pounds of raw milk just a few months ago. The price is expected to drop to about $14 for 100 pounds of raw milk in coming months. ''It is unclear as to whether this will be a short-term or long-term market correction. It all depends on how long it takes the U.S. economy to recover,'' he said.
 Other agricultural sectors are also struggling with a slowdown in demand from foreign buyers because of the global recession and an increase in the value of the dollar, which has made American exports more expensive abroad. The Agriculture Department is expecting steep declines in exports of corn, wheat, soybeans and pork.
 But while the government has price-support programs for about two dozen agricultural products, so far milk powder is the only commodity that has sunk low enough to start the flow of government dollars. Some expect that taxpayers will soon be buying blocks of cheese, too, given the plunging price.
 Government price supports provide a price floor for agricultural products as a way of keeping farmers afloat during hard times and ensuring an adequate food supply. 
 The Agriculture Department has committed to buying 111.6 million pounds of milk powder at 80 cents a pound, for roughly $91 million, which includes some handling fees. Before October, the last time the government bought milk powder was in June 2006, and it was eventually used in government nutrition programs, given away as animal feed or sold on the open market, said Steve Gill, director of commodity operations for the department.
 He said the agency has not decided what to do with the cache of milk powder in California.
 Some critics of farm subsidies argue that price support programs are antiquated and allow farmers to continue producing even when the economics make no sense, as taxpayers will always buy up the excess production.
 ''They don't want to downsize or respond to the market signal. They want to keep producing,'' said Kenneth Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, a Washington research organization that has long been critical of the government's farm policy. ''Once you get in a jam like this, it becomes our collective problem.''
 The government purchases come after what the department calls a ''euphoric period of record prices and booming exports'' for the American dairy industry. Since 2003, dairy exports have increased from $1 billion a year to about $4 billion this year, with exports of powdered milk increasing sixfold during that period. Milk powder is an attractive product to export because it does not require refrigeration, has a long shelf life and can be used to make numerous beverages and foods.
 Much of the increase was caused by increased demand in developing countries, where a growing middle class replaced starch in their diets with protein sources like meat and dairy products. Some Asian countries had little history of eating dairy products but were introduced to milk and mild cheeses by government nutrition programs or by restaurant chains like McDonald's and Pizza Hut.
 In China, for instance, per-person dairy consumption nearly doubled in just five years, to 63 pounds in 2007 from 33 pounds in 2002 (though it remains far below the per-capita consumption in the United States of about 580 pounds), according to the U.S. Dairy Export Council. The growth translates into the need for nearly 40 billion pounds more milk each year, roughly equal to California's annual milk production.
 In addition to the increased demand, exports from the American dairy industry benefited from a relatively weak dollar and tight global supplies. For instance, droughts reduced milk production in New Zealand and Australia, two major dairy exporters, allowing American suppliers to fill the gaps.
 American dairy shipments soared to places like Algeria, Bangladesh, Indonesia and the Philippines. The biggest market, however, was Mexico, where imports from America increased to $853 million in 2007 from $258 million in 2003, according to the Agriculture Department.
 But now, global demand has stagnated amid high prices and economic uncertainty just as the dollar has strengthened and milk production in New Zealand and, to a lesser extent, Australia, has bounced back. The continuing scandal involving melamine contamination of dairy products in China is expected to further diminish demand.
 ''In some of these countries where dairy hasn't been a big part of their diet, this is where we are seeing people pull back,'' said Deborah Perkins, managing director of the food and agribusiness research group at Rabobank International.
 Several dairy exporters say they remain bullish on their long-term prospects, given the barely tapped markets in the developing world. Until then, dairy farmers say, they are braced for a period of low milk prices even as feed and other costs remain relatively high.
 Arthur Machado, who milks cows on the outskirts of Fresno, said he sold more than half his herd in 2006, the last time prices collapsed. Now, with prices plummeting again, he said he is trying to sell the remainder of his herd to another dairy farmer.
 ''The business isn't what it was in the '70s, when I started,'' he said. ''There are not enough peaks to offset the valleys anymore.''
 Once the herd is sold, Mr. Machado said, he plans to focus on less volatile commodities, like almonds and grapes. But it is not so easy to get out of the dairy business. Just as with automobiles and homes, there is simply too much inventory on the dairy cow market.
 ''Right now, there are no buyers,'' he said. ''When it's on the upswing, we'll sell. Until then, we'll struggle through.''

HEADLINE: Oil Prices Begin the New Year by Slipping 4%

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Crude oil prices were lower and gold prices rose as trading resumed after the New Year holiday.
 Crude oil prices fell in New York, extending their worst yearly drop, on concern that a global economic contraction would limit fuel demand. 
 Crude oil for February delivery dropped as much as $2.06, or 4.6 percent, to $42.54 a barrel in after-hours electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
 Gold rose in Asia after an eighth straight annual gain as demand increased for the metal as a hedge against inflation and an alternative asset.
 Gold advanced 5.8 percent in 2008 on demand for a store of value, as a financial crisis pushed major economies into recession and drove equity markets lower.
 Bullion for immediate delivery gained $2.10 an ounce to $881.55 at 9 a.m. in Singapore, after earlier rising as much as 1 percent to $888.35. Gold for February delivery fell 0.2 percent to $882.40 in after-hours electronic trading on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Among other precious metals for immediate delivery, silver fell 0.4 percent to $11.345 an ounce, platinum was little changed at $935 an ounce, and palladium rose 1.1 percent to $189 an ounce as of 8:54 a.m. in Singapore.
 Oil fell 54 percent in 2008, the first annual decline since 2001 and the biggest drop since futures trading started in 1983. The February contract rose $5.57 to $44.60 a barrel on Dec. 31, the highest settlement since Dec. 12.
 Fuel consumption in the United States was down 3.7 percent during the four weeks ended Dec. 26 from a year earlier, according to the Department of Energy. Oil rose 14 percent on Dec. 31 after a report showed American fuel stockpiles climbed less than expected and the conflict between Israel and Hamas raised concern that Middle East supplies may be disrupted.
 ''That rally on the 31st didn't have too much behind it so we're seeing crude come back to a level more reflective of the fundamentals,'' said Toby Hassall, an analyst with Commodity Warrants Australia in Sydney. ''We still don't have a clear picture of when a global recovery is going to take place.''
 Crude oil may rise next week as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries makes record production cuts to counter the deepest economic slump since World War II.

HEADLINE: My Secret Life

BYLINE: By ELLEN ULLMAN. 
Ellen Ullman is the author of the novel ''The Bug'' and the forthcoming ''By Blood.''

DATELINE: San Francisco 

 BODY:
 I AM not adopted; I have mysterious origins.
 I have said that sentence many times in the course of my life as an adopted person. I like it so much I put it into the mouth of a character in the novel I'm writing. The character and I are both fond of the idea. We can think of ourselves as living in the dense pages of 19th-century fiction, where one's origins -- the exact mother and father -- are not nearly as important as one's ''circumstances.''
 Some might say I came to this rationalization because, until recently, everything surrounding my adoption was kept secret from me. Even the date it was finalized was a secret. (The woman on the phone said, ''Those records are sealed.'' I said, ''I know I can't see what's in them, but can I find out the date from which I couldn't see what's in them?'' She replied, ''Even the outsides of the records are sealed'' -- a confounding statement, as I envisioned envelopes surrounding envelopes, all sealed into infinity.) 
 Of course, mysterious origins are a confusing business these days. One might be gestated in an unknown womb while having genes from some combination of one's mother and father and a stranger; from a mother's womb with some combination of known and unknown genes -- not to mention the complication of untold numbers of half-siblings who might be out there from the sperm donations of one man. There are adoptive parents and biological parents, surrogates and donors -- adults of all sorts claiming parenthood by right of blood, genes, birth, law and affection. 
 Does one have the right to know all of these people? If so, do they have a reciprocal right to find the child in whose birth they participated? 
 I won't even try to answer these questions. It seems we must have a social conversation about this subject that will last for many years. The trend, certainly, is toward openness, a growing ''right'' to know. I am not against this trend. I simply want to give not-knowing its due.
 I like mysteries. I like the sense of uniqueness that comes from having unknown origins (however false that sense may be). I have a dear friend who is also adopted. We spoke as we were considering whether we should enter our names into the New York State Adoption Registry, where we might learn something about our history.
 My friend grew up in a small town upstate near a university. She had constructed for herself a satisfying fantasy in which her mother and father were in town on fellowships from the World Bank, had the occupations ''king'' and ''queen,'' had ruled in a remote region where everyone was fit, ate a diet centered upon yak yogurt and lived 110 years. She decided not to register. ''One family is quite enough for me,'' she said.
 My own fantasies were more vague: an evolving set of parents including actresses, folk singers, writers and intellectuals. I am certain that none were like the computer scientists and mathematicians who run up and down the bloodlines of my adoptive father's family. I think it is because of them, the example of those engineers and math professors, that I went into software engineering, a field for which I do not have native talent. (I was good enough, but I had to work at it.) If I had been raised by the word-eaters -- writers, readers and long-letter-writers -- who I'm certain were my ''natural'' parents, I never would have spent 20 years as a computer programmer. 
 Which is exactly my point. I could just see my birth mother looking up from George Eliot's ''Daniel Deronda'' (Book V, ''Mordecai'') to say, ''Darling, why struggle so on those cold programs when you haven't yet read 'Middlemarch'?'' And so I might have put aside my sweaty attempt to write a bubble-sort algorithm -- and thereby missed the defining profession of my time.
 No one is a genetic match to his or her parents. Nature has gone to a great deal of trouble to see that we are not like them (a strong argument against adding cloning to the human parental mix). Through the miracle of natural genetic recombination, each child, with the sole exception of an identical twin, is conceived as a unique being. Even the atmosphere of the womb works its subtle changes, and by the time we emerge into the light, we are our own persons. Knowing every single ancestor, therefore, will never solve the deeper mystery, which of course is the dreadful question of who we become.

HEADLINE: Economy Blunts Korea's Appetite for Plastic Surgery

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER; Su Hyun Lee contributed reporting.

DATELINE: SEOUL 

 BODY:
A grim frugality has settled over this export powerhouse that once burst with optimism -- and silicone.
 Cosmetic surgery took off here after South Korea's spectacular recovery from its currency crisis a decade ago. Rising living standards allowed ever-growing numbers of men and women to get the wider eyes, whiter skin and higher nose bridges that define beauty for many here. Improved looks were even seen as providing an edge in this high-pressure society's intense competition for jobs, education and marriage partners. 
 But turmoil coursing through the financial world and then into the global economy has hit South Korea hard, as it has many middle-income countries. The downturn drove down the stock market and the currency by a third or more last year, and the resulting anxiety forced many South Koreans to change their habits. 
 A particular chill has seeped into the plastic surgery industry, emptying waiting rooms and driving clinics out of business. 
 ''In hard times, people always cut back on luxuries like eating out, jewelry and plastic surgery,'' said one plastic surgeon, Park Hyun, who has seen the number of his patients drop sharply. ''If this is a normal recession, then these desires will eventually get reignited, and our patients will come back.''
 After a pause, Dr. Park added: ''If this downturn is like the Great Depression, then we are all going to get killed off.''
 It is hard to measure the exact size of the industry here or the extent of the current downturn because no one keeps exact figures. Seoul-based ARA Consulting, which specializes in the plastic surgery industry, said reports from surgeons and local media suggest the number of patient visits each month is down 40 percent since September.
 That would be a huge setback to this once fast-growing industry. From a luxury limited to the wealthy a decade ago, according to ARA, plastic surgery has become so common that an estimated 30 percent of Korean women aged 20 to 50, or some 2.4 million women, had surgical or nonsurgical cosmetic procedures last year, with many having more than one procedure.
 That compares with 11.7 million cosmetic procedures performed last year in the United States, according to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, meaning that the number of procedures in America is 4.9 times the number in South Korea, though the United States population is more than six times larger. 
 ''As South Korea became wealthier, it was just one more thing that women desire,'' said Yoon Sung-min, ARA's chief executive. He said many doctors were drawn to plastic surgery because payment is outside of the national health care system's price controls, allowing bigger profits.
 Nowhere has the boom, and the currently unfolding bust, been more apparent than Seoul's fashionable shopping neighborhood of Apgujeong. 
 More than half of South Korea's 627 registered cosmetic surgery clinics are here -- their names, including Dr. For You and Ivy Plastic, visible among the fashion boutiques and wine bars. 
 But their once-crowded waiting rooms are empty. For sale signs have begun appearing on clinic doors for the first time in memory, and some 20 clinics have already closed.
 Dr. Park, the plastic surgeon, predicts a third of Apgujeong's clinics could close by spring. 
 ''This is the Mecca of plastic surgery in Asia,'' said Dr. Park, who sat in his lavishly decorated wood-paneled clinic overlooking the neighborhood. ''But even a Mecca can fall on hard times.''
 Dr. Park said December would normally have been his peak season because high school seniors finish South Korea's grueling university entrance exams and prepare for winter graduation. He said the exhausted students -- and their equally stressed mothers -- often celebrated by getting cosmetic surgery. 
 Not last December. Though he would not disclose specific numbers, Dr. Park said his patient load was down by half, leading him to lay off three of his seven nurses and office workers. 
 Sung Myung-soon can sympathize. 
 Like millions of South Koreans who recently emerged into the middle class, Ms. Sung, a 54-year-old homemaker, enjoyed a lifestyle of shopping at malls and lounging by her health club's pool, and -- until a few months ago -- regularly visiting the plastic surgeon, where she maintained her youthful appearance.
 But the financial crisis in the fall has brought fears that South Korea's good times may be over, or at least on indefinite suspension, and Ms. Sung has cut back by making fewer visits to her plastic surgeon and bargaining hard for discounts when she does visit. She refuses to give up her plastic surgery altogether.
 ''Even at times like these, women still want their plastic surgery,'' said Ms. Sung, who recently rounded her eyes and smoothed wrinkles on her forehead.
 Typical of South Korea's more frugal patients, she chose less expensive procedures, like Botox injections to remove wrinkles, instead of her usual surgery. She also said she would reduce her number of visits to once a year, from twice.
 Still, surgeons say the continued desire of women like Ms. Sung to look beautiful will keep the industry alive, although it may shrink greatly. 
 But Dr. Park and other plastic surgeons said the country's decline has brought one silver lining: South Korea's currency has fallen so far that procedures here are now cheap when calculated in dollars and other currencies. This has led to growing numbers of Japanese, Chinese and Korean Americans coming to Seoul for relatively inexpensive cosmetic procedures. 
 Some clinics said 20 to 30 percent of patients are now foreigners, up from 10 percent last year. A few larger clinics are even taking the opportunity of a downturn at home to open branches in China, the country seen as the industry's next big growth market.
 Other plastic surgeons have left the Apgujeong area to escape the intense competition. One, Jang Yeon-jae, recently moved to a small clinic in the nondescript middle-class neighborhood of Nokbeon, in northern Seoul, in hopes of drawing new customers. He said business had been slow so far at the clinic, whose tiny waiting room has a peach-colored sofa and a television playing footage of Korean pop concerts.
 The lower volume of patients, as well as the national plastic surgery downturn, has led Dr. Jang to change some of his habits too. ''Before, I focused on profitable procedures'' like breast enlargement, he said. ''Now, I take every little procedure, even just removing a single mole.''
 Some companies in the industry are adapting in other ways. Hyumedi, a firm that sells and leases medical equipment, has been buying used equipment from liquidated clinics at fire sale prices. 
 Jeon Jin-wook, the company's chief executive, said he had bought so many machines that he rented a second warehouse just to store them all. He said he expected demand for second-hand equipment to pick up as clinics can no longer afford expensive new machines.
 ''It is a good time to stock up,'' Mr. Jeon said. ''We have to change with the times.''

HEADLINE: Parking Fine Too Big? Well, Just Say So

BYLINE: By JO CRAVEN McGINTY and RALPH BLUMENTHAL; Joel Stonington contributed reporting.

 BODY:
In a city of markdowns, where bargains are prized, New York officials have been offering sharply reduced fines on parking tickets for almost three years and, remarkably, the deep discounts have gone largely unnoticed.
 Any driver who challenges a parking ticket -- in person, in writing or online -- is offered a substantial, guaranteed reduction for most fines, under a program the city quietly introduced in 2005. 
 Plead guilty to parking at an expired meter in Midtown, for example, and agree to forgo a hearing, and the city will immediately reduce the fine from $65 to $43. No questions asked. 
 But most people who get tickets, about 80 percent by city estimates, do not challenge them and still simply pay the full fine. 
 While the willingness to pay full freight may be evidence of civic zeal, it also appears to be an outgrowth of the fact that public knowledge of the program remains slight.
 The city has never produced a press release on the program, whose existence has enabled it to reduce the cost of holding hearings on the 10 million tickets it issues each year. Nor is the policy, known as the settlement program, described in the city's official brochure ''Got Tickets? Your Guide to Parking Ticket Hearings.''
 The settlement option is mentioned on the city's Web site, though many drivers do not seem to learn about it until they line up for a hearing to challenge a ticket and a clerk advises them that there is another option.
 ''How are you supposed to know that?'' said Jennifer Zarcone, who has received hundreds of parking tickets in the 16 years she has lived in Brooklyn without ever hearing about the program. ''Do they not want you to know?''
 Councilman Vincent J. Gentile of Brooklyn, who has been alerting his constituents to the program, said he can understand why the city is not shouting from the rooftops about the schedule of fine reductions for people who challenge tickets. ''Obviously, if they can get someone to pay the full fine,'' he said, ''it would be more beneficial to the city.''
 But city officials say the program's low profile is not part of an effort to keep dutiful ticket-payers in the dark. ''Since this is offered to everyone universally, it was not as necessary'' to publicize it, said Owen Stone, a spokesman for the city's Department of Finance, which runs all parking ticket adjudication programs. 
 Mr. Stone said the settlements, which function like plea bargains in a court setting, have worked to reduce administrative overhead in areas like the five hearing centers. More than half the drivers who challenge tickets now agree to forgo a hearing and plead guilty in exchange for a reduced fine, he said.
 That has allowed the city to pare its stable of parking judges by nearly half, from an average of 222 in 2005 to an average of 128 this year. As a result, the city now spends about $2 million less on administrative costs each year than it did before the program began.
 The city has separate settlement programs for commercial vehicles that are meant to ease payment and also have helped to reduce hearing costs. Delivery companies that enroll, for example, waive their right to a hearing or an appeal, and have all of their fines reduced, in many cases to zero, depending on the severity and location of the infraction.
 City officials say that if the number of people challenging tickets, and getting the discounts, were to rise substantially and affect the economic viability of the program, the city could always just cancel it. ''It is unlikely that we would ever reach that tipping point,'' Mr. Stone said. 
 Currently, city statistics show that 13 percent of individuals who receive parking tickets end up challenging them, a proportion that is unchanged since the settlement program was introduced.
 ''It's not like we rolled it out and everyone came running in for hearings,'' said Mary Gotsopoulis, the chief administrative law judge for the city's Parking Violations Bureau, which adjudicates tickets.
 Chris Nellen, an unemployed copywriter, said if he had known about the program he would have challenged a ticket he received on Oct. 24.
 Mr. Nellen, 40, said he had pulled his gray 2008 Toyota into a space near his girlfriend's house in Park Slope, Brooklyn, that morning. He had not gotten a ticket in years and had not seen a sign down the block prohibiting parking for street cleaning from 7:30 to 8 a.m., so he said he was shocked to find a $45 ticket on the car when he returned. But he paid the ticket (and a $2 service fee) without protest to avoid further frustration.
 Mr. Nellen said he did not think a possible fine reduction was worth waiting for a hearing with a judge. But had he known an automatic reduction by a clerk was available, it would have been different. ''If I could walk in and walk out, absolutely!'' he said.
 Ms. Gotsopoulis said that the efficiency of the hearing system has improved because a large slice of those who once waited for judges are now being dealt with by clerks, reducing the waiting time.
 ''You can come in during your lunch time and get service within that hour,'' she said. ''Prior to the settlements, hearings by mail took a number of months before you would get decisions. Now, you can get a decision in two to four weeks.''
 The clerks who work in the settlement program use a set schedule of fine reductions, which are tied to the severity of the infraction. For certain tickets, like parking at a fire hydrant, no settlement is possible. People who challenge a ticket by mail, or online, are given the same option after they request a hearing.
 Those who challenge a ticket also learn about some new rules that govern the hearing process: Judges no longer have the discretion to reduce fines. They can either find a driver guilty or dismiss the ticket. They are no longer able to set lenient fines for people who seek to plead ''guilty with an explanation.'' 
 The city says using a fine reduction schedule, instead of judicial discretion, creates a fairer, more uniform adjudication process. Officials also estimate that they are collecting more in fines with the reduction schedule because judges actually dismissed more tickets and gave greater reductions under the old system.
 But the change to a set schedule has rankled some critics, who say it deprives citizens of due process and casts clerks in the role of judges. 
 ''When they offered the settlement, they touted customer service,'' said Ruth Kraft, a former law professor at New York University who was an administrative law judge for the city's Parking Violations Bureau for nine years. ''Customer service should not trump due process.''
 Discounts do produce smiles, though, as was evident one recent morning at the Manhattan business center. Two of the six drivers waiting in the line at one point agreed to accept the clerk's offer of a settlement. One of them was Brigitte Alexander, who had come to fight her tickets because she had received two within nine minutes.
 ''To me, it was the principle,'' she said. The clerk examined Ms. Alexander's tickets and saw that the address on one was unreadable.
 Dismissed.
 On the second, the clerk offered to reduce the fine to $43 from $65.
 Done.
 Ms. Alexander's total cost fell to $43 from $130.
 Another satisfied bargain shopper.
 ''The line moved quickly, it was efficient,'' Ms. Alexander said. All in all, a good experience that she characterized as ''nicer than the post office.''

HEADLINE: Out With The Knit, In With The Wine

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO

 BODY:
IT was an especially cacophonous ''Auld Lang Syne.'' But for the Knitting Factory's last night in Manhattan, it was appropriate, as the shaggy avant-folk group Akron/Family led a version of that Scottish New Year's hymn on Wednesday night that mutated from a simple singalong to screeching feedback to a meditative one-note drone.
The Knitting Factory has been celebrating noise and eclecticism ever since it opened on East Houston Street in 1987, and in its earlier days the club gained renown as a defining stage for downtown music, that clamorous and unclassifiable New York amalgam of jazz, punk, art-rock and every kind of experimentation. 
But once again an arty Manhattan outpost has become a victim of the neighborhood renewal it helped to foster. The Knitting Factory, which moved to Leonard Street in TriBeCa in 1994, can no longer afford the area's rising rents and will reopen in May in a considerably smaller and less expensive space in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
This real-estate drama, however, has a twist: one of the area's gentrifiers is a stylish new restaurant and performance space opened by Michael Dorf, the founder of the Knitting Factory. New Year's Eve also served as the debut of City Winery, on Varick Street in the South Village nearby, with a performance by Joan Osborne, and the two concerts could hardly have been more different.
At the Knitting Factory, where the dominant color was, as it has always been, black, a bohemian young audience sweated out the night in sardine closeness, with about a dozen acts performing on three floors. A note slapped above the second-floor bar read simply ''PBR can $3.'' At the spacious, golden-hued City Winery, Ms. Osborne sang bluesy soft rock in a crimson gown, and the sold-out crowd -- many of whom looked as though they could well have been the parents of the Knitting Factory clientele -- sat comfortably at tables and ordered from a list of 500 wines.
Mr. Dorf, who ran the Knitting Factory from its opening until he left the company in 2003, has said City Winery is intended for music fans who have outgrown their dive-bar phase and prefer a more elegant night out. There is warm lighting and table seating for 350. Mr. Dorf's $5 million establishment allows for every step of the winemaking process to occur on the premises, he said, from the crushing of the grapes to fermentation and aging. A membership program gives customers their own barrel in the basement; clients include Lou Reed, a longtime friend to the Knitting Factory.
Kerianne Flynn, 41, who lives nearby in TriBeCa, said she signed up her husband, James, for a barrel for his birthday.
''There's really nothing this sophisticated in the city,'' Ms. Flynn said, ''where you can see live music and have great wine, great food, and be with grown-ups.''
At the Knitting Factory, revelers seemed perfectly happy to be not so grown up, as fan after fan climbed onstage during Akron/Family's set to get in one last stage dive.
In recent years some critics have complained that the Knitting Factory's programming has suffered as it moved further from its experimental origins. But Wednesday's show was a classic example of the club's wide-ranging and progressive taste.
Akron/Family, which made its reputation in Brooklyn and whose members are now split between New York and Pennsylvania, headlined an evening with Deerhoof, a sprightly and unpredictable art-pop band from San Francisco; Dirty Projectors, one of the leaders of a renaissance of experimental rock in Brooklyn; and Deer Tick, the nom de plume of the alt-country songwriter John McCauley.
''It's very much a storied place,'' Courtney Harkins, 19, said. ''I wanted to see it before it goes away,'' she added, pulling a flier from the wall as the club was closing just before 2 a.m., its floor a mush of spilled beer and fallen confetti.
When the Knitting Factory opened in TriBeCa, the area still had remnants of its past as an artist-colonized wasteland. But in recent years the club has sometimes clashed with the upscale new residents and businesses.
''People think they want music and arts and entertainment,'' said Morgan Margolis, a longtime employee who was recently named president of the parent company, Knitting Factory Entertainment. ''They think that until they buy a $3 million loft and there's a line of 400 kids outside a rock club downstairs.''
Mr. Margolis, whose father is the actor Mark Margolis (''Requiem for a Dream''), grew up in TriBeCa, and the scene he describes of his childhood home is almost unrecognizable today. ''It was empty,'' he said. ''You could play ball in the streets. It was a great place to grow up.''
Today, of course, Manhattan rents have forced most of the rock 'n' roll crowd to Brooklyn, where new clubs sprout up regularly; one, the Bell House, opened in Gowanus in September.
The Knitting Factory itself has also expanded far beyond TriBeCa. In 2000 it opened a sister club in Los Angeles, and two years ago it took over large clubs in Boise, Idaho, and Spokane, Wash., which have lately been providing the company with a large portion of its revenue. Mr. Margolis will be based in Los Angeles; the main business offices of Knitting Factory Entertainment are in Boise.
In Brooklyn, the Knitting Factory is taking over the former Luna Lounge, on Metropolitan Avenue in Williamsburg. The club will have a capacity of around 200, which should remove it from the fierce competition among midsize spaces (the main room in TriBeCa held 400 people), but also move it farther from the spotlight.
Patrons on New Year's Eve bemoaned the loss of the TriBeCa club but were hardly surprised by its need to move out of Manhattan. Some were already predicting the next relocation.
''The gentrification in Lower Manhattan is happening in Brooklyn now, too,'' said Tim Hiles, 31, who came down from Providence, R.I., for the show. ''Even though they're moving to Brooklyn, 10 years later they'll probably have to move somewhere else.''

NAUTICAL PACK RAT
 And Sea Dog in Chief
 Franklin Delano Roosevelt's policy and life have been much studied recently, in shows at the New-York Historical Society in Manhattan and the Presidential Library and Museum in Hyde Park, N.Y. A more relaxed view of the president and his passion for collecting seafaring memorabilia is the subject of a third exhibition that is well worth a visit. 
 Throughout much of his life Roosevelt bought ship models, nautical prints and paintings, scrimshaw, relics, naval documents, autograph letters and books on naval and maritime subjects. More than 75 examples from his collection, including 30 ship models, can be seen in ''Treasures of a President: FDR and the Sea,'' at the South Street Seaport Museum in Lower Manhattan through 2009. 
 In addition to his own ice boats, sailboats and yachts, Roosevelt became familiar with dispatch boats, patrol boats, battleships, transport ships and cruisers while assistant secretary of the Navy under President Woodrow Wilson. The show has several models of Navy ships, including a gift from the Navy: 11 miniature models of combat vessels from World War II designed to teach Navy personnel how to recognize ships. 
 Another model, of the S.S. John Bidwell, represents the more than 2,700 cargo ships known as Liberty ships commissioned by Roosevelt in the early 1940s for the Merchant Marine to supply the Allies and American forces.
 ''The importance of Roosevelt's collection is that it gave him the opportunity to be released from his day-to-day activities and immerse himself on another plane,'' said Cynthia M. Koch, director of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum, the lender to the show. ''He worked on his collections daily throughout his life.'' Dr. Koch organized the show with Mary Ellen Pelzer, director of the Seaport museum, which restored 23 of the ship models.
 The artifacts are surrounded with photos and clips from family home movies. One 1888 photo, of the 6-year-old Franklin in a sailor suit at the helm of his father's yacht, is displayed not far from a sketch of a sailboat, not at all bad, that Franklin drew at 5.
 Photographs taken during his presidency record both historic events (Roosevelt meeting Winston Churchill on H.M.S. Prince of Wales during the August 1941 Atlantic Charter meeting in the North Atlantic) and poignant moments: the president at the wheel of a sloop, Amberjack II, in June 1933, en route from Massachusetts to his family's summer home on Campobello Island off the coast of Maine. (What did he do after his first 100 days in office, exhausted from trying to solve the country's great financial crisis? He went sailing.)
 ''Despite the fact that in 1921 polio left Roosevelt unable to walk or even stand on his own, it did not keep him from his first love -- the sea,'' Robert F. Cross, an authority on Roosevelt's naval history, writes in the fall issue of Seaport magazine, published by the museum. ''After 1921, being at the helm of a sailboat was really the only circumstance in which FDR's disability was irrelevant.'' 
 Roosevelt, whose ancestors included whalers, shipbuilders and sea captains, acquired ephemera documenting his family's history at sea.
 An 1862 ship log from the clipper Surprise, for example, lists Roosevelt's maternal grandmother, Catherine Robbins Lyman Delano and six of her children (including Roosevelt's mother, Sara), as passengers on the trip from New York to Hong Kong. Roosevelt's maternal grandfather, Warren Delano II, made a fortune trading in tea and opium in China, and the family lived there for years. That business was the foundation of the family's wealth.
 Other ship models include Pardon Me, a wooden speedboat made by a prison inmate as a gift, and France, a model submarine Charles de Gaulle gave him in 1944. The president promptly tested the sub in the Washington boat basin, watching with delight as it submerged and launched torpedoes. 
 Information on ''Treasures of a President'' can be found at southstreetseaportmuseum.org.
 SOUTH SEA BUBBLE SPOOF
 Christie's Jan. 21 sale of Chinese export porcelain has a rare set of six plates that satirize the collapse of the South Sea Company in 1720, a financial disaster with clear parallels to the present.
 ''When the company collapsed, governments were almost ruined, and the English had to step in and restore the banking system,'' said Becky MacGuire, the porcelain specialist at Christie's.
 The South Sea Company, despite its name, was an English enterprise trying to mine gold in South America -- without any success. It attracted speculators from all over Europe.
 ''Company stock traded at $:128 in January 1720 before reaching $:550 in May and peaking at $:1,050 in late June, when the sell-off began,'' reads the entry in Christie's catalog. ''By August individuals and institutions alike had been destroyed.''
 Chinese potters copied prints from Europe on the plates that depict buffoonlike Harlequin figures from the popular commedia dell'arte. 
 ''Instead of New Yorker cartoons, they had plates to satirize the high and mighty,'' Ms. MacGuire said. The estimate for the set is $40,000 to $60,000.
 LAST CHANCE
 There's still time to catch the intriguing exhibition about the most revered fall flower of Japan. ''The Chrysanthemum in Japanese Art,'' at the LuEsther T. Mertz Library of the New York Botanical Garden, in on view through Jan. 11. 
 With only 32 objects, the show explores how artists have portrayed the kiku, or chrysanthemum, the emblem of the Japanese imperial family, over four centuries in woodcut prints, hanging scroll paintings, screens, ceramics, metalwork and textiles.
 The flower became a symbol of longevity after the Japanese adopted the Chinese legend of the Chrysanthemum Boy, a youth banished from the Chinese Imperial court who attains a long life in exile by drinking the dew from mums in the mountains.
 The exiled boy is beautifully depicted on hanging scrolls, but the legend is also alluded to in simple designs depicting only dipper, stream and chrysanthemum -- variations that are well explained in the excellent catalog by the curators Miyeko Murase and Stephanie Wada.

 ASIA SOCIETY AND MUSEUM: 'ART AND CHINA'S REVOLUTION,' through Jan. 11. The splashy party that was the 2008 Olympics is yesterday's news, but one-party rule in China remains. New China is still, in significant ways, Old China. The obvious question is: What comes next? To help answer it, Asia Society asks a different, equally timely post-Olympics question: What came before? This exhibition of paintings, drawings, posters and Maoist souvenirs produced in the years leading up to and during the Cultural Revolution gives complicated answers. It lays out the conflicted loyalties that have shaped contemporary China, and finds them in the work of artists who anticipated the current art boom and are part of it. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400, asiasociety.org. (Holland Cotter) 
 BARD GRADUATE CENTER: 'ENGLISH EMBROIDERY FROM THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART, 1580-1700,' through April 12. At once revelatory and great fun, this exhibition examines one of the world's most beloved and ancient art forms/crafts/hobbies during one of its golden ages, a time that included mind-boggling turmoil. Given the beheadings, regime changes and warring ethnic and religious factions -- outlined in the show's exemplary catalog -- it is a miracle that anybody had time for anything, much less great needlework. But it was a leading indicator of wealth and status, a means of decoration, a form of moral instruction and a sign of wifely devotion. Glass beads, pearls, raised work, applique and striped ribbons mix with an intimidating array of stitches for effects that are never less than stunning. Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design and Culture, 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000, bgc.bard.edu. 
 (Roberta Smith)BRONX MUSEUM OF THE ARTS: 'STREET ART STREET LIFE: FROM THE 1950S TO NOW,' through Jan. 25. If to you ''street life'' means noise-lights-action, you'll find this show a surprise. With its immaculate, stripped-down installation, the exhibition is clearly devoted not to recreating the feel of art on the street, but to recording it, from Robert Frank's unvarnished photographic views of post-World War II America to digital montages by Fatimah Tuggar uniting today's streets of New York and Lagos, Nigeria. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. (Cotter)
 COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'HOUSE PROUD: 19TH-CENTURY WATERCOLOR INTERIORS FROM THE THAW COLLECTION,' through Jan. 25. The 70 or so jewel-like renderings of rooms and their furnishings here are delightful, mordantly signifying artifacts. They track the domestic effects of exoticism and nostalgia (chinoiserie, Gothic Revival); uncover glimmers of modernity (Biedermeier, smaller rooms); and witness the birth of the contemporary genre known as shelter porn. Accompanied by relevant examples of furniture, decorative objects and books, they also reveal that rooms seen whole, with light and space as well as decor carefully depicted, are among painting's most appealing subjects. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Smith)
 * FRICK COLLECTION: 'ANDREA RICCIO: RENAISSANCE MASTER OF BRONZE,' through Jan. 18. Scholars say that Andrea Riccio was one of the greatest sculptors of the Italian Renaissance. Cast in dark bronze and resembling Roman antiquities, Riccio's small-scale statuettes, reliefs and oil lamps seem unremarkably modest at first. But let your eyes adjust to the formal subtlety, expressive urgency and almost supernatural aliveness of his art, and you will fall in love. Sculpture does not get much better than this. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Ken Johnson)
 THE JEWISH MUSEUM: 'CHAGALL AND THE ARTISTS OF THE RUSSIAN JEWISH THEATER, 1919-1949,' through March 22. A fascinating tale of two vanguard theater companies that flourished in Moscow for a few years after the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 is told by this big, walk-in scrapbook of a show presenting more than 200 pieces of art and ephemera. Exploring the histories of the Hebrew-speaking Habima theater and the Yiddish-speaking Moscow State Yiddish Theater, the exhibition includes drawings, paintings, photographs, posters, sheet music, costumes and clips from vintage films. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Johnson)
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE PHILIPPE DE MONTEBELLO YEARS: CURATORS CELEBRATE THREE DECADES OF ACQUISITIONS,' through Feb. 1. As the title implies, the show is a tribute to Mr. de Montebello, who is leaving the Met after being director for more than 30 years. For the occasion, curators in 17 of the museum departments have chosen objects in their fields of expertise from the permanent collection. There are marvelous things here, from Chinese scrolls, Greek vessels and Oceanic effigies to Byzantine icons and an 18th-century American pickle-holder. In short, a wonder-cabinet situation. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
 MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'SECOND LIVES: REMIXING THE ORDINARY,' through April 19. The inaugural show in the Museum of Arts and Design's jewel-box-like building continues its haphazard segue from a concentration on craft to a hipper, more wide-ranging program. Unfortunately, the focus is a strategy that is epidemic in the larger art world: the massing of something small (plastic spoons, ladies pumps, spools of thread, dangling eyeglasses) into something large (a pyramid, a loveseat, a view of the ''Mona Lisa,'' a chandelier). It is Surrealism 101, descended from Meret Oppenheim's beloved and far too influential fur-lined teacup. Basically, you see the thing. You see the things it is made of. Something in the way of a punch line follows. 2 Columbus Circle, (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Smith)
 MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY AFRICAN DIASPORAN ARTS: 'I AM A MAN,' through Jan. 18. The words that make up the title of this strong, timely group show were emblazoned on placards carried by striking black workers in Birmingham, Ala., in 1968. But the show turns the original assertion into a question: What does it mean to be an African-American male today? A smart, Pop-style painting by Fahamu Pecou sends up stereotypes of sexual prowess; a video by Lorenzo Steele Jr. looks at prison life from the inside; Jefferson Pinder casts his sights back to the civil rights movement's espousal of passive resistance in a video piece that illustrates that ideal in action. The written statements by each artist are well worth reading. 80 Hanson Place, at South Portland Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0492, mocada.org. (Cotter)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'JOAN MIRO: PAINTING AND ANTI-PAINTING 1927-1937,' through Jan. 12. When, in 1927, Joan Miro said, ''I want to assassinate painting,'' he wasn't saying anything new. What was new was the way he carried out his self-assigned, cut-throat task. And that process is the subject of this invigorating, absorbing and -- Miro would be mortified -- beautiful show. It illustrates, step by step, how he stalked and attacked painting -- zapped its conventions, messed up its history, spoiled its market value -- through distinctive groups of experimental works produced over a decade. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)
 THE NEW MUSEUM: 'MARY HEILMANN: TO BE SOMEONE,' through Jan. 26. Over the past four decades Ms. Heilmann has been painting with an infectious joie de vivre. Working with big brushes and generous quantities of paint, she continues to produce wildly colorful abstractions that riff with irreverent verve on basic elements of Modernist painting: the grid, the monochromatic rectangle, stripes, organic forms, linear webs, spots, checks and drips. This exhilarating retrospective presents works dating from 1967 to the present. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Johnson)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'ALEXANDER CALDER: THE PARIS YEARS, 1926-1933,' through Feb. 15. Is art glorified child's play, extending into adulthood, through a lifetime, picking up ideas and gaining finesse as it goes? That's one way to think of this exhibition, which focuses intently on one artist's child-within embodied in toys, cartoons and wire figures, with the Whitney's famous ''Calder's Circus'' as a centerpiece and a grown-up modernist surprise at the end. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)

 'FRANKENTHALER AT EIGHTY: SIX DECADES'Helen Frankenthaler's longtime gallery is giving her an 80th-birthday party. With nine large-scale works from the artist's personal collection, covering more than five decades, the show takes the form of a mini-retrospective. (A more substantial museum survey is long overdue.) The earliest work is ''Western Dream,'' a maelstrom of lavender-and-coral stains on unprimed canvas; the newest is ''Warming Trend,'' a near-monochrome field of indigo with fiery undertones. Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550, knoedlergallery.com, through Jan. 10. (Karen Rosenberg)
 'NEIL JENNEY: NEW PAINTINGS' With the works in this beautiful show, his first exhibition of new paintings in New York since 1998, Neil Jenney continues to create idiosyncratic landscapes with heavy black frames. Most surprising are two paintings of luminous blue skies with puffy, animal-shaped clouds in them and the word ''Atmosphere'' neatly lettered on each frame. Barbara Mathes Gallery, 22 East 80th Street, (212) 570-4190, bmathesgallery.com, through Jan. 24. (Johnson)
 Galleries: SoHo
 MATT MULLICAN: 'A DRAWING TRANSLATES THE WAY OF THINKING' Drawing for Mr. Mullican is a note-taking tool in a vast program of semiotic research. Much of the material displayed in this intermittently intriguing exhibition of more than 200 drawings, collages, photographs, watercolors and notebooks will mean less to the average viewer than it presumably does to the artist himself. A fascinating video of a Paul McCarthy-style performance suggests that Mr. Mullican is most interesting as a kind of highbrow clown. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org, through Feb. 5. (Johnson)
 CHARLOTTE POSENENSKE: 'PROTOTYPES FOR MASS PRODUCTION (1965-1967)' The works in this exhibition -- simple geometric forms made of folded sheet metal and painted in black and primary-colored enamels -- were intended to be mass-produced, sold at cost and displayed in public. Ms. Posenenske quit making art in 1968 when she concluded that it could not make enough of a political difference in the world, but her sculptures still have a bright, Pop Art-like punch. Peter Freeman, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 966-5154, peterfreemaninc.com, through Jan. 10. (Johnson)
 Galleries: Chelsea
 AL HELD An awesome blast of light, color, space and geometry awaits visitors to this exhibition of six paintings dating from 1979 to 1985 by Mr. Held (1928-2005). Rendered in richly saturated and incandescent colors, these expansive, hard-edged pictures of grids, boxes, wheels and serpentine loops, interpenetrating and receding into infinite, Euclidean distances, are like visions of a neo-
 Platonist on acid. Paul Kasmin Gallery, 293 10th Avenue, at 27th Street, (212) 563-4474, paulkasmingallery.com, through Jan. 10. (Johnson)
 Out of Town
 MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS, BOSTON: 'RACHEL WHITEREAD: PLACE (VILLAGE),' through Jan. 25. This exhibition, the centerpiece of the museum's mini-survey devoted to the British sculptor Rachel Whiteread, may strike the artist's admirers as a bizarre and kitschy departure. Viewers who have never seen one of her room-size casts won't really get a sense of her work from this installation, which is making its United States debut. Still, the show, which includes drawings and a few smaller sculptures, reveals the more emotive side of an artist who can come off as somber and humorless. 465 Huntington Avenue, (617) 267-9300, mfa.org. (Rosenberg)
 Last Chance
 BALTIMORE MUSEUM OF ART: 'FRANZ WEST: TO BUILD A HOUSE YOU START WITH THE ROOF: WORK, 1972-2008' This influential Austrian godfather of the lately popular grunge aesthetic has his first major American museum show. The exhibition includes crusty abstractions made of plaster and papier-mache; ribald anticonsumerist collages; low-tech furniture and light sculptures; and, best of all, big, colorful, abstract works made of welded-together aluminum patches that mischievously subvert the monumental pretensions of conventional public sculpture. Mr. West is ostensibly a populist artist, but he is really a coolly sophisticated hipster. 10 Art Museum Drive, at North Charles and 31st Streets, (443) 573-1700, artbma.org; closes on Sunday. (Johnson)
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'JESPER JUST: ROMANTIC DELUSIONS' An enchanting show of four short films exhibits most of the qualities for which Mr. Just has become known since completing his studies at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 2003. Melodramatic but never campy or over the top and made with Hollywood-quality production values, his brief musicals explore vulnerable, ordinarily well-armored zones of the masculine psyche, like grief, same-sex love, Oedipal conflict and spiritual desire. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Johnson)
 AMY GRANAT In her latest exhibition, the film artist Amy Granat has transferred her penchant for randomness to a series of photograms made using mysterious-looking objects (mostly from her purse) and oddly cut sheets of photo paper. They propose the creative process as a darkroom tussle among unknown forces. The show's centerpiece -- an exquisite three-channel film installation -- is more deliberately choreographed. A Day of the Dead skull of indeterminate size is the subject of a mercurial six-minute film that is screened using different methods and scales. Legibility and other contrasts fluctuate with the changing daylight. An extraordinarily simple and beautiful meditation on life, death and structuralism unfolds. Broadway 1602, 1182 Broadway, at 28th Street, Apartment 1602, Chelsea, (212) 481-0362, broadway1602.com; closes on Saturday. (Smith)
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM:
 'THEANYSPACEWHATEVER' The innately sculptural Guggenheim mounts the first major exhibition in this country about relational aesthetics -- probably the most radical art to emerge in the 1990s -- and comes up looking, well, remarkably empty, which is also extraordinarily beautiful in its own Wright. The more or less interactive works by 10 artists invite you to experience in a new way time, space, the art-viewing world and the museum itself. Even if you never want to see the museum going this far out again, the Guggenheim must be credited for bringing the latest art remarkably intact to a larger public. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org; closes on Wednesday. (Smith)
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'CATHERINE OPIE: AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHER' Catherine Opie is many artists in one. Best known in the 1990s for her striking portraits of gay, lesbian and transgendered men and women drawn from a circle of friends and intimates, she is also a photographer of landscapes, cityscapes, architecture, still lifes and lifestyles. She is an insider and an outsider: a documentarian and a provocateur, a classicist and a maverick; a trekker and a stay-at-home; a lesbian feminist mother who resists the gay mainstream. It's all here in a fine retrospective. (See above.) Closes on Wednesday. 
 (Cotter) INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'AMERICA AND THE TINTYPE' This show about the tintype, an early form of photograph made by exposing a lacquered iron plate to light, includes some 200 examples from the museum's collection. Most of the artists, and subjects, are unidentified. These works form a group portrait of Americans, mostly working- and middle-class, struggling to adapt to the rapidly shifting social and economic conditions during the four decades after the Civil War. The exhibition makes the most of the tintype's range of subject matter and emotion, from postmortem shots to vaudevillian caricatures, freedmen to minstrels. It does not dispute the daguerreotype's superior potentials for artistry but simply asserts that tintypes have been unfairly overlooked because of their ubiquity, affordability and anonymity. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org; closes on Sunday. 
 (Rosenberg) 
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'LANDSCAPES CLEAR AND RADIANT: THE ART OF WANG HUI (1632-1717)' The Met's first solo show devoted to a Chinese master is gorgeous and revelatory; its focus is the landscape virtuoso Wang Hui, star of the 17th-century Chinese art scene. Wang could do anything and did, synthesizing and transforming disparate strands of almost a millennium of Chinese painting, but also making exact copies of earlier masterpieces. Distinguished by a Mozart-like ease and perfection, his work unsettles Western notions of copy, original and originality. It is aided in this by displays of works by 16 earlier artists dating to the 10th century -- his mentors, his mentors' mentors and the artists they all revered -- which form a dazzling introduction to Chinese painting in general. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith)
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'DRAWING BABAR: EARLY DRAFTS AND WATERCOLORS' The first and most brilliant Babar book (''The Story of Babar'') gets its own gallery in which Jean de Brunhoff's familiar story is illustrated by his sketches and drafts -- a room bound to fascinate children and the adults who read to them. Another is devoted to the first Babar book by Jean's son, Laurent (''Babar's Cousin''), who first heard about the elephant in the green suit in bedtime stories. In this compact, elegant exhibition, we don't learn a lot about the reasons for Babar's appeal. Speculation is restrained, and simple demonstration preferred, an approach in keeping with Jean's spare, precise narrative and laconic illustration, in which diverging lines of dots become tears; angled eyebrows signal anger; and the varied curves of an elephant's trunk evoke an inner life. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org; closes on Sunday. (Edward Rothstein)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'VAN GOGH AND THE COLORS OF THE NIGHT' This small, anomalous exhibition is a Van Gogh antiblockbuster with a seemingly counterintuitive theme, given the importance of the brilliant light of southern France to his art. It explores Van Gogh's special relationship with darkness, where his interests in perception, color and symbolism fuse with unexpected intensity. And seeing a manageable number of Van Goghs -- including masterpieces like ''The Potato Eaters,'' ''The Starry Night'' and ''Night Cafe'' -- in intimate galleries is thrilling. (212) 708-9400, moma.org; closes on Monday. (Smith)
 NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: 'GEORGE TOOKER: A RETROSPECTIVE' George Tooker has painted some of the 20th century's most memorable images of angst. With its lost souls haunting the New York underground, ''Subway'' (1950) envisions modernity as a spiritual prison system. The Kafkaesque ''Government Bureau'' (1956) pictures an office of seemingly infinite dimensions, where people wait like penitents at the windows of terminally unresponsive bureaucrats. Both paintings are included in this richly affecting five-decade career retrospective. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org; closes on Sunday. (Johnson)
 YALE CENTER FOR BRITISH ART: 'SUN, WIND AND RAIN: THE ART OF DAVID COX' Watercolor was all the rage in early-19th-century England, and one of its most admired practitioners is the subject of this expansive, engaging show. Cox had a particular knack for picturing windy days, and the liveliness of his scenes is reflected in his vigorously realist style. Many of his most affecting pictures show ordinary travelers making their ways toward distant, unseen goals within the picture. Life is a journey. 1080 Chapel Street, New Haven, (877) 274-8278, yale.edu/ycba; closes on Sunday. (Johnson)

HEADLINE: Teams Trying To Avoid Blackout

BYLINE: By JOSHUA ROBINSON

 BODY:
Many N.F.L. fans are consulting on-line auction sites, casual acquaintances and possibly their bank managers in the pursuit of playoff tickets, but the Arizona Cardinals and the Minnesota Vikings are still struggling to fill their stadiums for this weekend's wild-card games. If they fall short, the games will not be shown on local television. 
 The Vikings said Thursday night that they were 8,000 tickets short of a sellout, and the Cardinals need to sell 3,700. Normally, a team must register a sellout 72 hours before kickoff to have its game broadcast locally. But because of factors like the New Year's holiday and the distressed economy, the league has granted extensions to both teams. 
 The Vikings, who play the Eagles on Sunday, have until Friday afternoon, and the Cardinals, who play the Falcons on Saturday, required a second 24-hour extension Thursday. 
 Greg Aiello, an N.F.L. spokesman, said wild-card weekend games are always ''the most challenging'' sales of the playoffs, primarily because of the late scheduling. Traditionally, Aiello said, if they are close enough to a sellout, the teams work with their sponsors to buy the remaining tickets.
 The Cardinals and the Vikings seemed confident that they would meet the requirements. 
 ''There's no reason to have a Plan B,'' Ron Minegar, the Cardinals' executive vice president and chief operating officer, said in a telephone interview. ''In spite of all those challenges, we've been really happy with how the public has responded.'' 
 Steve LaCroix, the Vikings' vice president for sales and marketing, said the economic downturn had become a consideration this season. But, he added, it was not a major concern this weekend with tickets starting at $30 and with the league's decision to reduce the price of playoff tickets by 10 percent. 
 The Cardinals have sold out each of their 30 games since moving to University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Ariz.
 The Vikings, who play at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, have a streak of 114 consecutive sellouts since 1998, which includes their last home playoff game eight years ago. 
 ''The Metrodome can get very loud and really give us a home-field advantage,'' LaCroix said, ''so it's critical that we keep it packed with purple versus Eagles fans in green.'' 
 He has good reason to be worried. The Eagles have started an equally aggressive online campaign with the front of their Web page telling fans that tickets are still available and instructing them, ''Let's turn Minnesota green.'' 
 The last playoff blackout came in the 2002 wild-card round, when games between the Ravens and the Dolphins and the Jets and the Raiders were not broadcast in the Miami and Oakland areas. 
 Perhaps the highest-profile victim of that rule was the wild-card game between the Buffalo Bills and the Houston Oilers in 1993.
 Because it was blacked out in Buffalo, Bills fans missed their team's 32-point comeback, which remains the largest in N.F.L. history.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 7, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about efforts by the Arizona Cardinals and the Minnesota Vikings to avoid a local television blackout of their N.F.L. playoff games because of sluggish ticket sales referred incorrectly, using information from the N.F.L., to previous playoff blackouts. As the article correctly noted, the Dolphins' game against the Baltimore Ravens was blacked out in the Miami area in 2002, but the Jets-Raiders game that year was not. (Both Arizona and Minnesota eventually sold enough tickets to avoid blackouts in their markets.)

HEADLINE: A Nevada Town Escapes the Slump, Thanks to Gold

BYLINE: By STEVE FRIESS

DATELINE: BATTLE MOUNTAIN, Nev. 

 BODY:
Hundreds of revelers crammed into this small town's community center on a recent Saturday night to celebrate the marriage of Bianca Hernandez and Jose Lomeli.
 Throngs danced to Spanish folk music well into the wee hours. Beer, wine and laughter were abundant, and several tables were piled high with gifts. ''It's not just the wedding,'' said a friend of the newlyweds, Jesse Dias, 34. ''Times are good around here. People are happy.''
 Good times? Happy people? Hasn't word of the national economic anxiety and resultant austerity made it to this remote high-desert capital of Lander County, 215 miles east of Reno? 
 Yes, it has, but the economic meltdown in much of the country has been a boon to the county and its 5,000 residents, 4,000 of whom live in the Battle Mountain area. 
 The reason: They mine gold in Lander County, a mineral-rich area that is a major reason Nevada, nicknamed the Silver State, is also the world's fourth biggest producer of gold. 
 And when the broader economy declines and the value of the dollar fluctuates, people buy gold. At current prices -- gold hit $892 an ounce on Monday, its highest price in three months and not that far off its record high of more than $1,000 an ounce in March -- places like Battle Mountain hum with good-paying jobs and rising home values, making the financial woes of the rest of the country a distant concern.
 ''I don't know of anybody who is getting foreclosed on; it's just not something that's an issue out here,'' Charlotte Thompson, 56, said, shrugging as she seated diners on a frigid, wind-swept evening at the Owl Club Casino and Restaurant, the main attraction of Battle Mountain's four-block main thoroughfare, Front Street. ''That's the way it usually goes, though. We're always opposite of the rest of the country.''
 To grasp how anomalous Battle Mountain is now, consider the data. Home foreclosures, as Ms. Thompson noted, are unheard of here, even though November was the 23rd consecutive month that Nevada had the nation's highest foreclosure rate.
 Unemployment in Lander County was 4.8 percent in November, while the statewide rate of 8 percent was the state's highest since 1984. Two goldless counties bordering Lander, Nye and Pershing, had unemployment rates in November of 10.5 percent and 8 percent, respectively.
 Even with annual salaries for average mining jobs starting at more than $60,000, the two largest mining companies in the area, Barrick and Newmont, cannot find enough qualified workers to fully staff their operations round-the-clock. Mr. Dias, the friend of the newlyweds, is working six days a week. 
 Robert Perry, a shift supervisor at Barrick's Pipeline Mine, a 12-year-old facility near Battle Mountain that yields about a million ounces of gold a year and is expected to continue to produce until 2014, said the mine was always interviewing and hiring people.
 ''Our housing market, I would say, is better than most, just because there are jobs around here,'' Mr. Perry said. ''My house I bought five years ago for $134,000, and right now it's worth about $300,000.''
 The gold-mining business is doing so well that industry lobbyists did not complain when the Nevada Legislature passed a measure in early December requiring mining companies to pay $28 million in 2009 taxes early to help the state patch a $340-million shortfall in revenue. 
 And Barrick is set to spend nearly $500 million to open a new mine near Pipeline, provided it wins a legal challenge by the Western Shoshone Indians, who assert that the mine would disturb the tribe's most sacred religious site.
 ''In tough times, people need a backup for their money, and that backup is gold,'' said Omar Jabara, a spokesman for the Newmont Mining Corporation, which operates eight Nevada mines that yielded 2.3 million ounces of gold in 2007.
 Battle Mountain residents are clearly enjoying the upswing, just as they clearly suffered through the high-tech boom of the late 1990s that brought prosperity to much of the rest of the nation. During that time, gold fell to about $215 an ounce, the local economy was moribund and several mines laid off workers. The Owl closed for four years, during which Ms. Thompson worked as a truck driver.
 ''We went 11 years without a new business really opening up here, but now we're getting a new furniture store, and there are some new commercial businesses opening that are mining-related,'' said Sarah Burkhart, director of the Battle Mountain Chamber of Commerce. ''We're getting a Family Dollar, and that's kind of a biggie for us because it's like a mini-Wal-Mart.'' (The nearest Wal-Mart is about 50 miles away in Winnemucca.) 
 These signs of prosperity are especially gratifying to residents who took umbrage at a 7,000-word cover article in The Washington Post Magazine in December 2001 in which the writer, Gene Weingarten, went searching for the ''armpit of America,'' and found it in Battle Mountain. Some town boosters, like Ms. Burkhart, used the national notoriety to organize three annual Armpit Festivals, sponsored by the deodorant-maker Old Spice, but others were insulted by the article and glad when the festivals were abandoned. 
 ''I think we ought to have a little more pride than that,'' said Kimberlie Davis, owner of Sage Homes, a company here that builds about 25 homes a year in Lander and neighboring counties. ''If that's all we have to market, then don't market it.''
 There is so little to see in Battle Mountain that the state's promotional map, Nevada Wide Open, designed to generate interest in tourism in the sparser, less-known regions of the state, does not highlight it. The town has no traffic lights. Besides two small casinos and one legal brothel that caters almost exclusively to truckers who crisscross the nation on Interstate 80, there is a pizza place, a coffee shop, a McDonald's and a Super 8 motel.
 ''Oh, we'll drive 75 miles to go get Chinese food,'' said Ms. Davis, 39, who moved here from Portland, Ore., in 1989 after visiting a childhood friend who had come here to be with her miner boyfriend. ''If you're going to the movies, that's 55 miles. It's an event. You make a big deal out of it. You give up conveniences of the big urban areas for a great deal of safety and comfort and a really nice place to raise your families.''
 The town's isolation and its dominant, blue-collar industry propel many of its disaffected young people to pursue college degrees.
 ''It's too small -- there's not enough opportunity as there is in a big city,'' said Ed Figueroa, 20, home for a holiday visit from the University of Nevada at Reno, where he is studying international business administration. ''There's nothing to do here. All our parents work at mines. I like to come back and see friends, but the town itself is ... whatever, you know?''
 Both Ms. Davis and Ms. Burkhart shrugged off such statements, citing numerous examples of Battle Mountain natives who do return, as Ms. Davis noted, ''after they swear they never will.''
 Most everyone here is concerned that a national economic recovery could drive gold prices down again. A Barrick spokesman, Louis A. Schack, agreed that it was a danger, but he noted that in the decade since the last major slump, gold had become a staple as an electrical conductor in things like cellphones and most high-tech wiring, boosting its value considerably. 
 Yet Mr. Schack acknowledged that commodity markets were unpredictable, so Ms. Davis and the rest of Battle Mountain know that slow times could return and are determined to enjoy their good fortune while it lasts.
 ''It's a very unique economy that exists out here,'' Ms. Davis said. ''I don't want the national economy to be awful by any stretch. I like a happy medium. There is a point when everything's even, when it's good here and good everywhere else, too, but it's very short lived.
 ''More than likely, gold's going to devalue and the cycle will start all over again.''

HEADLINE: Worldwide, a Bad Year Only Got Worse

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
After a catastrophic year for global markets, dazed investors are emerging from their shelters to ask if 2009 will be any better. The consensus among professionals? Do not expect the big rebound that usually follows a sharp downturn.
 Stocks lost 42 percent of their value in 2008, as calculated by the MSCI world index, erasing more than $29 trillion in value and all of the gains made since 2003. Just about the only assets to prosper were government bonds of developed countries and gold, where prices rose as investors ran for cover. 
 The year began with a shock, but only a previously lonely group of bears predicted the disaster to come. When Societe Generale lost 4.9 billion euros ($6.8 billion) in January on the unauthorized positions taken by a low-level trader, it seemed the year might already have its biggest financial news.
 But that loss would prove trivial compared with what happened afterward. The bad news never seemed to let up: Bear Stearns in the spring, then after a bit of a summer lull, the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in mid-September, the takeover of Merrill Lynch, the bailout of American International Group, the collapse of Bernard L. Madoff's business, the near-bankruptcy of General Motors. The names say it all for one of the most memorable years in financial history. 
 Many economists held out hope through the first half of the year that because of the rise of China and India and the growing might of the European Union, the rest of the world would escape the fallout of the American subprime mortgage crisis. 
 That hope -- ultimately dashed -- was never reflected in the markets. Even as economic data from Brussels and Beijing looked better than that from Washington, stocks in Europe and Asia were falling faster than their counterparts in the United States, partly because panicked dollar-based investors were repatriating their overseas investments. By the end of the year, the global economic picture was almost uniformly bad.
 The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 600 index, a measure of the broad European market, finished the year down 46 percent. The MSCI Asia-Pacific index fell 43 percent. United States stocks were not much better, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling 33.8 percent, its worst year since 1931, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 38.5 percent. 
 The last four months of 2008 stand out as truly terrible. Bank lending all but halted, and markets went into a tailspin that ended only when governments agreed to spend trillions of dollars bailing out the global financial system. 
 If the news from the developed world sounded bad, it was even worse for many emerging markets. The Shanghai composite index fell 65.4 percent, the Russian RTS index fell 72 percent and the Sensex 30 in Mumbai fell 52.4 percent.
 Looking for someplace comparatively safe? You would have needed the foresight to put your money into Bangladesh, where the main Dhaka stock index lost only 7.4 percent last year, or Venezuela, down the same amount.
 The events of the last year helped to remind stock investors that equities are just one part of the overall picture. Their importance was dwarfed by a handful of other markets, including credit default swaps, that had barely been on most investors' radar before the storm broke, not to mention the dreaded mortgage-backed securities game. What happens in those other markets will help to determine where stocks go. 
 Investors hoping that 2009 will be better point out that 2008 was marked by two major phenomena unlikely to be repeated: the near-collapse of the world financial system along with the subsequent de facto government takeover of many banks, and the extraordinary bubble in commodities prices that burst in the second half of the year.
 Oil prices peaked in July at more than $145 a barrel. At year's end, crude was trading slightly above $44 after falling to less than $40 a barrel. 
 The collapse of commodities prices helped to upend economies from Russia to Australia. 
 With credit markets thawing a bit but still operating far from normally, economies around the world are still deteriorating. 
 Where will the first signs of growth emerge? Some analysts predict that the United States economy, which fell into recession in December 2007 and is poised to receive a stimulus package from Washington of as much as $1 trillion over the next two years, might actually start to lead the world out of the downturn in the second half of the year. 
 But the continuing deterioration in the United States housing market, the struggles of the auto industry and layoffs almost everywhere serve as a reminder that the outlook for 2009 remains grim.
 The International Monetary Fund forecasts that developed economies will contract slightly in 2009, while overall world output will grow only 2.2 percent. The fund defines a global recession as growth below 3 percent, because that is far too weak to keep up with the demands of a growing population in emerging markets for jobs.
 At the same time, deleveraging -- the winnowing down of banks' troubled balance sheets -- continues to crimp lending. Consumer confidence in the United States and Europe has fallen to record lows.
 Nouriel Roubini, an economist who call the 2008 market disaster correctly, argued in a recent commentary that in 2009, global recession ''will morph into a stag-deflation, a deadly combination of economic stagnation/recession and deflation.''
 A shrinking economic pie is bad for stocks because corporate profits tend to fall, making equities appear more expensive. Analysts say corporate profit forecasts are probably still too high to accurately reflect the dimming economic prospects of 2009.
 Still, Julian Chillingworth, chief investment officer at Rathbone Unit Trust Management in London, said that investors were sitting on unusually large cash reserves, ''so if the news is bad, but not devastatingly bad, then you might well see a rally.'' Unfortunately, he added, any rally will likely turn out to be a ''false dawn'' until the economic picture begins to clear up. 
 ''The real bottom in most bear markets is when you go from capitulation'' -- when most investors simply give up hope -- ''to disinterest,'' he said. ''We haven't quite gotten there yet.''
 Philippe Gijsels, senior equity strategist at Fortis Global Markets in Brussels, predicted that 2009 would be ''the year of the big shakeout, a year of financial Darwinism, where the weak get weaker and the strong get stronger.'' 
 Many retailers, banks, commodity producers and pharmaceuticals companies ended 2008 barely hanging on, Mr. Gijsels said, making them ripe for acquisition. ''The people with the cash and the balance sheet strength will be able to do what they want,'' he said.
 In the long run, consolidation will help to create the conditions for the next bull market, he said, because it will mean that capital is being redirected to its most efficient uses. 
 Mr. Gijsels said it was possible that the market could begin to stabilize by late 2009 if there was clear evidence that the financial crisis was ending and there were signs that the United States housing market crash was nearing an end.
 If there is any hope for improvement, it is in the nearly unanimous mood of pessimism. Mr. Chillingworth said it was possible that ''we're all too depressed and the U.S. could kick into gear much faster than anyone now anticipates.''
 But ''no one is factoring that possibility into their calculations at the moment.''

HEADLINE: Should a College Degree Be Essential?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In ''Should the Obama Generation Drop Out?'' (Op-Ed, Dec. 28), Charles Murray argues that we should have more vocational schools and stop using a college degree as a requirement for jobs.
 These ''reforms'' would institute a class system in the United States on a par with that of Victorian England. 
 Under these proposals, bachelor's degrees would be restricted to the rich, regardless of qualifications, and the lucky few among the common people who possessed exceptional intellectual endowments. As for the rest, they would receive sufficient training to fill jobs with limited potential for upward mobility.
 Mr. Murray's proposals would actually intensify the importance of a prestigious degree -- necessary as it would be for entry into the highest occupational echelons. 
 This might be acceptable if eligibility for these degrees were based on merit alone. But under Mr. Murray's proposals, the rich would have unlimited access, while those less well off would have to compete for limited, subsidized spots in expensive institutions. If this is not a recipe for a closed, permanent upper class, I do not know what is.
 Charles Axilbund Los Angeles, Dec. 28, 2008
 To the Editor: 
 Charles Murray needs to recognize that the liberal arts degree, at its best, validates its holder as one who has skills needed for some of our biggest jobs.
 A good half of the liberal arts curriculum is about thinking analogically. The degree says this person has studied ''humane letters'' and so knows his or her way around a metaphor: how it opens up vistas, alters viewpoints, both frees and constrains thought and affects decisions.
 No one should try to motivate a work force, lead a corporation, plan military strategies or run a government who does not know how a metaphor works. 
 Math and science, the other half of the liberal arts curriculum, develop skills that are scarce, yet needed, in our society. They are all about knowing a fact from a factoid, reasoning from data to underlying patterns and practical implications, all while feeding careful observation through the strainer of valid logic. 
 The liberal arts degree says, or should say, here's someone who has skills we deeply, powerfully, urgently need.
 Jacques Jimenez Stamford, Conn., Dec. 28, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Devaluing the bachelor's degree would not help students who earn it or those who don't go to college. A bachelor's degree may indeed serve as a foot in the door for a recent graduate, but that's all it does. That graduate still has to show that he or she can do the job.
 The degree tells an employer that an applicant had the ability and perseverance to accomplish something.
 Charles Murray suggests that instead of degrees, we use ''certification tests, which would provide evidence that the applicant has acquired the skills the employer needs.'' This would amount to a postcollege SAT, when the precollege SAT has enough problems. 
 An employer takes a chance on any applicant, even one with a degree. There already are two-year colleges and technical training schools for people who can't or won't earn a four-year degree. 
 The responsible thing to do is to make sure that all students who have the ability to earn a degree aren't prevented from doing so by the cost.
 Jeff Adler Livingston, N.J., Dec. 28, 2008
 To the Editor:
 I recently graduated with a bachelor's degree in history and am now in law school, hoping to earn the degree that will lead to a paycheck. Though this will eventually pay my mortgage, my liberal arts education will be what sustains me emotionally, intellectually and in my relationships with other human beings.
 To say that young Americans are, for the most part, ''not smart enough to deal with college-level material'' and that we must scratch the bachelor's degree from our list of must-haves is to treat a symptom rather than the cause. 
 Employers must ask that their employees relate to one another and to the world around them; a broad, liberal education helps students to arrive at the point at which that kind of sympathy is possible. 
 Make college affordable, make it accessible, make it free, make it a requirement for employment. Don't accept defeat.
 Lillian Hoodes Chicago, Dec. 28, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Charles Murray's notion of discarding or de-emphasizing academic degrees as a job qualification in lieu of skills or ''what you know'' makes perfect sense. But let's not stop with postsecondary education.
 A greater emphasis on specific job skills in traditional high school education is needed.
 Language and mathematics will remain the pillars of our liberal academic institutions, but we also need carpenters, plumbers, electricians, machinists and more. Our schools should emphasize job skills for those not suited to traditional academic education.
 Larry Hoffner New York, Dec. 28, 2008
 The writer is a high school teacher.
 To the Editor:
 Finally, someone dared to say what every college professor knows in her heart: half the students in her classroom shouldn't be there and don't want to be there. 
 We have created this B.A.-B.S. grail for millions of students who would be far better educated if they could focus on something that they want to learn. 
 For 12 years, I was a professor of English at the flagship campus of a big state university. My students were majoring in computers, nursing, landscape design and kinesiology. They didn't care about ''Beowulf'' or John Milton. The university wanted them there, however, because more four-year graduates meant more money from the legislature. Now we can no longer tolerate such waste.
 We should redesign college curriculums so that students can study something useful, get a job and help redevelop the economy. 
 Rather than dumbing down ''hard'' courses, so that everyone picks up a smattering of knowledge they will never use, universities should offer challenging courses in students' majors. If that major takes three instead of four years to complete, that's fine. The goal is to become productive without wasting time or money.
 Sandra Sherman New York, Dec. 28, 2008
 The writer is assistant director of the Intellectual Property Law Institute, Fordham Law School. 
 To the Editor:
 Students who have battled for a bachelor's degree will have learned a valuable skill. It is unlikely that most of them will practice only one trade throughout their career. They will have to learn a range of skills that were unheard of when they were students. 
 Charles Murray should bless them for having learned how to learn. If they are thus armed, our economy will have a chance.

HEADLINE: Heart of U.S. Occupation Reverts to Iraqi Control

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON and STEPHEN FARRELL; Abeer Mohammed, Suadad al-Salhy and Riyadh Mohammed contributed reporting from Baghdad. Graham Bowley contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD 

 BODY:
The Green Zone, for nearly six years the headquarters of the American occupation of Iraq, passed from American to Iraqi control on Thursday, in a handover that was marked by two ceremonies of speeches, poems and music on a blustery cold day in Baghdad.
 The Iraqi flag was raised during a small ceremony at what had been the Republican Palace of Saddam Hussein attended by Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. 
 In a speech broadcast on state television, Mr. Maliki said that the handover had a special meaning for Iraqis. ''It means we have gotten rid of the most dangerous remains of the policies that the former regime adopted,'' he said.
 Later, on a street elsewhere in the 5.6-square-mile Green Zone, a second ceremony was attended by senior Iraqi security officials, including the defense minister, and senior American Army officers, including Lt. Gen, Lloyd J. Austin III, the second-highest ranking United States commander in Iraq. 
 At that ceremony, there were speeches about Iraq's readiness to take over responsibility of the Green Zone, children sang songs and a poem was read about Iraqi unity. An Iraqi marching band -- with bagpipes -- played the country's national anthem.
 Control of the Green Zone reverted to Iraqi control as part of the recent security agreement with the United States. 
 From Thursday, the Iraqis will decide, with input from the Americans, who gets which buildings, what parts should be opened up to the rest of Baghdad and who can go in and out. 
 Americans will even begin paying rent. 
 Several committees have been set up, consisting of both Iraqi and American officials, to study and administer these matters, though it appears that little will be done immediately. Because of the immense strides in security, the reality outside -- in the Red Zone, or, as soldiers call it, ''on the economy''-- is inching toward equilibrium with the reality inside, but it is not quite there yet.
 So while Iraqi soldiers now stand at checkpoints, Americans are still watching from nearby, and intelligence about a possible terrorist attack has made the checkpoints more stringent than usual this week, an Iraqi military spokesman said. 
 Plans to shrink the zone or open major thoroughfares, which could go a long way toward reducing Baghdad's strangling traffic, are promised but could be months away. 
 Americans have been moving out of buildings since 2006, though it has not been decided in many cases who is taking their place.
 No real estate transfer is as significant as that involving the Republican Palace, Saddam Hussein's lavish showpiece, captured and occupied in April 2003 by American troops. It was home to the Coalition Provisional Authority and, later, the American Embassy.
 The American diplomats have moved into the enormous yet austere new embassy nearby, but the decision on who gets the valuable palace is still under discussion. It will probably be Mr. Maliki, said several Iraqi officials. Or President Jalal Talabani, said several others. Or both. 
 Neither occupant -- one a Shiite, the other a Kurd, both involved in armed resistance against the Hussein government -- would be an agreeable sight for the man depicted on the huge portrait in relief that still remains, covered by a tarp, in the lobby of the palace.
 This portrait of Mr. Hussein as master architect is not the only reminder of his rule that has lingered in the nerve center of the new government. The country's most famous monument, though now inaccessible to most Iraqis, still dominates the Green Zone's skyline: the towering arches of crossed swords held aloft by forearms sculptured to resemble Mr. Hussein's own. Much less noticed is the tomb of Michel Aflaq, the founder of Mr. Hussein's Baath Party, which for a while was used by American troops as a gym and barracks.
 Despite the Green Zone's symbolic association with the American occupation, life inside the bubble is far from homogeneous.
 There are the American military and State Department minizones, where joggers, golf carts and duck-and-cover bunkers proliferate and parties take place, though with less abandon than in the early years. But there are also Iraqi high schools, an often startling firing range and a chaotic Iraqi taxi lot. 
 Alongside the Tigris lies Little Venice, a well-tended neighborhood of minicanals where senior Iraqi government officials live in residences once occupied by Mr. Hussein's closest aides. Other officials have made their homes in the rooms of the Hotel Rasheed, or in Green Zone neighborhoods where driveways are guarded by dark sport utility vehicles and civilian Humvees. 
 Many of the officials have complained that while they can come and go, relatives and guests cannot visit them without the same body searches and metal detectors awaiting every non-V.I.P. But that very complaint worries many of the other Iraqis who live and work in the Green Zone. 
 Some were already living in the area when their homes became engulfed by the zone; others moved in after 2003 as poor squatters or high officials; still others lived in violent neighborhoods in Baghdad and lined up for work every morning at the frequently bombed checkpoints.
 Despite repeated mortar and rocket attacks, the Green Zone has been a sanctuary for these Iraqis, who number in the thousands. Hearing from relatives during the worst years about life in Baghdad -- bloody and increasingly Islamist -- was like hearing news from another planet. 
 ''It feels like Kurdistan,'' said Nabez Jamal Shahrazurri, 35, a Kurd who works for the Presidency Council. With the transfer of control, he is doubtful it will stay that way.
 The impersonal efficiency of the American checkpoints, which has angered countless Iraqis, is, in Mr. Shahrazurri's view, the chief reason that security has been so well maintained. 
 ''The American forces only deal with badges,'' he said. ''They have no friends. The Iraqis have friends.''
 Iraqis in the zone tend to view Americans more positively than their counterparts who live or work outside it, but many have kept their association a secret for years, as a matter of survival. In interviews, they expressed a deep fear that the transfer of the Green Zone would leave them in danger.
 Some families are so terrified they are considering moving elsewhere, said Adeer Kadim, 20, a taxi driver who has lived in the zone since 2003. Others say they are worried that they will be forced out. 
 But the Iraqi government has been pushing for this day, and it seems natural that a security agreement that gives Iraq control of its radio frequencies and airspace would also include the seat of its government. 
 ''Even if the Iraqi side is not as professional as the Americans, I still believe that it's better to be transferred,'' said Nawal al-Samarrai, the Iraqi minister for women's affairs and the sole cabinet member to vote against the agreement.
 ''They are Iraqis, and this is their home,'' she said. ''They are not foreigners, not occupiers.''

HEADLINE: Bigger Than Bush

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
As the new Democratic majority prepares to take power, Republicans have become, as Phil Gramm might put it, a party of whiners.
 Some of the whining almost defies belief. Did Alberto Gonzales, the former attorney general, really say, ''I consider myself a casualty, one of the many casualties of the war on terror''? Did Rush Limbaugh really suggest that the financial crisis was the result of a conspiracy, masterminded by that evil genius Chuck Schumer? 
 But most of the whining takes the form of claims that the Bush administration's failure was simply a matter of bad luck -- either the bad luck of President Bush himself, who just happened to have disasters happen on his watch, or the bad luck of the G.O.P., which just happened to send the wrong man to the White House. 
 The fault, however, lies not in Republicans' stars but in themselves. Forty years ago the G.O.P. decided, in effect, to make itself the party of racial backlash. And everything that has happened in recent years, from the choice of Mr. Bush as the party's champion, to the Bush administration's pervasive incompetence, to the party's shrinking base, is a consequence of that decision. 
 If the Bush administration became a byword for policy bungles, for government by the unqualified, well, it was just following the advice of leading conservative think tanks: after the 2000 election the Heritage Foundation specifically urged the new team to ''make appointments based on loyalty first and expertise second.''
 Contempt for expertise, in turn, rested on contempt for government in general. ''Government is not the solution to our problem,'' declared Ronald Reagan. ''Government is the problem.'' So why worry about governing well?
 Where did this hostility to government come from? In 1981 Lee Atwater, the famed Republican political consultant, explained the evolution of the G.O.P.'s ''Southern strategy,'' which originally focused on opposition to the Voting Rights Act but eventually took a more coded form: ''You're getting so abstract now you're talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you're talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is blacks get hurt worse than whites.'' In other words, government is the problem because it takes your money and gives it to Those People.
 Oh, and the racial element isn't all that abstract, even now: Chip Saltsman, currently a candidate for the chairmanship of the Republican National Committee, sent committee members a CD including a song titled ''Barack the Magic Negro'' -- and according to some reports, the controversy over his action has actually helped his chances.
 So the reign of George W. Bush, the first true Southern Republican president since Reconstruction, was the culmination of a long process. And despite the claims of some on the right that Mr. Bush betrayed conservatism, the truth is that he faithfully carried out both his party's divisive tactics -- long before Sarah Palin, Mr. Bush declared that he visited his ranch to ''stay in touch with real Americans'' -- and its governing philosophy.
 That's why the soon-to-be-gone administration's failure is bigger than Mr. Bush himself: it represents the end of the line for a political strategy that dominated the scene for more than a generation.
 The reality of this strategy's collapse has not, I believe, fully sunk in with some observers. Thus, some commentators warning President-elect Barack Obama against bold action have held up Bill Clinton's political failures in his first two years as a cautionary tale. 
 But America in 1993 was a very different country -- not just a country that had yet to see what happens when conservatives control all three branches of government, but also a country in which Democratic control of Congress depended on the votes of Southern conservatives. Today, Republicans have taken away almost all those Southern votes -- and lost the rest of the country. It was a grand ride for a while, but in the end the Southern strategy led the G.O.P. into a cul-de-sac.
 Mr. Obama therefore has room to be bold. If Republicans try a 1993-style strategy of attacking him for promoting big government, they'll learn two things: not only has the financial crisis discredited their economic theories, the racial subtext of anti-government rhetoric doesn't play the way it used to.
 Will the Republicans eventually stage a comeback? Yes, of course. But barring some huge missteps by Mr. Obama, that will not happen until they stop whining and look at what really went wrong. And when they do, they will discover that they need to get in touch with the real ''real America,'' a country that is more diverse, more tolerant, and more demanding of effective government than is dreamt of in their political philosophy.

HEADLINE: A False and Unfair Economy

 BODY:
Gov. David Paterson's $121 billion doomsday budget has the virtue, at least, of matching scarce dollars against harsh reality. We have commended him for trying to spread the pain, and urged him to stand firm against the interest groups that would put their needs above the stability and solvency of New York State. 
 Dollars will be restored here and cut there in the negotiations to come. When they are, there is one interest group, quieter and far less powerful than most, that always needs a voice. That is the poor, among whose setbacks in this budget is the zeroing-out of noncriminal legal services -- a chronically underfunded need for which, in this budget, there is no funding at all. 
 In the real world -- unlike courtroom TV -- people usually get the justice they can pay for, and those who cannot afford lawyers end up bearing an unfair burden. People need decent representation when doing battle with bad landlords and employers, callous health maintenance organizations and government agencies, disgruntled business partners and grasping relatives. And in an era of predatory home loans, the legal needs of distressed homeowners are urgent and steadily rising.
 Advocates for the poor argue, persuasively, that outlays for civil legal services are budgetary pennies that save many dollars. A foreclosure prevented is an eviction avoided, a family kept from homelessness -- and a considerable burden lifted from the government's social-service safety net. With legal help, poor people can avoid litigation, easing the load on judges and courtrooms. They can get food stamps, leveraging federal dollars in an underused program. If they avoid the poorhouse they will have, by definition, more money to spend, increasing sales tax revenues and benefiting local businesses.
 Gov. Eliot Spitzer once thought he had a painless way to increase the financing stream for civil legal services. It was to raise the interest rate on the funds that law firms hold for clients in escrow accounts. The Interest on Lawyer Account Fund is a mainstay for financing civil legal services, and when it rose, it helped state spending reach a high of nearly $16 million last year. 
 But the fund has plunged in the economic downturn, and subsequent budget cuts have taken big bites out of civil legal services. The funding cuts have come at the worst possible time. The Legislature and Mr. Paterson must take care to save money by spending a little more in the right places, like civil legal services.

HEADLINE: Time Warner and Viacom Reach Agreement on Cable Shows

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

 BODY:
There was good news in the early hours of Thursday for small children in New York, Los Angeles and other large cities: the ''SpongeBob'' blackout had been avoided. 
 The ball had already dropped in Times Square, but MTV Networks and Time Warner Cable kept talking into the early new year and concluded a deal in principle that ensured that shows like ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' and ''The Colbert Report'' would still be available to the 13.3 million subscribers to the Time Warner Cable service. 
 The final terms, which were not disclosed, will be worked out in talks in the next few days, an executive at Viacom, the parent of MTV, said. 
 The two sides had faced a deadline of midnight to renew the contract under which Time Warner pays MTV a rights fee for its 20 cable networks, which include MTV, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, VH1, TV Land, BET and Spike. 
 Viacom demanded an increase of about 23 cents per subscriber to cover its full portfolio of channels, under a threat that it would remove all 20 networks from Time Warner's systems. Viacom's chief executive, Philippe P. Dauman, said the increase was justified because MTV Networks had been underpriced compared with other cable networks with fewer viewers. 
 Time Warner Cable resisted the demands, saying that the current recession was no time to be seeking higher fees from consumers. A Time Warner executive had labeled the MTV Networks demands as outrageous. 
 In the past, when cable channel owners like MTV Networks moved to take their programs off cable systems over fee disputes, they invariably won because viewers generally expect cable systems to provide the programs they like -- and are paying for -- and protest loudly if those shows are blacked out. 
 That is what seemed to happen again in this negotiation, which followed by a day a series of newspaper ads placed by Viacom that urged fans of its networks' shows to make protest calls to Time Warner Cable. 
 Though the announcement of the agreement reached early Thursday did not include specifics about the financial terms, and executives on both sides agreed not to disclose the numbers, an executive with knowledge of the negotiation said that Time Warner had given in and agreed to pay a higher fee to MTV Networks. 
 Some or all of that fee increase is likely to be passed on to Time Warner Cable subscribers. But now none of them will be deprived of seeing Jon Stewart, Dora the Explorer or the fractious young women of ''The Hills.''

HEADLINE: Proud of Obama's Victory, An Ad Executive Is Hopeful

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
The morning after Barack Obama was elected president of the United States, Maurice Levy, chief executive of the Publicis Groupe, the advertising company based in Paris, sent an e-mail message to the 15,000 Publicis employees in the United States.
 ''Congratulations on such a great choice,'' he wrote. ''Once again the American people have proved that they are right there when it comes to turning points in history -- and they know how to make history.'' 
 In his support for President-elect Obama, Mr. Levy had plenty of company in Europe, of course. And he understands the value of friendly relationships with politicians; associates say he uses the informal French ''tu,'' rather than the formal ''vous,'' to address President Nicolas Sarkozy of France.
 But openly gushing about the results of another country's election is unusual for any chief executive, let alone a discreet Frenchman whose company's commercial messages go out to Americans of all political stripes.
 ''I have always thought politics, that is something I should not get involved in,'' Mr. Levy said during an interview in his Paris office. ''But I had to because this is so fantastic.''
 ''It erases all the bad images, the bad pictures of the last eight years with one vote,'' he added. ''It is a wonderful demonstration of the strengths of America, a formidable lesson for the world.''
 Like many Europeans of his generation, Mr. Levy said, he has always admired American culture. But it is also clear that the prospect of trans-Atlantic rapprochement makes good business sense to an executive whose clients include McDonald's, Procter & Gamble and General Motors, especially when the economic news is going from bad to worse. Since the election, forecasters have predicted that ad spending will fall in most major developed markets next year.
 Analysts at Morgan Stanley predict that revenue from Publicis's existing businesses will fall 4 percent next year. The group's subsidiaries include the ad agencies Saatchi & Saatchi and Leo Burnett, as well as the media buying operations ZenithOptimedia and Starcom Mediavest.
 The automotive industry, along with two other sectors hit hard by the downturn -- health care and financial services -- account for about a third of Publicis's revenue. In addition to G.M., its clients include Renault, Toyota and Fiat. G.M has been cutting its ad spending as its woes have deepened over the last year, Mr. Levy said. Publicis expects further reductions from G.M. and other automakers as they streamline their product offerings, he added.
 ''Nobody should think they are not conscious of cost,'' Mr. Levy said of G.M. ''They are very tough on us.''
 As carmakers and other advertisers look for more efficient ways to get their messages across, Mr. Levy said, the economic crisis will hasten the shift of advertising to the Internet and away from traditional media. By 2010, he said, 15 percent of global ad spending will be online.
 Mr. Levy has tried to prepare Publicis for this shift by beefing up its digital capabilities. Two years ago, the company acquired Digitas, a specialist in online marketing, for $1.3 billion. Publicis has also invested substantially in emerging markets, where ad spending has been growing more rapidly than in Western Europe, Japan or North America.
 ''This has recently become a higher-risk strategy,'' the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a recent report. Indeed, the notion that Internet ad spending will be less affected by the downturn, which has become something of a mantra in the industry, remains unproven. During the last downturn, Internet spending suffered the most. Emerging markets can also be volatile.
 But Mr. Levy said Publicis would stick with its approach. This month, the company acquired W&K Communications, an agency based in Beijing. In November, it acquired Tribal, a Brazilian agency specializing in digital advertising.
 ''We have other negotiations under way in China; we have contacts in India,'' Mr. Levy said.
 Might he be planning a bigger move? There has long been speculation in the industry about the possibility of a merger between Publicis and the Interpublic Group, based in New York. Those companies are neck-and-neck for the No. 3 position in the industry, after the Omnicom Group and the WPP Group.
 Publicis previously made an unsuccessful run at the Aegis Group, a company based in London specializing in media buying and digital advertising. There has been renewed talk in the industry that Aegis might be for sale, following the recent resignation of its chief executive, Robert Lerwill.
 But Mr. Levy said his company was not holding discussions with Interpublic. And he said the fate of Aegis was out of his hands because the French investor Vincent Bollore holds a stake of nearly 30 percent in that company, allowing him to keep other potential suitors at bay. Mr. Bollore is also the chairman of the French advertising company Havas, in which he owns a 32.9 percent stake.
 ''It is important at a time like this not to spend a lot of time on chess games,'' Mr. Levy said. ''We are not looking at any game-changing operations.''
 He said big, geographically diversified advertising companies like Publicis, alongside small agencies with a creative reputation, would fare better than midsize companies in the downturn.
 ''There will be casualties,'' he said, without citing names. ''There will be consolidation. There will be companies that will not be in business when this crisis is over -- advertisers, advertising agencies and media.''
 While Mr. Levy is ebullient about the election of Mr. Obama, his admiration for the United States has its limits. In deploring what he sees as the root of the crisis -- a ''perversion'' of capitalism that drove Wall Street to try to profit from the idea of extending home ownership to the masses -- he echoed a widely held French view.
 ''Capitalism cannot be only about maximizing profit,'' he said.
 But are not advertising and marketing all functions of capitalism -- about making people want bigger houses, and things to fill them with?
 ''We don't lie to them, we don't cheat them,'' he said. ''We don't tell them something is a triple-A product when it is not a triple-A product.''

HEADLINE: STEEL INDUSTRY, IN SLUMP, LOOKS TO U.S. STIMULUS

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The steel industry, having entered the recession in the best of health, is emerging as a leading indicator of what lies ahead. As steel production goes -- and it is now in collapse -- so will go the national economy. 
 That maxim once applied to Detroit's Big Three car companies, when they dominated American manufacturing. Now they are losing ground in good times and bad, and steel has replaced autos as the industry to watch for an early sign that a severe recession is beginning to lift.
 The industry itself is turning to government for orders that, until the September collapse, had come from manufacturers and builders. Its executives are waiting anxiously for details of President-elect Barack Obama's stimulus plan, and adding their voices to pleas for a huge public investment program -- up to $1 trillion over two years -- intended to lift demand for steel to build highways, bridges, electric power grids, schools, hospitals, water treatment plants and rapid transit.
 ''What we are asking,'' said Daniel R. DiMicco, chairman and chief executive of the Nucor Corporation, a giant steel maker, ''is that our government deal with the worst economic slowdown in our lifetime through a recovery program that has in every provision a 'buy America' clause.'' 
 Economists in the Obama camp said the president-elect's proposals to Congress will include significant infrastructure spending that draws on heavy industry.
 New spending should provide an immediate jolt to the steel business, which has already gone through the painful makeover now demanded of automakers. Steel mills were closed, companies were consolidated, hundreds of thousands lost their jobs and the survivors agreed to concessions. As a result, productivity shot up and so did profits, to record levels in the first nine months of this year. Even as the economy wobbled, steel held its own.
 But then the recession hit in force. Steel goes into nearly everything made in America, from homes and office buildings to cars, appliances and light bulb sockets, and as construction and manufacturing wound down, so did the output of steel, plunging 50 percent since September. 
 The steel industry's collapse closely tracks the alarming late-autumn swoon in the national economy, as the housing bust and the credit crisis converted a mild downturn into ''a severe one that has much further to run,'' says Nigel Gault, chief domestic economist at IHS Global Insight, offering a view increasingly shared by forecasters. 
 Through August, steel production was actually up slightly for the year. The decline came slowly at first, and then with a rush in November and December. By late December, output was down to 1.02 million tons a week from 2.1 million tons on Aug. 30, the American Iron and Steel Institute reported. The price of a ton of steel is also down by half since late summer.
 ''We are making our steel at four mills instead of six,'' said John Armstrong, a spokesman for the United States Steel Corporation, adding that two mills were recently idled and the four still operating are running at less than full capacity. 
 ''The third quarter was one of the best in U.S. Steel's history,'' Mr. Armstrong added. ''And it has been a very precipitous drop from there.''
 The cutback has been particularly hard on workers at the big integrated mills like those at U.S. Steel and Arcelor Mittal USA, with their blast furnaces and coke ovens converting iron ore and other materials into steel. Operated at less than full capacity, these mills are less efficient than the equally large ''minimills,'' like Nucor, whose electric arc furnaces can be operated efficiently at lower speeds. 
 So the plant closings have been mostly at the integrated mills, whose 50,000 workers -- roughly 40 percent of the nation's steelworkers -- are represented by the United Steelworkers. The union says that early this year it expects 20,000 workers to be on furlough. 
 Ten thousand already have been. Kathleen Loepker, a millwright and mechanic, is among the most recent to join their ranks. She was laid off on Dec. 19 from the U.S. Steel plant in Granite City, Ill., which shut, putting more than 2,000 employees out of work. With nearly 30 years seniority, Ms. Loepker, 48, has worked through bankruptcies, union concessions and consolidations during which her mill was acquired by U.S. Steel in 2003.
 Her income today is tied more to incentive bonuses than in the past. On layoff, she is collecting $20 an hour, which is 80 percent of her base pay of $25.12 an hour. That base pay, rather than rising significantly, is fattened by incentive bonuses tied to amounts of steel produced and to profits. It had been averaging an additional $7 an hour -- money now gone until the mill reopens. 
 ''No one knows when that will happen,'' said Ms. Loepker, who lives by herself in a four-bedroom home she bought in nearby Belleville, three blocks from a married sister. ''The company tells us the end of March, but they don't know either,'' Ms. Loepker said. ''The uncertainty has everyone fearful.'' 
 Not since the 1980s has American steel production been as low as it is today. Those were the Rust Belt years when many steel companies were failing and imports of better quality, lower cost steel were rising. 
 Foreign producers no longer have an advantage over the refurbished American companies. Indeed, imports, which represent about 30 percent of all steel sales in the United States, also are hurting as customers disappear.
 The industry, in response, is lobbying the Obama transition team for infrastructure projects that would require big amounts of steel. Mass transit systems are high on the list, and so is bridge repair.
 ''We are sharing with the president-elect's transition team our thoughts in terms of the industry's policy priorities,'' said Nancy Gravatt, a spokeswoman for the American Iron and Steel Institute. 
 The Obama team has not yet revealed details of the president-elect's soon-to-be-announced recovery plan other than to indicate that most of the package will probably go into infrastructure spending rather than tax breaks. 
 ''If the president-elect really follows through, he'll fund a lot of mass transit projects,'' said Wilbur L. Ross Jr., the Wall Street deal maker who put together the steel conglomerate known as Arcelor Mittal USA. ''All the big cities have these projects ready to go.''
 The sharp slide in steel production has several causes. Construction and auto production have fallen sharply; between them, they account for 57 percent of the steel bought each year in the United States, according to the Iron and Steel Institute. Appliances, machinery and other electrical equipment account for an additional 13 percent, and the fall-off in production of these goods has also reduced steel orders. 
 Then there are the wholesalers, known in the steel industry as service centers. They buy in huge quantities from the mills, building up inventories and selling to customers like a construction company that needs I-beams to build a shopping center, or a manufacturer of auto parts in need of steel tubing. 
 Until recently, the inventories were bought on credit, and the service centers constantly replenished these stockpiles as steel was sold to end users. But now the service centers, unable to borrow money easily and reluctant to borrow anyway in these hard times, have stopped buying from the steel mills. They are selling off their inventories instead, raising cash in the process. It is a tactic that annoys Mr. DiMicco, the Nucor chief, no end. 
 ''They don't want to be without cash when they go into whatever the black hole is that is being created by the financial crisis,'' he said, and faulted the nation's lenders for collecting billions in government bailout money and then, in his view, refusing to lend it to the service centers on reasonable terms. ''Credit completely dried up,'' Mr. DiMicco said, ''and it is still hard to get.''

HEADLINE: Cuba Marks 50 Years Since the Revolution

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO; Guillaume Decamme contributed reporting from Havana.

 BODY:
Cuba marked the 50th anniversary of its revolution on Thursday amid somber assessments of a struggling economy, even as its Communist leaders exalted the resilience of a political system that has endured 10 United States administrations.
 Fidel Castro, 82, whose group of bearded rebels waged a guerrilla war that toppled the strongman Fulgencio Batista on Jan. 1, 1959, remained behind the scenes during the subdued festivities on the island nation, grappling with an undisclosed illness that forced him into seclusion more than two years ago. 
 ''I congratulate our heroic people,'' Mr. Castro said in brief comments published by Granma, the newspaper of Cuba's Communist Party. 
 Mr. Castro's younger brother, President Raul Castro, 77, addressed the nation Thursday night from the eastern city of Santiago. But instead of jubilation, the younger Mr. Castro, who officially became president in 2008, seems to have been preparing Cubans for more hardships as the revolution enters its sixth decade.
 Speaking from beneath the same balcony where Fidel Castro declared victory over the Batista government, President Castro said the revolution would survive another 50 years. 
 But he also referred to a speech by his brother a few years ago, in which he warned that ''this revolution can destroy itself,'' The Associated Press reported; if that occurred, Raul Castro quoted his brother as saying, ''it would be our own fault.'' Nearly all of the time since Fidel Castro seized control of the country has been spent under a United States economic embargo. Cuban officials said in December that the economy would grow 4.3 percent in 2008, about half the rate that had been expected.
 Even though Cuba's economy has been stabilized in recent years by the provision of about 100,000 barrels a day of subsidized oil from Venezuela, it is dealing with a host of other problems.
 Hurricanes wrought damage last year, while agricultural disarray heightened reliance on food imports. The younger Mr. Castro has introduced halting reforms like allowing Cubans to buy cellphones or stay at hotels set aside for foreign tourists, but average salaries of about $20 a month put such luxuries out of reach for most people.
 Scattered flags and small banners with slogans appeared in recent days in the capital, Havana, but otherwise events surrounding the revolution's anniversary were in keeping with the somber economic mood.
 Illustrating just how long the enmity between Cuba and the United States has persisted, the incoming United States president, Barack Obama, who is 47, was not yet born when President Eisenhower ordered the first sanctions against Cuba in 1960.
 But while Mr. Obama has signaled the possibility of dialogue with Cuba's leaders and the lifting of some restrictions on travel to Cuba, other nations in Latin America and elsewhere have gone much further in efforts to make Cuba less isolated.
 The presidents of Brazil, China and Russia have all visited Havana in recent months, pledging greater economic cooperation. At Mexico's initiative in December, Cuba was admitted to the Rio Group, a diplomatic association of Latin American and Caribbean countries. And in October, the European Union formally renewed ties to Cuba.
 ''While the U.S. is dithering, virtually every other major actor in world affairs is becoming more engaged with Cuba,'' said Daniel Erikson, director of Caribbean programs at the Inter-American Dialogue, a policy research group in Washington.
 Still, Cuba's enduring revolution, which has secured advances in education and health care, faces other challenges. It has one the hemisphere's lowest birthrates, 1.6 children per woman, and one of its highest life expectancy rates, 77.3 years. Emigration of thousands of young people each year also erodes its population of 11.4 million.
 Some Cubans find opportunity in a society in which revolutionary fervor wanes while other needs prevail. One 33-year-old resident of Havana said he studied international trade, but gave up a legitimate career in business because of a lack of job opportunities.
 Now he works on the black market. ''I have my own business; I sell Viagra pills,'' said the man, who did not want to be identified for fear of running afoul of authorities. ''You can't buy them in Cuban shops, so that is a pretty good business considering that the Cuban population is growing older every year.''

HEADLINE: City's Workers Will Travel, but Without City-Owned Cars

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
Economic hard times are about to hit New York City's employees where it hurts: in their driveways. 
 As the Bloomberg administration scrambles to cut spending, it is ordering city agencies like the police, parks and health departments to give up nearly 700 city-owned cars, a cherished perk for their workers. 
 The move would save $20 million over the next two years, according to a copy of the memorandum sent to city agencies. 
 The decision to sell off scores of Toyota Prius cars and Ford Escape sport utility vehicles is very likely to irritate many city workers, who use the them to travel around the city inspecting sites or rushing to meetings. But it would help blunt criticism that City Hall practices a form of vehicular hypocrisy, telling ordinary New Yorkers to use mass transportation while at times clogging the streets with its own city-issued cars.
 City agencies must relinquish at least 10 percent, or about 685, of their 6,800 nonemergency vehicles by the end of March, according to the memo from Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, which was sent on Wednesday and obtained by The New York Times. 
 And they must cut their overall vehicle expenses by roughly another 5 percent, either by relinquishing more cars or cutting down on fuel or maintenance costs, the memo said. 
 The decision represents Mr. Bloomberg's latest attack on what he regards as unnecessary traffic that snarls the city's roadways and pollutes the air. 
 Last year, after embarrassing revelations of abuse, the city started to eliminate thousands of placards that gave employees free street parking privileges at their workplace and across the city while on official business. 
 That followed an ill-fated campaign, in 2007, to establish a congestion pricing fee on cars entering Midtown Manhattan, which met stiff resistance from lawmakers in Albany, who eventually killed the proposal. 
 Removing 700 city cars from the road, Mr. Bloomberg's memo said, would help the city meet its goal of reducing carbon emissions from city government by 30 percent by 2017. 
 Jeff Kay, the director of the mayor's office of operations, said the ''goal is twofold -- one, produce savings at a time when we need to stretch every penny, and two, reduce our carbon footprint to help reach our sustainability goals.'' 
 He added, ''The fleet reduction does both.''
 Union officials who represent city workers declined to weigh in on the change, saying most of the cars are driven by nonunion supervisors and managers.
 The city faces a projected budget gap of at least $1.3 billion next year, largely because of sharply lower tax revenues from Wall Street, which has laid off thousands of workers.
 In response, the mayor has raised property taxes by 7 percent and has ordered across-the-board spending cuts that will reduce new police cadets and nighttime staffing at firehouses. 
 City Hall aides have pledged that in such tough financial times, all spending, no matter how seemingly off limits, must be scrutinized. The mayor's decision to take away cars seemed to reinforce that message. 
 Many city agencies operate their own fleet of cars, which they assign to employees for official use. Buildings inspectors use city-owned cars to travel to construction sites, for example. And supervisors at the Department of Parks and Recreation use them to get to far-flung city properties. 
 For many of these employees, mass transportation may add hours to their travel schedule. 
 But City Hall is convinced that the agencies can do more with less, possibly by sharing fewer cars, or perhaps even using rental services, on occasion. 
 The Police Department has about 1,200 so-called light-duty, nonemergency cars. The Department of Environmental Protection has about 750. 
 The city estimates that most of the cars have a resale value of about $2,000 at auction. 
 Douglas M. Turetsky, a spokesman for the city's Independent Budget Office, said the estimated $20 million in savings from selling the cars ''could preserve another essential service.'' ''When you are facing a big budget gap, every bit counts,'' he said. 
 Eventually, the city is expected to consolidate what is now a sprawling system of cars spread out across nearly a dozen agencies, according to those familiar with the plans.

 50 YEARS AFTER CUBA'S REVOLUTION,
 Hard Times Persist
 Thursday marked five decades for Cuba since its revolution. As leaders exulted, there was a marked undercurrent: the country is facing a sixth decade under an American embargo and has a struggling economy that will see only slight growth. Cellphones are out of most of people's reach. And agricultural disarray has forced the country to depend more on food imports. Page A6 
 RUSSIA CUTS OFF GAS TO UKRAINE 
 When Ukraine rejected a demand from the Kremlin for a sharp increase in gas prices, Gazprom, the Russian gas monopoly, cut off supply to the country. The strong-arm move was explained by Gazprom as no different than a utility cutting service to a nonpaying customer, but experts say the move is more indicative of Russia's deepening economic troubles.

 A cluster of restored temples in Guandu province have become a money pit for local officials who hoped the reminder of China's Buddhist past would draw tourist dollars.

 In black churches in New York and across the country, many worshipers concluded their service at the stroke of the new year by rising from their knees. It's the defining moment of Watch Night, a tradition begun on New Year's Eve of 1862, before the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation, the day when the ideal of freedom in America became a little more real. With President-elect Barack Obama soon taking office, there was another layer of meaning. Page A17

 Once again an arty Manhattan outpost has become a victim of the neighborhood renewal it helped to foster. The Knitting Factory, which has been celebrating noise and eclecticism ever since it opened in 1987, can no longer afford downtown's rising rents. But this real-estate drama has a twist: New Year's Eve, its last show, served as the debut of City Winery, a nearby stylish restaurant and concert space opened by the founder of the Knitting Factory, and the two concerts could hardly have been more different.

 Sometimes, fairly or not, an artistic work gets saddled with a reputation it just can't shake. ''La Rondine'' has long been considered Puccini's problem child, his sole venture into crossover, an attempt to write an Italian operatic equivalent of a lightly comic, bittersweet Viennese operetta. The opera arrived at the Metropolitan Opera for a New Year's Eve gala performance in a beguiling new production by Nicolas Joel, which, amazingly, is the first Met production since 1936.

HEADLINE: A Block That Wanted Development Has to Wait

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
For Stan Murray, new town houses on his Brooklyn block would mean more hands to help care for the plants, the pin oaks and flowering pear tree he has tended for decades. 
 Parishioners of St. Nicholas Antiochian Orthodox Cathedral would like to buy one of the homes planned for next door, to use for offices and for Sunday school classes that are held in the basement now. Patrick Downey would welcome any new condo owners to the empty lot across the street, especially if they buy $1.80 cups of coffee at his cafe.
 But the residents, worshipers and workers along the State Street block between Hoyt and Bond Streets in Boerum Hill are slowly accepting that the economic downturn means that the empty lots they had hoped would soon have new town houses and condos will not be filled anytime soon. 
 The land was bought in 2004 by the Ibec Building Corporation and the Strategic Development and Construction Group, with plans to fill in this block's sea of parking lots. After the companies finished one rental building, said Samy Brahimy, a partner in Ibec, they were unable to get the financing to complete the two remaining sites. So he has put off building six town houses until at least the spring, has no schedule for a condo project and isn't sure that there will be condos at all. 
 Just as the neighbors are tired of seeing vacant lots, he is eager to see the projects completed, he said. 
 ''Unless we have firm commitments from buyers, we wouldn't even start developing,'' Mr. Brahimy said. ''Banks at this point are not going to give you a construction loan.''
 In a city where residents often complain about the hassles created by construction and about the arrival of new residents in their rapidly gentrifying blocks, residents along this block have worked steadily to attract development. 
 They started small by renovating their brownstones. Expanding into a block-wide effort in the late 1980s, they filled their stoops with plants and greens. A few years later, they won accolades as the greenest block in Brooklyn from GreenBridge, a horticulture program run by the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. The neighborhood association worked closely with city and state agencies to turn the block's government-run parking lots over to developers. 
 After Mr. Brahimy built a rental apartment tower, State Renaissance Court, adjacent to their yards, the residents were enthusiastic when he set up a schedule for the design and marketing of six town houses and said he was considering condos on the third lot.
 Then came the Wall Street meltdown, and the project came to a halt.
 ''I'm disappointed,'' said Aurelio Mark de Yoanna, who longs to hear the sounds of new families, not the silences of empty spaces. ''It would be great to have just a completed block.''
 But this block is not the only one whose building boom has been slowed by the economy. Abby Hamlin, a developer who built 14 town houses and a 217-unit rental building nearby, has delayed plans for three remaining sites by at least 6 to 12 months because of the economy. 
 ''Everybody is under financing constraints,'' said Brian Leary, a local commercial real estate broker who arranged the sale of many neighborhood sites over the past few years.
 For Mr. Murray, a 71-year-old retiree, the latest holdup is just a blip in his 32-year effort to bring change to his block. He bought his three-family brownstone along State Street in 1976 for $62,500. Back then, he joked, it was ''probably the ugliest block around.'' It was never a ''fancy block,'' he said, like the one Ms. Hamlin has been developing, marked by older town houses with landmark status. 
 But Mr. Murray found that his block had enough charm to tolerate its drawbacks. He lived with how the radiator cover rattled when the subway rumbled below, and he chuckled when recalling a bag of dirty laundry stolen from his stoop. 
 He found neighbors open to his gardening plans -- among them, ''a pot for every stoop'' -- and they planted a climbing rose with petals as big as saucers.
 Mr. Murray, the son of a builder, has kept an eye on one of Mr. Brahimy's lots, too. He worked with neighbors to put planters out to draw attention away from the emptiness, and in June, the block association's gardening committee persuaded Mr. Brahimy to give the neighbors tan and black paint to redo the bright blue fence at the site. 
 With a hint of humor, Mr. Murray hangs hula hoops on the fence; when construction is complete, he hopes to grow ivy there again. 
 For now, when he heads out each morning to buy the newspaper, he picks up trash along the street near the site. 
 ''I know it's inevitable they will build at some point,'' he said. ''And I'm perfectly happy to wait.''

HEADLINE: Willing to Deal

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Hard times are usually good times for debt collectors, who make their money morning and night with the incessant ring of a phone.
But in this recession, perhaps the deepest in decades, the unthinkable is happening: collectors, who usually do the squeezing, are getting squeezed a bit themselves.
After helping to foster the explosive growth of consumer debt in recent years, credit card companies are realizing that some hard-pressed Americans will not be able to pay their bills as the economy deteriorates.
So lenders and their collectors are rushing to round up what money they can before things get worse, even if that means forgiving part of some borrowers' debts. Increasingly, they are stretching out payments and accepting dimes, if not pennies, on the dollar as payment in full.
''You can't squeeze blood out of a turnip,'' said Don Siler, the chief marketing officer at MRS Associates, a big collection company that works with seven of the 10 largest credit card companies. ''The big settlements just aren't there anymore.'' 
Lenders are not being charitable. They are simply trying to protect themselves.
Banks and card companies are bracing for a wave of defaults on credit card debt in early 2009, and they are vying with each other to get paid first. Besides, the sooner people get their financial houses in order, the sooner they can start borrowing again.
So even as many banks cut consumers' credit lines, raise card fees and generally pull back on lending, some lenders are trying to give customers a little wiggle room. Bank of America, for instance, says it has waived late fees, lowered interest charges and, in some cases, reduced loan balances for more than 700,000 credit card holders in 2008.
American Express and Chase Card Services say they are taking similar actions as more customers fall behind on their bills. Every major credit card lender is giving its collection agents more leeway to make adjustments for consumers in financial distress.
Debt collectors, who are typically paid based on the amount of money they recover, report that the number of troubled borrowers getting payment extensions has at least doubled in the last six months. In other cases, borrowers who appear to be pushed to the brink are being offered deals that forgive 20 to 70 percent of credit card debt.
''Consumers have never been in a better position to negotiate a partial payment,'' said Robert D. Manning, the author of ''Credit Card Nation'' and a longtime critic of the credit card industry. ''It's like that old movie 'Rosalie Goes Shopping.' When it's $100,000 of debt, it's your problem. When it's a million dollars of debt, it's the bank's problem.''
The recent wave of debt concessions is a reversal from only a few years ago, when consumers usually lost battles with their credit card companies. Now, as bad debts soar, it is the lenders who are crying mercy.
Credit card lenders expect to write off an unprecedented $395 billion of soured loans over the next five years, according to projections from The Nilson Report, an industry newsletter. That compares with a total of about $275 billion in the last five years.
All that bad debt is getting harder to collect. In the past, troubled borrowers might have been able to pay down card loans by tapping the equity in their homes, drawing on retirement savings, taking out a debt consolidation loan, or even calling a relative for help. But with credit tight, consumers are maxed out.
''Knowing that the sources of funding have dried up, having someone pay the balance in full isn't a viable strategy,'' said Tim Smith, a senior executive at Firstsource, one of the biggest debt collection companies.
Lenders are reluctant to admit they will accept less than full payment, lest they encourage good customers to stop paying what they can. Industrywide data is scarce.
Unlike the huge mortgage loan modification programs that are taking place, which address thousands of mortgages at once, workouts for credit card customers are still being handled on a case-by-case basis.
In addition to debt forgiveness, debt collectors are allowing many delinquent borrowers to pay down their debt over the course of a year rather than the standard six months.
Paul Hunziker, the chairman of Capital Management Services, said that before this downturn, his firm put only about a quarter of all borrowers into longer-term repayment plans. Now, it puts about half on such plans.
Some lenders are also reaching out to borrowers shortly after they fall behind on their payments to try to avoid having to write off the account. Others are reaching out to customers who seem likely to fall behind. Just as lenders competed for years to be the first card to be taken out of the wallet, they are now competing to be the first ones paid back.
And realizing that millions more consumers are likely to default on their credit card bills in the coming months, the banking industry has started lobbying regulators to make it more advantageous to lenders to extend payment terms or forgive debt.
In an unusual alliance, the Financial Services Roundtable, one of the industry's biggest lobbyists, and the Consumer Federation of America recently proposed a credit card loan modification program, which was rejected by regulators.
Under the plan, lenders would have forgiven about 40 percent of what was owed by individual borrowers over five years. Lenders could report the loss once whatever part of the debt was repaid, instead of shortly after default, as current accounting rules require. That would allow them to write off less later. Borrowers would have been allowed to defer any tax payments owed on the forgiven debt.
Landmark changes to bankruptcy legislation passed in 2005, for which the industry aggressively lobbied, seem to have hurt card debt collections. Credit card industry data indicate the average debt discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy has nearly tripled since 2004. And in Chapter 13 bankruptcies, secured lenders like auto finance companies routinely elbow out unsecured lenders like card companies, trends that have contributed to the card lenders' willingness to settle.
Borrowers should not expect sweetheart deals. Card companies will offer loan modifications only to people who meet certain criteria. Most customers must be delinquent for 90 days or longer. Other considerations include the borrower's income, existing bank relationships and a credit record that suggests missing a payment is an exception rather than the rule.
While a deal may help avoid credit card cancellation or bankruptcy, it will also lead to a sharp drop in the borrower's credit score for as long as seven years, making it far more difficult and expensive to obtain new loans. The average consumer's score will fall 70 to 130 points, on a scale where the strongest borrowers register 700 or more.
For the moment, it may be easier for troubled borrowers to start negotiating a modification by contacting the card company or collection agency directly. Credit counselors can help borrowers consolidate their debts and get card companies to lower their interest payments and other fees, but they currently cannot get the loan principal reduced.
Another option is for a borrower to sign up a debt settlement company to negotiate on her behalf. But regulation of this business is loose, and consumer advocacy groups warn that some firms prey on troubled borrowers with aggressive marketing tactics and exorbitant upfront fees.

HEADLINE: November Chip Sales Slipped 10%

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Global semiconductor sales fell almost 10 percent in November, as the economic slowdown shook the chip sector, an industry trade group said Friday. 
 Semiconductor sales dropped to $20.8 billion in November, from $23.1 billion a year earlier, the Semiconductor Industry Association reported. Sales through the first 11 months of the year rose 0.2 percent to $232.7 billion.
 November sales were 7.2 percent lower than the $22.4 billion in October 2008. Excluding memory products, chip sales declined 4.8 percent to $17.3 billion.
 ''The worldwide economic crisis is having an impact on demand for semiconductors, but to a lesser degree than some other major industry sectors,'' the group's president, George Scalise, said in a statement. ''We expect the industry will remain the second largest exporter in the U.S. for 2008.'' 
 Mr. Scalise said that in the memory market, which has been under severe price pressure throughout the year, sales have declined significantly while many other product sectors have year-to-date sales above 2007 levels.
 Sales in the Americas fell 19.5 percent while in Europe sales fell 13.9 percent. However, the Asia Pacific region had the smallest decline, 6.2 percent in sales.
 The trade group represents makers of silicon chips that run computers, mobile phones and other electronics devices. Its members include Intel, Texas Instruments and Advanced Micro Devices.

HEADLINE: Coping Skills and Horrible Imaginings

BYLINE: By ALINA TUGEND

 BODY:
I DIDN'T know this -- maybe you did -- but Nov. 17 is officially ''Coping With Uncertainty Day.'' I can't figure out if this came about through an act of Congress or was the brainchild of a greeting card company, but you can send e-cards and even coffee mugs to mark the occasion.
 I really think we need more than a day. In fact, 2008 could be the ''Coping With Uncertainty Year.'' (And no doubt, the commemoration will continue into this year as well.) Like so many others over the past year, my family faced job insecurity, investment losses and were even touched by the Bernard Madoff scandal.
 The year ended up with our jobs safe and our investments, well, no worse than anyone else's. But the feeling that life is increasingly chaotic and fragile remains. Most of us may intellectually agree with Benjamin Franklin that ''nothing is certain except death and taxes.'' But we still believe -- and this is particularly true of the baby boomer and younger generations -- that for the most part we're in control. And when that belief crumbles, we often do, too. 
 In fact, researchers have found that uncertainty can sometimes take a greater toll than bad news.
 Sarah A. Burgard, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Michigan, has for several years looked at how perceived job insecurity affects people's health.
 Drawing data from two separate longitudinal studies -- the Americans' Changing Lives survey and the Midlife in the United States survey -- Professor Burgard and her colleagues looked at almost 3,000 employed people below age 60.
 The subjects were divided between those who were worried about losing their jobs and those who were not so concerned. The survey was adjusted for gender, education and income, as well as for those who were more anxiety-prone in general and for those who had lost jobs in the past and, therefore, might be more worried about it in the future.
 Based on how participants rated their own physical and mental health, the academics found that people who felt chronically insecure about their jobs reported significantly worse overall health in both studies and were more depressed in one of the studies than those who had actually lost their jobs or had even faced a serious or life-threatening illnesses.
 ''Chronic stress is extremely damaging to your health,'' Professor Burgard said. ''I'm an academic and I'm going up for tenure. I know what uncertainty is. You're unable to make plans, unable to take action. You're waiting for the other shoe to drop.''
 Of course, not everyone reacts the same way to uncertainty. There are gamblers who get a charge out of playing the odds and thrive off risk. And there are some who may not love, but at least can tolerate, insecurity.
 And then there are those considered by researchers (and maybe some others as well) to be neurotic. That's not a clinical definition, but refers to people more anxious or easily stressed out, said Jacob Hirsh, a graduate student at the University of Toronto who has studied how different people respond to uncertainty.
 Mr. Hirsh was the lead author on a study, published in the October issue of the journal Psychological Science, which found that those considered higher on the neuroticism scale would prefer knowing something for sure -- even if it's negative -- than not knowing.
 In the study, 41 young men and women were given a personality survey to assess if they were more laid back or more anxiety-prone. Then they were fitted with electrode caps that measured brain activity as they completed different tasks.
 Mr. Hirsh and his colleagues looked at neural activity in a part of the brain called the anterior cortex, which is involved in conflict, uncertainty and monitoring errors.
 During the research, the participants were given a plus sign, meaning they performed the task well; a minus sign, meaning improvement was needed; or a question mark with no further explanation. 
 Those considered more neurotic demonstrated more brain activity in response to the question mark -- unclear feedback -- than to the negative feedback, while those who were considered less neurotic were not bothered by the question mark response, but were upset by the critical feedback, Mr. Hirsh said.
 Robert L. Leahy, director of the American Institute for Cognitive Therapy and a clinical professor of psychology at Weill-Cornell University Medical College, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, said the problem is that ''people who are anxious tend to equate uncertainty with a negative outcome.''
 Professor Leahy pointed to one study of students who predicted negative outcomes for various concerns, like an exam or a relationship. But follow-up studies found that 85 percent of the outcomes were neutral or even positive. 
 In addition, said Professor Leahy, who also wrote ''The Worry Cure,'' (Harmony, 2005), people underestimate their ability to cope with a bad situation. ''You can't just say don't worry and everything will turn out fine -- people will think you're an idiot,'' he said. ''But there's productive worry and unproductive worry. Productive worry is thinking about something you can do in the next 24 hours.'' 
 That could mean re-examining your investment portfolio, getting a real fix on your checking and savings balance or putting your resume together. Unproductive worry, on the other hand, Professor Leahy said, is fretting about whether the stock market and entire economy will decline by 25 percent -- something you can't do anything about. 
 There are ways to keep your sanity even in a world that seems increasingly crazy. Don't obsessively watch television or check the stock market online because people who are already worried tend to overvalue negative information, Professor Leahy said. That's known as confirmation bias. 
 But don't just stick your head in the sand, tempting as that may seem. If you have a real concern that can be addressed in a concrete way, ''get as much information as possible,'' said Jerilyn Ross, president of the Anxiety Disorders Association of America and author of ''One Less Thing to Worry About,'' to be published in April by Ballantine.
 If you're worried that you're going to lose your job, don't avoid the boss. ''Try and find out what is really going on,'' she said. ''Knowledge is power.''
 Also, put all this in some sort of context and remind yourself of the historical realities that many of us have been too eager to ignore in recent times. Markets have always gone up and down. So has real estate. Most jobs nowadays, are, in reality, temporary, and in any situation people should be trying to improve their skills.
 Finally, Professor Leahy said, try and put money in perspective.
 ''Your portfolio is not simply financial, but a life portfolio,'' he said. Although it's easy to nod and tune it out when you're told that money isn't everything, it helps to really focus on what is important in life besides making money, like your family relationships, friendships and your role in your community.
 ''You are not just a consumer product,'' he said. ''It will sound corny to some people, but if your life portfolio is greater than your financial portfolio, then you're diversified.''
 It's not going to be an easy ride, especially for those of us (ahem) who lean toward the high anxiety end of the spectrum. But the good news is that we have almost 11 months to prepare for the next ''Coping With Uncertainty Day.''

HEADLINE: Web Site Points the Way to Where Drinks Are on the House

BYLINE: By CARA BUCKLEY

 BODY:
Frank Leone does not just dislike Drambuie, the Scottish liqueur, he hates it. Its sweetness and thickness remind him, he says, of ''corn syrup straight from the jar.'' 
 Yet there he was the other night at the Slipper Room, a club with red velvet-lined walls on the Lower East Side, downing one Drambuie and soda and ordering another. Because while Mr. Leone, a 37-year-old personal trainer and musician, insisted that ''there's no amount of free liquor that would help me acquire a taste for Drambuie,'' he does have an acquired taste for free drinks.
 He is among the growing audience of myopenbar.com, a Web site that lists where free drinks can be had across New York City each night. On this night, it was the Drambuie Variety Show, which meant that all who got in the door were entitled to all the Drambuie they could drink, courtesy of the liqueur's vendor. The Slipper Room was packed by 7:30 p.m., a long line snaking around the corner outside. 
 Myopenbar.com has been around since 2005 but is now attracting more listings, promotions and readers than ever, despite -- or perhaps because of -- the tanking economy and shrinking advertising dollars and liquor sales at bars. The site's founders, Seva Granik and Jason Fried, said that more bars and restaurants are clamoring to get their events listed, eager to drive customers through the door. And, to no one's surprise, demand for free drinks is skyrocketing. (Liquor sales are considered recession-proof, though one recent study by the Nielsen Company suggests that while sales at liquor stores have increased, people are going out to nightclubs and bars far less frequently.)
 ''The bad economy is doing nothing but helping us,'' Mr. Granik wrote in an e-mail message. ''We're probably the only company we know of that's doing very well because of the downturn.''
 Myopenbar.com has 30,000 subscribers in New York, most of them in their 20s and 30s, the very demographic that liquor companies want to reach. The site also has listings for five other cities (Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Miami and Honolulu) that have attracted 19,000 subscribers, and it has 30 employees. Mr. Granik, 33, and Mr. Fried, 34, declined to say how much revenue the site generates, but they said it was profitable, both through advertising (Toyota Scion and American Apparel are among the sponsors) and the consulting fees that they collect for holding, marketing and promoting events. Those events are noted on the site; otherwise, bars and liquor companies do not have to pay to be listed.
 Lauren Goldberg, who is 23 and works in publishing, said the events listed at myopenbar.com suit her because she would be watching her budget even if the economy was not in crisis. ''Normally I could not afford this fine liqueur,'' she said, taking a sip of a Drambuie fizz. 
 Myopenbar.com does not only promote Drambuie events, though it has listed so many of them that Mr. Fried has begun using the liqueur in his cooking, especially in glazes. As often as not, the site lists places that offer free beer or vodka, restaurants that serve free wine, and brunch spots that allow diners to bring their own bottles.
 It started with Mr. Granik, then a broke musician living in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, who simply forwarded text messages to his friends about various open bars around town. Demand grew, so he launched a crude Web site that Mr. Fried, a Web designer he had met through a friend's band, helped to fine-tune. Within six months, 3,000 people had signed up for weekly e-mail blasts. By mid-2006, there were 18,000 subscribers, and a lot more places offering open bar nights. 
 ''We watched open bars as a culture explode, along with this new avenue of promotion,'' Mr. Granik said.
 Mr. Granik and Mr. Fried rented space in the Decker Building in Union Square, which used to house Andy Warhol's Factory, and thus did their empire grow. A hallmark of the site is its honesty, and its edge. Each event is rated on a scale of 1 to 5 designated with small icons -- cocktail glasses -- and accompanied by a brief descriptive paragraph.
 ''If something's not good, we'll say so,'' Mr. Fried said. 
 One recent posting: ''Who goes to the East Village anymore? Every time I come through, I'm up to my ears in fossils wearing studded jackets and guyliner.''
 Another said: ''Two hours of free top-shelf vodka on a Wednesday night draw a thin line betwixt an asset and a liability. Ever the optimists, we'll opt for the former.''
 And then there was this, about a club on Broome Street: ''I need a vacation from this place. I love you Happy Ending, but I snuck into you when I was too young, and now that I'm older, being inside you makes me feel like a 40-year-old hooking up with a spring break coed in South Padre.''
 Even though Mr. Granik and Mr. Fried say demand for their service has not abated, there has been a shift in who is promoting what: Drambuie notwithstanding, liquor giveaways have declined, they say, but more places are offering free beer and wine. 
 The number of people signing up for the weekly e-mail list continues to grow; Mr. Granik said 7,000 subscribers have joined since the summer.
 ''If there's ever a moment that you're going to love your drink,'' Mr. Fried said, ''it's going to be right now.''

Business, they say, has never been better.(PHOTOGRAPH BY G. PAUL BURNETT/THE NEW YORK TIMES)

HEADLINE: Bullishness Is Stirring (In Theory)

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
THE logic behind decoupling, one of 2007's big ideas, was that foreign markets and economies were strong enough to withstand an American recession. Then stocks plunged every bit as much overseas as here.
 The theory is proving more resilient than the markets. It is drawing new adherents who contend that decoupling was not the wrong idea but the right idea at the wrong time.
 Decoupling didn't work on the way down because foreign stock markets depended on a strong American economy more than the theory's advocates realized. The United States is the world's main importer of merchandise and exporter of bubbly sentiment, both of which were needed to sustain the bull market. 
 The rest of the world needed the United States, but the United States may not need the rest of the world to get a recovery started and keep it going. That will become clear, proponents of new-model decoupling predict, when American stocks break from the pack and start outperforming.
 In a recent Citigroup survey of portfolio managers, 39 percent predicted that American stocks would beat the global market this year, far more than any other asset class offered as an option.
 Komal Sri-Kumar, chief global strategist at TCW Group, a fund management arm of the French bank Societe Generale, was correctly skeptical and contrarian about decoupling a year or so ago, as the bear market was about to unfold. Conditions are much different today, and he has joined the consensus, expecting investors to be more discriminating in what they buy than what they sell. 
 ''Correlations across different asset classes have gone up a lot because there has been no place to hide,'' he said. ''In the next step, as the U.S. economy and equity market recover first, some emerging and European markets will still be moving downward. The decoupling that did not take place will take place as the market turns upward.''
 Jeremy Grantham, chief strategist at the portfolio manager GMO, points out that the coordinated movement in global markets over the last year is an exception to a long-running pattern. He recalled that stock markets throughout the developed world outperformed for about seven years until the last year or so. Before that, American stocks were stronger for nine years.
 ''The short-term correlations are a red herring and irrelevant to serious money management,'' Mr. Grantham said.
 He does not think that the world's economies are unrelated to one another. The expansion of global trade and capital flows, which could be the most significant economic development of the last 20 years, means ''we're all horribly coupled,'' he said.
 BUT that connection has created a widening disconnection, in his view, not between the United States and everything else but between emerging and developing economies.
 ''Growth rates in the developed world have been slowing without much fanfare for the last dozen years,'' Mr. Grantham said. ''I expect emerging markets to do much better and become the only game in town.''
 His version of decoupling may seem at odds with Mr. Sri-Kumar's, but they can be compatible. All it takes is time.
 Under Mr. Sri-Kumar's depiction, the American economy and stock market will begin to lose their edge as the recovery spreads around the world. Similarly, Mr. Grantham expects emerging markets to shine only after the ''current unpleasantness'' in the global economy and financial system abates and a recovery is under way.
 Mr. Grantham is so optimistic about long-run prospects for the developing world because its economies and societies are decoupling in important ways from those in mature countries. Population growth, university graduation rates, the ratio of workers to retirees, rates of saving and investment -- all factors that determine long-term growth rates -- are higher in the emerging world. In many cases they are rising there and falling in the West and Japan. With the outlook so promising in emerging markets, Mr. Grantham said, ''why wouldn't you invest there?''

HEADLINE: Data Shows Manufacturing Is Suffering In All Corners

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER; Jack Healy contributed reporting.

 BODY:
From Australia to Asia and Europe to the United States, the message on Wednesday in the latest economic reports was clear: manufacturing continued to slump amid the worst slowdown since the Great Depression.
 In the United States on Friday, a crucial measure of manufacturing activity fell to the lowest level in 28 years in December. The Institute for Supply Management, a trade group of purchasing executives, said its manufacturing index was 32.4 in December, down from 36.2 in November. 
 ''Manufacturing activity continued to decline at a rapid rate during the month of December,'' said Norbert J. Ore, chairman of the Institute for Supply Management Manufacturing Business Survey Committee. This index was at the lowest reading since June 1980, when it was 30.3 percent. 
 ''This report indicates that the U.S. economy was on even weaker footing than commonly believed as 2008 came to a close,'' said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR. ''Moreover, the signal from the export orders index is that the rest of the world is right there with us. Hardly a signal for economic recovery anytime soon.''
 In addition, Mr. Ore said, ''new orders have contracted for 13 consecutive months, and are at the lowest level on record going back to January 1948.''
 The new orders index was 22.7 percent in December, 5.2 percentage points lower than the 27.9 percent registered in November. 
 No industry sector surveyed reported growth in December; the jobs sector was particularly grim. The employment index was 29.9 percent in December, a decrease of 4.3 percentage points from November. That was the lowest reading since November 1982.
 In Europe, a closely watched index of purchasing managers showed manufacturing hit a low in December, falling to 33.9 from 35.6. Any reading above 50 signals growth, while a reading below 50 indicates contraction in manufacturing. Similarly grim readings in Australia, China and India highlighted how the Asia-Pacific region has become caught up in the global turmoil.
 In China, the purchasing managers' index by the brokerage firm CLSA showed the manufacturing sector had contracted for a fifth consecutive month. The survey showed the steepest decline in its history. 
 With five back-to-back purchasing index readings signaling contraction, ''the manufacturing sector, which accounts for 43 percent of the Chinese economy, is close to technical recession,'' said Eric Fishwick, head of economic research at CLSA in Hong Kong, in a note with the release. 
 The data added to the flood of statistical evidence from across the Asia-Pacific region showing that activity was slowing faster than previously thought as demand withers in the United States and Europe. 
 Australia's manufacturing index showed a seventh month of contraction, and a similar survey in India showed activity down for a second month in December. In South Korea, December data showed exports plummeted 17.4 percent from a year ago.
 President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea pledged on Friday that the government would go into emergency mode to pull the country out of its economic crisis.
 And in Singapore, the economy shrank 12.5 percent in the last quarter of 2008 from the previous period, causing the trade and industry ministry to lower its growth forecast for 2009. The ministry now expects Singapore's economy to shrink up to 2 percent, with only 1 percent growth at best. Previously, it had expected up to 2 percent growth. 
 The worsening data, combined with a stream of company profit warnings, production cuts and layoffs, raises the pressure on policy makers to step up their efforts to bolster their economies. 
 India on Friday cut its main interest rate by a full percentage point, to 5.5 percent, and took a series of steps to bring more money into the country. It also raised the limit on overseas investments in corporate bonds to $15 billion, from $6 billion, and will contribute 200 billion rupees ($4 billion), to increase the capital of state-run banks.
 Countries across the region were widely expected to make more interest rate cuts in coming weeks.
 ''China's economic outlook for 2009 will be best characterized as 'getting worse before getting better,' laying the foundation for a firmer recovery in 2010,'' said Qing Wang, chief economist for Greater China at Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong. 
 Mr. Wang expected growth to continue to slow in the first six months, before stimulus measures could take effect. ''The authorities have already made delivering economic growth a top policy priority by adopting a campaign-style policy execution approach,'' he said. 
 Mr. Wang expects interest rates to be cut aggressively by an additional 1.35 percentage points this year. The country's important one-year lending rate is 5.31 percent. He added that a $586 billion stimulus package announced in November ''is unlikely to be the first and only stimulus package for the entire year.''
 The package includes substantial infrastructure spending, which will begin to lead to increased activity once weather allows construction to begin in the spring. ''The stimulus package provides a short-term buffer for the economy, and other policy measures such as health care and land reforms will be a long-term growth driver. This should help the stock market at least to stabilize in 2009,'' said Yi Tang, general manager at Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management in Hong Kong. 
 ''We are seeing some encouraging signs that institutional investors are starting to consider putting money back into equities in China and the rest of Asia, hopefully in the next month or two,'' he said. ''But it will take longer for retail investors -- who are worried about their job prospects and the wider economy -- to go back into the market.''

HEADLINE: Debating the Wisdom of a Gas Tax

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''The Gas Tax'' (editorial, Dec. 27):
 Although I agree that higher gas prices are crucial to achieving important policy goals, your editorial does not address two critical questions: Will the public support paying more for gas, and can politicians push for a floor on gas prices without public support?
 It's unrealistic to expect our elected officials to risk getting voted out of office by imposing tough choices that we are unwilling to make ourselves. But our political leaders can ask us: Are we serious about energy independence? 
 Do we want to reduce the military burden of protecting our oil supplies? Do we want to free our foreign policy to deal with nations and nonstate actors who don't like us? Do we want to bring Iran to the bargaining table from a position of strength? Do we want to make alternative fuels competitive, reduce our carbon emissions and protect the environment?
 Merely talking about those goals will not be enough. We have to be willing to act to achieve them, and that means endorsing incentives to change our own behavior.
 We cannot continue making the same choices as a nation and as individuals and expect different results.
 When enough of us say we are willing to act, our elected officials will then have the political support for a floor price for gas.
 Daniel A. Simon New York, Dec. 27, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Your editorial praising the merits of a gas tax has two flaws.
 First, your own numbers show that it takes an exorbitant tax, or extremely expensive gas, to alter the buying and driving habits of Americans. 
 Do you honestly believe that a tax of $3 a gallon -- even a revenue-neutral one -- is anything but political suicide?
 Second, efficiency standards work better. Take refrigerators. As a result of regulations, today's refrigerators are as much as four times as efficient as those built in the 1970s, even though they're bigger and come with more gadgets. And they save consumers money.
 Economists favor a gas tax because it puts free-market principles first. If there's anything we should have learned this last year, it's that a deregulated free market is neither sacrosanct nor automatically efficient, and oil prices are exquisitely sensitive to demand.
 So we have a choice. Price our way to efficiency by making oil exorbitantly expensive, or use efficiency standards to lower prices by sending the market a long-term signal about the future demand for oil.
 To paraphrase Henry Ford, Americans should be entitled to buy any kind of car they want -- as long as it gets 100 miles a gallon.
 John Atcheson Rockville, Md., Dec. 27, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Keeping the price of gasoline high to stimulate demand for more fuel-efficient and alternative-fuel vehicles is a reasonable way to transition away from gas guzzlers.
 But the proposal you pass on from Robert Lawrence, an economist, is seriously flawed. A variable gasoline tax that fluctuates to keep gasoline prices at $4 to $5 a gallon will result in oil companies raising the price to exactly that, with no tax revenue to the government and huge profits to the oil companies.
 The best way to place a tax on gasoline is to impose a fixed-dollar amount -- $1 to $2 on each gallon of gasoline. Diesel fuel should also be taxed, with exceptions for large commercial trucks. No comparable tax should be placed on jet fuel. This tax should be offset with reductions in income taxes to avoid a negative effect on the economy.
 Robert Block Pleasanton, Calif., Dec. 28, 2008
 To the Editor:
 As someone raised in Minnesota who now lives in the Northeast, I think that the use of sport utilities with four-wheel drive is more than just a faddish choice for consumers. It is a matter of getting to work or to other destinations without suffering the delays of bad weather.
 All the gas taxes in the Treasury won't prevent many of us from anticipating the agony of snow drifts and life-threatening commutes. Should electric, fuel-sipping vehicles provide the ability to traverse America's poorly maintained Interstate roads and potholed state roads, we would be more than grateful. 
 But don't slam the auto industry for giving us what we needed when rear-wheel drive and a foot and a half of snow on unplowed side roads and mountain passes could delay travel or even lead to fatalities from exposure to subzero temperatures.
 Geoff Charles Coventry, R.I., Dec. 27, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Come to the gas pumps in our rural community early some morning. Watch working men fill working trucks with huge amounts of fuel. When you raise gas prices (by whatever means), you strike right at these people, who have trouble enough feeding and housing their families as it is.
 Donald Mintz Trumansburg, N.Y., Dec. 27, 2008

HEADLINE: Desperate Retailers Try Frantic Discounts and Giveaways

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
At a dealership on the outskirts of Miami, people who agree to buy one Dodge Ram truck can get a second truck or car -- free. In 415 supermarkets across the East, customers who bring in a prescription can walk out with free antibiotics. And one clothing chain, not to be outdone, has started offering three suits for the price of one.
An era of desperation marketing is at hand, with stores and automobile dealerships adopting virtually any tactic that might grab the attention of frightened consumers. 
After one of the worst holiday seasons in decades, businesses are doing whatever they can to clear their shelves and make way for spring merchandise. Sales of 50 percent off stopped capturing the attention of customers weeks ago, so stores are layering discounts on top of discounts, and trying to lure shoppers with promises of giveaways, bulk bargains and other gimmicks.
''Retailers are trying everything in the book,'' said C. Britt Beemer, chairman of America's Research Group, a consumer research firm. ''You're seeing things like, 'Buy one, get two free.' That's just unheard of, and the item you're buying isn't even full price.''
He added, ''When you're advertising those sorts of price points, you're just trading trash for cash. There's no strategy. You're just trying to get rid of it.''
For stores, offers like free antibiotics, three-for-one sweaters and 90-percent-off Sony PlayStations are usually ''loss leaders,'' a retailing term for sweet deals meant to drive traffic. The stores hope not only to clear out merchandise that is not moving, but also to draw in customers who will spend money on other items.
With sales of clothing, electronics, luxury goods and more down by double digits in the dismal economy, these loss leaders are more important than ever, analysts said. Stores began discounting long before the holiday season and slashed prices even more as Christmas approached, but the sales alone were not enough to clear away winter inventory.
''Fear is very high right now,'' said Dan de Grandpre, editor of the Web site DealNews. ''What you're going to see is retailers do as much as they can to be as creative as possible. You're going to see more of this aggressive and sometimes panicky discounting from apparel stores and electronics stores.''
At the Samsonite outlet in Castle Rock, Colo., two free pairs of boots come with the purchase of one pair; similarly, at the home furnishings store Domestications, three throw rugs go for the price of one. Toys ''R'' Us had three-for-one Crayola products, and there were three-for-one cashmere sweaters at Off Fifth, the Saks outlet chain, according to news reports.
''They had so many freebies,'' said Carrie Koors, who lives in Cincinnati and writes a blog about bargain-hunting. ''It was really a great holiday season to shop and get stuff for next season.''
Of course, selling items at two- or three-for-the-price-of-one is effectively just a fat discount on each item.
But Dan Ariely, a professor of behavioral economics at Duke University, says the word ''free'' can work psychological magic on reluctant consumers.
''When you offer something for free it's more exciting,'' said Mr. Ariely, the author of ''Predictably Irrational.'' ''We don't think of it in the same way. We just get tempted, because we think of it as only having pluses and no negatives. Free is like a whole new category.''
And so the deals keep multiplying. The clothing company PacSun is offering a $10 discount coupon that allows customers to buy $9.99 T-shirts and slippers for only the cost of shipping. A Ford dealership in San Mateo, Calif., is offering a free scooter with the purchase of every 2009 Ford F-150. And shoppers at Jos. A. Bank can buy three suits for the price of one, while customers at Stop & Shop and Giant Food supermarkets can get free antibiotics to treat their winter ailments -- with a doctor's prescription, of course.
''We're going to take a leadership role in the industry, and we're going to be different,'' said Faith Weiner, Stop & Shop's director of public affairs.
In Davie, Fla., University Dodge dreamed up a ''Buy 1 ... Get 2!'' deal to attract the attention of potential customers and whittle excess inventory, which had spilled onto the lot next door. So far, the dealership has sold 40 vehicles under the promotion, which promises customers a free Dodge Ram, Dodge Caliber or PT Cruiser if they buy a 2008 Ram.
''Most people think we're crazy,'' said Ali Ahmed, the sales manager. ''More than anything, it's a way to catch the customer's interest than to just offer a percentage or dollar amount off. They've heard that before.''
The dealership has advertised its two-for-one car sale online and in newspapers, Mr. Ahmed said, and customers have been calling and showing up to see whether the sale is a gag. But it is no joke from Mr. Ahmed's point of view: an estimated 900 auto dealerships out of 20,770 nationwide went out of business in 2008, according to industry estimates, and Mr. Ahmed said he did not want to join the thousands likely to close this year.
''It's a tough environment,'' he said. ''Of the dealers around you now, you know some of them aren't going to be on the map next year. If you can steal a little bit of market share now, you're not going to be one of those.''

HEADLINE: Rangel Pushed School; Insurer Pushed Tax Cut

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

 BODY:
On April 21, 2008, Representative Charles B. Rangel met with officials of the American International Group, the now-troubled insurance giant, to ask for a donation to a school of public service that City College of New York was building in his honor.
 Mr. Rangel had already helped secure a $5 million pledge for the project from a foundation controlled by Maurice R. Greenberg, one of the company's largest shareholders and its former chief executive. And C.C.N.Y. officials, according to the school's own records, had high hopes for A.I.G. -- a donation of perhaps as much as $10 million.
 The company has never made a contribution. But less than a month after Mr. Rangel met with its officials, the company turned to the congressman for help: A senior A.I.G. executive who had attended the fund-raising meeting wrote a letter directly to Mr. Rangel, chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, urging him to support a provision of a tax bill that would save A.I.G. millions of dollars a year, according to Joseph M. Norton, a company spokesman. 
 Mr. Rangel's exchange with A.I.G. last spring appears to be at odds with the public statements he has made since his fund-raising for the school became an issue. When his approach to A.I.G. was first reported in The Washington Post in July, Mr. Rangel said that he could not recall any issues his committee might have considered in which A.I.G. had an interest.
 ''I can't think of one piece of legislation that impacts them, and there has never been a time that they've raised any legislation to me,'' the paper quoted Mr. Rangel as saying. Indeed, in Mr. Rangel's formal submission to the House ethics committee, asking it to review his use of Congressional stationery in soliciting money for the school, he wrote, ''So far as I am aware, none of those whom I wrote had any pending requests into my office, lobbied me regarding any legislation before my committee, or asked me for assistance on legislation in which they had a special interest.''
 Mr. Rangel, who had opposed the tax change A.I.G. was seeking -- part of a much bigger piece of legislation -- ultimately allowed it to be added to a bill he sponsored. Mr. Rangel's aides, and fellow Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee, say that he agreed to the bill only after being persuaded by other members of Congress that it would help an array of American companies weather the economic uncertainty.
 After Mr. Rangel's office was asked in recent days about the letter from A.I.G., Janice Mays, counsel to the Ways and Means Committee, said a search of the committee's records had not turned up a copy of it. But she said Mr. Rangel had already changed his mind about the tax provision before A.I.G. says it sent him the letter.
 Federal statutes and House ethics rules forbid members of Congress from asking for anything of value from a person or company with business before them.
 Ms. Mays said those rules did not prohibit members of Congress from raising money for nonprofit organizations, even from people or companies with interests before the government. And she said Mr. Rangel's representation to the ethics committee last summer concerned only those instances in which he had written to potential donors on Congressional stationery, not those he might have met with personally in seeking donations. 
 A review of Congressional records indicate that A.I.G. had interests in a number of issues before Mr. Rangel -- both prior to Mr. Greenberg's gift and the congressman's solicitation of A.I.G., and afterward.
 Records kept by the Clerk of the House of Representatives indicate that during the past two years, A.I.G. has paid lobbyists to push for changes in at least 10 bills that have been handled by the Ways and Means Committee, including the $700 billion bailout bill that passed in October to stabilize the financial markets. 
 A.I.G. lobbyists, the records show, pushed for legislative items that would lower taxes on various life insurance products, offer foreign tax credits to multinational corporations and lower the corporate tax rate. The company's financial services arm hired lobbyists to oppose a push to tax private equity income at a higher rate and to shape new reporting requirements for investment firms.
 And because A.I.G. does business around the globe, the company also lobbied on trade issues, which are handled by the Ways and Means Committee.
 The available public record shows that A.I.G. prevailed in some of its lobbying efforts and failed in others.
 Asked two weeks ago to provide a detailed accounting of Mr. Rangel's dealings with A.I.G. officials and lobbyists regarding legislation during the past two years, the congressman's spokesman and lawyer have said they are unable to complete such a time-consuming task during the holidays. And they challenged the fairness of the request.
 The New York Times this week sought a response from Mr. Rangel himself about whether, in general terms, he had any reservations about seeking the money and meeting with A.I.G. officials, and a major shareholder, given what the record suggests were the company's interests before his committee.
 Ms. Mays wrote on Friday: ''The law expressly permits members of Congress to engage in fund-raising activity on behalf of nonprofits such as C.C.N.Y. and recognizes that donations will inevitably coincide with legislative activity.''
 Ms. Mays said the $10 million figure contained in C.C.N.Y. records as the possible size of an A.I.G. contribution represented ''an appropriate request'' at that time ''given the company's other support for nonprofit educational activities.''
 Mr. Norton, the A.I.G. spokesman, said there was no connection of any kind between Mr. Rangel's bid for a donation and the company's lobbying on the tax matter.
 A.I.G., one of the world's 20 largest corporations, has been at the center of several public crises during the past year. 
 In September, the company received an $85 billion federal bailout when its possible bankruptcy threatened to further undermine the teetering economy. Two months later, after an intensive lobbying effort involving the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve, terms of that financial rescue were enhanced and the amount of federal money involved swelled to $150 billion. 
 Details of the bailout have been negotiated primarily by the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve. Mr. Rangel's aides have said he played no role in the bargaining. Democratic Congressional leaders who have been consulted by the Treasury Department about how much government assistance A.I.G. should receive and how the bailout should be structured said the congressman's aides were correct.
 ''To say that Chairman Rangel has had minimal involvement in the bailout negotiations would be overstating things,'' said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.
 Mr. Greenberg, who has clashed publicly and in lawsuits with the executives who succeeded him after he was forced out of A.I.G. in 2005, has been highly visible as the company's problems have made it a ward of the federal government. 
 Mr. Greenberg has not returned repeated telephone calls over the past month requesting an interview about his dealings with Mr. Rangel and his donation to C.C.N.Y. A spokesman for C. V. Starr, the investment fund headed by Mr. Greenberg, said last week that Mr. Greenberg was out of the country and could not be reached.
 Mr. Rangel's spokesman on the Ways and Means Committee declined to say whether the congressman had spoken with Mr. Greenberg about his strategy to persuade federal officials to revise the tax-funded rescue plan, but said in an e-mail message, ''The bailout appears to have done nothing to benefit Mr. Greenberg as a shareholder, with the value of A.I.G. stock dropping from $60 at the beginning of the year to $1.50 a share.''
 At a news conference last summer, Mr. Rangel said that he and Mr. Greenberg had forged a friendship based on their service in the Korean War, during which both men were awarded a Bronze Star for valor.
 So in July 2006, when Mr. Rangel wrote to 100 philanthropic organizations seeking support for the C.C.N.Y. project, one was sent to an administrator at the Starr Foundation, where Mr. Greenberg serves as the chairman. The foundation did not make a donation in 2006, according to C.C.N.Y. officials. In March 2007, two months after Mr. Rangel had been elevated to Ways and Means chairman, he wrote a letter directly to Mr. Greenberg, using his Congressional stationery.
 By the end of the year, Mr. Greenberg had pledged $5 million, by far the largest contribution to a project that has raised $11 million to date.
 Ms. Mays said the Starr Foundation had a ''well-established record of charitable giving,'' and was ''a logical potential source of funding for C.C.N.Y.''
 In 2008, Mr. Rangel participated in a meeting with officials at A.I.G., to ask for their support. Mr. Norton, the A.I.G. spokesman, said that the purpose of the meeting was to ask whether A.I.G. would make a financial contribution to C.C.N.Y., although he did not know whether a specific dollar figure was discussed. Mr. Rangel and the C.C.N.Y. officials left the meeting without a commitment.
 But several weeks later, in a letter dated May 13, Edward T. Cloonan, the highest-ranking A.I.G. official who attended the fund-raising meeting with Mr. Rangel, wrote to the congressman asking him to support the extension of a tax provision designed to help American-based multinational companies lower their obligation to the I.R.S., which was set to expire. Mr. Rangel, who had announced plans to add an array of ''tax extenders'' to an energy bill he was preparing to introduce that month, opposed extending the specific measure Mr. Cloonan and A.I.G. were lobbying for. 
 The measure, known as the ''subpart F active financing exception,'' would benefit a broad coalition of American companies, including hundreds of financial services firms, and according to estimates by the nonpartisan Joint Taxation Committee would cost the Treasury $3.97 billion in revenue in 2009 and 2010. A.I.G., which Congressional records indicate spent more than $9.5 million on lobbying in 2008, had its own lobbyists and three outside firms pushing to extend the measure.
 By early May 2008, concern about the damage that American businesses would suffer if the tax break was allowed to expire had grown so great that Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee held two meetings to ask Mr. Rangel to extend it.
 Representative Joseph Crowley, a Democrat from Queens, said he pressed the issue because it helped Citigroup, a major employer in his district. At least two committee caucus meetings to discuss many aspects of the legislation followed -- on May 7 and May 13 -- and Mr. Rangel relented, Mr. Crowley said, and agreed to extend the measure for one year. 
 ''While Chairman Rangel opposed extending the provision this year, a majority of the Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee supported doing so and the chairman listened to his membership,'' Congressman Crowley said in an e-mailed statement.
 On the date of the second caucus meeting, Mr. Cloonan wrote to Mr. Rangel, according to Mr. Norton. ''We urge the Ways and Means Committee to include the tax provision commonly known as subpart F exception for active financing income in the current round of tax extenders legislation,'' the letter said, according Mr. Norton.
 Mr. Crowley's spokeswoman said the congressman was unaware A.I.G. had written Mr. Rangel about the matter and had thought that ''due to other distractions, A.I.G. was not active in lobbying the issue.''
 The spokeswoman, Angela Barranco, in a statement Friday, said Mr. Rangel had changed his mind after the May 7 meeting. Mr. Rangel's aides say that a document dated May 12 from the nonpartisan joint committee on taxation indicated that he had signed off on the provision.
 Mr. Rangel included the provision in the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act of 2008, which was introduced on May 14 and which passed the House a week later, then stalled in the Senate over the summer. 
 But in September, after the House of Representatives rejected the first attempt to pass a $700 billion bill intended to stave off the collapse of the banking system, leaders in the Senate revived Mr. Rangel's bill as part of a compromise that won approval in both houses.
 ''There is simply no connection between Chairman Rangel's advocacy on behalf of an educational institution in his district and legislation affecting A.I.G.,'' Ms. Mays said.

HEADLINE: Oil Opens the Year by Moving Higher, but Not Echoing the Increases of 2008

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
One year after crude oil eclipsed $100 a barrel for the first time, the new year's trading began Friday with prices roughly half their year-earlier levels, and some believe oil could be headed even lower. 
 Oil markets started 2009 with crude settling above $46 a barrel. Several factors were probably at work, including continued violence in Gaza and expectations that OPEC would carry out its largest production cut ever. Market activity was also light as many traders took a long holiday weekend, and that can lead to price swings. ''I have a feeling, more than anything, it's the thin trading conditions pushing the price higher,'' said Peter C. Beutel of the energy consultancy Cameron Hanover. 
 Oil for February delivery rose $1.74 to settle at $46.34 a barrel in New York trading.
 A year ago, crude oil's surge into triple digits for the first time was the start of a climb that peaked above a settle price of $145 a barrel in July. Since then, amid fears of a prolonged recession and crumbling worldwide demand, crude prices have plunged more than 70 percent.
 The same gloomy economic data that drove prices into the mid-$30s in the final month of the year continued into 2009.
 In other markets, interest rates rose.
 The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 1 16/32, to 112 2/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 2.37 percent from 2.21 percent late Wednesday.
 A private group's measure of manufacturing activity fell more than expected in December, hitting the lowest reading in 28 years as new orders and employment continued to decline. The Institute for Supply Management, a trade group of purchasing executives, said its manufacturing index fell to 32.4 in December, from 36.2 in November. 
 Any reading above 50 signals growth, while a reading below 50 indicates contraction. 
 A weakened manufacturing industry suggests that demand for energy will not rebound any time soon. 
 The Energy Department said Friday that it planned to take advantage of the huge drop in crude prices and was soliciting bids to buy 12 million barrels of oil to replenish the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
 The reserve is an emergency depot maintained by the Energy Department. It can hold as much as 727 million barrels of oil in salt caverns along the Gulf of Mexico. 
 The agency said the new supplies would replace those used after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita severely crimped oil supplies in 2005.
 Concerns that the week-old renewal of fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza could disrupt supplies in the Middle East helped keep prices from falling further earlier this week.
 The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which accounts for about 40 percent of global supply, has announced production cuts of more than four million barrels a day in the last few months. Analysts say crude's direction in the early part of 2009 will be linked largely to whether members of the cartel adhere to the new quotas.

AUSTRALIA AND BRITAIN BALK
At Request to Take Detainees
Australia balked at American requests to accept yet more detainees from the prison at Guantanamo Bay would be accepted. Britain expressed a similar reluctance. The prison has stirred up controversy worldwide, and the goal of closing it has become a major undertaking for the United States government. The Bush administration has approached Australia twice and appealed to others around the world to help resettle the 60 inmates who have been cleared for release, but cannot be sent to their home countries. Page A6
ISRAEL LETS FOREIGNERS LEAVE GAZA
Israel's bombing of Hamas and targets in the Gaza strip has just reached the one-week mark. Israel allowed hundreds of foreigners, many of them married to Palestinians, to leave the area. This move has given rise to fears that Israel may escalate its attacks. It has already pledged to continue the campaign until there are no more rockets being fired out of Gaza. Page A5 
SRI LANKA CLAIMS VICTORY
Sri Lanka announced the capture of the de facto rebel capital, Kilinochchi. It was a symbolic victory over the Tamil separatists who have been trying to create a homeland of their own. The announcement seemed to have an effect, if not the desired one, when a suicide bomber on a motorcycle detonated his device at the Sri Lankan Air Force headquarters, killing at least two other people.

PAKISTAN REOPENS VITAL PASS
The Khyber Pass was briefly reopened by Pakistan after a three-day closure as part of a military action against Taliban guerrillas. The pass is the most important supply route for American and NATO troops fighting the Taliban in neighboring Afghanistan. Page A6
EGYPT'S SILENCE WORRIES ARABS
Egypt, which often plays the role of intermediary between Israel and the Arab world, has made public statements disapproving of Hamas's actions resulting in a new Israeli bombing campaign in Gaza. There has been mounting public pressure for Egypt to be more forceful in its support of the Palestinians. Instead there has been relative silence from Cairo and an apparent lack of pressure on the United States to intervene. Page A7
TRIBAL MEETING BOMBED IN IRAQ
A meeting of tribal leaders to discuss national reconciliation efforts in Iraq was attacked when a member of the tribe detonated an explosive vest, killing at least 24 of them and wounding 42 others, government officials said. The meeting took place at the house of an influential Sunni sheik in a region that was formerly a hotbed of insurgents until local leaders turned against Al Qaeda and began to support the American military.

HEADLINE: Governors Seek $1 Trillion in Federal Aid Over 2 Years

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
Gov. David A. Paterson joined governors from several other large states on Friday in ramping up their calls for assistance from the federal government, asking for a total of $1 trillion for all 50 states over two years. 
 The money would finance schools, public works projects, social services and tax cuts for the middle class, according to an economic stimulus plan presented by the governors.
 Gov. Deval L. Patrick of Massachusetts said, ''We're really talking about a bridge from where we are today to where we think the economy will be in two years' time.'' He spoke during a conference call in which he was joined by Mr. Paterson and the governors of New Jersey, Ohio and Wisconsin. All five men are Democrats.
 States are forecasting budget deficits over the next two years that total nearly $100 billion, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. That projection has intensified the push from states for federal assistance.
 Economic relief was the focal point at the National Governors Association meeting last month in Philadelphia, where President-elect Barack Obama pledged to work toward helping states solve their budget problems. But he also warned that as a nation, Americans cannot just ''keep on printing money.''
 Mr. Patrick said that while Mr. Obama and his incoming administration were well aware of the hardships states face and were ''very receptive'' to the idea of offering help, ''it's by no means a done deal.''
 The large amount of assistance requested on Friday would still not allow states to avoid much of the cuts already planned. 
 ''We should make this very clear,'' Mr. Paterson said, adding, ''Our situation is so dire that even the greatest assistance from the federal government, the one we are proposing here today, will still not alleviate us from the responsibility of some rather severe action.''
 What the governors have proposed -- sizable government spending at a time when the federal deficit is growing ever bigger -- is, in principle, something that some economists have criticized as financially irresponsible. Mr. Obama's economic stimulus package would also rely heavily on deficit spending.
 Gov. Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey said the $1 trillion figure was comparatively small as a portion of the nation's $14.4 trillion gross domestic product. 
 ''One trillion dollars sounds like a lot of money, and is a lot of money,'' Mr. Corzine said. ''It is important to think about this in the overall size of the G.D.P., and in there it is not shockingly large.''
 Without assistance, the governors warned, school financing and social services programs would be put in even greater jeopardy. 
 ''We're not crying wolf,'' Gov. Ted Strickland of Ohio said. ''This is a real crisis. These are real problems.''

HEADLINE: In Obama's Team, 2 Camps on Climate

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In the fall of 1997, when the Clinton administration was forming its position for the Kyoto climate treaty talks, Lawrence H. Summers argued that the United States would risk damaging the domestic economy if it set overly ambitious goals for reducing carbon emissions.
 Mr. Summers, then the deputy Treasury secretary, said at the time that there was a compelling scientific case for action on global warming but that a too-rapid move against emissions of greenhouse gases risked dire and unknowable economic consequences. 
 His view prevailed over those of officials arguing for tougher standards, among them Carol M. Browner, then the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and her mentor, Al Gore, then the vice president.
 Today, as the climate-change debate once again heats up, Mr. Summers leads the economic team of the incoming administration, and Ms. Browner has been designated its White House coordinator of energy and climate policy. And Mr. Gore is hovering as an informal adviser to President-elect Barack Obama. 
 As Mr. Obama seeks to find the right balance between his environmental goals and his plans to revive the economy, he may have to resolve conflicting views among some of his top advisers. 
 While Mr. Summers's thinking on climate change has evolved over the last decade, his views on the potential risks to the economy of an aggressive effort to limit carbon emissions have not. But he now works for a president-elect who has set ambitious goals for addressing global warming through a government-run cap-and-trade system.
 It may once again prove to be Mr. Summers's role to inject a rigorous economist's reality check into the debate over the scope and speed of an attack on global warming. 
 According to a transition official familiar with Mr. Summers's thinking, he is wary of moving very quickly on a carbon cap, because doing so could raise energy costs, kill jobs and deepen the current recession. He foresees a phase-in of several years for any carbon restraint regime, particularly if the economy continues to be sluggish, a slower timetable than many lawmakers and environmentalists are pressing.
 Mr. Summers and Peter R. Orszag, the economist whom Mr. Obama has designated director of the White House budget office, have both argued that a tax on carbon emissions from burning gasoline, coal and other fuels might be a more economically efficient means of regulating pollutants than a cap-and-trade system, under which an absolute ceiling on emissions is set and polluters are allowed to buy and sell permits to meet it.
 But Mr. Obama and Ms. Browner have ruled out a straight carbon tax, perhaps mindful of the stinging political defeat the Clinton administration suffered in 1993 when, prodded by Mr. Gore, it proposed one. 
 Mr. Obama was asked in a television interview last month whether he would consider imposing a stiff tax on gasoline, whose price has now fallen to below $2 a gallon after cresting above $4 a gallon last summer.
 He replied that while American families were getting some relief at the pump, they were hurting in other ways, through rising unemployment and falling home values. ''So putting additional burdens on American families right now, I think, is a mistake,'' he said. 
 At least for the present, then, the idea of a carbon tax has been shelved, and Mr. Obama's economic and environmental advisers are working, along with Congress, to devise a cap-and-trade system.
 But difficult debates lie ahead within the White House, between the White House and Congress, and within the Democratic Party, whose deep divisions on climate change break down along ideological and geographical lines. 
 The fight in November between two Democrats, Representatives John D. Dingell of Michigan and Henry A. Waxman of California, for the chairmanship of the House Energy and Commerce Committee was a preview. It pitted lawmakers from auto- and coal-producing states against liberal lawmakers from California and the East Coast, Blue Dog fiscal conservatives against environmentalists, pro-business moderates against regulatory activists. Mr. Waxman, with the tacit support of the Obama camp and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, won, but narrowly.
 That was just a taste of the broader and potentially more bitter fight over global warming and energy legislation, which will have profound implications for the American economy, the environment and foreign policy.
 Both sides -- those seeking strict enforcement of emissions limits and those concerned about higher energy costs and potential job losses -- will find receptive ears in the new White House, Obama aides and outside analysts said.
 ''There is a diversity of opinion among Democrats over the best way to contain costs associated with a climate change plan,'' said Scott Segal, a utility lobbyist in Washington, who cited rival approaches pushed by Senator Barbara Boxer of California, chairwoman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
 ''I think there is room within the current range of administration advisers to accommodate all those points of view,'' Mr. Segal said. 
 The Obama transition did not make Ms. Browner or Mr. Summers available for on-the-record interviews. A spokesman, Nick Shapiro, said that Mr. Obama had appointed advisers with differing views but that ultimately he would set policy.
 ''At the end of the day,'' Mr. Shapiro said in an e-mail statement, ''the advisers will be charged with implementing President-elect Obama's strong targets that set us on a course to reduce emissions to their 1990 levels by 2020 and reduce them an additional 80 percent by 2050. However, the president-elect appointed a cabinet with diverse views and looks forward to strong debate within the cabinet on how best to achieve those outcomes.'' 
 Emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by the United States in 2007 were about 15 percent above 1990's level, according to the Department of Energy.
 In past public statements and writings, Ms. Browner and Mr. Summers have wrestled with the difficult choices posed by global warming and at times have come to different conclusions on how to minimize the impact on the economy.
 Ms. Browner has been a forceful advocate for strict carbon limits for years and has said that a comprehensive cap-and-trade system is the best way to achieve swift and certain reductions in emissions. She has said that the plan could include flexibility for carbon-emitting businesses by allowing them to bank and borrow permits, but she has not supported setting a maximum price or ''safety valve'' cost in case permits become prohibitively expensive, as Mr. Summers and Mr. Orszag have.
 She has urged Congress to take up the issue quickly in the new year. In September, in testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee, Ms. Browner pointedly noted that the Supreme Court had given the E.P.A. authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. She implied that if Mr. Obama was elected, the new administration might unilaterally seek to curb carbon emissions should Congress not act.
 ''Given the magnitude of the problem, and the scale of the solution required,'' she said, ''I believe it is important that Congress provide national leadership on this issue.''
 Mr. Summers believes a cap-and-trade program can be a workable solution, provided it includes some sort of escape clause if prices rise too quickly, according to several articles he has written in the past two years. He has also expressed a belief that developing nations must also adhere to carbon limits, or manufacturing jobs will migrate to countries without them.
 In a forum at the Brookings Institution a year ago, Mr. Summers said the current moment on climate change was analogous to that on health care in 1992: Everyone agreed that the current system was unsustainable, but there was less agreement on how to address the complexities and costs. There was a general expectation that with the inauguration of a new Democratic president, something would be done. 
 ''In the end,'' Mr. Summers said, ''what everyone agreed needed to happen didn't happen in 1993.''

HEADLINE: G.M.'s Secret Success

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN. 
William J. Holstein is the author of the forthcoming ''Why G.M. Matters: Inside the Race to Transform an American Icon.''

 BODY:
WITH billions of federal dollars flowing to General Motors, and with the incoming administration likely to discover that still more assistance is required, we can expect renewed calls for G.M.'s chief executive, Rick Wagoner, to lose his job as the price of failure. This view presupposes that Mr. Wagoner has not been willing to bring G.M. into line with the new global reality, that he has not designed cars Americans want to buy and that the company is a ''dinosaur,'' to quote Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama. 
 In reality, Mr. Wagoner has presided over the most sweeping transformation of G.M. since the 1920s. He has reversed management's long practice of meekly going along with the demands of the United Auto Workers, notably with a deal to transfer health care costs to a union-controlled trust over the next two years.
 During his tenure, as president, then as chief executive, Mr. Wagoner also put in place a previously unthinkable two-tier wage system to reduce the company's average cost per worker; halved the company's unionized work force in the United States through layoffs and plant closures; spun off Delphi Corporation, its largest parts supplier; and sold controlling interest of GMAC, its financing arm. 
 A decade ago, suggesting that Mr. Wagoner attempt these restructuring goals would have been ridiculed as unrealistic. But these moves have largely succeeded and by 2010 should strip $5,000 from the cost of every G.M. vehicle.
 The company has made enormous strides in imitating and improving upon Toyota's lean manufacturing system. At G.M. plants, gone are the mass assembly techniques pioneered by Henry Ford. Instead, workers are organized in small Japanese-style teams and encouraged to make sure problems are fixed on the spot rather than passed down the line. The quality gap between G.M. and Toyota has been closed.
 Mr. Wagoner has allowed his designers to recapture car design leadership with products like the Cadillac CTS, the Saturn Aura, the new Chevrolet Malibu and the revived and visually dazzling Camaro. The cliche that G.M. makes only gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles is years out of date.
 On the innovation front, Mr. Wagoner was responsible for introducing OnStar, the onboard communications and navigation system, and he has made a huge commitment to lithium-ion batteries, which will power the Chevrolet Volt, an extended-range electric vehicle. If the Obama administration wants to create new ''green'' industries here in the United States, these batteries represent a potential $150-billion-a-year opportunity.
 Lastly, Mr. Wagoner has globalized G.M. to a degree that it never has been before. The company's strong position in China has helped support the difficult turnaround effort in North America.
 Before the financial crisis tanked American automotive sales, Mr. Wagoner had almost guided the country's largest industrial company into a new era, demonstrating great resilience in the face of intense global competition. Making him a scapegoat might be politically expedient but it ignores the very tangible progress he has achieved.

HEADLINE: Will the Real Senate Please Be Seated

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

 BODY:
The opening of a new Congress is typically chaotic, what with dozens of overwhelmed new members and their families trying to navigate the Capitol, the associated pomp and circumstance and the usual power plays by one party or another to kick off the session.
 But the convening of the Senate on Tuesday promises to be one for the Congressional Record books. Two months after the November election, it is still unclear exactly who is going to be in the Senate for the next two years. Senators may want to replace the stately doors that lead onto the floor with the revolving variety. 
 The seats of Illinois and Minnesota are totally up for grabs. Senators from New York and Colorado have one foot out of the Capitol, and the identity of the new New Yorker remains a mystery. To top it off, the incoming vice president is to be sworn in as a senator Tuesday though he will be departing later this month to put on his new executive branch hat, which he will wear while occasionally presiding over the chamber.
 ''Just when you think it could not get any stranger, it keeps getting weirder and weirder,'' said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas.
 The tumult is hardly what Democrats envisioned when they celebrated the growth in their numbers to a near filibuster-proof level in the heady days after Nov. 4. With their new majority muscle, they were finally going to roll over stubborn Republicans and deliver all sorts of pent-up legislation for President-elect Barack Obama to sign the moment he got the keys to the Oval Office.
 Democrats could still find themselves with an impressive retinue of 59 senators, allowing them to work their legislative will. But they have some serious housekeeping matters to attend to first.
 ''Obviously, we didn't want to start out this way,'' said Jim Manley, senior communications strategist for Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader. ''We will do what we can to make the best of it.''
 Mr. Manley said that, despite the sideshows, Senate Democrats would prove ''we can walk and chew gum at the same time'' by forging ahead with the development of an economic recovery package in concert with Mr. Obama. He pointed to Monday's planned gathering of Mr. Obama, Mr. Reid and Speaker Nancy Pelosi on the economic legislation as evidence that any Senate contretemps will not prove to be a debilitating distraction.
 But there is a growing sense that one will need a scorecard to keep track of who's who, and the unsettled atmosphere is certain to influence the Senate's work. Not to mention that fights over seating senators could leave hard feelings and establish precedents that linger for years.
 And the leadership's decision to bar Roland W. Burris, the former Illinois attorney general, from taking Mr. Obama's seat because he was appointed by Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich in the middle of a federal criminal investigation could cost Democrats politically if they are seen to be unfairly refusing an African-American politician.
 The current Democratic strategy of barring Mr. Burris on the basis of his inability to get the Illinois secretary of state to countersign his Senate certificate could also come back to haunt Democrats if they try to install their candidate, Al Franken, as the new Minnesota senator before all the legal fights are exhausted in that state.
 Republicans, who are already vowing to filibuster any effort to seat Mr. Franken prematurely, say they find it hard to believe Democrats would try to put the former comedian in the Senate without proper credentials while denying a seat to Mr. Burris on essentially the same grounds.
 The new focus on the formal state credentials of incoming senators and the demand they be properly signed and sealed by the governor and secretary of state is already troubling some Senate officials. They worry that in the future, rogue governors or secretaries of state will simply refuse to sign the credentials of a senator they don't like, causing more problems. The Senate has the power to waive such requirements, but precedents are hard to roll back there.
 Even without all the fights, it is a bit jarring how much the makeup of the Senate has been altered since the election. Four senators are departing -- Mr. Obama, Vice President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware; Secretary of State-designate Hillary Rodham Clinton and Secretary of Interior-designate Ken Salazar. In comparison, the shifting in the House, with two lawmakers and several top staff members joining the administration, hardly registers.
 The Senate game of musical desks could come to an end in a few weeks. But given the way things have been going so far, don't count it.

HEADLINE: Forecasters See Fast Recovery; Others Doubt Their Eyesight

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Economics as the dismal science? Not in some quarters. 
 In the midst of the deepest recession in the experience of most Americans, many professional forecasters are optimistically heading into the new year declaring that the worst may soon be over.
 For this rosy picture to play out, they are counting on the Obama administration and Congress to come through with a substantial stimulus package, at least $675 billion over two years. 
 They say that will get the economy moving again in the face of persistently weak spending by consumers and businesses, not to mention banks that are reluctant to extend credit.
 If the dominoes fall the right way, the economy should bottom out and start growing again in small steps by July, according to the December survey of 50 professional forecasters by Blue Chip Economic Indicators. Investors seemed to be in a similarly optimistic mood on Friday, bidding up stocks by about 3 percent. 
 But in the absence of that government stimulus, the grim economic headlines of 2008 will probably continue for some time, these forecasters acknowledge. 
 ''Without this federal largess, the consensus forecast for 2009 is for the recession to continue through most of the year,'' said Randell E. Moore, executive editor of Blue Chip Economic Indicators, which conducts the monthly survey of forecasters. 
 Many economists are more pessimistic, of course. Nouriel Roubini at New York University, who called the 2008 market disaster correctly, wrote in a recent commentary on Bloomberg News that he foresees ''a deep and protracted contraction lasting at least through the end of 2009.'' 
 Even in 2010, he added, the recovery may be so weak ''that it will feel terrible even if the recession is technically over.''
 But Mr. Roubini is not among the economists surveyed by Blue Chip Economic Indicators. These professional forecasters are typically employed by investment banks, trade associations and big corporations. 
 They base their forecasts on computer models that tend to see the American economy as basically sound, even in the worst of times. That makes these forecasters generally a more optimistic lot than the likes of Mr. Roubini. 
 Their credibility suffered for it last year. They did not see a recession until late summer. One reason they were blindsided: their computer models do not easily account for emotional factors like the shock from the credit crisis and falling housing prices that have so hindered borrowing and spending.
 Those models also take as a given that the natural state of a market economy like America's is a high level of economic activity, and that it will rebound almost reflexively to that high level from a recession. 
 But that assumes that banks and other lenders are not holding back on loans, as they are today, depriving the nation of the credit necessary for a vigorous economy. 
 ''Most of our models are structured in a way that the economy is self-righting,'' said Nigel Gault, chief domestic economist for IHS Global Insight, a consulting and forecasting firm in Lexington, Mass.
 Even if the economy begins to right itself by this summer, the recession would still be the longest since the 1930s, which was the last time the government engaged in widespread public spending to overcome the persistent inertia in consumer and business spending. 
 ''The consensus says we are in the deepest part of the recession now,'' Mr. Moore said. ''But the stimulus package and much lower gasoline prices are expected to somewhat restore consumer confidence and personal spending and that will put us on the road back.''
 There is a psychological factor that Robert Shiller, a Yale economist, hopes will come into play.
 ''If we have massive infrastructure spending and people feel that it is working, it could create a sense that we are O.K. and people will go back to normal,'' he said. ''The real problem is that we are on hold. Everyone is.''
 The expectation of most forecasters, several report, is that most of the Obama administration's stimulus will go for public works projects and tax cuts. 
 With this sort of stimulus, the gross domestic product, the chief measure of the nation's output, should begin to rise -- if not in the third quarter, then certainly in the fourth, the forecasters say, and the unemployment rate will finally peak at 8 to 9 percent by early next year.
 ''The job insecurity is very serious; that is the worst aspect of all this,'' said Albert Wojnilower, a consulting forecaster at Craig Drill Capital. ''But most upturns in the economy have begun with upturns in consumption, when people who still have jobs stop worrying about losing them.'' 
 Like other forecasters, Mr. Wojnilower expects the just-ended fourth quarter to be the recession's worst, with the G.D.P. having contracted at a 4 or 5 or even 6 percent annual rate. Also like the others, he expects the economy to be growing again by the end of the year, although at an annual rate of 1 percent or less, which feels like a recession and is not enough to generate new jobs. 
 But the economy will no longer be contracting, and the recession that started in December 2007 will end at 18 or 21 months of age. The previous record holders, severe recessions in the mid-1970s and early 1980s, each lasted 16 months.
 ''I think that consumers are certainly in a state of shock right now, but their behavior is fundamentally rational,'' said Martin Regalia, chief economist at the United States Chamber of Commerce. ''They want to work, they want to make money and they want to spend that money. Above all they are resilient. They lick their wounds and with some help from government, they start back again and we come out of this quickly.''
 A key to the revival, in every forecast, is home construction and home prices. The latter are still falling, at an even faster pace, adjusted for inflation, than in the Great Depression, according to the S.& P./Case-Shiller Home Price Indices.
 That has the knock-on effect of multiplying foreclosures and trapping millions of people in homes that are worth less than their outstanding mortgages. Such circumstances inevitably depress spending and business investment.
 But housing will probably bottom out by spring, many forecasters now argue. The Federal Reserve will play a role in making this happen by buying mortgage-backed securities and, in doing so, lowering the rate on 30-year mortgages to less than 5 percent, which is roughly the present level. That will encourage not only home buying, but also refinancing.
 ''In the midst of recession, with very sour moods, housing activity begins to improve because we get a big decline in mortgage rates,'' said Robert Barbera, chief economist for ITT Investment Technology Group.
 Then, too, the basic demographic demand for new homes, the forecasters say, is 1.7 million units a year. That many are not being built today, but with inventories shrinking and prices stabilizing, home construction will revive, many forecasters argue, contributing once again to economic growth.
 ''It is not fun to be a portent of doom,'' Mr. Barbera said. ''And even now in these doomlike times, we in the forecasting profession say it won't last.''

HEADLINE: Shortchanging Voters

 BODY:
More than three years have gone by since the New Jersey Legislature required the state to install modern voting machines that provide printouts of each vote -- the paper trail that experts regard as essential to fair and accurate elections. The machines are still nowhere in sight. 
 Deadlines have been imposed and proved meaningless. The latest deadline was New Year's Day, which of course has passed. Technically, the state is in violation of its own law, but nobody seems to care. Gov. Jon Corzine has said he will do something without specifying what. 
 New Jersey's main problem is that for technical reasons it is virtually impossible to hook up a reliable printer to the Sequoia voting machines used in most of the state's voting precincts. One assemblywoman has called the printer attachment a ''Rube Goldberg'' contraption that could cause more problems than it solves. A public interest lawsuit to prohibit further use of the Sequoia machines on grounds they are easily tampered with is scheduled for trial this month. 
 Governor Corzine and the state's election officials must now face reality: New Jersey needs new machines altogether, preferably an optical scan system that allows voters to mark paper ballots -- much as students mark standardized tests in schools -- and then feed the ballots into the scanners.
 Mr. Corzine has argued that such a system, which he says could cost $80 million, is too expensive in view of the deep financial crisis and the state's huge deficit. The Coalition for Peace Action, which brought the lawsuit, says the true cost is less than half that. 
 Whatever the cost, the state must move ahead, and quickly. New Jersey is one of only a handful of states that do not provide a paper trail. And the 2009 elections -- when the governorship and all 80 seats in the Assembly will be up for grabs -- are not that far away.

HEADLINE: Gauging Risk to Paterson in Defying Conventional Wisdom

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
It has been opined on chat shows and blogs, insisted on publicly and whispered privately. It has somehow been concluded -- with delight in some quarters and aggravation in others -- that Gov. David A. Paterson has little choice but to appoint Caroline Kennedy, she of the royal political lineage, fund-raising prowess and pure star power, to the United States Senate.
''I've heard this a hundred times: 'He has to pick her,' '' said Erick C. Mullen, a Democratic political consultant who has worked extensively in New York. ''Or what? If he doesn't pick her, what happens?'' 
That question has not yet received much of an airing during Ms. Kennedy's audition for the Senate. Not unlike an overleveraged but venerable investment house, Ms. Kennedy is considered by many to be too big to fail.
But after her recent tour of upstate New York and a round of media interviews, it is not hard to find people who, like Mr. Mullen, ask how much, exactly, Mr. Paterson might risk should he not pick Ms. Kennedy.
One of the most common arguments made so far for selecting Ms. Kennedy is that, while she would enter the Senate as one of its most junior members, Ms. Kennedy, and thus New York, would have the ear of the president-elect, Barack Obama. That will come in handy, they say, when the Obama administration looks for ways to spend federal appropriations.
Ms. Kennedy's endorsement of Mr. Obama was a significant moment in the Democratic presidential primary and his affection for her seems genuine; he recently called her ''one of my dearest friends.'' Yet it is hard to calculate the size of his debt to Ms. Kennedy, or where it ranks among his many other obligations, from preventing a conflagration in the Middle East to passing a national economic stimulus package.
Moreover, New York's senior senator, Charles E. Schumer, is no slouch when it comes to delivering for his New York constituents. And some say it is difficult to imagine Mr. Obama somehow punishing Mr. Paterson or New York, fiscally or otherwise, if the Senate job goes to someone else.
''That's inconceivable,'' said Judith Hope, the former state Democratic Party chairwoman. ''It would not be in his self-interest,'' she said of Mr. Obama.
Another advantage to picking Ms. Kennedy -- or so it seemed a few weeks ago -- was that she might allow Mr. Paterson to avoid alienating his many friends and allies who want the job, like Thomas R. Suozzi, the Nassau County executive, and Representative Steve Israel, from Suffolk County. Nobody, the thinking went, could challenge Mr. Paterson for selecting a potential political star.
But Ms. Kennedy, by almost every account, has stumbled a bit during her entrance onto the New York political stage. Mr. Paterson would not be immune from upset, even among allies, were he to go ahead and appoint her.
''She was an out,'' said Lee M. Miringoff, the director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion. ''But the initial few salvos did not go her way.''
What is foremost on Mr. Paterson's mind, some say, is how his Senate appointment will affect the 2010 campaign. Given an array of qualified candidates, they say, Mr. Paterson will focus on who can hold onto the seat and whose presence on the ticket would most help him.
''You would hope that in the 2010 campaign, the aura from her reflects on him and helps him defeat a primary challenge and win a general,'' said George Arzt, a Democratic political consultant, who is close to another official interested in the Senate seat, Representative Carolyn B. Maloney.
Given the tens of millions of dollars it could take to hold the seat in 2010 and 2012, money is a major concern. Ms. Kennedy, perhaps alone among the candidates for the job, could tap a national donor network -- from Park Avenue to Beverly Hills -- to raise money. With that reach, she would compete less against Mr. Paterson and other officials for the real estate and financial industry dollars that fuel statewide campaigns in New York.
Ticket balance is also a consideration. Some of Mr. Paterson's advisers envision a Republican ticket headed by Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor, for governor, with Joanne M. Mahoney, the popular Onondaga County executive, as his running mate. Rounding out the ticket might be John J. Faso, the former assemblyman, for comptroller, and Peter T. King, the Long Island Republican, for Senate.
''That's a white Catholic ticket,'' said one person who has ties to the governor's political team, and who requested anonymity for fear of losing those ties. ''And it's white Catholics upstate they are going to lose.''
According to the tribal logic of New York politics, Mr. Paterson can expect strong support in New York City, among black voters and from staunch Democrats. Ms. Kennedy, a white Catholic, could help in the battleground suburbs of Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse. But the Democratic ticket already includes Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo, who is Catholic and already broadly popular in those places.
Picking Ms. Kennedy might assuage some number of women who feel that the seat, currently held by Hillary Rodham Clinton, should be filled by another woman. And Ms. Kennedy would certainly add balance to a ticket that is otherwise all men.
But so could other candidates, including Ms. Maloney and Representative Kirsten E. Gillibrand, who represents a large, mostly rural upstate district along New York's eastern border. There is no evidence yet that women voters have any particular affinity for Ms. Kennedy over other women up for the seat. Moreover, Mr. Paterson will have another chance to balance the 2010 ticket, when he picks his running mate for lieutenant governor.
Of course, every other candidate has drawbacks. Picking Mr. Cuomo could lead to a fight with the Legislature, which would appoint the new attorney general. Picking Ms. Gillibrand would anger her more senior colleagues. Choosing Ms. Maloney would add yet another Manhattanite to the ticket; Mr. Suozzi yet another Italian-American; Mr. Israel yet another Long Islander.
''The risk is in what he does,'' Mr. Miringoff said of the governor. ''Not picking her is one thing. But if he then picks someone who most of New York voters say 'Who?' -- that will need some quick explanation.''

HEADLINE: Ever a Critic, Barkley Lacks Credibility

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON. 
E-mail: hjaraton@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Back in the day when Charles Barkley was selected to be a basketball ambassador as a member of the original Dream Team, he introduced himself on the Olympic stage by putting the force of his 250-plus pounds behind an elbow planted in the modest chest of a player for the Angolan national team.
 The overmatched Angolan, Herlander Coimbra, had the audacity to contest a Barkley sortie to the rim during an American rout to launch the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona. 
 ''You hit me, I'll hit you, even if it doesn't look like he's eaten in a while,'' Barkley said, oblivious to the fact that his opponent was an economics student from a war-torn third-world nation who said his favorite N.B.A. player happened to be the one, the only and the occasionally ugly Sir Charles.
 Given a chance to sleep on that performance, to be a redeem teamer, Barkley said the next day that he was inclined to launch his elbow because he didn't know if Coimbra ''would pull a spear'' on him.
 Wouldn't you know it? His audience of reporters had a good laugh. A social critic of slapstick and stereotype got his international baptism. But when did Barkley, an I-man in his own right, become a broadcasting shock ex-jock whose opinions are accepted as serious commentary when he is so lacking in personal credibility?
 What makes Barkley -- who recently attacked Auburn, his alma mater, for not hiring an African-American football coach -- any more of a voice of reason on race than Don Imus? 
 When was Barkley anointed such an authority on professionalism that his criticism of LeBron James was aired and legitimized as if it had come from the almighty -- and not a player whose career greatest hits include spitting on a fan and throwing a bar patron through a plate-glass window?
 Earlier this season, Barkley accused James of being ''disrespectful to the game and disrespectful to the Cavaliers'' by acknowledging in interviews the possibility of a free-agent free-for-all for his services in 2010. Compared with Barkley, James has been an N.B.A. altar boy. He showed up as a teenager with more maturity and accountability than Barkley demonstrates at 45.
 ''He's stupid,'' James said of Barkley. Harsh, yes, but if the basketball shoe fits ... 
 We know Barkley is no role model. He told us that himself a long time ago, and he continues to prove it. His arrest early Wednesday morning on a misdemeanor drunken driving charge in Scottsdale, Ariz., was behaviorally true to form -- a man-child acting impulsively, living dangerously and ducking the consequences by trying to speak comically.
 According to a police report obtained by The Arizona Republic, Barkley showed his great respect for the female passenger in his sport utility vehicle by telling an officer he had run a stop sign because he was hurrying ''around the corner'' to have sex with her. After failing a field sobriety test and having his vehicle impounded, Barkley told another officer that he would ''tattoo your name'' on his behind if that would make the charge disappear.
 As an alternative tattoo, Barkley may want to consider plastering to his bald dome one of his favorite critiques for players in his cross hairs on TNT: knucklehead.
 That in itself is no crime, and certainly does not make him a rarity in sports or sports journalism. It is just time for responsible news media outlets to cast Barkley once and for all as a television clown, not as the conscience of basketball or future governor -- another good one -- of Alabama.
 Barkley's rationalizations of his publicized high-stakes gambling and losses have been rambling and at times ridiculous -- what you would expect from a man in need of counseling much more than a microphone. His history and lifestyle should always be a sub-context when he rants about contemporary players -- what you would expect if, say, Latrell Sprewell were in his seat.
 Contrary to reputed industry bad guys, Barkley never comes off as threatening because he is portly and pouty and pleasant -- at least on air, or apparently under arrest (he shook hands with several officers in Scottsdale before being released).
 Others with his record of making off-color remarks and less-than-exemplary news would never have been made a studio star, or lasted this long. In a statement Friday, Turner Sports said: ''We take these matters very seriously. Obviously there's a legal process and we have to wait for that to play out so we won't have any comment at this time.''
 Fair enough. If Barkley is found guilty, he will probably be suspended a short time, if only as an attempt to help him grow up. But he won't be fired, not over this, because there is always a place for a genuinely funny guy to be heard -- and not taken seriously, no matter the subject.

Untrimming the Tree
 Q.I know how long it takes our family to clean up after Christmas and take all the lights and ornaments off the tree. How long does it take Rockefeller Center? 
 A. Several weeks, or about as long as it takes to trim the tree. The 30,000 energy-efficient L.E.D. lights, five miles of wire and the Swarovski crystal star are put away until next year. The tree is made into lumber for Habitat for Humanity, said Iva Benson, a spokeswoman for the center.
 The W.P.A. Lives On
 Q.The economic slowdown, reminiscent of the Great Depression, has brought the Works Progress Administration of the 1930s back into the news, and I've always been a fan of those rugged-worker-style W.P.A. murals. Where are some good places to see the murals in New York?
 A. Depression-era murals painted by artists who were subsidized by the federal Works Progress Administration (and, for post office art, the Treasury Department's Section of Fine Arts) adorn many public and private building interiors in the city. This list just scratches the surface.
 Buildings whose interiors have been protected by the Landmarks Preservation Commission, and which have federal New Deal murals, include Radio City Music Hall at Rockefeller Center, the United States Custom House at 1 Bowling Green, the New York County Courthouse at 60 Centre Street, and, in Queens, the Marine Air Terminal. The lobby of Staten Island Borough Hall, another landmark building, has a rich series of W.P.A. murals. 
 Abraham Lincoln and Samuel J. Tilden High Schools in Brooklyn were built around 1930, and both their auditoriums have large paintings done as W.P.A. projects.
 Post office art includes the Jackson Heights, Forest Hills and Woodhaven stations in Queens, Manhattan's Madison Square office, and the Bronx Central Post Office. 
 One Web site with a listing of New Deal art across New York State is www.wpamurals.com/newyork.htm.
 A 1937 federal art project mural by Anton Refregier for the visitors' room at the Rikers Island jail still exists, although the room has been partitioned.
 Comfort Decals
 Q.On the interior ceilings of new subway cars there are black-and-white stickers, about an inch and a half square, with the image of what looks like a thermometer. What are these all about?
 A. Their full name is heating, ventilation and air-conditioning target temperature decals. They were applied this year to both bus and subway car ceilings.
 The decals are used to ensure that transit workers are recording the temperatures in a consistent way. On subways, one decal is placed in the center of the car and two are close to the low ceiling areas at either end of the car near the heating and air-conditioning systems. Workers then use a handheld laser thermometer aimed at the decals to record the temperature at all three points.
 During the summer, the average temperature on the bus or car is supposed to be below 78. If it is not, the cars are taken out of service at the end of the run. During the winter, the heaters in the subway cars will be turned on automatically by the thermostat when the temperature inside the car drops below 63 degrees. MICHAEL POLLAK

CORRECTION-DATE: January 11, 2009

 CORRECTION:
A report in the F.Y.I. column last Sunday about New York buildings that house murals subsidized by the federal Works Progress Administration erroneously included Radio City Music Hall at Rockefeller Center. Although the artwork in Radio City, which was completed in 1932, is Depression-era, no W.P.A. money contributed to the construction.

HEADLINE: All the Home's a Stage

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

DATELINE: WESTPORT, Conn. 

 BODY:
 WANTED: Compulsively neat, highly organized people to live in houses being marketed for sale. Must keep house suitable for showing at all times. Dirty dishes, used bath towels and stray newspapers strictly prohibited. 
 Salary? None. Length of time in house? Unpredictable.
 If this description serves only to remind you what a mess your own house is, you are probably not ''home manager'' material. For people who simply cannot leave the house before making the bed, however, the role of home manager might actually sound appealing. And according to firms that recruit and place home managers, the bleak housing market is driving more of the naturally tidy into their programs. 
 A home manager is essentially a live-in stager, as well as a caretaker and cleaner extraordinaire. The service is marketed as a tool to sell a vacant property more quickly. Prospective buyers will be less enticed by an empty, stale-smelling house, the theory goes, than by a meticulously kept home decorated with high-quality furnishings. 
 Home managers are required to accommodate real estate agents who want to show the house any day of the week. They pay a reduced rent and their own utility costs and have to keep up the grounds. 
 What they get in return is the privilege of living in what are usually large, expensive homes for a fraction of what it would cost to rent such a property. And in instances where they have to leave a house because it sold, staging companies usually try to place them in another house as soon as possible.
 Economic uncertainty is making it easier to find reliable, trustworthy people willing to live on a month-to-month basis, said Susan Hendee, an associate at Show to Sell, a Westport firm that offers home manager and staging services. For people who have sold their homes and don't want to buy another right away, ''we're a very good option,'' she said. ''This is actually a pretty good time for us.''
 Likewise for Susan Hendrickson, the owner of Unique Property Marketing, also in Westport. ''In just the last month,'' she said, ''I've put three new home managers in houses.''
 Before home managers are accepted into such a program, they usually undergo a rigorous screening process. (Some firms are more diligent than others -- last year, a home manager in Georgia was accused of running an escort service out of the home she was staying in.) Firms may do background checks and ask for financial information in addition to scrutinizing the applicant's furniture and decor. 
 ''You probably have friends who every time you go to their apartment they've moved their furniture around, right?'' said Thomas Scott, vice president for operations of Showhomes, a national chain of offices offering home manager services. ''Those are the people we like.''
 With 44 franchises, Showhomes is wrapping up its best year ever, company executives say, and hopes to establish more of a presence in the Northeast in the coming year. 
 Showhomes charges homeowners a fee for their services, in addition to charging a monthly rate to the home manager.
 The two Westport firms, which serve Fairfield County, provide the service at no cost to the homeowner, and make their money from the manager's ''rent'' -- usually $1,000 to $1,500 a month. Market-rate rents for similar properties might run as high as $4,000 a month or more. 
 ''Financially, it was such a benefit for us,'' said Sally Bohling, who, with her husband, four children and two dogs, managed two houses in the last two years. The Bohlings were building a house in Westport and didn't want to get locked into a rental lease in the meantime. So they signed on with Unique Property Marketing. 
 They spent the first five months in a restored antique home on prestigious Beachside Avenue. Then, when the owner decided to rent that property, they moved their Oriental rugs and baby grand piano to a new 12,000-square-foot colonial in a gated community in Fairfield. 
 There were some inconveniences beyond the obvious challenge of keeping up with the clutter potential of four children. They couldn't use the fireplaces or fancy built-in coffee maker. Last-minute Sunday showings were ''precarious.'' But Ms. Bohling said she treated the role as seriously as a job, and used the experience to teach her children the importance of getting chores done and respecting other peoples' property. The family moved into their own home last month.
 Kerrin O'Brien worked with Unique Property Marketing as a house manager for two Greenwich properties after she and her partner, Tamara, sold their own home there. ''We were thinking we'd be moving to New Jersey at some point,'' said Ms. O'Brien, a real estate investor, ''but we weren't ready to buy or build, given the economy.''
 One of the properties they moved into had been on the market and vacant for at least two years. After they moved in, it sold within a few months, she said. 
 Having left the second house in November, the couple now live in Monmouth Beach, N.J., and are considering starting their own home manager business. 
 Kim Elstein, co-owner of Gallery 33, in Westport, finds that being a home manager with Show to Sell enables her to showcase her company's 20th-century vintage furniture, while also reducing storage costs for her inventory. Every piece of furniture in the renovated ranch she currently manages in Fairfield is for sale. Although the furniture's sky-high prices are out of reach of the average buyer, Ms. Elstein has noticed that, because the pieces are so unusual, people tend to linger in the house longer. ''It should be just enough to give an impression, without clutter,'' she said. 
 Show to Sell's president, Debra Grant, says most of her home managers come to her through referrals, sometimes from divorce lawyers. Divorced men, it might pain their ex-wives to know, often turn out to be very good home managers. 
 ''We do the decorating, tell them this is how it has to be,'' Ms. Grant said. ''And then they don't touch anything once it's set up.''

HEADLINE: A Bear Saw Around the Corner

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KOTKIN

 BODY:
THE long economic boom passed many people by, but the bust has nailed nearly everyone. The carnage has also made a clairvoyant of James Grant, the founder of Grant's Interest Rate Observer and a perennial market bear.
 In ''Mr. Market Miscalculates'' (Axios, $22), Mr. Grant serves up an edifying anthology of his previously published -- and prescient -- editorials and speeches from his much-read industry publication. Read them now and weep.
 Counteracting the uncanny amnesia of the financial world, the bookish Mr. Grant has a wonderful habit of revisiting forgotten or classic works like ''Lombard Street'' by Walter Bagehot (1873), which defended the necessity of bailout loans by the Bank of England. Mr. Grant disagrees. 
 His longstanding, consistent, contrarian views are bracing; his prose, fluid and witty. (Subprime lending is dubbed ''not one borrower left behind.'') ''Great booms,'' he wrote in 1999, ''produce large abuses, which usually do not seem abusive until after the up cycle ends.'' Happy 2009!
 In 1999, Mr. Grant also rightly noted that ''there is one set of rules for bull markets, and another for bear markets.'' Unfortunately, the regulations needed during boom times are instituted only during the downturns. 
 Lucid essays from well before the 2008 meltdown captured the toxicity of the mortgage market and the investments known as collateralized debt obligations (stacks of debt). Other writings celebrated Karl B. Hill, an unconventional banker who muses that it would be convenient if all the McMansions built with financial flows from Asia could now be exported to improve America's foreign trade balance. (The alternative is for the Asian holders of American debt to move into the houses and employ the insolvent nominal homeowners as household staff.)
 We've been here before. Technology stocks, Mr. Grant writes in the anthology's foreword, were absurdly overvalued in early 2000, just before the tech bubble burst, ''but, then again, they were only a little less overvalued in 1999 and 1998.'' Ditto for 1997, and 1996. ''I myself,'' he adds, ''thought the market was a little overvalued in 1992.''
 Had investors followed Mr. Grant's advice in any of the years before the tech crash, they would have forgone huge gains that kept piling up in defiance of his doomsday predictions. It takes a strong person to leave a lot of easy money on the table, quarter after quarter.
 More recently, Mr. Grant correctly predicted that securitized mortgages would implode -- but in 2005, and again in 2006, which turned out to be gloriously profitable years for those who were in the game. 
 ''When the music stops, in terms of liquidity, things will be complicated,'' said Charles O. Prince III, the former Citigroup chief executive, in the summer of 2007. ''But as long as the music is playing, you've got to get up and dance. We're still dancing.''
 Another key to the fiasco, Mr. Grant shows, is the widespread disinclination to accept, let alone seek out, information that contradicts one's views. ''As a rule,'' he wrote in 2002, ''investors see what they want to see.'' This applies to many of his own subscribers, who paid for analysis that they ignored. 
 Therein lies the allure of the irrational Mr. Market, a character invented in the 1930s by the father of value investing, Benjamin Graham (whose disciples include Warren E. Buffett). Modern portfolio theory now generally holds that outsmarting the markets is impossible, making it advisable to invest in index funds.
 But Mr. Grant follows Graham in insisting that Mr. Market's herd behavior -- ''price is never an object; he just wants in, or he wants out'' -- creates opportunity for a disciplined investor to find stocks selling at a discount to a company's intrinsic value.
 In gauging the troubles of the American International Group, the big insurer, Mr. Grant proved no better than regulators, and issued a mea culpa. Still, he contends that mispricing opportunities are always at hand. ''Panicked investors,'' he wrote in 2007, before the recent sell-offs, ''will care no more about value than the euphoric ones did.'' But here's the paradox of successful ''value investing'': it's possible, if at all, only because few practice it.
 Mr. Grant's targets have been many, but none more so than the Federal Reserve. During the height of Alan Greenspan's maestro acclaim, Mr. Grant made the case against him, then took up the cudgel against his successor, Ben S. Bernanke. He accused them of inflating bubbles and of fighting what Mr. Grant sees as the false bogeyman of deflation. 
 Beyond the tilting, though, one question begs an answer: Is it possible to have robust growth without the follow-on crises? Essentially, Mr. Grant answers, no.
 Capitalism, like invention, is disruptive, he has observed many times, while arguing that past efforts to ensure future safety have only increased long-term instability. That's because well-meaning protections against ''systemic risk'' -- even government insurance for bank deposits -- encourage recklessness. Such was the backdrop to the financial engineering that computers made possible.
 IN addition, as Mr. Grant sees it, the world went to hell after 1971, when the United States abandoned the gold standard. ''Gold not only collateralized the currency but also tempered the growth in bank credit,'' he admonished in 1999 -- and, it seems, every year, before and since. 
 Unhitching economic growth from the vicissitudes of mining freed the Fed to issue endless liquidity to prop American employment and G.D.P. But cheap credit meant that investors, already egged on by Uncle Sam's implied backstop guarantees, became flush with gambling money.
 Mr. Grant is dead right about the long-run tendency of central banks to debase their own paper currencies, but permanently returning the dollar to a gold standard is no more practicable than reducing the government's size to 19th-century levels. Still, as he warned in 2002, ''very low interest rates often ignite booms, but even ultralow interest rates may not fix busts.'' Live by the Fed's pump-priming, die by the Fed's pump-priming.

HEADLINE: Dreamers and Doers

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ. 
John Schwartz is a reporter for The Times.

 BODY:
Nicolas Naranjo knocked on Evan Kimbrell's door at midnight. 
 At other colleges, this might have been a prelude to a fraternity prank or an invitation to help float the keg at the end of a party. But Mr. Naranjo, who had just arrived in the United States from his native Colombia some weeks before, wanted to talk about starting a business. He had an idea about a hop-on, hop-off bus service for college tours around the Boston area. Mr. Kimbrell had tried to start a bus company the previous year and knew the pitfalls -- and was happy for the break from his studies to talk business. 
 This is life in the E-Tower at Babson College in Wellesley, Mass. Babson focuses on business, and E-Tower focuses, even more tightly, on entrepreneurship. The residents of E-Tower hash out new business plans at Monday night meetings, and they talk shop throughout the day and night. 
 ''We're really a dorm of dreamers and doers,'' says Prinya Kovitchindachai, who is hoping to market a vile-tasting pill, imported from Thailand, that he touts as a hangover treatment. ''College students are the largest group of binge drinkers,'' he says, quietly gleeful at the prospect of such a large market so close at hand. Friends have helped him bone up on the basics of international shipping, of securing shelf space and -- in a consultation with a neighbor who was wearing a towel and still dripping from the shower -- of creating Web sites. 
 ''Any school can teach entrepreneurship,'' he says, ''but at Babson, we live entrepreneurship.''
 Now, let's not get carried away: as a reporter and as a parent, I find myself on plenty of college campuses these days, and many of the students I meet are indistinguishable from the dull-eyed slackers I went to college with (when dinosaurs roamed the Earth and Pluto was still a planet). But then there are those who have this . . . THING, this go-getting excitement to start something, make something. They want money, sure. But the overwhelming desire seems to be to carve out something of their own.
 Today's students have grown up hearing more about Bill Gates than F.D.R., and they live in a world where startling innovations are commonplace. The current crop of 18-year-olds, after all, were 8 when Google was founded by two students at Stanford; Mark Zuckerberg founded Facebook in 2004 while he was at Harvard and they were entering high school. Having ''grown up digital'' (to borrow the title of Don Tapscott's recent book on the Net Generation), they are impatient to get on with life. 
 ''They're great collaborators, with friends, online, at work,'' Mr. Tapscott wrote. ''They thrive on speed. They love to innovate.''
 The easiest way to find kids like these is to check in on entrepreneurship education, in which colleges and universities try to prepare their students to recognize opportunities and seize them. 
 For those who haven't been paying attention, the idea of entrepreneurshipmight bring up the Memo Minder, the lame invention by the ''Future Enterpriser'' played by Bronson Pinchot in ''Risky Business.'' 
 Reader, you date yourself: that was 1983. In the intervening decades, Tom Cruise has grown up and entrepreneurship programs have boomed.
 A report issued last year by the Kauffman Foundation, which finances programs to promote innovation on campuses, noted that more than 5,000 entrepreneurship programs are offered on two- and four-year campuses -- up from just 250 courses in 1985. Full-scale majors, minors or certificates in entrepreneurship have leaped from 104 in 1975 to more than 500 in 2006. Since 2003, the Kauffman Foundation has given nearly $50 million to 19 colleges and universitiesto build campus programs. 
 Lesa Mitchell, a Kauffman vice president, says that the foundation is extending the reach of its academic gospel, which used to be found almost exclusively in business schools. 
 Now, the concept of entrepreneurship is blossoming in engineering programs and medical schools, and even in the liberal arts. ''Our interest is in the whole curriculum,'' she says. ''We need to spread out from the business school.''
 Either as class projects or on their own, students in an array of disciplines are coming up with ideas, writing business plans and seeing them through to prototype and, often, marketplace. In their spare time, students in agricultural economics at Purdue invent new uses for soy; industrial design majors at Syracuse, in a special collaborative laboratory, create wearable technologies; a psychology major, through the Yale Entrepreneurial Institute, starts a limited liability company offering neuromarketing services. 
 Richard Miller, the president of the Olin College of Engineering in Wellesley, recalls a time that academically packed programs like engineering believed that teaching business and entrepreneurship would require watering down curriculum. ''We think differently now,'' he says. Dr. Miller says a personal turning point came back in his days at the University of Southern California, when visitors from McDonnell Douglas told a classroom of engineers that the project they were working on in class was actually the subject of a patent worth $200 million. ''What's a patent?'' they asked. 
 Clark University, a liberal arts college in Worcester, Mass., offers a minor in entrepreneurship that can be fitted into just about any degree plan. ''It's too important to be taught by business professionals to business students,'' says George Gendron, the founder and director of its innovation and entrepreneurship program. The program, he says, is intended to help students find ''what they're passionate about,'' and to learn how to apply themselves to it practically, whether in business or in the growing area of social entrepreneurship, which focuses on societal change. 
 Even at Babson, entrepreneurship isn't all about business: in E-Tower, Austin Conti and Gerald Praysman are writing a screenplay about the Middle East that they hope to sell using the techniques for spotting business opportunities. And Gabriel Schillinger, a freshman, is engaged in social entrepreneurship. A nonprofit organization he helped start in high school, For Darfur Inc., put on a concert by Kanye West in Florida that raised $300,000 for Doctors Without Borders, and he is trying to build on that early success. 
 The entrepreneurship movement has its critics, especially among those who see college as a time for broad academic exploration. Daniel S. Greenberg, author of ''Science for Sale: The Perils, Rewards and Delusions of Campus Capitalism,'' finds the increasingly fervent campus embrace faddish and narrow. ''I just don't think that entrepreneurship ranks so high in terms of national need, or in terms of what can effectively be taught in the limited time available'' in the college years, he says. ''What aren't you studying because you're studying entrepreneurship?'' 
 Leonard A. Schlesinger, Babson's president, says that the question of whether innovation really can be taught is ''an age-old debate.'' Mr. Schlesinger, who has served as chief operating officer of Limited Brands, says that if teaching entrepreneurship is an academic fad, it is one the school has pursued since 1978 -- ''a fad like wearing pants and underwear.''
 Schools do not teach the spark of creativity so much as provide the tools for students to capitalize on that spark, he says.''I'm going to teach you to find opportunity.''
 Especially in a bad economy, he adds, the curriculum ''gets our people to be much better prepared for the structure and dynamics of the job market they're likely to face. The thought process and logic that we teach is at the core of stimulating innovation, stimulating innovation is at the core of any developed economy.''
 ''I'm not trying to be arrogant,'' Dr. Schlesinger notes, ''but the world needs what we do.''
 The urge is strong at E-Tower.
 With word of a visitor on the premises spreading, some two dozen dorm residents crowded into the common room to talk about their projects. They were brimming with excitement about their plans, and eager to share them with a reporter who, as more than one noted, might be able to help them make a connection in the business world or get them a little publicity. Prinya Kovitchindachai pressed one of his hangover pills into my hand. I tried it, and grimaced at the taste. ''It's much better if you're drunk!'' he insisted.
 Another student grabbed me as I was leaving. He asked that I not use his name in the article. The people with whom he was dealing in his start-up trading business, he said nervously, ''don't know how old I am.''

HEADLINE: Newark Murder Rate Dipped 30% in '08

BYLINE: By NATE SCHWEBER

DATELINE: NEWARK 

 BODY:
The murder rate dropped more than 30 percent here last year, but that is little comfort to Preisy Ragin, 29.
 On Halloween, Mr. Ragin's cousin Lamar Ragin, 27, was shot and killed at the Pilgrim Baptist Village apartment complex when he went to pick up his 8-year-old sister, who was dressed as Cinderella to go trick-or-treating. Police charged a 21-year-old Newark man with the murder.
 ''Losing my cousin still hurts me,'' Mr. Ragin said. 
 Newark recorded 67 homicides in 2008, according to the police, the fewest since 2002, when there were 65. In 2007, there were 97 homicides; in 2006, just over 100.
 City officials and community leaders credit new police strategies for the declining murder rate. The yearly total is still higher, though, than was hoped for at midyear, when the city was on pace to match its lowest homicide totals in a generation. 
 Most officials are optimistic that the murder rate will continue to go down, despite concerns that the nation's economic downturn could have adverse effects.
 Some say that the new statistics are the first step toward changing the violent reputation of Newark, New Jersey's largest city.
 ''When you look at the murder rate and see it decline, it does give you a real sense of hope about the city,'' said Al Koeppe, chief executive of the Newark Alliance, a nonprofit group dedicated to improving business and public education.
 But James Alan Fox, a professor of criminal justice at Northeastern University who recently published a study on homicide rates among young blacks, said that the 2008 statistics should be ''taken with a grain of salt, and possibly the whole shaker.''
 ''This reflects hard work and smart policing,'' he said. ''But some of the decline is probably random fluctuation.''
 Since the mid-1980s, Newark's homicide totals have vacillated between a high of 117 in 1985 to 57 in 1997, according to statistics from the Department of Justice. From 1985 to 2005, the city averaged 90 killings a year.
 Mayor Cory A. Booker, who has made reducing crime a priority, said that while he was pleased that homicides had dropped, they remained too common. He said he was looking forward to cutting the number further by using better technology and putting more officers on the streets.
 ''I think that 2009 is going to show the trend is going to continue going our way,'' he said.
 Around City Hall, the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, is credited with putting into effect policies that may have helped to achieve the reduction in homicide rates since he was appointed in 2006. The strategies of Mr. McCarthy, a former New York City police commander, have included closer monitoring of drug dealers and violent offenders and responding to more quality-of-life issues like noise and vandalism.
 Derrick Hatcher, president of the Fraternal Order of Police in Newark, the city's main police union, said he believed that Mr. McCarthy's best practice was putting more officers on duty at night and on weekends, when most homicides occur. 
 Mr. McCarthy said he was ''pleased, but not satisfied'' with last year's homicide statistics.
 ''We had a good year, but that brings no solace to the families of the 67 people murdered,'' he said.
 Murder rates also sank in the neighboring towns of East Orange and Elizabeth, though they rose slightly in Irvington; officials there speculated that the increase could be linked to drug dealers moving across the city line because of increased police pressure in Newark.
 ''Is there a displacement issue? Possibly,'' said Sgt. Keith Sandberg of the Irvington police. ''Newark made a push, and when you push, people are either going to push back or move.''
 Chip Hallock, president of the Newark Regional Business Partnership, said the statistics were the beginning of a change in dialogue about the city, one that does not center on its reputation for violence.
 ''Now we can begin to tell a different story because of the reduction in crime,'' he said.
 Al-Tarik Onque, co-founder of Stop Shootin', a nonprofit group founded in 2005 to lead a grass-roots effort against violent crime, said that last year's homicide trend was emblematic of a groundswell.
 ''These stats are about people from Newark stepping up and saying, 'Enough,' '' he said.

HEADLINE: 'Lady D.U.I.' Comes to Her Own Defense

BYLINE: By GERRI HIRSHEY. 
E-mail conn@nytimes.

 BODY:
F. SCOTT FITZGERALD'S beautiful sinner Jay Gatsby famously drove to perdition past the billboard eyes of the oculist Dr. T. J. Eckleburg, one of American literature's enduring symbols of human fallibility and its messy consequences. In Gatsby's case, his passion-drunk lover, Daisy, caused a fatal hit-and-run crash beneath the omniscient doc's gaze. 
 Now Connecticut offenders -- arrested for allegedly driving while impaired by drugs or alcohol can gaze upward for succor to the friendly peepers of Lady D.U.I. She is the 29-year-old lawyer Teresa DiNardi, and she smiles down from giant billboards on the state's most car-clotted arteries, Routes 91, 95 and 84. She proffers court and motor vehicle representation ''starting @ $1,000.'' Her phone number blazes red: 888-LADYDUI. And in letters the size of six-packs, she warns: Because Hope Is Not a Strategy. 
 Over the last year, many of the accused have turned to Ms. DiNardi -- enough that some judges in Connecticut courts have asked dryly, ''Will Lady D.U.I. please approach the bench?'' And callers to the Hartford headquarters of Mothers Against Drunk Driving have expressed outrage at what they feel is a flippant ad pitch involving a deadly serious problem. Letters to the editor bristled with disapproval when Ms. DiNardi, profiled in The Hartford Courant in a series on rising young professionals, declared: ''It's a crime that has no intent. Some get caught and others don't. I love my job.''
 And she really does. When I reached Ms. DiNardi by phone, I asked whether she would agree to be interviewed via Skype live Internet chat, a format offered to potential clients on her Web site. And she obligingly popped on my screen, eager to expand upon some of her terse, shoot-from-the-hip quotations that have raised public hackles. 
 First, please -- that name. She laughed and said, ''That would be the brilliant Jay Ruane,'' the younger, promotional-minded partner in the father-and-son firm that offered her a position right out of law school in 2006. Ruane Attorneys specializes in drunken driving defenses, with offices in Hartford, Greenwich, Shelton and New London. The novelty phone number was available, and no detail is too small: Ms. DiNardi appears in a Web promotional video wearing a polo shirt embroidered with Lady D.U.I. over her heart. 
 The firm is now handling about 400 drunken driving cases a year. I asked what she felt when she first saw herself towering over traffic just over a year ago. ''I was in total shock,'' she said. ''I couldn't believe how big they made my head.'' 
 She laughed, and added that she had been with her parents, who had just picked her up at Bradley airport. ''My parents loved it, they got excited.'' She said of her father, a police officer who served in Newington: ''He's like any other father -- he's proud of me and happy I went to law school, and he loves seeing the billboards.''
 She thinks it is good that he has retired so that he doesn't have to hear any commentary on her work in the station house. Ms. DiNardi spends many of her days attempting to debunk or disqualify the evidence collected in police reports. ''Most of the cops understand that the people they arrested are entitled to a defense,'' Ms. DiNardi said. ''I get along well with almost every police officer that I've encountered. But then I grew up with cops.''
 They understand gradations in criminal behavior, and so does she. ''D.U.I.'s happen to everyone across the board. Politicians, judges, cops, prosecutors, your next-door neighbor. It's not the same as having clients that are burglars, robbers and murderers. You feel that you can actually help people that are productive members of society.''
 Ms. DiNardi estimates that over 90 percent of her cases are first-time offenders, most of whom are stopped within a mile of their homes. ''They're never going to do it again, and they just want to move on with their lives.'' I asked whether she has had to defend a nice average person who has accidentally killed or maimed someone. ''We did have a pretty serious one in Fairfield County that involved someone driving the wrong way up a ramp on 95 and it turned into a major accident. The victim has not passed but is very badly hurt, and the case is still pending.''
 Like any responsible criminal defense lawyer, she will seek the best outcome for her client. And she would much rather do it without the emotional impact of victim testimony and advocacy. ''It's heart-wrenching when the family comes into court. It's the same basic mistake, but it was a lot bigger and a lot more tragic.''
 Victim testimony engenders drama, more curious onlookers in court, and a shakier client. ''When you're dealing with people who did something like that, the remorse you watch them go through, the consequences -- well, their life is ruined, too, and they know it. So it's very difficult.''
 She acknowledged that defending cases is ever more challenging in Connecticut, owing to near-continuous tightening on license suspensions and other penalties. ''The legislature has imposed so many mandatory minimums that there's really no leeway in the negotiating process.'' And as to sentencing, ''Judges don't have discretion anymore.'' The required motor vehicle hearings are even more draconian. ''The hearing officers have to be tougher based on case law,'' she said. ''The automatic license suspension is extremely hard to overturn. We do our best.''
 Even more vexing are the police videos now cropping up to derail a defense. ''Some police cruisers shoot video out the front and you get the entire roadside situation. And a lot of the police departments have video equipment in their booking rooms.'' 
 Clients are always treated to a private screening of their wobble-kneed struts and roadside rants. ''You really don't want a jury seeing that,'' Ms. DiNardi said. ''And once the clients see themselves in that situation, they'll jump on any compromise to avoid the max.''
 When I asked whether she has noticed any trend among her clients, she did not hesitate: ''There's been a lot of repeat offenders this year. I don't know if it has a lot to do with the recession, the economy.''
 In fact, her firm is busiest among the stately hedgerows of Fairfield County, home to so many financial industry workers in crisis. The firm is also hoping to make inroads in their just-opened New London office where heavy state trooper patrols cut drunken driving suspects from the herds of casinogoers.
 Ms. DiNardi is in favor of the court-mandated ignition lock devices with instant breath analysis that keeps people from driving drunk. She has seen it work. But she does not see the efficacy of locking up drivers. ''The problem is that everyone wants these repeat offenders to go to jail. But they have a disease, they're usually alcoholics, and jail doesn't fix that. It just ruins their lives. They can't work, pay their bills, support their family.''
 She believes they need to be in substance abuse treatment instead. But she has little compassion for outright idiocy, such as driving despite a suspended license. ''We reiterate to every single client: 'You cannot drive or you're going to jail for at least 30 days. It's automatic jail time. We can't even argue to mitigate those. Get a driver. Take a cab.' ''
 Though Ms. DiNardi finds her work fulfilling, there is another area of law -- considerably more life-affirming -- that she has been exploring as a member of the gay and lesbian community. ''I'm trying to get into same-sex-couple adoption,'' she said. ''But it's not a booming business. And D.U.I.'s are.''
 And with that, the eyes of my screen-sized Lady D.U.I. crinkled into a smile. She wished me good evening, and blinked off.

HEADLINE: In Queens: A Melting Pot, and a Closed Book

BYLINE: By ADAM B. ELLICK

 BODY:
NEW YORK'S most impenetrable night spot is not a chic Manhattan lounge but an unmarked Korean bar tucked under the el in Jackson Heights, Queens. One night, driven by curiosity, I vowed to penetrate the black plastic facade that effectively shielded the place from voyeurs like me.
 Gingerly, I twisted the doorknob. It didn't budge. I knocked loudly. Footsteps, softened by the lazy drag of slippers, approached. The peephole flashed open, then went dark the moment I peered in. No one answered for an awkward five minutes. I walked away to the faint sound of Korean karaoke.
 Was it a brothel? A private club? Somebody's apartment? A chic gathering place of lissome Korean models who drink soju and read Dostoyevsky? For an entire year, despite tireless efforts, I repeatedly failed to discover anything about my mysterious neighbor.
 I moved to Jackson Heights in late 2006 precisely to discover these discreet ethnic underworlds. Previously, I lived for six years in developing nations, and upon my return to the States, I sorely missed those exotic environments. I figured the best place to find similar places was in the borough that claims more languages spoken and more passports possessed than any county in the world. Queens, I hoped, would be the ultimate consolation prize for a grieving former expatriate. 
 Over the next 18 months, I learned a humbling lesson. The underworlds of Queens are so authentic that they are impossible to discover, at least for a white American like me. The only authentic experiences I had were acquired as I sat alone in half-empty ethnic restaurants. 
 I should have realized early on that I was destined for outsider status. When I was interviewed by board members of the rental co-op where I hoped to move, two fragile white-haired women escorted me to a dingy basement room.
 ''Sorry for all the questions we're about to ask you,'' one woman said, clipboard in hand. ''But ever since 9/11 we really like to screen all applicants. So, Adam, what are your hobbies?''
 ''I like to read and ride my bike,'' I replied carefully, purposefully omitting mention of my two years in the world's largest Islamic country.
 As I signed the documents, one woman asked, ''Are you loud?''
 No, I said.
 ''Great,'' she replied. ''You're approved.'' 
 On my first Sunday in Queens, I went to a crusty bar to watch a football game and encountered Irishmen equipped with authentic accents and swollen red cheeks. I took a stool and asked for a root beer, a nonalcoholic beverage that made me the instant butt of jokes. I laughed and thought that I had finally found some neighborhood pals.
 Everyone was on a first-name basis, a situation that prompted the owner to ask me a question. ''Why did you come to Gandhiland?'' he demanded, in a reference to the vibrant South Asian communities that defined the area. After a five-minute monologue on the glory days of this former Irish enclave, he said, ''This is the last white stronghold from here to Shea Stadium, and together, we're going to keep it that way.''
 At this point, I began to question my decision to settle in this particular part of the city. Yet Queens cannot be dismissed so easily. The morning E train feels more like an economic bloodline than a subway ride, and like all of Queens, it runs on Arabic, Urdu, Spanish, Russian, Mandarin and a dose of English.
 If we are to eat pasta in Rome, see theater in London and go on a safari in Kenya, in New York we have to explore Queens. Many big cities have immigrant enclaves, but the diversity and breadth of Queens is unparalleled, and exemplified by its most sacred intersection -- 74th Street, Broadway and Roosevelt Avenue.
 In Little India, a block to the north, Bangladeshi and Pakistanis have supplanted the more assimilated Indians who have since moved to the suburbs. To the south are Korean spas, Korean barbecue joints and hofs, or Korean pubs. Southeast on Broadway are Southeast Asian restaurants, mainly Indonesian and Thai. Nearby are Filipinos, and their cured-pork Sunday brunches. 
 East on Roosevelt is Latino nightlife: Colombian, Mexican, Ecuadorean, Peruvian, with salsa clubs that open at 2 a.m. Sprinkled along these unofficial borders are Burmese, Tibetan and Polish populations, all with their own shopping centers and cafes.
 Come summer, I was determined to make Queens work by testing my hobbies: jogging, biking and photography. My success was limited.
 Documenting the neighborhood's colorful streets was like a lesson in intelligence gathering. When I raised the viewfinder to my eye, street vendors and pedestrians alike jumped out of sight, as if I were wielding an AK-47. Several men mumbled the words ''snitching'' and ''immigration'' under their breath.
 Jogging in the morning was like playing Frogger. I dodged Mexican mothers pushing flimsy strollers, not to be confused with the robust four-wheelers found on the Upper West Side. Laborers unloading trucks gaped as if I were fleeing a crime scene. In a month of morning runs, I passed only two other joggers.
 As I biked along the Flushing waterfront one bright day, I came to an outdoor Guyanese wedding. Women in saris unknowingly clogged the public bike path. They blatantly ignored me, forcing me to awkwardly walk my bike through the dense crowd. One gorgeous young woman smiled flirtatiously, but before I could return the gesture, her father whisked her away. Clearly, I wasn't going to crash this party.
 When befriending locals proved difficult, I invited my Manhattan-based friends to explore Queens. Only three friends made the trip, and none of them came a second time. 
 On the plus side, there was the food, whose variety reflected the inhabitants. On cold nights, I found myself at Spicy Mina, a Bangladeshi restaurant where a dingy curtain divides a few tables from the kitchen of Mina, a 70-year-old who serves dal and mango curry. I don't think there's a better way to spend $6.
 Donovan's, which has won awards for serving the city's best burgers, was a 10-minute walk from my apartment. So was Elmhurst and its two stellar and seriously spiced Indonesian restaurants. Sichuan food could be found in Flushing, the city's real-deal Chinatown. But after many nights of eating well but eating alone, the thrill, unlike the weight, wore off.
 Nightlife was downright depressing. Bars along Roosevelt Avenue were packed with Latino laborers who send currency back home via the dozens of money-transfer businesses along the drag. Each night, rows of men could be found draped over the bars, passed out. The only women I saw were the baristas. Almost all apparently were in the country illegally, hence afraid to talk to me.
 With only a few weeks of my Queens experience remaining, I, with a friend, approached the Korean karaoke joint one last time. I turned the doorknob, waiting for it to jam. But it opened seamlessly, and I took a quick step inside. A frail Korean woman, about 60, sprinted to the door in her slippers. ''No! Korea! Korea! Only Korea!'' she shouted.
 After an awkward five-minute conversation, she allowed us to enter, then dumped a bottle of soju and a plate of celery sticks on our table.
 Four Koreans lined the bar. One was a hunched woman in her 80s who, when she grabbed my friend and jerked him into a slow dance, seemed to have risen from the dead.
 When it was my turn to dance, the woman grabbed me even closer. I concentrated less on dancing than trying to support her drunken body.
 Finally, I had infiltrated one of the hidden enclaves of my recently adopted borough. I left the bar reinvigorated about the possibilities in Queens, imagining the other underworlds that I could discover. But it was too late. I had already signed a lease with a girl named Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Toward A Leaner, Bolder City Opera

BYLINE: By ANTHONY TOMMASINI

 BODY:
IN just over nine months the New York City Opera is supposed to open its 2009-10 season. Exactly how that will happen is hard to imagine. The scrappy 65-year-old company has seldom faced such a dire crisis. 
 First off, there is a $15 million deficit to manage, made more onerous by the board's inexplicable and costly decision to forgo staged productions in the current season while the David H. Koch Theater (formerly the New York State Theater) is being renovated. By contractual obligation City Opera is still paying the salaries of its full-time orchestra and chorus.
 The company is also reeling from the debacle of Gerard Mortier's aborted tenure as general director. When he and the City Opera board parted ways in November, just months before he was to take charge full time, all of his ambitious programming plans were scrapped. One result is that in a field where major companies book even younger, rising singers months and years in advance, City Opera has neither repertory nor artists finalized for the looming season. 
 To top it off, the company has no general director, although Susan L. Baker, the chairwoman, says she is hoping to make an announcement soon. 
 The daunting problems facing City Opera are unfolding amid the global economic crisis, which is threatening many orchestras and opera companies. Just last month the valuable Baltimore Opera Company filed for bankruptcy. The situation is particularly alarming because it is crucial that New York -- like London, Paris, Vienna, Berlin and other major opera towns -- have a vibrant second company. 
 Back when City Opera was founded Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia nicknamed it ''the people's opera'' to distinguish it from the bigger, richer Metropolitan Opera. Despite its economic and artistic ups and downs City Opera has been an essential alternative to the Met, a complementary company with an admirable mission: to present opera in accessible, affordable and theatrically innovative productions; to provide opportunities for young singers, especially Americans; and to explore neglected repertory, contemporary works in particular.
 On Jan. 15 and 16 at Carnegie Hall, City Opera will present a concert performance of Samuel Barber's ''Antony and Cleopatra'' with two exciting singers in the title roles, the baritone Teddy Tahu Rhodes and the soprano Lauren Flanigan. But these will be the only performances of an operatic score that the essentially moribund company is offering this season. 
 In the coming months music lovers in New York and opera buffs everywhere are going to be paying attention to every official announcement, informal leak, sign of trouble and glint of life from the people's opera. It may be that rare case in which a major performing arts institution will be making news not by what it puts onstage, which is next to nothing, but by what takes place backstage, in its offices and especially in its boardroom.
 City Opera has seemed close to collapse before. During the 1980s, when Beverly Sills ran the place, a debilitating 54-day strike by the orchestra musicians forced the cancellation of the company's first summer season, and another musicians' strike wiped out the entire fall season in 1989, just as the conductor Christopher Keene, a dynamic musician committed to presenting challenging 20th-century works, arrived to take over from Ms. Sills. 
 Can City Opera rise from the depths again? Ms. Baker feels hopeful, she said in a recent telephone interview, though her credibility took a big hit after Mr. Mortier and City Opera parted ways two months ago. It was Ms. Baker, seemingly star-struck, who recruited the debonair, Belgian-born Mr. Mortier, an impresario with a penchant for shaking up stodgy institutions, who is now winding up his directorship of the Paris National Opera.
 ''At this crossroads in the City Opera's history we've seen an enormous outpouring of support,'' Ms. Baker said. ''A few days after the separation announcement, we had a wonderfully well-attended fund-raising dinner, which led to some wonderful gifts.''
 Michael M. Kaiser, the president of the Kennedy Center in Washington, offered a more objective vote of confidence. In the arts world Mr. Kaiser is known as a turnaround artist for his record of rescuing floundering institutions, among them American Ballet Theater and the Royal Opera in London.
 ''I've seen many worse situations,'' he said in a telephone interview, ''which doesn't mean it's going to be easy.'' This fall he was approached by the City Opera board for consultation and advice, which he has been dispensing gratis.
 Like the crippled Big Three automakers, City Opera will have to refashion itself into a more streamlined and focused company. Ms. Baker knows this. She said the board had been candid with all of the company's personnel. Every element of the operation will have to be examined, especially the ''enormous high fixed costs,'' she said, of which the most enormous, as in every major opera house, is the orchestra and chorus. 
 Whoever agrees to take on the general director's job will be thrust into immediate crisis management. That person will surely have to be available immediately. Experienced managers currently working elsewhere may find it impractical, not to mention unprofessional, to abandon contractual commitments to their institutions. Many names have been bandied about, including that of George Steel, the former director of the Miller Theater, who this season took charge of the Dallas Opera. Mr. Steel, who had been sounded out about his possible interest by a City Opera board member, reiterated in an interview that he was excited by the possibilities in Dallas and intended to honor his commitment.
 At least the new director will not have to invent the company from scratch. Every leader of City Opera has signed on to its populist mission, though each has struggled anew to distinguish the company from the Met, its intimidating Lincoln Center neighbor since 1966.
 Though City Opera audiences may not hear the big-name singers who appear at the Met, they routinely encounter younger, gifted singers who are hungry and eager and who care about acting and look like the characters they portray. Throughout its history City Opera has fostered singers who have gone on to starry careers elsewhere. When it relocated from New York City Center to the New York State Theater in 1966, it opened with a recent work, Ginastera's ''Don Rodrigo,'' starring the fast-rising tenor Placido Domingo.
 City Opera has long championed unusual and neglected repertory. It is happy to cede Wagner's ''Ring,'' Verdi's ''Aida,'' Berlioz's ''Troyens'' and other grand fare to the Met. But it has introduced audiences to 20th-century works by Janacek, Hindemith, Michael Tippett and other significant composers. 
 For me, a production that well embodied the company's mission was Rhoda Levine's bleakly vivid staging of Carlisle Floyd's ''Of Mice and Men,'' a searing 1970 adaptation of the Steinbeck novel. A surprise hit 10 years ago, it featured an unforgettable performance by the tenor Anthony Dean Griffey as the hulking, feeble-minded Lennie. 
 During Paul Kellogg's 11-year directorship, which ended in 2007, City Opera developed an additional profile as a house for Handel. Who could have imagined that Handel's mystical, strange and profound ''Orlando'' would outdraw ''Carmen''? ''Orlando'' was a major success four years ago in an enchantingly modern production by Chas Rader-Shieber starring the charismatic countertenor Bejun Mehta and the luminous soprano Amy Burton.
 The Met has received a lot of credit in recent years for producing thorny and important works, including Schoenberg's ''Moses und Aron,'' Busoni's ''Doktor Faust'' and Janacek's ''Makropulos Case.'' Last summer the Lincoln Center Festival presented a landmark production of Bernd Alois Zimmermann's daunting ''Soldaten'' at the Park Avenue Armory. Yet all these works were first mounted for New Yorkers many years earlier by City Opera. 
 Historically the greater challenge for City Opera in establishing a profile apart from the Met's has come with productions of standard repertory. Partly by inclination, partly of necessity, City Opera has typically taken more chances with the staples. Puccini's ''Boheme'' is a good example. You can see Franco Zeffirelli's gargantuan cast-of-hundreds production at the Met. Or you can see City Opera's gritty staging by James Robinson, updated to the opening months of World War I. 
 Yet if the Met was the more traditional company in the past, Peter Gelb, its current general manager, is trying to change all that by hiring theatrical and film directors to spice up the productions.
 Still, the main reason to attend a production of, say, Donizetti's ''Lucia di Lammermoor'' at the Met is that a star soprano like Natalie Dessay or Anna Netrebko is singing the title role. This puts pressure on City Opera to compete by presenting the staples in exceptionally imaginative productions with the most appealing young casts available.
 Tickets are still more affordable, over all, at City Opera. Yet the top tickets have edged up to $130 in recent years. The Met has actually lowered the cost of its family circle seats to $15, comparable to City Opera's cheapest tickets. 
 City Opera has long been hampered by its home, the Koch Theater. Conceived as a ballet house, with opera added as an afterthought, the 2,800-seat auditorium at the Koch is too big to feel intimate, and acoustically dull. So dull that Mr. Kellogg installed a controversial sound-enhancement system over the public objections of Ms. Sills and other City Opera luminaries. 
 Mr. Kellogg tried mightily to move the company to its own home in a different neighborhood, envisioning a new, hip, more intimate house with lively acoustics where young singers could thrive. If this was financially unrealistic during Mr. Kellogg's tenure, it's a pipe dream today. 
 Still, Ms. Baker said the renovations would result in ''a 21st-century opera house'' with an expanded and movable pit and greatly improved acoustics. 
 All of which assumes that City Opera can stay afloat until next season. Mr. Mortier wanted to create a company that rooted its repertory in 20th-century works and cultivated relationships with living composers. The standard repertory would have appeared in daring, even radical productions with contemporary resonances and strong, advanced points of view. 
 ''Mortier's vision for a season of must-see events was a good one and could have been exciting,'' Mr. Kaiser said. But it was not attached to a business model that made sense, he added. ''Any creative person can come up with a programming framework. But most board members and, to be honest, most critics do not know how to fit a vision into an affordable structure.''
 For that, he said, ''you need expert arts business leadership.''
 The next leader will have to make many unpopular decisions. Mr. Kaiser saved the Royal Opera by whittling down the season and renegotiating contracts with the orchestra. He still has the scars to prove it, he said. But New York should be able to support two opera companies, though perhaps not those that offer overlapping repertory for months at a time. And to survive City Opera will almost certainly have to get smaller. 
 Yet now more than ever, it should be bold. Maybe the new director will adopt a few of Mr. Mortier's more intriguing ideas, like importing the haunting English National Opera production of Britten's ''Death in Venice,'' which starred Ian Bostridge as Aschenbach, one of the hottest tickets in London in 2007. And how about the new staging of Philip Glass's ''Einstein on the Beach'' with which Mr. Mortier wanted to inaugurate the renovated Koch Theater? And please, New York must finally have a production of Messiaen's visionary ''St. Francois d'Assise,'' another Mortier promise. The Met is not about to take on this five-hour spiritual epic. Go to it, people's opera.

HEADLINE: A Tree Grows in Panama

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
While working in eastern Panama between 2002 and 2006, four young Peace Corps volunteers conceived of a plan to help restore the region's disappearing tropical forests, provide income for struggling landowners and make money for investors and themselves. 
 It's one thing to have an idea and another to start a business, of course. But the partners -- using skills gleaned from academic programs in business, design and international relations -- have pulled it off. 
 Their company, Planting Empowerment, leases land in the region -- a pocket of biological riches that has been eroding under decades of slash-and-burn farming. Money from investors is used to plant and tend about 500 trees an acre that, in 25 years, should become a source of valuable tropical hardwood. 
 The key to the model is the concept of leasing, according to Damion Croston, a 29-year-old graduate student at Ohio University who is studying international development. (Another founder graduated in May from Thunderbird School for Global Management in Phoenix. The two others have degrees from Johns Hopkins and Virginia Tech.)
 When land is bought outright for tree plantations, the farmer is displaced. But Planting Empowerment is using only uncultivated, deforested parcels of a farmer's land, allowing agriculture to continue on other parcels. A lease clause prevents the use of the money to buy and clear more land. And to guarantee that the tree canopy is always increasing, trees are planted on different tracts at different times; as one patch of trees matures and is harvested, others will be in various stages of growth.
 Investors, who must plunk down a minimum of $7,000, have so far been mainly family and acquaintances, Mr. Croston says. But Planting Empowerment is now selling $50 and $100 forest savings bonds with an expected return, after lumber is harvested, equivalent to 7.8 percent a year. Some income from the plantings, now on 50 acres, is possible after five years, when foresters start thinning the dense stands of young trees to make room for others to grow to maturity.
 The business plan has won recognition in college-sponsored competitions aimed at fostering socially responsible ventures, including those at the University of Washington, Notre Dame, Yale and the University of Texas, Austin, where Planting Empowerment was second out of more than 1,000 ideas. 
 To promote sustainable economic opportunity, Planting Empowerment intends not only to pay indigenous people for the use of their land but also to provide some higher-level employment and a share of profits. 
 ''We believe,'' Mr. Croston says, ''in a more inclusive sort of capitalism.''

HEADLINE: School's Supporters Fight a Rising Tide

BYLINE: By KEVIN COYNE. 
E-mail: jersey@nytimes.com

DATELINE: Sea Isle City 

 BODY:
 A WINTER rain was falling in this summer place, and the cars that had just come over the bridge from the mainland -- all two of them -- waited patiently for the light to change at the central intersection where patience often wilts on July weekends. Whether you turned north or south onto the artery that runs the length of the island, it hardly mattered: Landis Avenue stretched empty for miles in both directions, as densely built as a city, but as sparsely peopled as the frontier.
 The lights were on at a handful of businesses on this gray afternoon: the supermarket, the convenience stores, the real estate offices. But everything else was battened down and silent, waiting for the sunny days to return: the gift shops along the beach promenade, the restaurants along Fish Alley, the cluster of bars around 40th Street. Most of the homes were dark, too, standing shoulder to shoulder, block after block, with few signs of habitation. 
 Like many shore towns, especially those on the barrier islands at the state's southern tip, Sea Isle City has wrestled in recent years with an economic paradox -- a real-estate frenzy, but a population decline. Cottages that were year-round homes for locals have been bulldozed to make way for grander dwellings that are vacation spots for visitors. Between 2002 and 2007, according to the Census Bureau, the population of the Ocean City metropolitan area (which consists of Cape May County) dropped from 101,449 to 96,422, a 5 percent decline that was exceeded in the United States by only two metropolitan areas -- the two that were devastated by Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans and the Gulf Coast of Mississippi.
 ''With the locals moving off, every year you say to yourself, 'Hmm, Bill used to come in, or Jim used to come in, but he doesn't come in anymore,' '' said Leonard C. Desiderio, 51, the mayor since 1993, a Cape May County freeholder, and the owner of a bar popular with year-round residents, McNutley's, as well as a motel and a liquor store. ''It was crazy. When the boom was going, properties were selling for $800,000 just to knock them down, which was unheard of, and many of the longtime residents were saying, 'This is just too good.' ''
 The lights were on this afternoon at the town's only school, too, but how much longer they stay on is the question at the center of the town's biggest debate, the most emotionally fraught consequence of the population decline. 
 ''It's getting heated,'' said Joe LaRosa, 44, as he walked with his wife, Jodi, 41, through the quiet halls of the one-story brick school that had almost 200 students when he attended in the 1970s; it has 68 now, including their two sons. ''There's a group of people who aren't going to give up until they get this school closed.''
 Other shore resorts have faced shrinking school enrollments, but the decline has been especially sharp, and the proposed solution especially drastic, here in this town with 7,000 dwelling units, a summer-weekend population of 40,000, a year-round population of perhaps 2,400 and an eighth-grade graduating class of seven. Last April's board of education election was ''basically a yes-no vote for the school,'' said Mr. LaRosa, who was one of four candidates who ran on a platform of keeping the school open. His slate lost in a close vote, which resulted in a majority on the nine-member board that favored closing the school and sending the students to another district. 
 ''You could see them come over the bridge, go in and vote, get back in their cars with the Pennsylvania tags and go right back over the bridge,'' said Jodi LaRosa.
 Taxes have always been a contentious issue in towns with many second-home owners who resent paying for services they don't much use, and as the year-round population here declined, and the per-pupil cost of the school consequently rose -- $36,000 for each student now, the highest in the state, according to the new board president, Valere Egnasko -- the debate grew louder. 
 ''It's not the financial issue as much as it is the educational experience,'' said Ms. Egnasko, 56, a retired actuary who has owned property in town since 1986 and been a full-time resident for the last four years. Despite the school's high cost, taxes are exceptionally low -- the fifth-lowest in the state, as the mayor often points out -- because the property in town is so valuable, assessed at almost $5 billion. The total annual tax bill on a property assessed at $1 million is $5,200. 
 ''You'd like to think there's a quick and easy solution, but there's just an enormous number of complexities, and it can be very, very emotional, which is understandable,'' Ms. Egnasko said. ''As an actuary I never hit a problem anywhere near as complex as the school problem.''
 The smaller the school, the harder it is to provide the services the state mandates. ''There's been a movement from Trenton to encourage schools to consolidate, so a small school like ours is really getting caught in the squeeze,'' she said.
 One initial suggestion was to close the school and send the students to the same place the local high-school students have long gone: Ocean City, one island to the north. But that plan snagged when Ocean City said it would take the students, but not the tenured teachers. Other possibilities have also been considered -- sharing services at various levels with other neighboring districts -- and will be discussed at a special board meeting on Jan. 14.
 ''We could afford it then, why can't we afford it now?'' asked Mr. LaRosa, the kitchen manager at a local seafood restaurant who lives two doors down from the school. His house is the one his grandfather bought in 1918 after arriving on the island to run a pound-net fishing company -- intercepting schools of weakfish, bluefish, mackerel and every other species that migrated past. 
 ''History I guess repeats itself, and we're going back there,'' he said about the enrollment that has declined to near the levels of his father's school years just before World War II. He is considering another run for the school board in April. ''Maybe it will stay like this for awhile, but maybe more people will move back in and it might still become more of a year-round community. But if the school closes, you don't have that chance anymore.''
 Mr. LaRosa was standing in the shadows of the gym where the school-board meetings have been held lately to accommodate the large and often contentious audience, and he switched on the light to point out one of the championship banners hanging on the wall -- the oldest one, from 1978, for his soccer team.
 ''It was 2-1 in overtime and I had the assist for the winning goal,'' he said, and then he switched the light off again.

HEADLINE: It's Fruitful And Multiplies

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE LAGORIO

 BODY:
Oh, those lonely plums, hidden beneath the banana bunch, forgotten until they are nearly prunes. Fill a bowl with fruit and a piece or two will invariably rot.
 Enter Sarah K. O'Brien. Her Elizabowl is more honeycomb than basin, its shape-shifting white plastic folds resembling an Elizabethan ruff. The bowl's petals expand to yield more than a dozen flexible, fist-sized compartments. Each holds one round fruit, keeping it visible and away from the other fruits' discharge of ethylene gas, which speeds spoilage. When folded, the collar design can cradle one or two grapefruits. 
 Ms. O'Brien conceived of the bowl last winter as a senior at the University of Louisiana, Lafayette. She had been seeking a fruit-spoilage solution for the International Home Housewares Student Design Competition, and cordoned herself off in her dorm room with, well, a lot of fruit. ''I knew that I needed something to make me really stand out from the pack, being an unemployed, 30-year-old senior,'' says Ms. O'Brien, now 31.
 Before enrolling in the university's industrial design program, she had held a job as director of research for the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra, forgoing college until she could find a focus. ''Then I was looking around my room one day and thought, 'Well, I built my couch; I designed my curtains. I had my table shipped from New York. I realized this was what made me different.''
 Ms. O'Brien won the housewares contest. She received a patent in October, and is exploring ways of putting the bowl on the market, perhaps by selling the design to a housewares company. 
 The Elizabowl still makes her smile. ''You can examine something intellectually forever, but it's someone's facial expression when they first interact with it that tells if it's a success for me,'' she says. ''I can see a kid being excited to eat an apple just so he can move around the bowl.''

HEADLINE: The End of the Financial World As We Know It

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LEWIS and DAVID EINHORN. 
Michael Lewis, a contributing editor at Vanity Fair and the author of ''Liar's Poker,'' is writing a book about the collapse of Wall Street. David Einhorn is the president of Greenlight Capital, a hedge fund, and the author of ''Fooling Some of the People All of the Time.'' Investment accounts managed by Greenlight may have a position (long or short) in the securities discussed in this article.

 BODY:
AMERICANS enter the New Year in a strange new role: financial lunatics. We've been viewed by the wider world with mistrust and suspicion on other matters, but on the subject of money even our harshest critics have been inclined to believe that we knew what we were doing. They watched our investment bankers and emulated them: for a long time now half the planet's college graduates seemed to want nothing more out of life than a job on Wall Street. 
 This is one reason the collapse of our financial system has inspired not merely a national but a global crisis of confidence. Good God, the world seems to be saying, if they don't know what they are doing with money, who does? 
 Incredibly, intelligent people the world over remain willing to lend us money and even listen to our advice; they appear not to have realized the full extent of our madness. We have at least a brief chance to cure ourselves. But first we need to ask: of what? 
 To that end consider the strange story of Harry Markopolos. Mr. Markopolos is the former investment officer with Rampart Investment Management in Boston who, for nine years, tried to explain to the Securities and Exchange Commission that Bernard L. Madoff couldn't be anything other than a fraud. Mr. Madoff's investment performance, given his stated strategy, was not merely improbable but mathematically impossible. And so, Mr. Markopolos reasoned, Bernard Madoff must be doing something other than what he said he was doing. 
 In his devastatingly persuasive 17-page letter to the S.E.C., Mr. Markopolos saw two possible scenarios. In the ''Unlikely'' scenario: Mr. Madoff, who acted as a broker as well as an investor, was ''front-running'' his brokerage customers. A customer might submit an order to Madoff Securities to buy shares in I.B.M. at a certain price, for example, and Madoff Securities instantly would buy I.B.M. shares for its own portfolio ahead of the customer order. If I.B.M.'s shares rose, Mr. Madoff kept them; if they fell he fobbed them off onto the poor customer. 
 In the ''Highly Likely'' scenario, wrote Mr. Markopolos, ''Madoff Securities is the world's largest Ponzi Scheme.'' Which, as we now know, it was. 
 Harry Markopolos sent his report to the S.E.C. on Nov. 7, 2005 -- more than three years before Mr. Madoff was finally exposed -- but he had been trying to explain the fraud to them since 1999. He had no direct financial interest in exposing Mr. Madoff -- he wasn't an unhappy investor or a disgruntled employee. There was no way to short shares in Madoff Securities, and so Mr. Markopolos could not have made money directly from Mr. Madoff's failure. To judge from his letter, Harry Markopolos anticipated mainly downsides for himself: he declined to put his name on it for fear of what might happen to him and his family if anyone found out he had written it. And yet the S.E.C.'s cursory investigation of Mr. Madoff pronounced him free of fraud.
 What's interesting about the Madoff scandal, in retrospect, is how little interest anyone inside the financial system had in exposing it. It wasn't just Harry Markopolos who smelled a rat. As Mr. Markopolos explained in his letter, Goldman Sachs was refusing to do business with Mr. Madoff; many others doubted Mr. Madoff's profits or assumed he was front-running his customers and steered clear of him. Between the lines, Mr. Markopolos hinted that even some of Mr. Madoff's investors may have suspected that they were the beneficiaries of a scam. After all, it wasn't all that hard to see that the profits were too good to be true. Some of Mr. Madoff's investors may have reasoned that the worst that could happen to them, if the authorities put a stop to the front-running, was that a good thing would come to an end. 
 The Madoff scandal echoes a deeper absence inside our financial system, which has been undermined not merely by bad behavior but by the lack of checks and balances to discourage it. ''Greed'' doesn't cut it as a satisfying explanation for the current financial crisis. Greed was necessary but insufficient; in any case, we are as likely to eliminate greed from our national character as we are lust and envy. The fixable problem isn't the greed of the few but the misaligned interests of the many. 
 A lot has been said and written, for instance, about the corrupting effects on Wall Street of gigantic bonuses. What happened inside the major Wall Street firms, though, was more deeply unsettling than greedy people lusting for big checks: leaders of public corporations, especially financial corporations, are as good as required to lead for the short term. 
 Richard Fuld, the former chief executive of Lehman Brothers, E. Stanley O'Neal, the former chief executive of Merrill Lynch, and Charles O. Prince III, Citigroup's chief executive, may have paid themselves humongous sums of money at the end of each year, as a result of the bond market bonanza. But if any one of them had set himself up as a whistleblower -- had stood up and said ''this business is irresponsible and we are not going to participate in it'' -- he would probably have been fired. Not immediately, perhaps. But a few quarters of earnings that lagged behind those of every other Wall Street firm would invite outrage from subordinates, who would flee for other, less responsible firms, and from shareholders, who would call for his resignation. Eventually he'd be replaced by someone willing to make money from the credit bubble. 
 OUR financial catastrophe, like Bernard Madoff's pyramid scheme, required all sorts of important, plugged-in people to sacrifice our collective long-term interests for short-term gain. The pressure to do this in today's financial markets is immense. Obviously the greater the market pressure to excel in the short term, the greater the need for pressure from outside the market to consider the longer term. But that's the problem: there is no longer any serious pressure from outside the market. The tyranny of the short term has extended itself with frightening ease into the entities that were meant to, one way or another, discipline Wall Street, and force it to consider its enlightened self-interest.
 The credit-rating agencies, for instance. 
 Everyone now knows that Moody's and Standard & Poor's botched their analyses of bonds backed by home mortgages. But their most costly mistake -- one that deserves a lot more attention than it has received -- lies in their area of putative expertise: measuring corporate risk. 
 Over the last 20 years American financial institutions have taken on more and more risk, with the blessing of regulators, with hardly a word from the rating agencies, which, incidentally, are paid by the issuers of the bonds they rate. Seldom if ever did Moody's or Standard & Poor's say, ''If you put one more risky asset on your balance sheet, you will face a serious downgrade.'' 
 The American International Group, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, General Electric and the municipal bond guarantors Ambac Financial and MBIA all had triple-A ratings. (G.E. still does!) Large investment banks like Lehman and Merrill Lynch all had solid investment grade ratings. It's almost as if the higher the rating of a financial institution, the more likely it was to contribute to financial catastrophe. But of course all these big financial companies fueled the creation of the credit products that in turn fueled the revenues of Moody's and Standard & Poor's. 
 These oligopolies, which are actually sanctioned by the S.E.C., didn't merely do their jobs badly. They didn't simply miss a few calls here and there. In pursuit of their own short-term earnings, they did exactly the opposite of what they were meant to do: rather than expose financial risk they systematically disguised it. 
 This is a subject that might be profitably explored in Washington. There are many questions an enterprising United States senator might want to ask the credit-rating agencies. Here is one: Why did you allow MBIA to keep its triple-A rating for so long? In 1990 MBIA was in the relatively simple business of insuring municipal bonds. It had $931 million in equity and only $200 million of debt -- and a plausible triple-A rating. 
 By 2006 MBIA had plunged into the much riskier business of guaranteeing collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O.'s. But by then it had $7.2 billion in equity against an astounding $26.2 billion in debt. That is, even as it insured ever-greater risks in its business, it also took greater risks on its balance sheet. 
 Yet the rating agencies didn't so much as blink. On Wall Street the problem was hardly a secret: many people understood that MBIA didn't deserve to be rated triple-A. As far back as 2002, a hedge fund called Gotham Partners published a persuasive report, widely circulated, entitled: ''Is MBIA Triple A?'' (The answer was obviously no.) 
 At the same time, almost everyone believed that the rating agencies would never downgrade MBIA, because doing so was not in their short-term financial interest. A downgrade of MBIA would force the rating agencies to go through the costly and cumbersome process of re-rating tens of thousands of credits that bore triple-A ratings simply by virtue of MBIA's guarantee. It would stick a wrench in the machine that enriched them. (In June, finally, the rating agencies downgraded MBIA, after MBIA's failure became such an open secret that nobody any longer cared about its formal credit rating.)
 The S.E.C. now promises modest new measures to contain the damage that the rating agencies can do -- measures that fail to address the central problem: that the raters are paid by the issuers. 
 But this should come as no surprise, for the S.E.C. itself is plagued by similarly wacky incentives. Indeed, one of the great social benefits of the Madoff scandal may be to finally reveal the S.E.C. for what it has become. 
 Created to protect investors from financial predators, the commission has somehow evolved into a mechanism for protecting financial predators with political clout from investors. (The task it has performed most diligently during this crisis has been to question, intimidate and impose rules on short-sellers -- the only market players who have a financial incentive to expose fraud and abuse.) 
 The instinct to avoid short-term political heat is part of the problem; anything the S.E.C. does to roil the markets, or reduce the share price of any given company, also roils the careers of the people who run the S.E.C. Thus it seldom penalizes serious corporate and management malfeasance -- out of some misguided notion that to do so would cause stock prices to fall, shareholders to suffer and confidence to be undermined. Preserving confidence, even when that confidence is false, has been near the top of the S.E.C.'s agenda. 
 IT'S not hard to see why the S.E.C. behaves as it does. If you work for the enforcement division of the S.E.C. you probably know in the back of your mind, and in the front too, that if you maintain good relations with Wall Street you might soon be paid huge sums of money to be employed by it. 
 The commission's most recent director of enforcement is the general counsel at JPMorgan Chase; the enforcement chief before him became general counsel at Deutsche Bank; and one of his predecessors became a managing director for Credit Suisse before moving on to Morgan Stanley. A casual observer could be forgiven for thinking that the whole point of landing the job as the S.E.C.'s director of enforcement is to position oneself for the better paying one on Wall Street. 
 At the back of the version of Harry Markopolos's brave paper currently making the rounds is a copy of an e-mail message, dated April 2, 2008, from Mr. Markopolos to Jonathan S. Sokobin. Mr. Sokobin was then the new head of the commission's office of risk assessment, a job that had been vacant for more than a year after its previous occupant had left to -- you guessed it -- take a higher-paying job on Wall Street. 
 At any rate, Mr. Markopolos clearly hoped that a new face might mean a new ear -- one that might be receptive to the truth. He phoned Mr. Sokobin and then sent him his paper. ''Attached is a submission I've made to the S.E.C. three times in Boston,'' he wrote. ''Each time Boston sent this to New York. Meagan Cheung, branch chief, in New York actually investigated this but with no result that I am aware of. In my conversations with her, I did not believe that she had the derivatives or mathematical background to understand the violations.''
 How does this happen? How can the person in charge of assessing Wall Street firms not have the tools to understand them? Is the S.E.C. that inept? Perhaps, but the problem inside the commission is far worse -- because inept people can be replaced. The problem is systemic. The new director of risk assessment was no more likely to grasp the risk of Bernard Madoff than the old director of risk assessment because the new guy's thoughts and beliefs were guided by the same incentives: the need to curry favor with the politically influential and the desire to keep sweet the Wall Street elite. 
 And here's the most incredible thing of all: 18 months into the most spectacular man-made financial calamity in modern experience, nothing has been done to change that, or any of the other bad incentives that led us here in the first place. 
 SAY what you will about our government's approach to the financial crisis, you cannot accuse it of wasting its energy being consistent or trying to win over the masses. In the past year there have been at least seven different bailouts, and six different strategies. And none of them seem to have pleased anyone except a handful of financiers. 
 When Bear Stearns failed, the government induced JPMorgan Chase to buy it by offering a knockdown price and guaranteeing Bear Stearns's shakiest assets. Bear Stearns bondholders were made whole and its stockholders lost most of their money. 
 Then came the collapse of the government-sponsored entities, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, both promptly nationalized. Management was replaced, shareholders badly diluted, creditors left intact but with some uncertainty. Next came Lehman Brothers, which was, of course, allowed to go bankrupt. At first, the Treasury and the Federal Reserve claimed they had allowed Lehman to fail in order to signal that recklessly managed Wall Street firms did not all come with government guarantees; but then, when chaos ensued, and people started saying that letting Lehman fail was a dumb thing to have done, they changed their story and claimed they lacked the legal authority to rescue the firm. 
 But then a few days later A.I.G. failed, or tried to, yet was given the gift of life with enormous government loans. Washington Mutual and Wachovia promptly followed: the first was unceremoniously seized by the Treasury, wiping out both its creditors and shareholders; the second was batted around for a bit. Initially, the Treasury tried to persuade Citigroup to buy it -- again at a knockdown price and with a guarantee of the bad assets. (The Bear Stearns model.) Eventually, Wachovia went to Wells Fargo, after the Internal Revenue Service jumped in and sweetened the pot with a tax subsidy.
 In the middle of all this, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. persuaded Congress that he needed $700 billion to buy distressed assets from banks -- telling the senators and representatives that if they didn't give him the money the stock market would collapse. Once handed the money, he abandoned his promised strategy, and instead of buying assets at market prices, began to overpay for preferred stocks in the banks themselves. Which is to say that he essentially began giving away billions of dollars to Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and a few others unnaturally selected for survival. The stock market fell anyway.
 It's hard to know what Mr. Paulson was thinking as he never really had to explain himself, at least not in public. But the general idea appears to be that if you give the banks capital they will in turn use it to make loans in order to stimulate the economy. Never mind that if you want banks to make smart, prudent loans, you probably shouldn't give money to bankers who sunk themselves by making a lot of stupid, imprudent ones. If you want banks to re-lend the money, you need to provide them not with preferred stock, which is essentially a loan, but with tangible common equity -- so that they might write off their losses, resolve their troubled assets and then begin to make new loans, something they won't be able to do until they're confident in their own balance sheets. But as it happened, the banks took the taxpayer money and just sat on it.

 Though several productions had planned limited runs and others arguably had it coming, a shocking number of Broadway shows will be closing on Sunday, making the first full week of 2009 a bleak start to what is likely to be a dark month (and possibly a dreary year) for New York theater. Sigh. 
 But there is plenty of life below 42nd Street, including the annual UNDER THE RADAR FESTIVAL, produced by the Public Theater and Mark Russell. This eclectic event has been introducing audiences to the work of artists from around the world for five years, and this year it's an especially important reminder that there are innovators out there assuring a future for the theater. 
 Besides, how often can you see a Korean theater company doing a stripped-down version of a German Expressionist play set to Argentine, tango-inspired music by Astor Piazzolla? That production, Georg Buchner's ''Woyzeck,'' presented by the Sadari Movement Laboratory from Seoul, South Korea, is one of more than a dozen offerings from the Netherlands, Britain, Ireland and the United States at the Public Theater and several other locations. And the ticket price is not going to break you, despite the bleak economy. Wednesday through Jan. 18. Full schedule and ticket information: (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org; $15 to $25.
 In the same vein see CULTUREMART 2009, another eclectic annual festival, running at the Here Arts Center, where two of the shows are collaborations with Under the Radar. Through Feb. 4, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 352-3101, here .org; $15 to $20.

HEADLINE: Living Apart for the Paycheck

BYLINE: By JENNIFER CONLIN

 BODY:
IT'S a typical weekday in the Ghosh household. Two-year-old Emilio, strapped in a highchair, is dallying over breakfast while his father pleads with him to finish. 
 ''Try some blueberries,'' Gautam Ghosh suggests, then slips his hand into a Baby Einstein puppet and begins his daily ritual of entertaining Emilio while his wife gets ready for work.
 Such scenes are hardly unusual for two-career couples with children, but this one is remarkable for the fact that Dr. Ghosh, an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania, is nearly 9,000 miles away and a daunting 16 hours behind his family's time zone. When his wife, Cecilia, and Emilio begin their day in New Zealand, it is the previous afternoon in Dr. Ghosh's Philadelphia office, where he conducts his morning video chats with Emilio via Skype -- software that enables users to transmit their voices and images through the Internet. 
 ''We talk in the morning and around dinner, when my wife needs my help the most,'' said Mr. Ghosh, whose wife recently accepted a post as an assistant professor at the University of Otago in New Zealand. 
 ''This was a career decision we simply had to make for financial stability,'' he said. 
 The Ghoshes are hardly alone in choosing to live in different places because of work. In 2006, the Census Bureau reported that 3.6 million married Americans (not including separated couples) were living apart from their spouses. In March, Worldwide ERC, the association for work-force mobility, released a report revealing that three-fourths of the 174 relocation agents surveyed had dealt with at least one commuter marriage in 2007, a 53 percent increase since 2003. 
 ''Families today are undergoing all sorts of strains that didn't exist before and are simply having to adjust to make things work,'' said David Popenoe, co-director of the National Marriage Project at Rutgers University, who says the challenging economy may force more couples into commuter marriages for the sake of a paycheck.
 Reginald C. Richardson, a vice president of the Family Institute at Northwestern University and a lecturer in psychology, agrees. ''I think we are going to see more and more commuter marriages in the future, given the global economy and the fact that our technology now makes this more doable,'' Dr. Richardson said. 
 Emma Child, a partner in the investment banking group of Rose Partnership in London, a financial services and corporate search firm, said that in recent months she had noted a marked increase in the willingness of couples to live in different locations. 
 ''Eighteen months ago anyone searching for a new job would ask to be placed in their current location,'' Ms. Child said. ''Now they come in and say 'I am prepared to move,' even, if necessary, without the family.'' 
 She added: ''We send a lot of people to emerging markets right now. But honestly, who wants to move the family to Lagos? And if the spouse is working, who wants to give up the second income?''
 Until last year, the author and teacher Miles Harvey and his wife, Rengin Altay, were getting by in Chicago on two freelance incomes. But when his wife, an actress, lost her Screen Actors Guild insurance because her voice-over work had all but dried up, they began worrying about their financial future, particularly with two young children to support.
 ''I wonder if we would be doing this if the economy was better,'' said Mr. Harvey, who accepted an assistant professorship at the University of New Orleans last spring and who now commutes weekly to Chicago. Though the plan is for the family to move to Louisiana, he says, ''It is not a great time to buy a house in New Orleans, nor is it a good time to sell one in Chicago.'' 
 Lori Janoff, who lives in the family home in Larchmont, N.Y., with her two youngest children, ages 17 and 15, while her husband, Peter, is in Brazil working as an asset manager for a property management company, said, ''Without a financial incentive I don't know why anyone would do this.''
 Ms. Janoff, who sees her husband once every six weeks, when he flies home, added, ''It was the perfect timing professionally for him, and the worst timing personally for our family.'' She said it would be disruptive to move her daughter, who is in her last year of high school, noting that moving to Brazil would also be tough on her and her youngest son.
 ''We don't speak Portuguese, and we would both have to make all new friends,'' Ms. Janoff said. Of course, raising children as a single parent has its share of challenges, some of which are similar to divorced parents. 
 ''I have all the responsibility now for the children and have had to become the serious disciplinarian,'' Ms. Janoff said. When her husband comes home he gets to be ''Mr. Fun,'' she said. 
 Ms. Altay of Chicago said, ''I know I holler more,'' adding that she retained her role as chief authoritarian when her husband visited because ''it helps to have one boss laying down the rules.''
 Conversely, the out-of-town spouses lament that they feel like outsiders in their own homes -- an issue Amos Guiora, a law professor at the University of Utah, said he got over quickly when he moved in 2004 to the United States from Israel for work. 
 ''I realized quickly my status had changed,'' Mr. Guiora said. ''You have to pick up the rhythm of the family, they shouldn't have to pick up yours.'' 
 Sarah Larson, whose husband commutes to Detroit from Chicago three days a week to manage a real estate development project, said she treated their two children, ages 11 and 13, differently while he was away. ''I don't worry about what is for dinner when my husband is not home,'' Ms. Larson said. ''I am sure the kids' manners are deteriorating and they are not getting as nutritious a meal, but that part is definitely a lot easier.'' 
 The at-home spouse may find that there are actually a few small advantages to having their partner away.
 While loneliness is often a big factor for both spouses, it can also add romance to the relationship. 
 ''The physical distance has been exhilarating for our relationship,'' said Audrey O'Connell, a department head at a London museum, who has been married 42 years to her husband, John. They are on their third year of a long-distance marriage (he moved back to their home in Montana to work for an educational institution) and have a rule that they must meet at least once every five weeks for a minimum of five days. 
 And while technology like Skype can help, it is not always the answer. 
 ''I hate e-mail,'' said Mr. Guiora's wife, Hagit. Her husband calls her twice a day and sleeps with his cellphone next to his ear so their three children can reach him any time of day.
 Still, technology has made it much easier for couples to commute. 
 ''A couple of hundred years ago a sailor went to sea and you didn't know if he were dead or alive for a few years,'' says Tina B. Tessina, whose latest book, ''The Commuter Marriage: Keep Your Relationship Close While You're Far Apart,'' gives couples tips on how to stay connected, which include making use of the latest technology. 
 One unexpected reaction commuting couples encounter is the assumption that there is some underlying problem in the marriage. 
 ''We looked at the situation as an experiment, but even our children worried we might be on the road to divorce,'' said Ms. O'Connell, whose grown children have families of their own. 
 However, as Brenda Fender, a relocation expert and director at Worldwide ERC, points out, the stress involved in maintaining a long-distance marriage can emphasize underlying problems. ''These types of work assignments have a profound effect on the family,'' Ms. Fender said. ''If there is any trouble in the relationship, this can be the tipping point.'' 
 While most commuting couples interviewed for this article view the situation as a temporary necessity and feel optimistic about their futures, at least one person's marriage did not withstand the stress. 
 ''My short-term project in Europe gave me a new perspective on our 22-year marriage,'' said one woman, who asked that her name not be used. ''It basically opened a whole new vista on my life and convinced me it was time for a divorce.''

HEADLINE: The Socializr

BYLINE: By GREGORY DICUM

 BODY:
IN San Francisco, the ongoing financial crisis can sometimes seem little more than a rumor, especially at night. Restaurants are still packed, bars are hopping, parties remain remarkably free of long faces. It is in part thanks to Web 2.0 -- the blockbuster field of online social networking -- that much of San Francisco is partying on.
 Jonathan Abrams, the serial entrepreneur who founded Friendster in 2002, and Socializr, a site devoted to optimizing users' social calendars, last February, is in the thick of the scene. 
 The e-mail invitation for an evening out from Mr. Abrams included a pink candy heart with both our names engraved on it and an audio stream of Guns N' Roses' ''Welcome to the Jungle'' -- a twee amalgam that I chose to read as endearingly ironic.
 I met Mr. Abrams, who is originally from Toronto, at an Irish bar in the SoMa district (so named for ''south of Market Street,'' the city's main drag), where unpretentious millionaire geniuses live and breathe databases and venture capital. 
 ''I'm going to have a chick drink,'' said Mr. Abrams, 38, ordering a vanilla Stoli and Coke. ''I got it from the ex of an ex-girlfriend. He's a nerd like me.''
 In a black OBEY Propaganda T-shirt and jeans, with terminal bed head and a hoary beard tinged gray -- perhaps from his days coding for Netscape -- Mr. Abrams was at his most voluble discussing the cozy world of Silicon Valley.
 ''I am a technology entrepreneur and a nerd. My life isn't that interesting, except that I own a bar,'' he said, referring to Slide, the San Francisco nightclub where he is one of the owners. 
 If Mr. Abrams straddles the divide between serious geek and party animal, at present the former dominates. Socializr, which combines event-planning with features like photo-sharing and friends-of-friends networking, takes up too much of his time for him to enjoy the life of a real socializer. 
 ''When you're running one of these things,'' he said, ''you don't have time to take advantage of it.'' Still, he said, ''It was a natural thing for me to do because I used to throw a lot of parties in my loft.'' 
 Instead of a nightclub, we went next door to the offices of a Web start-up where a weekly poker game of young dot-commers was in full swing.
 ''I like to keep connected to this younger generation of guys,'' Mr. Abrams said. 
 It was a lively crowd of about a dozen overachievers from various newish Web enterprises, like Dropbox, Disqus, Justin.tv, Scribd, Snaptalent, Livemeeting and an unnamed enterprise in Cupertino, Calif. Everyone was in T-shirts and jeans, playing low-stakes Texas Hold 'Em around a conference table. Black LCD monitors surrounded us, an invitation to get back to work. 
 By the time we took a Twitter break, I was down $40. Mr. Abrams, who spent much of the game scowling (he is the kind of player who either folds early or raises relentlessly), ended the night up. 
 ''I don't want to say how much,'' he said by e-mail later, ''because it's a bit embarrassing.''

HEADLINE: Not Just Another Dorm

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
Peter Applebome writes the Our Towns column for The Times.

 BODY:
To anyone who has ever wandered the halls of a college dormitory, Huntington Hall definitely has a familiar feel. You've got the slackers playing Halo and Call of Duty 4, the international students trying to make sense of their weird American peers, the quad where students play volleyball and Ultimate Frisbee when the weather's good, the intellectually engaging art on walls and doors, like the poster reading ''What I Really Learned in School (the Big Shots on Campus)'' with its pictures of 20 glasses of booze.
 ''College kids will be college kids,'' Trent Knapp, a resident adviser, says with a shrug. ''The things kids do here are probably the same as what they do anywhere else.''
 What's different about Huntington Hall, though, is that it is a residence hall at what is usually thought of as a commuter environment -- in this case, Mohawk Valley Community College in Utica, N.Y., an old textile and manufacturing town now struggling to find its way. 
 Despite the stereotypes, two-year colleges around the country are becoming 24-hour campuses. It's a reflection of economics, the growing enrollment at community colleges, and a new interest on the part of administrators in competing with their larger counterparts by serving more than just a local clientele. 
 ''We're the fastest-growing segment of higher education, so it makes sense to want to create a vibrant, dynamic campus culture,'' says Randall J. VanWagoner, Mohawk Valley's president, who began his own college career at Mott Community College in Flint, Mich., and eventually earned a doctorate in higher education administration from the University of Michigan. ''More and more, so much of learning happens outside of class, and this offers our students a tremendous opportunity to get more out of their experience here,'' he says. 
 Campuses that have recently added their first residence halls range from Metropolitan Community College in Omaha (Dr. VanWagoner's previous institution) to Niagara County Community College in upstate New York to Hillsborough Community College in Florida, which opened a $14 million student apartment complex a year ago. Itasca Community College in Minnesota offers housing with priority for engineering students, who spend a lot of time on campus working on projects and in labs.
 According to the American Association of Community Colleges, of the nation's 1,195 community colleges, 303 have residence halls. Community colleges enroll 6.5 million for-credit students and 11.5 million total. That translates into 46 percent of the country's undergraduates. And as growing numbers of students attend community colleges right out of high school, living on campus is increasingly part of the package. 
 Mohawk Valley, now part of the State University of New York system, was founded in 1946 as the New York State Institute of Applied Arts and Sciences. It was New York's first community college and the first in the state to add residence halls, back in the 1960s. It added its fifth and newest one -- the suite-style, 155-bed, $7.5 million New Hall -- in 2005 and still has a hefty waiting list. The dorms hold 516 students, 98 from neighboring counties and most of the rest from other parts of New York State. 
 Mr. Knapp, 20, a second-year student who wears a green ''MVCC'' hoodie, has a single room decorated with pictures of motorcycles and messages from his girlfriend, Melissa, a student at the University of Buffalo. His duties as a resident adviser include the standard dorm routine of inspecting bathrooms, checking out noise complaints and responding to violations of alcohol regulations. 
 He represents one likely path to a community college residence hall. After high school in Marathon, N.Y., he didn't think it made sense to pay the higher tuition at a four-year college until he had a better idea what he wanted to study. And while he could have attended a two-year college closer to home, in nearby Dryden, he wanted a more traditional experience.
 ''I wanted to get outside my parents' protection and have a sense of responsibility, but I wasn't ready for a four-year school,'' he says. ''As it is, you get a chance here to be in classes of 15 to 25 students and to get to know your professors one on one. My girlfriend has 350 to 400 students in her classes.'' He hopes to transfer to Alfred State College next year to study construction management and engineering technologies.
 With its blocky, low-rise brick buildings and treeless residential quad surrounded by charmless three-story residence halls, Mohawk Valley's 80-acre campus is not a gothic- or Georgian-style wonderland. There's no ivy on the walls, no hip student shopping district with an Au Bon Pain, Starbucks or Cosi's; just a utilitarian campus bordered by parking lots in a comfortable suburb. (There's more of a street, restaurant and bar scene a short drive away in downtown Utica.)
 But then, most people can't afford a high-dollar educational experience -- particularly these days. Still, Mr. Knapp likes to attend the campus ice hockey, basketball and soccer games, and enjoys longboarding (it's a longer skateboard) or playing Ultimate Frisbee in the quad. Many students gravitate to the gym, and there's a campus Acoustic Cafe, movies, lectures and concerts and 20 sports teams (the women's cross-country team last fall won the national junior college Division III championship). Commuting students also hang out, playing pool in the game room at New Hall or cards in the commons areas. At night, with most students gone, the dorms are something of an oasis in a largely empty landscape.
 Another common path is that taken by Ki Wook Kim, a resident adviser at New Hall (it will likely get a more exalted name when an obliging donor is found). Mr. Kim, a 22-year-old second-year student from South Korea, is one of 38 international students living in dorms. Others come from countries including France, Greece and Japan.
 He says he would probably not have attended Mohawk Valley if it didn't have housing, but after a year in the dorms, many international students choose to live off-campus to get a broader experience of American life.
 Mr. Kim had planned to be near New York City, but without much of a grasp of American geography ended up about 240 miles away in a distant and frigid place, where the dorms provide a core of like-minded students in a thoroughly unfamiliar world. In the end it worked out: ''Right now I can say that studying in Utica was much better, especially the part of understanding the American culture. It is a small town, and there is more chance to socialize with American people.'' 
 Residents from as far away as New York City and a handful from out of state are also lured by programs in nursing, aviation maintenance and surgical-technician training. Of Mohawk Valley's approximately 6,200 students, about 4,650 come from Oneida County, where the school is located, and 1,430 from elsewhere in New York State; 71 are international students. 
 Another part of the attraction is cost: $3,250 in-state tuition for the academic year and $6,500 out-of-state. A double room is $2,555 a semester at New Hall, and a meal plan $1,475, competitive with what students might pay for an apartment. 
 Still, residential life will always be a minority experience at community colleges, especially for local college-age students and for older ones returning to school. 
 Dan Slifka has been out of school for a few years and has a pregnant girlfriend. At 22, he doesn't have much interest in living around a bunch of partying 18-year-olds.
 Danielle Oppenheimer says it made sense to live at home. ''You might as well save the money,'' she says. ''Why add several thousand dollars in costs when I'm going to transfer to a four-year college next year anyway?'' 
 Amanda Horne, who is studying to be a nurse while working full time, might have some abstract interest in living on campus, but it's not on her radar screen. ''The traditional college experience is reserved for students whose parents saved a lot of money,'' she says.
 For community colleges that cater to rural communities, residential living has long been part of their mission. In Wyoming, Casper College is one of seven two-year colleges in a state where the University of Wyoming is virtually the only four-year option. Casper houses 436 students out of an enrollment of 5,000. Dorms are a necessity in a state with brutal, snowy winters and where many students live hours from campus.
 Barb Meryhew, director of student life, says demand is at an all-time high. ''We're at 100 percent of capacity,'' she says. ''That's never happened in my 17 years here.'' 
 The demand, she says, is a result of the state's energy boom, which has brought in enough people to make housing scarce in Casper, and the desire of students for a more complete campus experience. ''We feel a true student life program really has to be in place in order to give the educational process a chance to grow,'' she says.
 In Maine, residential living is part of a redefinition of two-year colleges' mission. In 2003, the state shifted its focus from technical colleges to community colleges that would be bridges to four-year institutions -- part of an effort to increase college attendance, which trailed the rest of New England.
 The new mission has been especially successful in drawing college-age students. Degree-seeking enrollment in six years has grown by 63 percent, to 12,264, at the seven public community colleges in the state. But it soon became apparent that teachers couldn't educate students if students couldn't get to the campuses. So the state added dormitories at three colleges. Five of the seven now offer housing for their students, some of whom previously had to stay in hotels.
 ''If you take a look at a map of Maine, we're really spread out and the population is really spread out,'' says Helen Pelletier, a spokeswoman for the Maine Community College System. ''If we're going to make a college education more accessible to more of our citizens, you need dorms to do it.'' Sometimes, too, she says, students need to live away from home because there's only one campus that offers a desired program -- for example, a program in adventure tourism and recreation at Washington County Community College in Calais in the eastern part of the state, on the Canadian border.
 Housing has yet to become commonplace on urban campuses, where some educators see a pressing problem for students who lack a quiet and safe place to work, think and live, away from the chaos and cacophony at home. With the financial crisis, such expansion is not likely to be addressed soon.
 Dorms present a host of challenges for administrators. ''There's a lot to learn,'' says Dennis Golladay, vice chancellor for community colleges at the State University of New York system, where 30 of the 64 campuses are two-year colleges and roughly half have residence halls. ''You have to make sure that meal plans are taken care of. You have to pay attention to safety and security a lot more than if you're just a commuter campus. You need activities on weekends you didn't have before. Every college with which I'm familiar that added residence halls had a bump in the road, problems to iron out, unexpected things to address.''
 And some legislators are wary of mission creep. Frederick J. Amato, who served in the Monroe County Legislature in upstate New York for 21 years, considered himself a big supporter of the local community college but became a vocal critic when it moved to add a residence hall at the start of this decade. ''The purpose of a community college is to provide an affordable type of education for people around the area,'' Mr. Amato says. ''It doesn't benefit local people to bring people outside the region and outside the country to live in dorms here. 
 ''I think we should be sticking with the original mission,'' he says, ''not branching out like this.''
 Dr. VanWagoner sees the growth of residence halls as one indicator of the new attention being given to two-year colleges and interest in making them as accessible as possible. He notes, for example, that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation recently announced $32 million in grants to the nation's community colleges. That's a small part of a planned half-billion-dollar effort over the next four years that will include substantial investments in two-year colleges.
 ''The stigma of being 'less than' has been replaced by the idea of being 'different from,' '' Dr. VanWagoner says. ''Particularly given the economy, the bang for the buck is a little more tangible in terms of getting people trained and into the workforce. You just need to look at the enrollment figures. Students are voting with their feet.

HEADLINE: Who Owns Your Great Idea?

BYLINE: By SAMANTHA STAINBURN. 
Samantha Stainburn writes about higher education and entrepreneurship for Crain's Chicago Business.

 BODY:
Peter Zummo, a senior double-majoring in design and mechanical engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, is used to explaining the products he thinks up for his studio-class assignments. But last spring, he found himself answering questions of a different kind in a conference room at Rensselaer's office of technology commercialization, which tracks and patents inventions made on campus. 
 Mr. Zummo and his classmate Matthew Naples, who was attending the meeting via speakerphone, had designed a water bottle that could be filled with sand and reused as a brick to build housing in developing countries. The director of the office, Charles Rancourt, sitting across the table from Mr. Zummo, wanted to know: When had they come up with their design? Had they held brainstorming sessions on campus or off? What equipment had they used to produce their prototypes?
 Colleges and universities own the ideas and technologies invented by the people who work for them, including professors and graduate students who are paid to do research. Most universities also own inventions created by students using a significant amount of their resources, even if the inventors are undergraduates like Mr. Zummo and Mr. Naples, both 21. 
 The question of whether the two students or R.P.I. owned their invention was a tricky one. They had first designed plastic bottles that snapped together, Lego style, with two other students for a freshman design class project that challenged them to solve a social problem. Their idea was to keep the billions of water bottles that people in developing nations throw away each year out of landfills while providing the poor with free building materials. They presented a paper and a prototype in class, but ''it was a crude concept, and we never really hit our goals with our first rendition,'' Mr. Naples says. 
 As juniors, he and Mr. Zummo decided to tinker with the design again on their own (the rest of the original group didn't want to join them), brainstorming off the Troy, N.Y., campus and interviewing bottle manufacturers about the molding process and materials. They developed a new design that was cheaper to manufacture and could withstand more types of stresses than the first.
 With entrepreneurship booming, especially in courses that mix M.B.A. candidates with budding physicians or engineers, more and younger students are coming up with ideas that have commercial potential. While formal programs offer classes in managing intellectual property, plenty of students develop their ideas with little knowledge of how ownership is determined or the pros and cons of involving the university.
 ''Universities want to get whatever revenue streams come out of inventions so they can build more labs, have more research going on and hire more professors,'' says David Schwartz, executive editor of Technology Transfer Tactics, a newsletter for people working in the field. Lisa Rooney, director of Ohio University's tech transfer office, notes another interest: ''Most universities have a broader economic mission to help out their communities and states, and licensing or starting new companies is a way to do that.'' 
 Colleges and universities obtained fewer than 250 patents a year before 1980, when the Bayh-Dole Act gave them ownership of inventions developed through federally financed research. Now they acquire about 3,000 a year, according to the Association of University Technology Managers, whose members work in tech transfer offices. In 2006, association members made $45 billion from licensing fees and equity in spinoff companies; research powerhouses like Stanford and New York University made $61 million and $157 million, respectively.
 University help can be a boon for student inventors, too. A third to half of the money generated by a product is typically assigned to the student, with the rest split between the student's department and the university. That's a better deal than the zero percent collected by scientists working for corporations. And universities cover the legal fees involved in obtaining patents on inventions they own, which can easily total $15,000 a patent. 
 ''You can imagine a 20-year-old who develops something isn't going to have access to venture capital money or the expertise to patent it,'' Mr. Schwartz says. ''The tech transfer office can find the resources to move it forward.'' 
 Of course, the offices negotiate deals that are best for the university, notes Peter Corless, a partner at the law firm Edwards Angell Palmer & Dodge in Boston. He specializes in protecting biotech and medical device inventions at academic institutions. ''If they can, they're going to give some deference to the inventor, but their first allegiance is to do something for the university,'' he says.
 Erez Lieberman, a 28-year-old graduate student doing federally financed research at the Harvard-M.I.T. division of health sciences and technology, discovered this tendency after the Massachusetts Institute of Technology pushed through a patent on a technology he created as an intern at NASA in the summer of 2007. His algorithm detects whether a person is standing correctly or is off balance, and Mr. Lieberman, currently in the sixth year of his Ph.D. program, has started a company called iShoe to develop products using the technology, including insoles that can help prevent elderly people from falling. Because M.I.T. is co-owner of the invention with Harvard and NASA, Mr. Lieberman knew he would have to negotiate a licensing agreement that would give his company exclusive rights to the technology, but he was taken aback by M.I.T.'s tough negotiating stance.
 ''I wasn't aware of the fact that more or less the day after the patent was filed, I would be facing a conversation like, 'We take a substantial royalty and $75,000 now, and it's all yours,' '' he says. ''That was a surprise.'' 
 Jack Turner, associate director of M.I.T.'s tech licensing office, says: ''We endeavor to get what we think is a fair deal for M.I.T. and the inventors and for the companies we're licensing. At the same time we don't want to license something exclusively to someone who's going to end up not doing anything. We write into the agreement those elements of the business plan that we consider essential for the technology to find its way into use. If they can't do that, we can get the technology back and find another home for it.'' 
 Ultimately, Mr. Lieberman says, the fact that M.I.T. doesn't automatically kick the license to an inventor is for the best. ''It enforces discipline on you,'' he says. ''The process has been valuable for us in terms of thinking hard about what needs to happen, how do we raise money and what kinds of milestones make sense.''
 He's hopeful that he can raise funds for the license through angel investors or a joint venture with a hospital. But now that he knows how expensive and complicated the licensing process is (not to mention having to check in in the future to show he's on track), Mr. Lieberman is avoiding using university resources as he develops the technology further. Last summer he paid an engineer and a computer programmer through iShoe to work off campus to improve the design of his insole and write software that lets it communicate with wireless devices. Using $25,000 worth of legal services he won in April in a business plan competition for space-derived technologies, he has filed for two additional patents, owned by iShoe, based on their work.
 If a student has money to develop and protect an invention on his own, should he? It depends. Turning the job of commercializing a product over to a university is a better bet if you have no interest in business or if finishing school is a priority. ''The mission of a student is to research, get their degree, and move on with their life, and if you start fooling around with this stuff too much, it's a total distraction,'' says Peter Corless, the intellectual-property lawyer. But if retaining control over an idea is important -- say, you don't want your technology licensed to a company that pollutes oceans -- the expense and hassle of doing it yourself might be worth it. 
 Lone-wolf inventors should get a written statement from their university confirming they own their idea, Mr. Corless advises. ''You want to get these things cleared up when there hasn't been a lot of value recognized,'' he says. ''If you try to clear things up later, people's memories change.'' 
 R.P.I. determined that the bottle design belonged to Mr. Zummo and Mr. Naples. The university offered to patent the bottles and get them into the market if they transferred ownership of the design to the university. The students chose to go it alone, deciding that the standard slice of royalties R.P.I. gives to inventors, 35 percent, was too low. An intellectual property lawyer who's a friend of Mr. Zummo's family waived his fees to help them file a provisional patent, and the students started looking for ways to raise $18,000 to mold several hundred actual bottles they can test and show to companies interested in licensing the technology from them. 
 They're not flying entirely solo, though. Last month, the university determined that while the students own the design, R.P.I. owns the idea for the bottles. The students must license it from them, at a cost of about $250 a year and 25 percent of the profits generated by the idea. That, though, comes to only 0.5 percent -- an ''idea'' being worth less than the ''design.'' 
 ''What we're giving up is obviously nothing, and if someone infringes on our rights, now it's R.P.I. against them,'' Mr. Naples says.
 The bottle negotiations helped convince R.P.I. to rethink its royalty-sharing policies for students in studio courses: it's now 75 percent for the inventors, 25 percent for the university. For one, the university recognizes the distinction between the ideas coming out of undergraduate design classes and those coming out of a research center or lab, Mr. Rancourt of R.P.I. says. 
 ''Given the early stage of development, a significant amount of work needs to happen to prove the idea,'' he says. ''At the same time, they have real potential, and our goal is to encourage them.

HEADLINE: A Cleaner Way to Keep The City Running

BYLINE: By C. J. HUGHES

 BODY:
FOR centuries, grist-grinders and sailors have exploited the wind. Now, New York developers, homeowners and city leaders might be coming around.
 A handful of buildings are already drawing electricity from wind turbines, which typically resemble table fans, or mounted airplane propellers. 
 Unlike some of the skyscraping versions that dot rural hillsides, small turbines supply power directly to homes without first sending it through a utility company's lines. 
 One major sticking point in the city is that densely packed buildings tend to scatter breezes, making it tough to capture steady gusts. Although this and other kinks need to be addressed before the widespread rollout of small turbines is possible, there are signs of gains.
 ''We're always excited to try new things in the area of green building,'' says Les Bluestone, a partner in the Blue Sea Development Company, which is building a five-story brick apartment building in the Melrose section of the South Bronx that will be partly powered by wind.
 Its 10 one-kilowatt turbines, from AeroVironment of Monrovia, Calif., will generate electricity for lights in the building's hallways, elevators and other common areas. 
 But because wind speeds in the Bronx, as in other parts of New York, aren't consistent, the turbines must be supplemented with a separate basement power plant, Mr. Bluestone said.
 Residents of the 63 one- to three-bedroom rental units, meanwhile, will plug in the conventional way, through Con Edison.
 The turbines, which collectively cost $100,000, could halve the annual utility bill for the common spaces, to $9,000 from $18,000, Mr. Bluestone said. 
 And that saving was critical to the budget for the project, which is designated as affordable housing. Indeed, units will be priced below the market, with monthly rents of $750 to $1,089, when leasing starts this month, he said.
 Winds in New York City clock in, on average, at six miles an hour. On low-lying Long Island, though, they hover at around 11 miles per hour, meaning a turbine can pick up more of a building's tab, says Michael Urban, a resident of Brookhaven.
 In September, Mr. Urban installed a 1.8-kilowatt turbine from Southwest Windpower of Flagstaff, Ariz., in the yard of his four-bedroom home. It provides a third of his home's energy, he said.
 Though many towns might prohibit a 60-foot tower like the one his turbine sits on, Brookhaven has allowed it. Mr. Urban also received a green light from the 26 other residents of his subdivision, allowing him to overcome some common obstacles to turbines.
 ''It cost me about $15,000, and I can save about $1,200 a year,'' he said. ''That adds value to my real estate.''
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg stoked excitement among wind-power advocates in August when he announced that he supported putting turbines atop city skyscrapers. 
 Of the 60 proposals that were later submitted to the city under a request for renewable-energy projects, the majority were wind related, including technologies for apartment-mounted machines, said Jen Becker, a vice president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation. ''It's definitely something we are looking at seriously,'' she said.
 The state is also offering encouragement through its Energy Research and Development Authority, which will cover half the homeowner's initial cost of turbines, though so far there have been no takers south of Dutchess County.
 Nationally, too, the wind industry received a boost in October when a provision in the Troubled Assets Relief Program bailout bill created a one-time 30 percent tax credit for the installation costs for homeowners. No credit had existed since 1985.
 But the new credit is capped at $4,000, which does little to defray the cost of equipment that can total $70,000, says Mike Bergey, president of Bergey WindPower, a manufacturer in Norman, Okla.
 Mr. Bergey also worries that roof-mounted turbines, which can be heavy and produce steady vibrations, might perform poorly on rickety buildings.
 ''It's not like it's impossible,'' he said, ''but we're just not really bullish on the New York market.''

HEADLINE: When the Town Line Is the State Line

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
AT 5:54 a.m. on weekdays, Lynn Palmer Jr. leaves for his hedge fund firm in Manhattan. From his four-bedroom colonial in Suffern, in Rockland County, some 30 miles northwest of Midtown Manhattan, he walks four minutes to the railroad station, his coat collar turned up against the cold. 
 He times it so there's no waiting for the train to Hoboken, N.J., where he will catch a PATH train to Wall Street -- or sometimes, in warmer weather, take a ferry across the Hudson.
 Because he lives so close to the train, he said, ''I don't have to warm up a car or brush off the snow, and then look for a parking space once I finally get to the station.'' Door to door, Mr. Palmer's commute is an hour and 10 minutes. ''Not bad,'' he said, ''considering that I have to switch trains along the way.'' 
 A commute he can live with; the relative affordability of housing, especially compared with similar villages in Westchester; and the academically high-performing Ramapo Central School District are among the reasons that Mr. Palmer and his wife, Darlene, bought their early-1900s-vintage house in Suffern a decade ago. 
 Suffern, a two-square-mile village in the town of Ramapo along the New Jersey border, has held fairly steady at about 11,000 people since 1990, census figures show. It was not always the kind of place that attracted young families, said Mayor John B. Keegan, a retired postal worker. ''When I first moved here as a kid 46 years ago,'' Mr. Keegan said, ''it was a real tough town, with people speeding all around in hot rods.'' 
 That was at least partly because of the difference in the legal drinking ages in New York and New Jersey until 1984. With not even a river to discourage New Jersey teenagers from driving into Rockland County, where the legal age was 18, Suffern's bars were a magnet for out-of-state youths, said Mr. Keegan, describing the village back then as ''a real gritty place.''
 But the crowd from New Jersey has long since thinned out. In recent years, migration patterns across the state border have reversed; residents can drive less than five minutes to fuel up and make purchases in New Jersey -- where gas prices are lower, there is no sales tax on clothing, and large stores abound. Today, the mayor said, the focus of the village's struggles is maintaining economic viability. 
 Suffern's main streets are lined with small shops, restaurants and taverns. Nestled amid the Ramapo Mountains, it has a coziness reminiscent of the village from an earlier era in ''It's a Wonderful Life'' -- a movie that played during the holiday season to a full house at the 975-seat Lafayette Theater. An 85-year-old auditorium, its lights twinkling on the marquee, the Lafayette has a balcony and a single movie screen -- as well as a Wurlitzer pipe organ played on Friday and Saturday nights before the main feature.
 To protect that old-fashioned charm, the Village Board of Trustees and the mayor are thinking ahead, contemplating ways to buffer the village from the accident of its geography. If there is convenience in living along the state line, there are also economic costs. 
 WHAT YOU'LL FIND
 For such a small village, Suffern offers a rich variety of housing options: single- and multifamily homes, as well as condominiums, co-ops and rentals -- or, as John C. Layne, the acting building inspector, described it, ''a little bit of everything for everyone.'' Lot sizes vary from one-eighth of an acre, near the center of the village, to three-fourths of an acre farther out. 
 The business district is centered on two blocks of Lafayette Avenue, with the theater at one end. It is close to the train station and small neighborhoods like the one the Palmers live in. Increasingly, sections of the village near the downtown, with smaller houses dating back to the early 1900s, are being sought after by buyers who want ''walkable neighborhoods'' less dependent on cars, said Joy G. Dorn, an associate broker for Prudential Rand Realty in Suffern.
 Dave Gutierrez, a media consultant, and Tara Agen, an executive for Hewlett-Packard, paid $86,000 a decade ago for a century-old one-bedroom stone cottage with a loft and finished basement in one of those neighborhoods. A year ago the couple, who work at home, received an offer of $500,000 for the house. Because they treasure the convenience that their neighborhood affords, they turned down the offer, Mr. Gutierrez said.
 With the one-car family in mind, and as a potential catalyst for Suffern's retail economy, village planners have proposed an urban renewal project that would replace a vacant gas station and several other buildings in the downtown with a condo complex. ''If we have 100 new condos,'' Mayor Keegan said, ''that could mean 200 more people shopping in the village. It's a real fight for us to keep the downtown thriving.''
 WHAT YOU'LL PAY
 The median sale price for a single-family home at the end of the third quarter was $425,000, down 9 percent, from $467,500 a year earlier, Ms. Dorn of Prudential said. The average length of time on the market was 208 days, 59 more than a year earlier, according to the statistics from the Greater Hudson Valley Multiple Listing Service that Ms. Dorn cited. In 2003 at the end of the third quarter, the median sale price for a single-family was $370,000.
 The price of condos in Suffern has also dropped -- to $215,000 at the end of the third quarter of 2008, from $230,000. Condos, however, sold more briskly, taking an average of 135 days on the market to sell, versus 154 in 2007. The median price of a condo in Suffern five years ago was $144,250.
 Larger, more expensive homes are not generally available in Suffern, but can be found in the bordering village of Montebello, where a five-bedroom 1998 colonial is listed at $1.295 million.
 WHAT TO DO
 Residents do drive to New Jersey to save on gas and clothing, but when it comes to outdoor recreation, entertainment and dining out, many prefer to stay closer to home. When Jeanette and Wayne Kunow want to see a movie, they say they much prefer the Lafayette to multiplexes in the Palisades Center in West Nyack, or Bergen County in New Jersey. They also dine locally, often on Lafayette Avenue -- at Marcello's Ristorante, where Ms. Kunow, the president of the Suffern Junior Women's Club, also takes cooking classes; or Ravi, which specializes in Continental cuisine. 
 Outdoors, Mr. and Mrs. Palmer and their children -- Wyatt and Paige, 7, and Claire, 5 -- enjoy hiking in the Ramapo Mountains. Another resource is Bear Mountain State Park, which offers hiking, biking and cross-country ski trails, ski jumps and an outdoor ice-skating rink. Also, in Bergen County, there is the 300-acre Ramapo River Reserve. 
 THE SCHOOLS
 The district has an enrollment of almost 5,000 students in five elementary schools, a middle school and a high school serving Suffern and some other parts of the town of Ramapo. 
 On both state-administered elementary school tests and SATs, averages were higher than for the state as a whole. On the English section of the state test, 85 percent of fourth-graders met or exceeded standards, versus 70 percent statewide. In math, the number was 96 percent -- 11 points higher than the statewide average.
 On last year's SAT, averages were 543 in reading, 566 in math and 559 in writing, versus 491, 505 and 482 statewide. 
 Of the 360 Suffern graduates last June, 263 are attending four-year colleges, 86 chose two-year colleges and others joined the military, entered the work force or took a year off to travel.
 An unusual feature of the high school is its lunch period -- ''a time for decompression,'' said Glenn Weeks, an assistant principal, when all 1,550 students and their teachers eat wherever they like in the building and then take part in extracurricular activities. 
 THE COMMUTE
 For commuters whose destination is Midtown, Short Line provides bus service, and New Jersey Transit operates passenger trains. Some riders take the train to Secaucus Junction, where they can switch to a Penn Station-bound train. Others, like Mr. Palmer, go farther, to Hoboken, where they can get on a PATH train or ferry headed for Lower Manhattan. A monthly train ticket to Pennsylvania Station is available online at $265. Off-peak round trips cost $15.25. Bus tickets cost $249.50 for 40 trips to the Port Authority. For Suffern residents who drive to the train or bus, the village charges $45 a month for one of the 426 commuter parking spaces, spread out over several downtown lots.
 THE HISTORY
 The village is named for John Suffern, a settler from Ireland who in the early 1770s built a home at what is now the intersection of Washington and Lafayette Avenues. The streets are named for General George Washington and the Marquis de Lafayette, who both encamped in the area during the Revolution, according to an early history of the county. After the war, John Suffern, who had worked as a farmer, teacher and store owner, became Rockland's first county judge.

HEADLINE: In Tough Times, Turning Down Raises

BYLINE: By NATE SCHWEBER

DATELINE: NORTH HAVEN, Conn. 

 BODY:
 WHEN Sara Querfeld, the superintendent of schools here, learned that her board had voted to give her a 3.5 percent raise, she felt uneasy.
 ''I just didn't feel right accepting a pay raise when the economy is tanking and so many people are losing their jobs,'' Dr. Querfeld said.
 After discussing the situation with her husband, she told the school board she would donate her raise, approximately $5,000, to the North Haven Education Foundation, a nonprofit group that will spend the money on technology in elementary schools. 
 Across the region, public employees like Dr. Querfeld have done what some consider to be counterintuitive in these troubled financial times: turning down their raises and bonuses. While some of these good Samaritans were elected and others not, all cited the economic plight of fellow community members as a reason for saying no thanks to extra money. 
 Many government watchdogs say that giving back money, while appreciated, is not the way to deal with mounting budget gaps in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.
 ''It's nice to hear about around the holidays, but in the long run it won't make that much of a difference,'' said Ilicia Balaban, an advocate at the Connecticut Public Interest Research Group. 
 In Westchester County, N.Y., Eric DiBartolo, the superintendent of highways in Yorktown, said no to a $25,000 raise that the town board decided, in a vote, he had earned for cutting nearly three-quarters of a million dollars' worth of wasteful spending from his department. Mr. DiBartolo said he made the decision while sitting in a diner, thinking of the more than a dozen employees who work for him, many of whom have young families. He said he could not in good faith take the raise, which equaled a large chunk of a worker's salary, when others were losing their jobs. 
 ''Some people called me a jackass and told me to take the money and run,'' he said. ''But it's not always about the money all the time.''
 In Montclair, N.J., Joseph Hartnett, the township's manager, reflected on the dismal budget forecast for the state, which will trickle down to Montclair, and declined a raise of almost $12,000.
 ''It's just something I had to do,'' Mr. Hartnett said. ''My style has always been to lead by example.''
 According to officials in the three states, New York's deficit over the next 16 months will top $15 billion, while the next budget deficits in New Jersey and Connecticut are projected at $5 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. 
 Compared with numbers like that, the conscionable actions by a few are akin to proverbial raindrops in an awfully large bucket, said Susan Lerner, executive director of Common Cause New York, a watchdog organization that advocates open and accountable government. 
 Ms. Lerner said she was ''a bit leery'' of trying to patch budget deficits with money slated for government workers. Keeping pay scales competitive with private industry is crucial to ensuring that public jobs attract the most qualified candidates, she said.
 ''If it's a question of cutbacks versus freezes, you're on a knife's edge,'' she said. ''If you freeze it for too long, you discourage people from working for you.''
 She added, ''We want the people who work for government to be the best and the brightest, not people who aren't going to leave because they can't get a job anywhere else.''
 At the county level, freezing salaries is being used as a way to shore up budgets and even as leverage in bargaining with unions. On Long Island, Nassau County Executive Thomas R. Suozzi is keeping his salary static, along with those of more than 250 people who work for him, through 2009, said Bruce Nyman, a county spokesman. Because of that, the unions that work with the county also agreed not to seek raises through the same period, Mr. Nyman said. 
 County Executive Joseph N. DiVincenzo Jr. of Essex County, in New Jersey, also opted for no raises for himself and the 125 people who work for him, through 2010, saying that was likely to come up in negotiations with the 26 unions that contract with the county. 
 ''People who are in leadership roles should lead by example,'' Mr. DiVincenzo said. 
 James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, said there was no way to keep track of how many public employees decline raises or bonuses. Nor was he sure how far their influence would reach, particularly with unions that have historically fought for raises, even if it meant some layoffs.
 ''The logic is that 5 percent of the people, who get laid off, would be unhappy, but the other 95 percent would be very happy,'' he said. ''It's not bad behavior, it's rational behavior given the conditions the leaders are in.''
 Dr. Hughes added that many precedents were moot, considering that these are ''probably the worst economic conditions of our lifetimes.''
 ''Crises bring out the best in your best people and the worst in your worst people,'' he said. ''And some people will respond and try to do the right thing.''
 While refusing money has endeared public employees to their communities, the opposite has caused public outcry. In May, a furor arose over a severance package worth $740,876 for Barbara Trzeszkowski, who retired as school superintendent of Keansburg, N.J. Gov. Jon S. Corzine ordered a review and the state attorney general went to court to block $500,000 of the payment. The case is pending, according to a spokesman for the attorney general.
 Meantime, the president of the University of Connecticut, Michael J. Hogan, turned down a $100,000 bonus and directed the money back to the school.
 ''Given the immense fiscal challenges facing UConn, I felt that redirecting the funds to our graduate programs was the right thing to do,'' he said. 
 In Chatham, N.J., the school superintendent, Jim O'Neill, and his staff took smaller raises than those to which they were entitled. The savings were enough, he said, to avoid laying off at least one teacher next year. He said the decision, for him, was easy.
 ''Here was a chance for us to do something that shows that we're not just knowledgeable educators,'' he said, ''but also ethical people.''

HEADLINE: All That Glitters, Not Quite Golden

BYLINE: By CAREN CHESLER

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY 

 BODY:
 CHAD Minnes, a 25-year-old bellman at Harrah's Resort Atlantic City, has his own barometer to tell him how the casino industry is faring as he goes about his job.
 ''Some guests are carrying their own luggage now, and the guests who do use our service aren't tipping the way they used to,'' Mr. Minnes said. ''The staff is definitely getting depressed. People aren't making as much money, and there's all this uncertainty about what will happen next week or tomorrow.''
 Mr. Minnes's unscientific gauge is not too far off. Atlantic City, New Jersey's gambling mecca, rang in the new year facing myriad problems. The casino industry, the town's biggest employer, is in a slump, with revenues down for the third straight quarter, according to the state Casino Control Commission. The municipal government is suffering as well. In November, the city elected its fourth mayor in just two years, at a time when the city is grappling with one of the worst budgets in a quarter century. 
 The fates of Atlantic City and its casinos have always been inextricably linked. The 11 casinos here employ about 40,000 people -- including around one-third of Atlantic City's population -- and finance about 75 percent of the city's budget through property taxes. 
 The industry has already laid off 1,000 employees, and further cuts may be coming, industry officials said. In turn, that trickles down to the rest of the community, from the companies that supply the casinos with meat, to the cab drivers who transport their patrons, to the people who tote baggage for resort guests.
 ''Atlantic City is at a critical point in its history,'' said Damon G. Tyner, a lawyer at Parker McCay who specializes in real estate development. ''Never have there been so many factors threatening revenues as there are now.'' 
 As go the casinos, so go the city's fortunes. A smoking ban imposed by the City Council illustrates the symbiotic relationship.
 The Council passed a ban that would have extended the existing prohibition on smoking from 75 percent to 100 percent of the casino floors, allowing smoking only in sealed-off lounges where gambling was not permitted. But after the casino industry -- and some of the very employees the ban was meant to protect -- loudly complained that the ban would make them lose business, the Council voted to postpone a total ban at least for a year. 
 ''This is not the time to play around with those kind of dynamics,'' said Robert McDevitt, president of Unite-Here Local 54, which represents hotel, food and beverage workers, some of whom feared a ban would cost jobs.
 During the debate on the ban, some workers wore orange T-shirts that read, ''I don't want to work in an ashtray''; others wore red T-shirts that read, ''I don't want to work in an ashtray, but I want to work.''
 The casino industry is being hit by what many are calling the perfect storm: a national recession just as competition from slot parlors in Pennsylvania and New York has heightened. In November, at the same time that Atlantic City casinos were experiencing a downturn, six of seven casinos in Pennsylvania had an increase in revenue of nearly 13 percent. Some of that increase comes from midweek ''convenience gamblers,'' who might otherwise have gone to Atlantic City, according to industry experts.
 For the city government, preliminary figures show a $15 million budget gap, a situation that the city's new budget consultant, Arthur Bunting Jr., blames on the city's two previous administrations. Mr. Bunting says they prepared budgets using revenues they knew they would never get, gave lucrative 4 percent pay raises to city employees, and then used up nearly every penny of the city's surplus.
 ''They will finish this year with the lowest surplus the city has seen in decades,'' Mr. Bunting said.
 But in a city where mayors often do not get to finish their terms, it is hard to lay blame for a budget crisis on any one administration. Robert W. Levy resigned in October 2007 after serving just over a year. He left office amid health problems and a federal investigation into veteran's disability payments he received. 
 The City Council president, William Marsh, filled in for a month before Councilman Scott Evans was appointed by the local Democratic Committee to serve until a special election could be held. Former Mayor Lorenzo Langford won that election in November and is now serving the last year of Mr. Levy's term.
 Half of the eight mayors who served before Mr. Levy were either convicted or pleaded guilty to bribery or election fraud.
 To those familiar with Atlantic City politics, the city's budgetary woes are sadly familiar. There have always been questions about how a small city with 36,000 people that has such few amenities -- it does not even have a supermarket -- can have a budget as high as $200 million and can afford to pay its lifeguards a pension.
 Mr. Langford has his work cut out for him. He just got into office, and he already faces a primary challenge in June and an election in November -- if he runs, which most say is likely.
 City officials were looking forward to the tax revenues they would have reaped from several multibillion-dollar casino projects now suspended at least temporarily. While casino owners still pay property taxes on the vacant land, the figure would have risen exponentially if the properties had buildings on them. But with credit dried up, MGM Mirage's $5 billion hotel next to the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa and separate $2 billion projects by Pinnacle Entertainment and the hotel developer Curtis Bashaw have been postponed indefinitely.
 ''Do I have a magic wand to fix the region's economy? No,'' Mr. Langford said. ''Our role is to be accommodating when they come.''
 With those projects on hold, city officials are now hanging their hopes on selling Bader Field, a 143-acre tract of city-owned land that was once an airport and is now considered one of the last buildable casino lots available. But after receiving no bids the first time, the city recently had to extend the deadline.
 ''Bader Field is the local equivalent of the bailout that's going on at the national level,'' said Councilman Marty Small.
 While the casino projects -- and, potentially, the sale of Bader Field -- have been derailed by the economy, developers say a revolving door on the mayor's office and the city's reputation for municipal malfeasance have not helped business.
 ''You have council people going to jail, a mayor resigning, an acting mayor for a month, and an interim mayor, and now that mayor is facing another election. Clearly, that instability is not a good thing,'' said State Senator James Whelan, an Atlantic County Democrat who served as the city's mayor from 1990 to 2001.
 In the end, many say, it is the state, not local officials, that controls much of what goes on here. The casinos are regulated by the Casino Control Commission, the city's expressway and airport are run by the South Jersey Transportation Authority, the two convention halls are operated by the Atlantic City Convention and Visitors Authority, and much of the land here is held by the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, all of which are state agencies. Even the sale or lease of Bader Field must be approved by the state's Local Finance Board.
 ''The mayor pretty much just sits back and counts the money and makes sure the city has adequate police and fire,'' said Mr. Tyner, the lawyer.
 But Councilman Small, who plans to challenge Mr. Langford in the June primary, thinks state officials are unfairly tarring all city officials with the same brush. 
 ''Everyone here wants what's best for Atlantic City,'' Mr. Small said. ''People have to realize we're elected officials, but we pay taxes just like everyone else.''

HEADLINE: The Twins Are Identical. The Act Is One of a Kind.

BYLINE: By JOE BRESCIA

 BODY:
Many identical twins can finish each other's sentences and wear the same clothes. The LaSalle brothers catch each other's juggling clubs while doing back flips with one standing on the other's shoulders. And they do it before hundreds of people several times a week.
 The brothers, Jake and Marty, who are among the stars of the Big Apple Circus, have proved adept at advancing their careers inside and outside the big top. They graduated cum laude from Columbia in 2007only professional jugglers. 
 The LaSalles, who are 24, began developing their talent as children in Kennett Square, Pa., a borough about 35 miles west of Philadelphia that bills itself as the ''Mushroom Capital of the World.'' The brothers, however, started out with apples. 
 ''When we were about 8, we would juggle apples when we went to orchards with my mother,'' Jake said. ''It started with just three apples, and we were instantly hooked.''
 ''Mushrooms,'' Marty joked, ''would have been more difficult to manipulate.''
 They decided to put together an act while still in elementary school, and they took gymnastics and added those skills to their performances. They performed mostly in Pennsylvania, and when they were 11, they were spotted at a juggling convention in Pittsburgh by Benji Hill, a professional juggling coach.
 ''He gave us the performance opportunities that gave us the motivation we needed,'' Jake said. Under Mr. Hill's guidance, they developed a unique, nonstop style that combines synchronized juggling with flips and dance moves.
 They have performed all over the world, from the Tigerpalast Variety Theater in Frankfurt to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington.
 Their career highlights include winning the World Juggling Championships in 2001 in Madison, Wis., and receiving a bronze medal and the Big Apple Circus Award at the Festival Mondial du Cirque de Demain in Paris in 2003. The brothers said they decided to enroll at Columbia because it offered not only an Ivy League education but a location that made it easy to keep up their performance schedule.
 ''But on campus we were serious students,'' said Marty, who majored in economics. ''There were no juggling books in the cafeteria or anything.'' He said he hoped to eventually pursue a career on the business side of entertainment. Jake majored in anthropology and pursued a course of premed studies; he is now applying to medical schools.
 LaVenia J. LaVelle of Columbia's Office of Communications and Public Affairs said that although the university did not keep records of its graduates' occupations, the LaSalles ''are the only jugglers, as far as we can tell.''
 After graduation, they were invited by Paul Binder, the ringmaster, founder and artistic director of the Big Apple Circus, to be a guest act in this year's production. After this season's final performance in Damrosch Park on Jan. 18, they will go on tour with the circus.
 In any given performance, their tosses and spins and leaps elicit oohs and ahhs from children and adults.
 On a recent night, 4-year-old Lara Deturris of Brooklyn turned to her mother, Suzanne, and said, ''Mom, they never drop anything.'' Well, almost never. There was that time on ''The Ricki Lake Show'' a couple of years ago when a club slipped and hit Ms. Lake in the back of the head. ''That was a little embarrassing,'' Jake said.
 Marty said that Tom Cruise and his wife, Katie Holmes, brought their daughter, Suri, to a performance in November. ''Tom told us the act was amazing,'' he said. ''That was nice to hear. He seemed genuinely impressed with what we were doing.'' 
 Barry Lubin, who performs as Grandma the Clown in the circus, says he hears plenty of comments about the brothers as he makes his way through the stands during his act.
 ''I get asked if they are really twins,'' Mr. Lubin said. ''I tell the people it's really one guy, but he's very fast.''
 According to Jake, the act is more about genetics than balance. ''Juggling is such a difficult discipline to perfect,'' he said. ''You have to be so precise. There are very few good team juggling acts out there now. I think everyone has an individual internal rhythm.
 ''There's a difference in internal rhythms,'' he added. ''With my brother, we're exactly on the same page. When I watch other professional teams perform, it seems much more forced. There's a fluency from our luck in being twins.''
 Marty said that having a sibling in any workplace was hard enough, but ''in a performance environment, it's particularly difficult. We've been angry at each other at times. But our responsibility is to the audience, and we honor the responsibility to make the show happen.'' 
 After the lights go down in the tent, the brothers walk to the trailers in Damrosch Park nearby, where they and some of the other performers live.
 ''We're camping out at Lincoln Center,'' Jake said. ''How can you not love it?''

HEADLINE: 36 Hours: Maui

BYLINE: By JOCELYN FUJII

 BODY:
''I went to Maui to stay a week and remained five,'' wrote Mark Twain in 1866. Whether it's lazing on warm sugary sand or snorkeling with humpback whales, visitors to Maui today would be likely to do the same, if they had the means. Well, thanks to the economic downturn, visiting Maui is now cheaper than usual. Airfare has dropped, hotel rooms have opened up and visitors to Hawaii's second-biggest island -- known for its sparkling coastline, fertile green interior and high-end resorts -- will find bargains everywhere, from two-for-one luaus to colorful beach chairs. You'll never want to leave.
Friday
3:30 p.m. 1)BEAUTY AND THE BEACH 
Tucked between the condo-studded town of Kihei and the upscale resort of Wailea, the white-sand beach of Keawakapu is south Maui's hidden jewel. Lined with lavish Balinese- and plantation-style homes, this half-mile playground has gentle waves, talcum-soft sands and free public parking along South Kihei Road. As you go for a dip, listen for the groans and squeaks of the humpback whale, a haunting song that continues to mystify children and biologists alike.
5:30 p.m. 2)DRIVE-BY BIRDING
For a glimpse of Maui's remarkable biodiversity, drive by the Kealia Pond National Wildlife Refuge (Milepost 6, Mokulele Highway 311; 808-875-1582; www.fws.gov/kealiapond), a 700-acre natural wetland and seabird sanctuary that is home to endangered Hawaiian stilts, black-crowned night herons, Hawaiian coots and migrating birds like ruddy turnstones.
7 p.m. 3)FAIRWAY PIZZA
There is no shortage of expensive restaurants in Wailea packed with well-heeled tourists, which makes Matteo's Pizzeria (100 Wailea Ike Drive; 808-874-1234; www.matteospizzeria.com) all the more inviting. An affordable joint that is wildly popular with the locals, this casual restaurant is run by an Italian couple who serve fresh, thin-crust margherita pizza ($10.50), zesty penne in vodka sauce ($12.99) and meaty lasagna ($13.99). After ordering at the counter, grab one of the tables that overlook a golf course.
9:30 p.m. 4)PIANO MAN
Sal Godinez, a spirited jazz pianist, has been tickling Maui's ivories for years, and these days he's playing at the Four Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea (3900 Wailea Alanui Drive; 808-874-8000; www.fourseasons.com/Maui), a lushly landscaped hot spot on Wailea Beach, where you can tap your toes to Mr. Godinez's riffs while enjoying a nightcap. The hotel also has a notable collection of contemporary Hawaii artists like Mary Mitsuda, whose meditative abstract painting hangs near the front desk, and Toshiko Takaezu, whose sculptural ceramic pots flank the lobby elevators.
Saturday
9 a.m. 5)GUAVA AND JAVA
Fresh start your morning at Grandma's Coffee House in the village of Keokea (9232 Highway 37, or Kula Highway; 808-878-2140; www.grandmascoffee.com), on the slopes of Haleakala volcano in Maui's verdant upcountry. The shop serves organic coffee from a fifth-generation farm. Order a cup of Grandma's Original Organic, an espresso roasted blend, and sit on the wooden deck for million-dollar views of the island. Then you can move on to the Kula Country Farm Stand (Highway 37, or Kula Highway, in Kula, across from Rice Park; 808-878-8381), a green-and-white produce stand. It sells just-picked fruit, like pineapple guavas and mangoes, along with homemade mango bread.
Noon 6)JELLYFISH ART
See what's hot in Makawao, the cowboy town turned art colony that is about 1,600 feet above sea level on the slopes of Mount Haleakala. Here you'll find old wooden storefronts, mom-and-pop restaurants and hippie herb shops. At Hot Island Glass (3620 Baldwin Avenue, 808-572-4527; www.hotislandglass.com), the furnace burns hot and glass-blowing is performance art. Watch molten glass evolve into jellyfish, bowls and oceanic shapes before your eyes. Next door is the Viewpoints Gallery (3620 Baldwin Avenue; 808-572-5979; www.viewpointsgallerymaui.com), in the style of a plantation. Among the landscape artists it represents are George Allan and Margaret Bedell.
3 p.m. 7)PUT THE TOP DOWN
The hourlong drive from Maui's hilly upcountry to Lahaina, a popular resort town on Maui's west coast, is a sight to behold. You'll be hard-pressed to keep your eyes on the road, with the shimmering Pacific on your left and the chiseled valleys of the West Maui Mountains to the right. But the views pale in comparison to the sights that await underwater at your destination, Black Rock, a lava outcropping just north of Lahaina, in the village of Kaanapali. Grab a snorkel and explore this Atlantis-like world of iridescent fish, spotted eagle rays and giant green sea turtles.
7:30 p.m. 8)FARM TO FORK
Locavores are still buzzing about Merriman's Kapalua (One Bay Club Place; 808-669-6400, www.merrimanshawaii.com) in the Kapalua Resort. Opened last June, the West Maui spot is run by Peter Merriman, one of the leaders of Hawaii regional cuisine, a culinary movement that blends international flavors with local ingredients. The oceanfront restaurant, which features a lanai with views of Molokai island, showcases exquisite ingredients, whether it's chevre from upcountry goats or line-caught fish from nearby waters. Appetizers include kalua pig ravioli ($15), steamed Keahole clams with mussels and yellow coconut curry broth ($15), and corn chowder with pancetta ($7). For a main course, try the wok-charred ahi ($36.95), so fresh that it tastes as if it were cooked on the beach.
9:30 p.m. 9)TIKI TORCHES
The old Hawaii -- tikis and plumeria trees under the stars -- is elusive, but you'll find it at Kaanapali Beach Hotel's tiki bar (2525 Kaanapali Parkway; 808-661-0011; www.kbhmaui.com). The lilting Hawaiian music is genuine, and the outdoor setting under the stars is hard to beat. If you're too jazzed to fall asleep, check out the Saturday night parties at Chez Paul (808-661-3843), an elegant French bistro in the sleepy village of Olowalu, just south of Lahaina. On weekends, a jazz band keeps the crowd entertained until 12:30.
Sunday
9 a.m. 10)MAKE IT MALA
Brunch at Mala Ocean Tavern (1307 Front Street, Lahaina; 808-667-9394; www.malaoceantavern.com) is like being on the ocean without leaving land. At this casual restaurant in Lahaina, you're practically sitting on the water, enjoying huevos rancheros with black beans ($13) or lamb sausage Benedict ($15) while dolphins frolic in the ocean and turtles nibble at the shore. Ask for a table outdoors.
Noon 11)FLY LIKE AN EAGLE
For an adrenaline finish, head to the heights of West Maui, where Kapalua Adventures (2000 Village Road, 808-665-4386; www.kapalua.com) offers a two-mile zip-line course, an unusually long distance. Beginners don't need to fear, as the three-hour zip ($149) requires virtually no athleticism. The five-hour trip ($299) is not for the weak-kneed. The zip line takes you over bamboo forests, gulches and ridges, with the luscious coastline in the distance.
THE BASICS
Kahului Airport in Maui is served by most major domestic airlines. Flights between New York City and Maui most often require a plane change. Fares have dropped recently: according to a recent online search, United has flights from Kennedy Airport, connecting through San Francisco, starting at $465 round trip for travel starting in January. Deals on packages can be found at the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau's Web site (www.gohawaii.com/value).
A car is needed to get around. Avis, Hertz and other major agencies have airport rentals.
The Four Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea (3900 Wailea Alanui; 808-874-8000; www.fourseasons.com/maui) recently underwent a $50 million renovation and now offers seaside massages, three restaurants and contemporary Hawaiian art. The elegant rooms and suites start at $495.
In Kaanapali, the sprawling Hyatt Regency Maui Resort & Spa(200 Nohea Kai Drive, Lahaina; 808-661-1234; www.maui.hyatt.com) remains irrepressibly flamboyant after a recent renovation, which includes a new poolside restaurant, Umalu. Rooms start at around $350.
Mana Kai Maui (2960 South Kihei Road; 808-879-1561; www.crhmaui.com), at the north end of Keawakapu Beach, offers ocean views, full kitchens and optional car-rental packages. And with rates starting at $150, it's a great value.

HEADLINE: Glow From N.H.L. Can't Hide Dark Spots

BYLINE: By JEFF Z. KLEIN and STU HACKEL

 BODY:
The N.H.L. enters 2009 on a high from the New Year's Day outdoor game at Wrigley Field. Like last year's game outside Buffalo, it was a ringing success in terms of aesthetics and television ratings. But beyond the afterglow, the league has several concerns in the year ahead. Here are five of the biggest.
 THE ECONOMY The recession has put at least one franchise, the Phoenix Coyotes, in critical condition. They will lose an estimated $25 million this season. Other teams are also hurting. If overall revenue holds steady and keeps the contract-mandated salary structure near its current level, some clubs may not be able to meet payroll minimums in 2009-10. 
 HITS TO THE HEAD A rash of injuries resulting from checks to the head, legal under N.H.L. rules, has increased pressure to ban such hits, as the Ontario Hockey League and the N.F.L. have done. After the N.H.L. imposed a six-game suspension on Sean Avery for rude language, its inaction on such hits prompted added criticism.
 PROBLEMS WITH THE STANDINGS The N.H.L. awards 2 points for any kind of win, but 1 point for losing in overtime or via shootout. Every year, the number of 60-minute ties skyrockets late in the season as teams play for the guaranteed point. 
 The league may consider eliminating the ''loser point,'' or switching to the system -- 3 points for winning in regulation, 2 for winning in overtime or in a shootout, 1 for losing in overtime or in a shootout and nothing for losing in regulation -- used by the rest of the world. 
 FOREIGN TRANSFER AGREEMENT The league used to pay $200,000 for every player it signed away from European teams, a pittance for the likes of, say, Evgeni Malkin. That angered European federations.
 Now there is no international agreement, and some players, like the ex-Predator Alexander Radulov, have skipped out of N.H.L. contracts to play in Russia. Unless the league consents to pay closer to market value so a new agreement can be signed, the contract-jumping chaos is likely to continue.
 OVERSIZE GOALIE EQUIPMENT The N.H.L.'s goaltending supervisor, Kay Whitmore, has made progress this season, trimming some of the enormous protruding flaps in chest and leg pads. That may have led to a small rise in leaguewide scoring. But pads -- catching gloves, too -- are still huge, and the bloated gear is the main reason the current era is one of the lowest scoring.
 Pros vs. Juniors
 Two of the biggest events take place this time of year: the Winter Classic, which the Chicago Blackhawks and the Detroit Red Wings played before almost 41,000 fans at a festive Wrigley Field on New Year's Day; and the World Junior Championship, a tournament that ends Monday night at the raucous 19,000-seat Scotiabank Place in Ottawa.
 The proximity of the two events allowed the television analyst Pierre McGuire of NBC and Canada's TSN the rare treat of covering both. 
 ''The noise levels were huge at ice level,'' McGuire said of the N.H.L. game, which was won by Detroit, 6-4. ''When the players came out, the Detroit players were taunted unmercifully by the Chicago fans.''
 The Red Wings and the Blackhawks were professionals and not overawed by the atmosphere, McGuire said. ''It was a tough, physical game, a playoff-style contest,'' he said.
 By contrast, the World Junior is about ''having enough emotion to win but also controlling your emotion so it doesn't become a detriment,'' he said.
 McGuire said a New Year's Eve game between the United States and Canada was an example of how emotion can determine the outcome of a game. In a matchup of unbeaten teams to settle seeding for the medal round, the Americans jumped to a quick 3-0 lead in an atmosphere even fiercer than that at Wrigley. But then, McGuire said, ''their emotions got the best of them.'' They ran into penalty trouble and ended up losing, 7-4.
 McGuire said he saw a crucial link between the World Junior and big N.H.L. events like the Winter Classic or the playoffs. 
 ''The World Junior is an amazing preparatory tool for players in terms of learning how to become better and how to play at big moments,'' McGuire said. 
 That lesson may have been best learned by the Slovaks, who reached the quarterfinals by winning a do-or-die penalty shootout against Finland. Then in the quarterfinal game, Slovakia eliminated the Americans, 5-3, despite being outshot, 47-19.
 Player Dies After Fight
 Don Sanderson, a 21-year-old student and a defenseman with the Whitby Dunlops in Ontario's top senior amateur league, died Friday of massive head trauma sustained in a fight Dec. 12.
 Sanderson hit his head on the ice after his helmet came off in a fight with a Brantford player, who also fell to the ice. Sanderson was knocked unconscious. He was briefly revived, then he lapsed into a coma from which he never emerged.
 Fights in the senior league result in an automatic ejection, with the instigator getting an extra game's suspension. Sanderson had four fighting majors in 11 games this season. 
 ''It didn't look like it was as bad as obviously this has turned out to be,'' the Dunlops' president, Steve Cardwell, told The Canadian Press. ''At the time, it looked like so many other fights that anybody connected with hockey would have watched over the last number of years.''

HEADLINE: Left in Limbo As Dealers Fail

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER JENSEN

 BODY:
HUNDREDS of auto dealers have gone out of business as the economy has soured, and some of their customers have become casualties as well.
Diana Foley has a two-ton reminder of her misfortune parked at her house in Willows, Calif., a 2006 Lincoln Town Car that she can neither drive nor sell. 
Last year, Ms. Foley bought the Town Car from Vacaville Ford-Mercury. The dealer got the car as a trade-in from another customer, but failed to pay off the loan before selling it to Ms. Foley, said Bryan Kemnitzer, a San Francisco lawyer who represents Ms. Foley. She sued the defunct dealership and its bank, charging fraud. In essence, the dealership is accused of selling a car it did not own.
''It is a great way to make money,'' Mr. Kemnitzer said.
Because the loan had not been paid off, Ms. Foley could not get the title. Therefore, she could not register the Lincoln or drive it.
''I was frankly astonished that Vacaville Ford would have sold me a car that they did not hold the title on to begin with,'' she said.
David Paulson, the Solano County district attorney, is prosecuting Vacaville Ford-Mercury for similar fraud involving an as-yet-undetermined number of consumers. A lawyer for Vacaville Ford-Mercury did not return telephone calls seeking comment.
Ms. Foley is not alone in her predicament, said Rosemary Shahan, president of Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety, a consumer group in Sacramento. She said that over the last year many consumers had experienced such problems with dealerships.
Of course, dealers themselves are having problems. About 900 went out of business last year, and at least that many may close in 2009, said Paul Taylor, the chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association.
That prediction worries consumer advocates like Bradford Phelps, a senior assistant attorney general in Arkansas who sued McKay Hyundai in Pine Bluff. The suit, filed in 2007 in the Circuit Court of Pulaski County, charges that the dealership violated consumer protection laws by not paying off loans or by selling nonexistent extended warranties to at least 40 people.
''There is a real fear out there that this could happen again, and when it does happen it has devastating consequences for consumers,'' Mr. Phelps said.
James E. Smith Jr., a lawyer representing McKay, said it would be improper to comment on a pending case.
Consumers can get hurt in either of two ways, Ms. Shahan said. One is being forced to make payments not only on a new vehicle, but also on the vehicle that was traded in, because the consumer would still be the legal owner if the dealership did not pay off the loan. Or, if consumers bought a used car they can wind up like Ms. Foley, unable to get the title because the previous owner's loan had not been paid off.
Mr. Kemnitzer and Mr. Phelps said the banks that made loans for the dealerships have some legal responsibility. That raises the possibility that consumers may get some help, although it may require litigation.
Mr. Phelps said some banks had been willing to let Arkansas consumers off the hook by handing over the title and accepting the loss.
He recommended that anyone buying a used car insist on getting the title immediately and not accept a promise that it will be mailed.

HEADLINE: Region's Poets Convey A Sense of Place

BYLINE: By TINA KELLEY. 
Poems by Tina Kelley have been accepted for publication in a journal edited by Vivian Shipley.

 BODY:
MAYBE January is the cruelest month. The holiday bills fester, the garden catalogs have not yet arrived with their immodest promises of spring, and escaping to warmer climes is harder now that the economy has stopped working.
It's a perfect time to sit in a chair, calmly, with a lap robe and a comforting book of poetry, and to think about where we live, listen to the heartbeat of here, and learn how words mean home.
An abundance of talented poets write and live in the cities and towns outside of New York City, including the 2008 Pulitzer Prize winner, Philip Schultz, of East Hampton.
For this first Sunday of the year, a time for resolutions and the contemplations that go with them, we have asked some of the area's leading poets what they find close to home that inspires poetry and what their poems can tell us about where we live. 
Westchester
Billy Collins, the national poet laureate from 2001 to 2003, has published nine books of poetry, including ''Ballistics'' (Random House, 2008). Mr. Collins, 67, has lived in Somers for the last 18 years.
''The location for most of my poems is generally between my ears,'' he said during an interview at the Geraldine R. Dodge Poetry Festival, which attracted 19,000 people last fall in Stanhope, N.J. ''Coleridge was one of the first poets to begin his poems in domestic settings -- the living room, the fireplace, the backyard. I learned how to start a poem in a very familiar place and move away from that and use it as a launching pad to abstract territories.''
Mr. Collins grew up in White Plains. ''The suburbs have such a terrible rap as being neither here nor there, neither city nor country,'' he said. ''I didn't learn about getting along in the city, or about deer hunting. They have a reputation for boring blandness. It's not until I got this house that I found my surroundings leaking into poetry, with a very attractive set of images.''
Patricia Smith's fifth book of poetry, ''Blood Dazzler'' (Coffee House Press), was a finalist for the 2008 National Book Award, and she won the individual National Poetry Slam four times. Ms. Smith, 53, has lived in Tarrytown for the last nine years.
''I've explored so much of myself through my poetry, I feel strong and rooted wherever I am,'' she said. ''You kind of take your community with you.''
But she remembers touring the county in search of a new place to call home before she found Tarrytown. ''From sitting in a little bench outside the CVS in the middle of town, I heard people beep horns at each other, and saw people walking their dogs, and it looked like a place you could fold yourself into,'' she said. ''Everyone's face seemed open, and everyone seemed happy to be living there.''
The town's natural beauty, while not appearing in her poems, helps feed them. ''I live so close to the Hudson, and it's very inspirational,'' she said. ''I get solace when I need solace.''
New Jersey
Joe Weil, 50, consistently draws on the muse of Elizabeth, where three generations of his family attended St. Mary of the Assumption High School. His books include ''Painting the Christmas Trees'' (Texas Review Press) and ''What Remains'' (Nightshade Press), which includes an imagined encounter between the actress Susan Sarandon and a boozy and besotted narrator.
Mr. Weil explained the long-gone setting of the poem, a seedy bar on the Newark border called Two Friends: ''It was owned, literally, by two friends who then stopped being friends, but still ran the bar together for 25 years. We called them Surly and Surly. They were both absolutely bald and never smiled.''
He added: ''It's not just people who are in love with each other who start to look alike. Sworn enemies start to look alike after 25 years.''
For Mr. Weil, Elizabeth has become part of his muscle memory. ''In a poem, it becomes part of the rhythms, the speech patterns, the rhythm of your lines. I speak Elizabeth. I have a voice somewhat like Joe Pesci's, but two bus stops over.''
BJ Ward, 41, is the author of ''Gravedigger's Birthday,'' ''17 Love Poems With No Despair'' and ''Landing in New Jersey With Soft Hands,'' from North Atlantic Books. He grew up in Warren County and lives there in Changewater, which straddles the Musconetcong River. His poems don't tell us about where we live so much as they create places that are even more compelling.
''For me it's a question of does the place help define your poetry, or can your poems help redefine the place you live in? Would Rutherford be the same if William Carlos Williams hadn't lived there?'' he said during an interview at the Dodge Poetry Festival.
Later, he said: ''Place is what we reinvent in a lot of poems, in order to make it truer. So often we forsake what people might call accuracy for the sake of truth or truthfulness. If my hometown needs a priest to try to shut down the library, I will invent a priest to shut down the library if that's what my poem needs, even if that's not what occurs. In the act of writing a poem, your fidelity shifts from the world outside you that you observe at first, to the world inside that's asking to be expressed.''
He loves living in rural Warren County in part because ''it's largely unimagined.''
''I'd find it much more difficult to reinvent Manhattan,'' he said.
Long Island
Grace Schulman, 73, has written ''The Broken String'' (Houghton Mifflin, 2007) and five other books of poetry. She teaches English at Baruch College and was The Nation's poetry editor from 1971 to 2006. She spends much of her time in East Hampton.
Her poem ''Headstones'' describes how the graves of Montauk Indians were marked with nothing but wampum.
''I think if it is concentrated on and seen with accuracy, and with sympathy, the image can reveal all we are,'' she said in a recent phone interview. ''The Indian shells were specific to the Indians, yet those shells reveal me, myself and my own ancestry.''
In the poem she visits the Devon Yacht Club in Amagansett, but realizes that neither Wyandanch, the Montauk leader, nor her ancestors Dave or Schmuel, would be welcome there.
''An image of the Montauk Indians captured for me the truth of my past, their past and the present as well,'' she said. ''As much as poetry reveals who we are, place provides the imagery which allows poetry to reveal who we are.''
Julie Sheehan, 44, has published two books of poetry, including ''Orient Point'' (W. W. Norton, 2007). She won a 2008 Whiting Writers' Award and moved from New York City to East Quogue in 2001.
Since then, she has become engrossed in economic and class strains, ''when your economic life becomes divorced from your place, and you end up working at a Wal-Mart that could be anywhere, instead of on a ship that by necessity would be sailing into the Peconic Bay.''
Poems, more than other art forms, tackle thorny social issues through metaphor, she said.
''I'm not a nature poet, I'm a people poet,'' she said. ''Nature in my poetry will always be there as a figure for something else that interests me a lot more.''
Connecticut
Vivian Shipley has published seven full-length poetry volumes, including ''Hardboot'' (Southeastern Louisiana University Press, 2005), and five shorter collections. She grew up in Harlan County, Ky., and has lived in Connecticut since 1965. She writes extensively about both places.
''What I think is happening in our society, distinctive locales are disappearing,'' she said in a recent interview. ''If you drive across the country on an interstate, you'll find the distinction in landscape pretty much disappear into structures of housing, Burger Kings, Domino's and Wal-Marts. I think we're really being leveled, and I think it's very important for poetry to try to preserve a uniqueness of place.''
Ms. Shipley, 65, spends her summers on Morgan Point, where she became fascinated by the cormorants diving for fish in Long Island Sound. ''I had all this information about them, and I was really interested in the subject for several years, before I found anything to attach it to,'' she said. They appeared in her poem about the mysterious crash of T.W.A. Flight 800 off Long Island in 1996, as counterpoints to the divers in black wet suits searching for remains.
Ravi Shankar, 33, is the author of ''Instrumentality'' (Cherry Grove Collections, 2004) and is a founding editor of Drunken Boat, an online journal of the arts. He moved seven years ago from Brooklyn to Chester, a town of about 4,500, which he said was ''probably the size of the apartment building I lived in.'' He enjoys living close to the Connecticut River, he said, and his walks along it have inspired him to write.
''Things I've been reading, conversations I've been having, phrases I have collected in my notebooks, and I think certainly going out to take a walk, they all help that,'' he said. ''Wallace Stevens composed many of his poems while he walked down Asylum Avenue in Hartford. The pace of his steps make it into his poems oftentimes.''

HEADLINE: Companies' Experiment: Bring Your Baby to Work

BYLINE: By ABBY ELLIN

 BODY:
SEVERAL years ago, Joyce DeLucca became pregnant at the same time she was building her new company, Kingsland Capital Management, an investment boutique in Manhattan. Her employees wondered: Was she going to take a maternity leave during this crucial period?
 She did not. Instead, Ms. DeLucca decided to bring her newborn to the office with her. She set up an enclosed playroom adjacent to her office, where Layla, now 3 1/2, could play, along with a baby sitter. 
 Layla is still coming to the office. ''If I have a break I can stand up and walk into her room,'' said Ms. DeLucca, who is 42 and works 12-hour days. ''She knows her way around the office, and sometimes she'll visit me on the trading desk. But it's not like she comes with me to meetings. If I put my finger to my lips, she knows to be quiet.'' Layla's sister Ariana, who is 7 months old, now comes to the office, too. 
 More companies are allowing women -- and some men, too -- to bring their babies to work. The advantages are clear: The women don't lose money by taking maternity leave. They can breastfeed conveniently. And they can bond with the baby rather than worry that he or she will develop a closer connection with a nanny or a day-care provider.
 Of course, disadvantages are clear, too. The needs and noises of babies have the potential to be highly disruptive and to stir resentment among co-workers. 
 Susan Seitel, president of WFC Resources, a workplace consulting firm in Minneapolis, put it this way: ''The business of business is business. I think it's a little distracting to have children at the office.''
 Critics also say that both child and job could lose out because the parent can't be 100 percent devoted to either one.
 Ms. DeLucca's firm has about two dozen workers, and she says they are welcome to bring in their children as well; about five have done so for brief periods. Her employees like having children around, she said: ''I have not heard anyone react other than enthusiastically.''
 The Parenting in the Workplace Institute, a nonprofit group that started in June 2006, has a database of 117 baby-friendly companies of all sizes, among them retail stores, banks, law firms and state agencies. 
 ''This has been going on for 15 years in a limited fashion, but in the last two years it's really taken off,'' said Carla Moquin, the founder of the Parenting in the Workplace Institute, who lives in Framingham, Mass.
 ''It's partly economic concern,'' Ms. Moquin said, because there are many more women in the workplace. ''Also, the Family and Medical Leave Act requires companies to give new mothers three months off. Even though it's unpaid, it's hard on businesses for an employee to be gone. That, combined with the fact that more people are seeing this as a viable idea, has inspired companies and mothers to work something out.''
 The most successful programs, Ms. Moquin said, are ones in which companies have written policies -- to designate another employee as an alternate caregiver in case the parent is temporarily unavailable; to specify areas for breastfeeding or changing diapers; and to spell out the ages when children are allowed in the office. Usually, babies are allowed up until 6 to 8 months, or before they start to crawl. 
 Even women who advocate bringing babies to the office say it can be rough. ''It's far better for me to have my child at home. It's hard to be your best work person and your best mom because you're doing both things at one time,'' said Denise McVey, president of S3, a 25-person advertising agency in Boonton, N.J., who brought her son to the office for his first eight months.
 Borshoff, a communications firm in Indianapolis with 40 employees, has a Bring Your Baby to Work program for infants ages 6 weeks to 6 months. The firm pays 80 percent of an employee's full salary when the child is in the office. 
 That way, the parent can devote energy to the child without feeling guilty. ''It feels very fair,'' said Susan F. Matthews, principal of the firm. ''We keep time sheets so we can monitor productivity, and we see that parents really don't maintain the same productivity levels.''
 Alison Gopnik, a psychology professor at the University of California, Berkeley, says she believes that taking children to the office can only enhance their development. ''There's no reason to believe that children need to have absolute single-minded attention being paid to them with nothing else in the background,'' she said.
 Jacqueline Grace, president and chief executive of LifeTime Media, a publishing company in New York with nine employees, has been taking her daughter Alexandra, now 5 years old, to work since she was 2 months old -- all day, every day. 
 Initially, Ms. Grace said, it was easy to work with Alexandra in her office. ''She slept, nursed and slept more,'' said Ms. Grace, who would hold conference calls while breastfeeding or while Alexandra was asleep. ''As she grew and needed more space to play, I gave her her own 'office,' '' Ms. Grace said. ''She loved the idea of having an office -- and a computer -- like everyone else. Of course, her office had a bouncy seat for her -- and her dolls and games and balls and markers and bookshelves filled with colorful books.''
 Ms. Grace says that all of her employees can bring their children to the office, in the belief that having children around creates a positive environment. ''People smile more; they're more relaxed and playful,'' she said. ''It has been challenging at times, for them and for me -- editing a book and hearing a 3-year-old sing 'Elmo' don't usually mix well -- but we all adapt and learn to be respectful of our office-mates.''
 SHE says that the arrangement has enhanced her daughter's ''self-esteem, her sense of security'' and that it ''has taught her so much about who she is, who she can be, as well as some amazing office skills in the process.'' 
 Ms. Grace added that she has been careful to hire ''baby-friendly people.'' ''If you hate children,'' she said, ''LifeTime Media is not a place for you to work.''

HEADLINE: Office Demand Is Down, And So Are the Deals

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
BY most accounts, the commercial property market reached its pinnacle in early 2007 with the Blackstone Group's acquisition of Equity Office Properties Trust and its prized cache of more than 500 office buildings.
 The $39 billion deal was the largest of a spate of mergers and acquisitions. Back then, trophy towers were a hot commodity for large investors with seemingly insatiable appetites for commercial properties and copious credit to buy them. 
 (In fact, with the ink barely dry on its agreement, Blackstone, a private equity firm, was able to resell a big chunk of the E.O.P. portfolio.) 
 But the credit crisis and recession crushed deal making in office buildings in 2008. 
 From January through December, there were just 1,410 transactions nationwide, valued at $49.3 billion, versus 4,410, valued at $207.2 billion, for the corresponding period in 2007, according to the latest data from Real Capital Analytics, a research company. It predicted that sales would total $53 billion to $55 billion for all of 2008, further below a recently reduced forecast of $61 billion.
 At the same time, demand for offices has softened as companies have cut back or consolidated operations; many of them are already subleasing space that they no longer need. Office vacancies nationwide rose to around 13.5 percent by mid-December from about 12.5 percent, on average, in 2007, according to Reis Inc., another research company. 
 Of course, all these negative conditions are taking a toll on investors. 
 Some property owners are dealing with tighter cash flows and reduced profits from lost tenants or falling rental rates. In Manhattan alone, rents are expected to plunge 10 to 20 percent by 2010, and nationally by 5 to 15 percent, according to Cushman & Wakefield, the commercial broker. 
 Shareholders in real estate investment trusts that focus on office properties have watched their returns plummet as well. 
 Industry analysts expect little improvement this year. ''It's safe to say that it's going to get worse before it gets better,'' said Maria Sicola, the executive managing director of research at Cushman & Wakefield, noting, too, that the office market tends to lag the overall economy because of its long leases. She said, ''2009 will be a difficult year -- we'll continue to see job losses in many regions of the country.'' 
 About 1.9 million jobs have been lost since January 2008, about a third of them among office workers, and many of those are in the troubled financial services industry, according to Raymond G. Torto, the global chief economist for CB Richard Ellis, the commercial brokerage firm. He predicted that as many as two million more jobs could vanish by the end of 2009. 
 On the positive side, new development remains under control. ''This was our saving grace,'' said Sheila K. McGrath, a real estate analyst at Keefe Bruyette & Woods, explaining that high construction costs and tighter financing had helped to curtail new projects.
 So what can investors do to minimize their losses until the next growth cycle? 
 For landlords, whether they own trophy towers or modest suburban buildings, the advice is simple. ''You will need to maintain cash flow and tenants and minimize expense -- that's your only strategy right now,'' Mr. Torto said. ''As an owner in a highly illiquid market, it's too late to sell,'' except at distressed prices. 
 But what about buying? That question seems harder to answer. 
 ''If you're a buyer, you're looking for prices to settle lower,'' Mr. Torto said. ''Some buyers cautiously see this as an opportunity. This is a time when core trophy properties become available, and they would never be able to get in that market before.''
 Indeed, a big investor could find deals in distressed or potentially troubled properties; in a recent report, Real Capital Analytics identified 649 of them nationwide. Those on the list included several Manhattan office buildings that were acquired through Blackstone two years ago by Macklowe Properties. Macklowe, in turn, gave them up because of financing problems. 
 ''Blackstone was extremely savvy -- or very lucky -- by disposing of the E.O.P. property as quickly as it acquired it,'' said Paul E. Adornato, a senior real estate analyst at BMO Capital Markets.
 For the smaller investor, there may be some buying opportunities in modest buildings outside urban areas, as well as in office REITs, which are dividend-paying companies that hold portfolios of properties. The office REIT sector over all was trading at a discount of nearly 36 percent to net asset value in mid-December, according to Mr. Adornato.
 Office REITs had a 44 percent loss, on average, for the year through Dec. 30, according to the latest data from the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, compared with a 40.5 percent loss for all property REITs during that same period. 
 Industry analysts urge investors to exercise caution when picking REITs, however. ''While we acknowledge deep discounts available, we don't necessarily see a catalyst now to get the stocks moving,'' Mr. Adornato said.
 Still, he and others maintain that some office REITs are better positioned to weather the anemic economy and tight lending environment, and they advised investors to pay close attention to company balance sheets, focusing on cash reserves and debt levels.
 ''You want to look at who's got loans coming due,'' said Ritson Ferguson of ING Clarion, explaining that refinancing can be dicey these days. 
 Because of their lower-than-average leverage, Mr. Ferguson said, he is relatively optimistic about Vornado Realty Trust, Highwoods Properties Inc. and Office Property Trust. He said he also preferred Boston Properties Inc. because it has longer-than-average lease terms -- ''north of seven years'' -- on its buildings.
 Ms. McGrath, meanwhile, said she favored Alexandria Real Estate Equities, which specializes in laboratory space. While the REIT was not immune to the economic slowdown, she said, she viewed its ''concentration in life science and lack of exposure to financial tenants as a positive.'' 
 Mr. Adornato also ventured from the plain-vanilla office companies. He was positive about Douglas Emmett Inc., which owns office space, along with apartments, in ''high-barrier-to-entry markets,'' where there are often obstacles to new development. He singled out another REIT hybrid, Liberty Property Trust, which owns office and industrial property in diverse regions. 
 While most analysts see few regions as particularly strong, some are upbeat about the Washington area, given the continuing demand from the federal government and the incoming Obama administration. ''I think defense intelligence will remain a top priority for the country,'' Mr. Adornato said, ''and you need office space for that.'' 
 He was also more bullish about so-called Class A buildings, which are often in superior locations and attract the highest-quality tenants and rental rates. ''I would think that the Class A property will likely do better,'' he said. ''The tenants who could not afford Class A before would be able to move up from Class B as prices are lowered.''

HEADLINE: Exporting Leaves, Importing Compost

BYLINE: By ABBY GRUEN

DATELINE: RYE 

 BODY:
 A PUFF of wind blew the last leaf off of the pin oak in Ken Knowles's yard here six weeks ago. The 30-foot drop to Mr. Knowles's tidy front lawn was the beginning of a journey that will carry his leaves along with a stream of others from nearby towns out of the county to fields and farms, sometimes hundreds of miles away.
 Each fall, Westchester County sends more than 85,000 tons of leaves to rural areas in a handful of states as far away as New Hampshire, where they are turned into compost and topsoil that is used throughout the region. Some of the products come back to Westchester as organic produce or soil enhancers sold at local nurseries. 
 ''It's unfortunate that we have to burn so much fuel to transport our leaves, but real estate is expensive around here,'' said William McDavid, 62, a retired lawyer who lives in Rye, while buying groceries at June and Ho, a gourmet store on Purchase Street in the Village of Rye. 
 Mr. McDavid, a regular June and Ho shopper, buys heirloom and organic tomatoes there that have been grown with compost made from Westchester's leaves at McEnroe's Organic Farm in Millerton, in the Catskills.
 During the fall, the City of Rye's six orange garbage trucks pick up thousands of leaf bags a week and dump them in a lot behind Disbrow Park on Oakland Avenue. The leaves are transferred to 100-cubic-yard trailers that are hauled upstate and to Connecticut, New Jersey and New Hampshire by City Carting of Westchester, a private trucker. During a typical December week, Rye sends nine container trucks full of leaves on the road.
 ''We fill a dozen Kraft leaf bags two or three times a year during the season,'' said Mr. Knowles, 58, a bookkeeper who has lived in Rye for 33 years.
 A lack of open space in Westchester means that densely settled towns and villages cannot afford to collect and process the avalanche of leaves fast enough to keep roads and drainage systems clear without county assistance.
 For the county, trucking leaves out of Westchester is cheaper than processing them here. It costs $80 a ton to dispose of garbage at the county's incinerator in Peekskill and only $40 a ton for leaves using the current transfer and trucking system. Towns in Westchester get a subsidy for using the county system and are charged only $15 a ton. The county spends $3.4 million for leaf removal, of which the municipalities pay $1.27 million.
 ''The agreement is very economical for us,'' said George J. Mottarella, city engineer for the City of Rye. One of the few municipalities in the county that has residents bag their own leaves, Rye also saves money because bagged leaves are lighter than moisture-laden leaves picked up from the street, Mr. Mottarella said.
 This year, one of the largest end-users of Westchester's leaves is Organic Recycling Inc., an 82-acre facility in Goshen that processes Westchester's leaves almost exclusively. 
 Dan Daly, a horticulturalist who lives in Goshen, recently filled up his truck with topsoil and compost from Organic Recycling for use at his nursery and home vegetable garden.
 ''We grow a lot of our own food and use straight compost here,'' said Mr. Daly, whose family was still eating home-grown tomatoes in December, picked before the frost. His garden takes up most of his yard. ''I like knowing where my compost comes from,'' he said.
 Westchester is known for its leafy suburban streets, and almost a third of its garbage is made up of yard waste. Half of that is autumn leaves.
 Removing this material from the solid waste stream has contributed to making Westchester the top county in New York State for the percent of recycled waste, said Marianne Petronella, director of resource management for the Westchester County Department of Environmental Facilities. 
 Westchester recycles 47 percent of its solid waste, compared with 35 percent by New York City, said Matthew LiPani, spokesman for the New York City Department of Sanitation.
 While most local politicians agree that municipalities need help managing the mountains of leaves that fall each year, the environmental impact of putting more than 900 trucks on the highway to cart them away is being questioned by the Westchester County Board of Legislators. 
 ''At the time this program was developed, it looked like the most efficient way to dispose of the leaves; but the environment, the economy and the technology are rapidly changing, and we need to look for better ways of doing things,'' said Thomas J. Abinanti, a Democrat who represents Greenburgh and is the chairman of the environment and energy committee. ''We need to start to see our leaves as a natural resource, not as a waste product.'' 
 The board recently heard two private-sector proposals for developing programs that would compost and sell the leaves in the county and even generate energy from the heat emitted by the compost, Mr. Abinanti said. 
 The Village of Irvington switched to the county transfer program from composting its own leaves and distributing the mulch free to village residents in 2006, said Mayor Nicola Coddington, after the county stopped providing the village with a leaf shredder and encouraged it to join the transfer agreement. 
 There has been no additional cost to the village because the fee for picking up the leaves roughly matches the cost of manpower for the mulch program. The village pays $50,000 a year to haul away all yard waste, including leaves and brush.
 ''It annoyed me at the time because it seemed counterproductive and wasteful to spend fossil fuels to truck all of these leaves away from where we could use them,'' Ms. Coddington said. ''It seemed to me not very green.''
 However, she said she had found in her own yard that expedience sometimes takes precedence over environmental sensitivity. While she composts her kitchen waste and some yard waste in a black plastic bin that she bought from the county, it can handle only a portion of her leaves. The rest she rakes to the curb for village pickup and shipping out of the county.
 ''I would need 10 bins to be able to keep up with the leaves each fall,'' Ms. Coddington said. ''They are a high-volume, short-term issue that you can't spread out over the year. You have to deal with them at once, which is where the space issue comes in.''

HEADLINE: The Positivity of Power Thinking

BYLINE: By LEE SIEGEL. 
Lee Siegel's most recent book is ''Against the Machine: Being Human in the Age of the Electronic Mob.'' He lectures on cultural criticism at Rutgers University.

 BODY:
Standing at the beginning of a new year, two weeks before a new president is inaugurated, and amid expectations of major political and economic change, we are, you might say, at a Huntington moment.
 Samuel Huntington, the political theorist who died on Dec. 24 at the age of 81, was a power thinker, one of the breed of ''big idea'' men whose major works didn't just explain historical transformation but seemed to crystallize it -- in ways that altered how the rest of us looked at the world, for better and also for worse. 
 In provocative books like ''Political Order in Changing Societies'' and ''The Clash of Civilizations,'' Mr. Huntington's talent -- some would say weakness -- for the grand synthesizing theory is most strikingly on display. In 1968, when ''Political Order'' was published, most political scientists held that the key to democracy was modernization. As backward societies caught up with the more advanced ones, they would also develop more inclusive political systems. But Mr. Huntington made a contrary argument: since modernization often brought chaos, the actual sine qua non of a successful society was order. It alone could contain the demons set loose by social change and also create the conditions for gradual political reform. By this calculation, any system that imposed order, even authoritarian order, was legitimate. 
 In the Soviet Union, Britain and the United States, ''the government governs,'' Mr. Huntington wrote. All three ''have strong, adaptable, coherent political institutions: effective bureaucracies, well-organized political parties.'' 
 Published at a time when efforts to build a democratic nation in South Vietnam had proved disastrous, Mr. Huntington's book changed the debate. 
 His later book, ''The Clash of Civilizations,'' published in 1996, also captured its moment, though with an altogether different argument. The unifying drive for order that had been at the center of Mr. Huntington's analysis of the cold war -- a period in which democratic and authoritarian regimes could coexist, however uneasily -- now gave way to a dark vision of a world irreconcilably divided. Surveying the post-cold-war landscape, Mr. Huntington described radically different civilizations with radically divergent values -- most specifically, those of the secular West and of the Islamic world. After Sept. 11, 2001, ''The Clash of Civilizations'' acquired something like a prophetic authority.
 In these two books, Mr. Huntington seemed to have calibrated his responses to a particular moment -- to history as it was happening. As events changed, so did his interpretations. This was to be expected. The adaptation of theory to reality is the essence of the power thinker's metier. 
 It was not always so. In the classical age, when wars lasted for many years, even decades, and technology evolved at a snail's pace, historians like Thucydides and Polybius took a longer view. To them, no single historical event mattered more than any other. All unfolded within endlessly recurring cycles dominated by the deep currents of human nature. This view might seem archaic -- yet its lessons remain relevant. Bernard Madoff is accused of bilking an estimated $50 billion from investors by executing the same scheme Charles Ponzi used in 1921. Wall Street's financial ''instruments'' have undergone a revolution in the last nine decades, but people are driven by the same appetites -- envy, greed, fear. 
 It was in the modern era, with its belief in human progress, that thinkers began to interpret the world in a different way -- not as a record of human folly but rather as an enactment of changing or evolving historical forces. 
 The 18th-century Italian philosopher Giambattista Vico argued that all civilizations pass through three stages: the age of the gods, in which divinities directly ruled humankind; the age of aristocratic heroes, in which superior individuals reigned over lesser individuals; and finally the age of ordinary humans, in which men and women govern themselves in the spirit of equality. This last phase eventually gives way to decadence and disintegration characterized by brutish manners (see: reality television). At that point, the gods return (Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, Dark Knight), and the three-part cycle starts again. 
 Meanwhile French thinkers like Voltaire, Condorcet and Turgot converted the Christian idea of spiritual progress into a vision of rational human improvement unhindered by religious superstition. This Enlightenment belief in human perfectibility is, among other things, a great illusion-producing machine. You could draw a steady line from 18th-century optimism to the sugar plums of fantastical mortgages and overdrawn credit in 2008.
 In the early 19th century, one of the true giants of power thinking, G. W. F. Hegel, tried to reconcile reason with religion through the logic of the ''dialectic.'' Even terrible events might represent advances for human society. For example, the French Revolution had descended into irrational cruelty, but its ''necessary'' violence had led to a rational and humane backlash against that very barbarism. 
 Today, Hegel's pendular historical motion continues to shape political debate -- for instance when some argue that the Democrats' deficit spending will lead to Republican retrenchment, which will then lead to more Democratic deficit spending. 
 The most influential of all 19th-century historical theorists, Karl Marx, adopted Hegel's dialectic but revised it to suit his own theory of historical materialism, which was rooted in class struggle and economic competition. For Marx, the ''dialectic'' meant that political systems plant the seeds of their own destruction. In his day the triumph of bourgeois capitalism fostered economic injustices that would, Marx predicted, give rise to an emerging class, the proletariat, which one day would topple the bourgeoisie. 
 It is possible to see the past 15 years through a Marxist lens. Prosperity and success sowed the seeds of the current economic crisis, which in turn has nourished growing anger at the ''class'' of Wall Street financiers. In the larger sense, of course, Marx's vision of a class revolution was discredited. 
 So, for that matter, was Mr. Huntington's theory about ''modernizing authoritarianism.'' In his foreword to a recent edition of ''Political Order in Changing Societies,'' Francis Fukuyama, a former student of Mr. Huntington's and a consequential big-idea man in his own right, observed that the Soviet system was by no means the effective government Mr. Huntington claimed it had been. 
 Mr. Huntington's idea about the inevitable clash of civilizations also looks different today -- its harsh view of the world disconcertingly similar to the thinking behind the Bush administration's crusading war on political Islam, though Mr. Huntington was himself skeptical about what he called America's ''imperial'' mission in Iraq. Mr. Huntington got many things right -- and his theories included major insights. But in their very largeness they veered toward oversimplification.
 ''Perhaps,'' as Mr. Fukuyama wrote, ''all grand theories are ultimately doomed to failure.'' 
 Why should this be? Probably because in their desire to explain so much, big thinkers tend to skip over complicating factors and counterevidence. Painting in broad and often brilliant strokes, they often miss the shadows and crevices. The very seductiveness of power thinking -- its promise that everything fits together or can be made to seem so -- is also the source of its danger. It offers something irresistible, the possibility that we can change, or at least control, our lives by means of ideas, even though those ideas are themselves abstract inventions. 
 Still, as long as there is private and public history, human beings will try to think their way around it. For better. And for worse.

HEADLINE: Husk Power for India

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
Many of India's cities have become bustling centers for high technology and heavy industry, but hundreds of millions of people in the countryside remain off the grid. Growing up in rural Bihar State, Manoj Sinha knew what it was like to sit in the dark. So after earning an electrical engineering degree at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and working for the Intel Corporation, he began exploring ways to turn farm waste into electricity, with the dream of building village-scale generators. 
 Last year at the University of Virginia, where he is studying for a master's at the Darden School of Business, he and a fellow student, Charles Ransler, teamed up with another engineer from Bihar, Gyanesh Pandey, and Husk Power Systems was born.
 The Indian engineers, both 31, had initially planned on raising money to build small generators for simply a few villages. But the company now has a proprietary generator that runs on a methane-like gas released by heating rice husks a certain way. A waste product of rice milling, husks are plentiful in villages. While agricultural waste is common for generating heat, it is not often used for generating electricity, and there is nothing remotely like this system in the villages of developing countries. The system produces enough electricity to supply 300 to 500 households for 8 to 10 hours a day. A byproduct is silica, a valuable ingredient in making cement. 
 The long-term plan is to profit from the global market in credits -- earned by avoiding greenhouse-gas emissions, which result from burning fossil fuels like coal -- and to sell the benefit. 
 Husk Power Systems won first place in 2008 in the University of Virginia business plan competition and the social innovation competition at the University of Texas, Austin. The students are headquartered at the Darden School of Business incubator, where they get space and advice.
 There are generators in five villages now, with the hope of expanding to 100 within a few years, Mr. Ransler says. Eventually, these communities could shift to other electricity sources as the Indian economy matures. But Mr. Ransler, 30, predicts there will be a market for many years to come for small-scale power systems burning renewable farm waste.
 Business leaders must realize that the world's poor need investments more than handouts, he says, adding, ''These are customers, not victims.''

HEADLINE: Design Loves a Depression

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CANNELL. 
Michael Cannell is a former editor of the House & Home section of The Times and founder of thedesignvote.com.

 BODY:
Few of the arts benefited from the late economic boom more than design. After all, when the wealth is flowing, people don't covet the concerts you see or the books you read. They covet the couch you bought, and then they buy a cooler one. 
 In the recent giddy years, signature architects and designers came to be known by their first names -- Rem, Philippe, Zaha -- and they were photographed as prolifically as Bono in new design hotbeds like Miami and Dubai. Brooklyn designers became the apotheosis of indie cool (thin portfolios notwithstanding), and the British collective Established & Sons and other skilled maneuverers learned to breed their self-conscious furniture selectively into limited editions that sold for the kind of prices more often found in the art world. All of which was chronicled in self-celebratory books like ''S, M, L, XL'' by Rem Koolhaas, a 1,300-page monograph as lush as glazed fruit and weighty as firewood. 
 Looking back, those of us with front-row seats might have known that this design surge would not sustain itself. Two years ago, at the Milan furniture fair, Marcel Wanders, a Dutch designer known for arty provocations, held a thumping party to show off his 15-foot-high lamps and other furniture of distorted Alice-in-Wonderland scale. Never mind that his work was upstaged by his girlfriend, Nanine Linning, who hung upside down half-naked while mixing vodka drinks from bottles affixed to a chandelier. Form followed frivolity. Function was left off the guest list. 
 Now, given that all those slick Miami condos are sitting empty in the sky, designers like the Campana Brothers, with their $8,910 Corallo chair, and Hella Jongerius, with her $10,615 Ponder sofa, might have a harder time selling their wares. Already designers are biting their knuckles over the damage reports. The American Institute of Architects reported that last month's billings index, a gauge of nonresidential construction, reached its lowest level since it began collecting data in 1995. 
 The pain of layoffs notwithstanding, the design world could stand to come down a notch or two -- and might actually find a new sense of relevance in the process. That was the case during the Great Depression, when an early wave of modernism flourished in the United States, partly because it efficiently addressed the middle-class need for a pared-down life without servants and other Victorian trappings. 
 ''American designers took the Depression as a call to arms,'' said Kristina Wilson, author of ''Livable Modernism: Interior Decorating and Design During the Great Depression'' and an assistant professor of art history at Clark University. ''It was a chance to make good on the Modernist promise to make affordable, intelligent design for a broad audience.'' 
 The most popular American designer of that era was probably Russel Wright, who acted as the Depression's Martha Stewart, turning out a warmed-up, affordable version of European modern furniture, tableware and linens for a new kind of informal home life. A bentwood armchair cost $19.95. ''They were not just cheap, they were beautiful, and that was a powerful combination,'' Ms. Wilson said.
 Design tends to thrive in hard times. In the scarcity of the 1940s, Charles and Ray Eames produced furniture and other products of enduring appeal from cheap materials like plastic, resin and plywood, and Italian design flowered in the aftermath of World War II. 
 Will today's designers rise to the occasion? ''What designers do really well is work within constraints, work with what they have,'' said Paola Antonelli, senior curator of architecture and design at the Museum of Modern Art. ''This might be the time when designers can really do their job, and do it in a humanistic spirit.'' 
 In the lean years ahead, ''there will be less design, but much better design,'' Ms. Antonelli predicted. 
 There is a reason she and others are optimistic: however dark the economic picture, it will most likely cause designers to shift their attention from consumer products to the more pressing needs of infrastructure, housing, city planning, transit and energy. Designers are good at coming up with new ways of looking at complex problems, and if President-elect Barack Obama delivers anything like a W.P.A, we could be ''standing on the brink of one of the most productive periods of design ever,'' said Reed Kroloff, director of Cranbrook Academy of Art. 
 On the other hand, the design community talked up its role in safeguarding the world after 9/11, with little result. 
 Modernism's great ambition was to democratize design. Ikea and Target have shown that the battle for cheap design can be won. The emphasis will most likely shift to greater quality at affordable prices. This time around it will be the designer's job to discourage consumers from regarding that $30 Ikea side table as a throwaway item. 
 If household furnishings are to avoid landfills, says Julie Lasky, editor in chief of I.D. magazine, they must be capable of withstanding the vicissitudes of fashion -- like the Aalto stool, but at a fifth of the price. ''It will be about finding the sweet spot between affordability and durability,'' Ms. Lasky said. This kind of innovation means rethinking the economy of production and distribution so that goods are made cheaply closer to home (or in the home, if the most radical ideas are to be taken seriously). 
 One way or another, design will focus less on styling consumer objects with laser-cut patterns and colored resin and more on the intelligent reworking of current conditions. Expect to hear a lot more about open-source design, and cradle-to-cradle, a concept developed by William McDonough and Michael Braungart that calls for cars, packaging and other everyday objects to be designed specifically for recycling so that their parts and materials are used and reused without waste. 
 The old paradigm -- epitomized by shelter magazines like Architectural Digest and Dwell -- that found romance in single-family homes, each with its own lawn, detached garage and septic system, may crumble under the weight of its wastefulness. One challenge will be for designers to coax us to a more efficient way of living, as the architect Lorcan O'Herlihy is doing with his light and airy schemes for multifamily dwellings in Los Angeles, a city where backyards and driveways are all but a birthright. Fewer buildings will go up, and the stock of mid-century buildings nearing the end of their lifespan will be thoughtfully reworked to make them efficient and in keeping with principles of sustainability. 
 If Ms. Linning's dangling from the ceiling was a cultural moment now passed, we can look forward to others for an age in which beauty and austerity go together.

HEADLINE: In a Dig for the Future, a Glimpse of the Past

BYLINE: By JAKE MOONEY

 BODY:
THE ground just inside a fence near the Fulton Ferry Landing on the Brooklyn waterfront was bare last week, only pavement and packed dirt, but that state of affairs, like the rest of the site's history, was only temporary. Within a year, planners say, a grassy field will slope up to a hill overlooking New York Harbor to form the centerpiece of the long-planned Brooklyn Bridge Park.
 ''Basically, it's going to be our Long Meadow,'' Regina Myer, president of the Brooklyn Bridge Park Development Corporation, said in a reference to the borough's beloved Prospect Park. That, provided the economic crisis does not render her statement overly optimistic, will be just one step in a history of change for the property. 
 Two weeks earlier, the spot had been a series of holes dug by archaeologists investigating the waterfront's history. A hundred years before that, the site was occupied by a flour mill. And a hundred years before that, before the shoreline was extended outward by landfill, it was a featureless point at the bottom of the East River, yards from one of Brooklyn's early town centers.
 The archaeologists, as it happened, were interested mainly in the mill -- the Jewell Milling Company, as it was known -- which opened on the waterfront around 1853, in a building that was already two decades old. The structure survived until the 1920s, but by 2008, its foundations were all that remained, buried a foot and a half under the warehouse on the borough's Pier 1. 
 While most of the city's old waterfront industrial and commercial districts have faded, the past has a way of emerging in unexpected ways. In the spring, workers tore down the warehouse to build the park, and this fall, as wedding parties arrived at all hours to be photographed at the ferry landing and tourist crowds stood in lines outside Grimaldi's Pizzeria, they uncovered what was left of the mill. 
 As was reported in The Brooklyn Paper, a local weekly, the archaeologists cataloged the mill's remains as part of a state-mandated historical investigation. Then, to protect the uncovered foundations from the weather, they buried them again.
 Still, to anyone standing on the site in a stiff wind, with Lower Manhattan seeming close enough to touch, it was easy to picture the thriving industrial Brooklyn waterfront of the 19th century. In fact, said Alyssa Loorya, one of the archaeologists from the URS Corporation, which did the work, remains of all of the buildings that once stood there are still on the site, albeit a foot and a half below ground. 
 Though Ms. Loorya, a native of Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, has worked on archaeological digs all over the city, spending time along the waterfront, with a view that embraces Staten Island, Governors Island, Ellis Island, New Jersey and Manhattan, gave her a new appreciation for the topography that long ago made the twin port cities of New York and Brooklyn so special. 
 ''I know what the map looks like; I've been up and down Manhattan and throughout Brooklyn and even over to New Jersey,'' she said. ''But you really see where it all comes together in the harbor here. You can see why this area was so important. It really was the gateway to the New World, in some way.''
 The dig, which focused on parts of Pier 1 and Pier 6, also explored the buried remains of a ferry terminal at the foot of Atlantic Avenue near Furman Street. There are reports, Ms. Loorya said, that a Revolutionary War-era British battleship was sunk, intact, and used as landfill near the foot of Joralemon Street.
 For now, the artifacts from the site are of a smaller sort: bricks, bits of tile and ornamental plaster, and bottles in varied sizes and hues, among them a little blue vial that once held medicine, another bearing the name of a Dr. J. T. Poock of Hoboken, N.J., and two small brown liquor bottles. The stash also included beer bottles: one from Anheuser-Busch -- though bottled in Brooklyn -- and another from the borough's own India Wharf Brewing Company.
 Why beer and liquor bottles amid the foundations of a flour mill? ''Why not?'' Ms. Loorya said with a small smile.

HEADLINE: Should Congress Limit Executive Pay?

BYLINE: By ROBERT H. FRANK. 
Robert H. Frank, an economist at Cornell, is a visiting faculty member at the Stern School of Business at New York University.

 BODY:
IT'S no wonder that voters' outrage over exorbitant executive pay is mounting. After all, the government just had to bail out financial firms that paid big bonuses last year to many of the same executives who helped precipitate the current financial crisis. 
 Nor is it any wonder that Congress is considering measures to limit executive pay -- not just in the financial industry, but economywide. So far, the only formal legislative proposal is ''say on pay,'' which would require a nonbinding shareholder vote on executive pay proposals. But critics complain that this would have little impact and are hungry for stronger measures. 
 One popular proposal would cap the chief executive's pay at each company at 20 times its average worker's salary. But while Congress may well have compelling reasons to limit executive pay in companies seeking bailout money, voter anger is not a good reason to extend pay caps more generally. 
 To be sure, executive pay in the United States is vastly higher than necessary. Executives in other countries, whose pay is often less than one-fifth that of their American counterparts, seem to work just as hard and perform just as well. The same was true of American executives in the 1980s. 
 So why not limit executive pay? The problem is that although every company wants a talented chief executive, there are only so many to go around. Relative salaries guide job choices. If salaries were capped at, say, $2 million annually, the most talented candidates would have less reason to seek the positions that make best use of their talents.
 More troubling, if C.E.O. pay were capped and pay for other jobs was not, the most talented potential managers would be more likely to become lawyers or hedge fund operators. Can anyone think that would be a good thing? 
 In large companies, even small differences in managerial talent can make an enormous difference. Consider a company with $10 billion in annual earnings that has narrowed its C.E.O. search to two finalists. If one would make just a handful of better decisions each year than the other, the company's annual earnings might easily be 3 percent -- or $30 million -- higher under the better candidate's leadership. That same candidate couldn't possibly make as much difference at a company with only $10 million in earnings.
 That's why companies where executive decisions have the greatest impact tend to outbid others in hiring the ablest managers. 
 Critics complain that executive labor markets are not really competitive -- that chief executives appoint friends to their boards who approve unjustifiably large pay packages. But C.E.O.'s have always appointed friends, so that can't explain recent trends. 
 One reason for these trends is that companies themselves have become bigger. As the New York University economists Xavier Gabaix and Augustin Landier argue in a 2006 paper, C.E.O. pay in a competitive market should vary in direct proportion to the market capitalization of the company. They found that C.E.O. compensation at large companies grew sixfold between 1980 and 2003, the same as the market-cap growth of these businesses. 
 Beyond growth in company size, executive mobility has also increased. In past decades, about the only way to become a C.E.O. was to have spent one's entire career with the company. With only a handful of plausible internal candidates, pay was essentially a matter of bilateral negotiation between the board and the chosen. Increasingly, however, hiring committees believe that a talented executive from one industry can also deliver top performance in another. 
 A celebrated case in point was Louis V. Gerstner Jr. Having produced record earnings at RJR Nabisco, he was hired by I.B.M., where he led the computer giant, then struggling, to a dramatic turnaround in the 1990s. 
 This new spot market for talent has affected executive salaries in much the same way that free agency affected the salaries of professional athletes.
 If the market for executive talent is competitive, critics ask, why are C.E.O.'s in an industry paid about the same, regardless of performance? That's because no one knows with certainty how a particular executive will perform. But most hiring decisions are based on well-researched predictions, and always with hope for success. Executives whose record predicts good performance command a high rate. Their leash, however, has grown shorter.
 In the past, a C.E.O. could often stay in the job for many years despite lackluster performance. Today, a C.E.O. who fails to deliver is often dismissed after a year or two.
 In short, evidence suggests that the link between pay and performance is tighter than proponents of pay caps seem to think. Since the fall of the former Soviet Union, no one has seriously challenged the wisdom of relegating a high proportion of society's most important tasks to private markets. And the market-determined salary of a job generally offers the best -- if imperfect -- measure of its importance. 
 THE financial industry, however, may be an exception. A money manager's pay depends primarily on the amount of money managed, which in turn depends on the fund's rate of return relative to other funds. This provides strong incentives to invest in highly leveraged risky assets, which yield higher average returns. But as recent events have shown, these complex assets also expose the rest of us to considerable systemic risk.
 On balance, then, the high pay that lures talent to the financial industry may actually cause harm. So if Congress wants to cap executive pay in financial institutions receiving bailout money, well and good.
 Elsewhere, however, the more prudent response to runaway salaries at the top is to raise marginal tax rates on the highest earners, irrespective of occupation. Again, relative salaries drive job choices. The jobs with the highest pretax salaries will still offer the highest post-tax salaries, just as before, so this step will not compromise the price signals that steer talented performers to the most important jobs. 
 In answering voter outrage about executive pay, Congress should recall the words of Marcus Aurelius: ''How much more grievous are the consequences of anger than the causes of it.''

BYLINE: By REBECCA SKLOOT. 
Rebecca Skloot teaches nonfiction at the University of Memphis. Her first book, ''The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks,'' will be published by Crown in spring 2010.

 BODY:
 ON HALLOWEEN NIGHT IN A SUBURB of Albany, a group of children dressed as vampires and witches ran past a middle-aged woman in plain clothes. She gripped a leather harness -- like the kind used for Seeing Eye dogs -- which was attached to a small, fuzzy black-and-white horse barely tall enough to reach the woman's hip. 
 ''Cool costume,'' one of the kids said, nodding toward her. 
 But she wasn't dressed up. The woman, Ann Edie, was simply blind and out for an evening walk with Panda, her guide miniature horse. 
 There are no sidewalks in Edie's neighborhood, so Panda led her along the street's edge, maneuvering around drainage ditches, mailboxes and bags of raked leaves. At one point, Panda paused, waited for a car to pass, then veered into the road to avoid a group of children running toward them swinging glow sticks. She led Edie onto a lawn so she wouldn't hit her head on the side mirror of a parked van, then to a traffic pole at a busy intersection, where she stopped and tapped her hoof. ''Find the button,'' Edie said. Panda raised her head inches from the pole so Edie could run her hand along Panda's nose to find and press the ''walk'' signal button.
 Edie isn't the only blind person who uses a guide horse instead of a dog -- there's actually a Guide Horse Foundation that's been around nearly a decade. The obvious question is, Why? In fact, Edie says, there are many reasons: miniature horses are mild-mannered, trainable and less threatening than large dogs. They're naturally cautious and have exceptional vision, with eyes set far apart for nearly 360-degree range. Plus, they're herd animals, so they instinctively synchronize their movements with others. But the biggest reason is age: miniature horses can live and work for more than 30 years. In that time, a blind person typically goes through five to seven guide dogs. That can be draining both emotionally and economically, because each one can cost up to $60,000 to breed, train and place in a home.
 ''Panda is almost 8 years old,'' her trainer, Alexandra Kurland, told me. ''If Panda were a dog, Ann would be thinking about retiring her soon and starting over, but their relationship is just getting started. They're still improving their communication and learning to read each other's bodies. It's the difference between dating for a few years and being married so long you can finish each other's sentences.''
 Edie has nothing against service dogs -- she has had several. One worked beautifully. Two didn't -- they dragged her across lawns chasing cats and squirrels, even pulled her into the street chasing dogs in passing cars. Edie doesn't worry about those sorts of things with Panda because miniature horses are less aggressive. Still, she says, ''I would never say to a blind person, 'Run out and get yourself a guide horse,' because there are definite limitations.'' They eat far more often than dogs, and go to the bathroom about every two or three hours. (Yes, Panda is house-trained.) Plus, they can't curl up in small places, which makes going to the movies or riding in airplanes a challenge. (When miniature horses fly, they stand in first class or bulkhead because they don't fit in standard coach.) 
 What's most striking about Edie and Panda is that after the initial shock of seeing a horse walk into a cafe, or ride in a car, watching them work together makes the idea of guide miniature horses seem utterly logical. Even normal. So normal, in fact, that people often find it hard to believe that the United States government is considering a proposal that would force Edie and many others like her to stop using their service animals. But that's precisely what's happening, because a growing number of people believe the world of service animals has gotten out of control: first it was guide dogs for the blind; now it's monkeys for quadriplegia and agoraphobia, guide miniature horses, a goat for muscular dystrophy, a parrot for psychosis and any number of animals for anxiety, including cats, ferrets, pigs, at least one iguana and a duck. They're all showing up in stores and in restaurants, which is perfectly legal because the Americans With Disabilities Act (A.D.A.) requires that service animals be allowed wherever their owners want to go. 
 Some people enjoy running into an occasional primate or farm animal while shopping. Many others don't. This has resulted in a growing debate over how to handle these animals, as well as widespread suspicion that people are abusing the law to get special privileges for their pets. Increasingly, business owners, landlords and city officials are challenging the legitimacy of noncanine service animals and refusing to accommodate them. Animal owners are responding with lawsuits and complaints to the Department of Justice. This August, the Arizona Game and Fish Department ordered a woman to get rid of her chimpanzee, claiming that she brought it into the state illegally -- she disputed this and sued for discrimination, arguing that it was a diabetes-assistance chimp trained to fetch sugar during hypoglycemic episodes.
 Cases like this are raising questions about where to draw the lines when it comes to the needs and rights of people who rely on these animals, of businesses obligated by law to accommodate them and of everyday civilians who -- because of health and safety concerns or just general discomfort -- don't want monkeys or ducks walking the aisles of their grocery stores. 
 A few months ago, in a cafe in St. Louis, I met a man named Jim Eggers, who uses an assistance parrot, Sadie, to help control his psychotic tendencies. Eggers looks like a man who has been fighting his whole life. He is muscular, with a buzz cut, several knocked-out teeth and many scars, including one that runs ear-to-chin from surgery to repair a broken jaw. Eggers avoids eye contact in public -- he walks fast down streets and through stores staring at the ground, jaw clenched. ''I have bipolar disorder with psychotic tendencies,'' he told me as he sucked down a green-apple smoothie. ''Homicidal feelings too.'' 
 Eggers's condition has landed him in court several times: a disturbing-the-peace charge for pouring scalding coffee onto a man under his apartment window who annoyed him; one-year probation for threatening to kill the archbishop of St. Louis because of news reports about church money and molestations by priests in other cities (which the archbishop had nothing to do with). In describing his condition, Eggers says it's like when the Incredible Hulk changes from man to monster. His vision blurs, his body tingles and he can barely hear. According to his friend Larry Gower, who often serves as a public liaison for him, in those moments, Eggers gets extremely loud. They both agree that Sadie is one of the few things keeping Eggers from snapping. 
 Sadie rides around town on Eggers's back in a bright purple backpack specially designed to hold her cage. When he gets upset, she talks him down, saying: ''It's O.K., Jim. Calm down, Jim. You're all right, Jim. I'm here, Jim.'' She somehow senses when he is getting agitated before he even knows it's happening. ''I still go off on people sometimes, but she makes sure it never escalates into a big problem,'' he told me, grinning bashfully at Sadie. ''Now when people make me mad I just give them the bird,'' he said, pulling up his sleeve and flexing his biceps, which is covered with a large tattoo of Sadie.
 Soon after what he calls ''the Archbishop Incident,'' Eggers got Sadie from a friend who owned a pet store. She'd been neglected by a previous owner and had torn out all her feathers, so Eggers nursed her back to health. He didn't initially train her as a service animal, he says; she did that herself. When Eggers had episodes at home, he'd pace, holding his head and yelling: ''It's O.K., Jim! You're all right, Jim! Calm down, Jim!'' One day, Sadie started doing it, too. He soon realized that she calmed him better than he calmed himself. So he started rewarding her each time it happened. And he has had only one incident since: he dented a woman's car with his fist on a day when he'd left Sadie at home.
 Eggers didn't think to use any special language to describe Sadie until he tried to take her on a bus and the driver said that only ''service animals'' were allowed. Eggers went home and looked up ''service animal'' online. ''That's when it all fell into place,'' he told me. He learned that psychiatric service animals help their owners cope with things like medication side effects. Eggers takes heavy doses of antipsychotics that leave him in a fog most of the day. So he trained Sadie to alert him with a loud ringing noise if someone calls, or to yell ''WHO'S THERE?'' when anyone knocks on the door. If the fire alarm goes off, Sadie goes off. If Eggers leaves the faucet running, Sadie makes sounds like a waterfall until he turns it off. 
 Eggers got a service-animal bus pass for Sadie and began taking her everywhere. (He has special insulated cage panels to keep her warm in winter.) For years, few people objected. Then, in the spring of 2007, Eggers went to have his teeth cleaned at the St. Louis Community College dental-hygiene school, and officials there told him that Sadie wasn't allowed inside because she posed a risk to public health and wasn't really a service animal. ''All I can say is, they were lucky I had Sadie with me to keep me calm when they said that,'' Eggers told me. 
 He filed a complaint with the United States Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights (O.C.R.), which initiated an investigation. Its conclusion: the school wrongfully denied access based on public-health concerns without assessing whether Sadie actually posed a risk. (Several top epidemiologists I interviewed for this article said that, on the whole, birds and miniature horses pose no more risk to human health than service dogs do.) 
 But Eggers is still fighting that fight. According to the O.C.R., the school ''exceeded the boundaries of a permissible inquiry'' by questioning Eggers about his disability. But that didn't change the school's conclusion: it labeled Sadie a mere ''therapy animal.'' If that label sticks, it will mean that Sadie isn't covered by the federal law that protects service animals and guarantees them access to public places.
 Stories like Eggers's involve two questions that are often mistakenly treated as one. The first: What qualifies as a service animal? The second: Can any species be eligible? 
 There are two categories of animals that help people. ''Therapy animals'' (also known as ''comfort animals'') have been used for decades in hospitals and homes for the elderly or disabled. Their job is essentially to be themselves -- to let humans pet and play with them, which calms people, lowers their blood pressure and makes them feel better. There are also therapy horses, which people ride to help with balance and muscle building.
 These animals are valuable, but they have no special legal rights because they aren't considered service animals, the second category, which the A.D.A. defines as ''any guide dog, signal dog or other animal individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, including, but not limited to, guiding individuals with impaired vision, alerting individuals with impaired hearing to intruders or sounds, providing minimal protection or rescue work, pulling a wheelchair or fetching dropped items.'' 
 Since the 1920s, when guide dogs first started working with blind World War I veterans, service animals have been trained to do everything from helping people balance on stairs to opening doors to calling 911. In the early '80s, small capuchin monkeys started helping quadriplegics with basic day-to-day functions like eating and drinking, and there was no question about whether they counted as service animals. Things got more complicated in the '90s, when ''psychiatric service animals'' started fetching pills and water, alerting owners to panic attacks and helping autistic children socialize.
 The line between therapy animals and psychiatric service animals has always been blurry, because it usually comes down to varying definitions of the words ''task'' and ''work'' and whether something like actively soothing a person qualifies. That line got blurrier in 2003, when the Department of Transportation revised its internal policies regarding service animals on airplanes. It issued a statement saying that in recent years, ''a wider variety of animals (e.g., cats, monkeys, etc.) have been individually trained to assist people with disabilities. Service animals also perform a much wider variety of functions than ever before.'' 
 To keep up with these changes, the D.O.T.'s new guidelines said, ''Animals that assist persons with disabilities by providing emotional support qualify as service animals.'' They also said that any species could qualify and that these animals didn't need special training, aside from basic obedience. The only thing required for a pet to fly with its owner instead of riding as cargo was documentation (like a letter from a doctor) saying the person needed emotional support from an animal. Legally speaking, the D.O.T.'s new policy applied only to airplanes -- the A.D.A.'s definition of service animal stayed the same. But for those looking online to find out whether they could take their animals into stores and restaurants, the D.O.T.'s definition looked like official law, and people started acting accordingly. 
 Soon, a trend emerged: people with no visible disabilities were bringing what a New York Times article called ''a veritable Noah's Ark of support animals'' into businesses, claiming that they were service animals. Business owners and their employees often couldn't distinguish the genuine from the bogus. To protect the disabled from intrusive questions about their medical histories, the A.D.A. makes it illegal to ask what disorder an animal helps with. You also can't ask for proof that a person is disabled or a demonstration of an animal's ''tasks.'' There is no certification process for service animals (though there are Web sites where anyone can buy an official-looking card that says they have a certified service animal, no documentation required). The only questions businesses can ask are ''Is that a trained service animal?'' and ''What task is it trained to do?''
 If the person answers yes to the first and claims that the animal is, say, trained to alert him or her to a specific condition (like a seizure), additional questioning could end in a lawsuit. And in many cases, according to Joan Esnayra, founder of the Psychiatric Service Dog Society, the outcome of those lawsuits depends largely on the words people use to describe their animals. ''If you say 'comfort,' 'need' or 'emotional support,' you're out the door,'' she says. ''If you talk about what your animal does in terms of 'tasks' and 'work,' then you stand a chance.''
 Case in point: When the dental school questioned Eggers about whether Sadie was a service animal, he said she kept him ''calm.'' If he had said that she alerts him to things like attacks and doorbells, his case might have been stronger. 
 According to Jennifer Mathis, an attorney at the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, ''A lot of times when people with legitimate service animals lose these cases, it has to do with the fact that they don't explain their service animals well.''
 Rather than risk a lawsuit, many business owners simply allow the animals, even if they doubt their legitimacy. Then they complain to the Department of Justice that the A.D.A. is too broad in its definition of ''service animal,'' and too restrictive of businesses trying to protect themselves from people who fake it. Which many people do. 
 In October, a man in Portland, Ore., took his dog on a bus, claiming that it was a service animal. While getting off the bus, the dog killed another dog that was riding as a ''comfort animal.'' (In Portland, comfort animals are allowed on public transportation.) A few days later, an editorial appeared in The Oregonian with the headline ''Take the Menagerie Off the Bus.'' It opened with: ''No offense, ferret lovers. Your pet may offer emotional support. But it shouldn't be roaming the aisles of a bus or train.'' It argued that the story of the dead comfort dog was proof that people had stretched the legal definition of service animals to include a virtual zoo of animals. 
 Lex Frieden, a professor of health-information science at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston and a former director of the National Council on Disability, sees the issue differently. ''People shouldn't be able to carry their pets on a plane or into a restaurant claiming they're service animals when they're not,'' he says. ''But that has nothing to do with what species a service animal is.'' The appropriate response in those situations isn't a species ban, he says, but rather strict punishments for people who pose as disabled. ''It's fraud,'' he points out, ''and it results in increased scrutiny of people with legitimate disabilities.''
 In June, in an effort to clarify the confusion surrounding service animals, the Department of Justice proposed new regulations to explicitly include psychiatric service and exclude comfort animals. This was part of a sweeping revision of the A.D.A. intended to increase protection and access for the disabled, which was widely applauded. But tucked into that proposal were a few lines that worry advocates and people with disabilities: the D.O.J. proposed limiting service animals to a ''dog or other common domestic animal,'' specifically excluding ''wild animals (including nonhuman primates born in captivity), reptiles, rabbits, farm animals (including any breed of horse, miniature horse, pony, pig or goat), ferrets, amphibians and rodents.'' 
 This summer, the D.O.J. held a public hearing in Washington and invited anyone who would be affected by the proposed changes to argue for or against them. Many pleaded their cases in person, others by letter. The arguments in favor of species restrictions came primarily from businesses concerned about having to alter facilities, rebuilding seating areas, say, to make room for miniature horses. Several service-animal organizations and people with disabilities argued that banning reptiles and insects was fine but that excluding miniature horses and primates simply went too far. In their defense, they cited things like dog allergies, the long life spans of several species and monkeys' opposable thumbs. After considering the arguments, last month the D.O.J. submitted a final proposal to the Office of Management and Budget. Until there's a ruling, neither office will comment on the issue or say whether the species restriction was removed or revised after the public hearings. 
 Jamie Hais, a spokeswoman for the D.O.J., said she couldn't comment on why the department suggested the species restriction. But its proposal expressed concerns about public-health risks and said that when the original A.D.A. was written, without specifying species, ''few anticipated'' the variety of animals people would attempt to use.
 ''That's simply not true,'' says Frieden, who was an architect of the original A.D.A. While drafting the regulations, he said, Congressional staff members had long discussions about defining ''service animal'' and whether a trained pony could qualify. ''There was general consensus that the issue revolved around the question of function, not form,'' he says. ''So, in fact, if that pony provided assistance to a person with a disability and enabled that person to pursue equal opportunity and nondiscrimination, then that pony could be regarded as a service animal.'' They discussed the possibility of birds and snakes for psychiatric disorders, he said, but one of their biggest concerns was that the A.D.A. shouldn't exclude service monkeys, which were already working with quadriplegics. Since then, however, monkeys have become the most contested assistance-animal species of all. 
 On a rainy day in November, I walked through a T. J. Maxx store in Springfield, Mo., with Debby Rose and Richard, her 25-pound bonnet macaque monkey -- one of the most controversial service animals working today. Rose was wearing brown pants and a brown-and-gold-patterned shirt. Richard was wearing a brown long-sleeved polo over a white T-shirt with jeans and a tan vest that said ''Please Don't Pet Me I'm Working.'' Richard stood in the child seat of Rose's shopping cart, facing forward, bouncing up and down, smacking his lips and grinning as Rose pushed him down the aisles.
 Richard is a hands-on shopper. If Rose pointed at a sweater or purse she liked, or a pair of shoes, his hand darted out to touch them. As we passed a pair of tan, fuzzy winter boots that Rose particularly liked, Richard leaned out of the cart and quickly licked one on its toe.
 People stared as we walked. ''Why do you have him?'' they'd ask.
 ''He's a service animal trained for my disability, kind of like a seizure-alert dog,'' Rose told them, again and again.
 ''Can I pet him?'' 
 ''He doesn't like to be touched,'' she'd say, ''but you can give him five.''
 People raised their hands, and Richard gave them five.
 That Rose isn't bothered by people looking and asking questions is impressive, considering that she has agoraphobia and severe anxiety disorder with debilitating panic attacks. Until getting Richard four years ago, she required heavy doses of anti-anxiety drugs just to go out in public. ''I couldn't have come in this store before Richard, let alone handled all these people talking to me,'' she said. ''Now I like it.''
 Rose adopted Richard in 2004; he was badly neglected and near death. She and two of her six children -- whom she raised as a single mother -- run an exotic-animal shelter. Rose says she believes that Richard was trained as a service animal for his previous owner, an elderly woman whose son gave Richard away when she died. He had been neutered, and his tail had been surgically removed. He'd also had his large and potentially dangerous canine teeth pulled, a procedure commonly done with service monkeys for safety (and often cited as one of several ethical concerns with using wild instead of domesticated species for such jobs).
 As Richard returned to health, Rose realized that he had begun to recognize her panic attacks before she did. Her doctor suggested that she train him to help with her disorder, then wrote a letter approving of him as a service animal, saying that Richard was ''a constructive way to avoid use of unnecessary medications.'' Rose took that letter to the Springfield-Greene County Health Department, got permission for Richard to accompany her in public and has been drug-free ever since. She ordered a service-animal ID certificate online; she even got a restriction on her driver's license saying that she can't operate a car without a monkey present. Now he sits in her lap with a hand on the wheel while she drives, and she never leaves home without him.
 But the number of places Rose and Richard can go is decreasing. In September 2006, after receiving complaints that Richard was sitting in highchairs in restaurants, touching silverware and going through a buffet line with Rose, the Health Department sent a letter to all local restaurants announcing that Richard was a risk to public health and not a legitimate service animal. It instructed businesses to refuse him access and to call the police if Rose protested. Businesses posted the letter on their doors and in their bathrooms; soon Cox College of Nursing and Health Sciences, where Rose was attending nursing school, refused Richard access, too. Stories started appearing about Rose and her monkey in the newspaper and on TV. ''Suddenly,'' she told me, ''everyone knew I had a mental disorder.''
 Rose dropped out of school and filed a lawsuit against her local Health Department, the nursing school, Wal-Mart and several other local businesses that had forbidden Richard access, saying that they violated the A.D.A. Kevin Gipson, director of the local Health Department, told me that he had asked Rose to show him what ''tasks'' Richard performed that would qualify him. ''She couldn't,'' he said. 
 Defining ''task'' is often a point of contention in these cases, especially with psychiatric service animals, whose work generally can't be demonstrated on command. Before going to T. J. Maxx, I saw Rose begin to panic while sitting in her lawyer's office talking about her case. Her face flushed; her voice quivered. Richard, who had been dozing in the chair beside her, leapt onto her arm and began stroking her hair. He hugged her, rubbed her ear and cooed while she talked. She immediately calmed down. ''He snaps me out of it before the attacks happen,'' she said. ''If they start at night, he'll turn on the light and get me a bottle of water.''
 For Gipson, that's really beside the point. ''Even if Richard is a legitimate service animal,'' he told me, ''if he poses a public-health risk, the A.D.A. says he can be excluded. And we believe primates pose a significant health risk.'' 
 Rose says that Richard is perfectly safe and immaculately clean. She showers and blow-dries him every day and uses hand sanitizer on him regularly, and he always wears diapers. But that doesn't impress the Health Department. Monkeys can carry viruses, like herpes B, which are essentially harmless to them but usually deadly to humans. Those viruses can be transmitted through saliva and other bodily fluids. In 1998, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a study titled ''B-Viruses From Pet Macaque Monkeys: An Emerging Threat in the United States?'' saying that 80 to 90 percent of adult macaques like Richard carry herpes B. It's possible to test them for viruses, which Rose does every year with Richard, but those tests often give false negatives. Plus, Gipson told me, ''he could catch it any time from contact with other monkeys, which we know he's had.'' Five days before the Health Department banned Richard, a local newspaper ran pictures of him and several other monkeys hanging out at Rose's family's sanctuary.
 According to Frederick Murphy, former head of viral pathology for the C.D.C. and co-discoverer of the Ebola virus, the threat that viruses from service monkeys present to humans is essentially unknown. There have been a few cases of primate-lab workers contracting herpes B from macaques -- mostly from being bitten -- but no cases of people being infected by service monkeys, which are usually capuchins.
 The bigger concern, according to several experts, is potential aggression. ''People think monkeys are cute and like humans, but they're not,'' says Laura Kahn, a public-health expert at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton. ''They're wild animals, and they're dangerous.''
 Critics of noncanine service animals tend to focus on disease perhaps because that's the only way to legally exclude any service animal under the current A.D.A. But on the whole, Bradford Smith, former director of the University of California Davis Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital, says, ''I would tend to think the disease argument is really a proxy for other concerns, like having to let any person who says their parrot or horse is a service animal enter into public areas.'' 
 Rose's case is sometimes held up as an example of why the A.D.A. should be rewritten to exclude primates as service animals. But in fact, Frieden says, it's an example of how the original A.D.A. works well as it was written, since it allows broad use of service animals while still leaving room to protect the public health. ''Some situations have to be dealt with on a case-by-base basis,'' he says. ''You can't legislate fine lines -- that's just not a functional law.'' 
 Frieden is very clear about his belief that it would be a huge loss if concerns about specific cases jeopardized the use of all noncanine service animals, especially the capuchin monkeys trained to help quadriplegics. The capuchins attend ''monkey college'' at Helping Hands, a nonprofit organization in Boston, where they fetch remote controls, put food in microwaves, open containers, vacuum floors and flip light switches, all in exchange for treats. Helping Hands capuchins are captive bred, which minimizes the risk of picking up diseases, and they're provided specifically for in-home use. The proposed species restriction might make it impossible for people to transport capuchins or keep them in their homes because of zoning restrictions. The thought of this makes Helping Hands's founder, M. J. Willard, shudder. ''There ought to be a more nuanced way if somebody just thinks it through,'' she says. ''Even just minor requirements of verifying the legitimacy of a service animal would solve a lot of the current problem.''
 Frieden agrees. He suggests that perhaps a national committee could be appointed to develop certification standards for all service animals as well as a formal process for preventing and punishing service-animal fraud. Doing so might solve part of the controversy, he says. But not all of it. Particularly when it comes to species questions. 
 ''Many people try to make this issue black and white -- this service animal is good; that one is bad -- but that's not possible, because disability extends through an enormous realm of human behavior and anatomy and human condition,'' Frieden told me. In the end, according to him, the important thing to remember is this: ''The public used to be put off by the very sight of a person with a disability. That state of mind delayed productivity and caused irreparable harm to many people for decades. We've now said, by law, that regardless of their disability, people must have equal opportunity, and we can't discriminate. In order to seek the opportunities and benefits they have as citizens, if a person needs a cane, they should be able to use one. If they need a wheelchair, a dog, a miniature horse or any other device or animal, society has to accept that, because those things are, in fact, part of that person.''

HEADLINE: Care for An Absinthe? Ptooey!

BYLINE: By ERIC KONIGSBERG

 BODY:
THERE are a number of bars in New York City these days that make cocktails with absinthe, mixing it with rum or tequila or gin to, um, complement the taste. A significant portion of them are on the Lower East Side and are the kind of bars that don't have a sign or a listed phone number -- although, once inside, you may well find yourself in the exclusive company of a bunch of drunk account executives.
 That was certainly the case the other night at Apotheke, a bar in Chinatown where the bartenders wear lab coats and mix drinks in giant laboratory beakers. Once an hour, the owner, an earnest Austrian mixologist named Albert Trummer, stands at the bar and makes flaming absinthe shots while the sound system plays ''Abracadabra'' by the Steve Miller Band. 
 Not so long ago, this clear-green liquor long associated with the French Impressionist movement was available only on the black market -- outlawed, it was said, after having caused hallucinations and violent behavior. This was attributed to a mysterious and mystical chemical called thujone present in one of the ingredients used to make it (a mysterious and mystical herb called wormwood). 
 ''Before it was legal, I smuggled two bottles of homemade absinthe from the Jura Mountains into my suitcase and kept them under the bar for special customers,'' said Jean-Michel Bergougnoux, the chef and proprietor of L'Absinthe, a French restaurant on the Upper East Side. ''We would get calls sometimes from young people: 'Do you have absinthe?' They were looking for something maybe little bit dangerous, something with the romantic history. Balzac, Apollinaire, Zola -- it was their fuel.''
 Now it is legal, and so we are in the midst of what appears to be an absinthe mini-craze. But to follow the arc of this craze, like others that have come before (remember cigar bars?) is to see just how quickly something that was once illicit -- and acquired notoriety because of that very illicitness -- can lose its sheen of mystery and become, well, rather uncool. Once the naughty aura of the forbidden fruit is removed, all that remains is a grasp at unearned sophistication.
 If absinthe were a band, it would be Interpol, third-hand piffle masquerading as transgressive pop culture. If absinthe were sneakers, it would be a pair of laceless Chuck Taylors designed by John Varvatos for Converse. If it were facial hair, it would be the soul patch. If absinthe were a finish on kitchen and bath fixtures, it would be brushed nickel.
 The absinthe available over the counter nowadays is neither dangerous -- in fact, it's debatable whether it ever was -- nor illegal (and whether it ever was is also unclear, but that, apparently, is a really long story). 
 In 2007, 95 years of prohibition ended, but instead of giving us Rimbaud and Baudelaire, modern-day absinthe has given newspaper editors the opportunity to assign articles on the drink's mysterious, romantic history -- drawn, perhaps to the opportunity it presented headline and caption writers for J.V.-level wordplay (''Absinthe of Malice,'' ''The Greening of America,'' ''Going Verte-ical'').
 And it has given us theme bars and happy-hour promotions, like ''l'heure verte,'' which the P.R. firm representing Mr. Bergougnoux's restaurant calls a ''resurrecting'' of ''a daily ritual in Montmartre during the late 1800s'' that involved absinthe drinkers ''talking about all of the happenings in the art world of the time.''
 You know a purported hallucinogen has peaked when it hires a publicist, even if she is a perfectly nice young woman named Alice who had to bail out early from an absinthe tasting one evening because her parents were taking her to get a new jacket at Patagonia. It probably doesn't do much for absinthe's street credibility, either, that L'Absinthe, a polished and perfectly highly-regarded French restaurant, is on 67th Street near Third Avenue, where the grooviest person in attendance on the night in question was Carl Bernstein.
 Mr. Bergougnoux, a perfectly charming fellow who grew up in the Auvergne region of France, said he named his restaurant after the liquor when he opened it in 1995 ''because I had some old posters of people drinking absinthe.'' He added: ''I put them on the walls.''
 Standing at the bar, Mr. Bergougnoux poured absinthe into four glasses, then arranged them beneath an auto-verseur, a small glass samovar that dispensed ice water. At extended intervals, the droplets fell into the glasses -- each of which was topped by a slotted silver spoon that held a lump of sugar. The water dissolved the sugar, and both of them served to dilute the drink. 
 ''And voila,'' Mr. Bergougnoux said. ''You wait. You can imagine the guys sitting around the table and talking politics, women. The whole thing is the community of the dripping.''
 ''It's a very good thing to have serious conversation over,'' said the restaurant's manager, Robert Thornton. Eventually, the absinthe was ready to drink, and several different brands were sampled. The first, Lucid, came in a dark bottle with cat's eyes on it and had what Mr. Bergougnoux called a ''classic absinthe taste.'' It tasted like licorice. 
 Remember: licorice jelly beans are always the last to go. 
 ''The distiller, he's been here,'' Mr. Thornton said. ''We have a video of him.''
 The second absinthe, Tourment Vert, was listed on the menu as containing the maximum legal amount of thujone. It tasted like mouthwash.
 ''It has a brighter flavor,'' Mr. Thornton said. ''It's more of a beginner's absinthe.''
 ''A little bit too licorice,'' Mr. Bergougnoux said.
 The third brand, St. George, was declared the favorite absinthe of Alice, who had quietly nursed the first two drinks. ''It's got the flavor without being like sambuca or whatever,'' she said. Mr. Bergougnoux raised his eyebrows at this assessment and shrugged slightly.
 As with rolling one's own cigarettes, say, or key parties, partaking of absinthe is built on preparation rituals and anticipation. 
 You could say that absinthe is a kindred spirit of so many falsely subversive things: ear piercing for men, tattoos on women, those cigar bars, pole-dancing-aerobics classes, mind erasers, blogging about one's bikini grooming, naming one's bong after a cartoon character.
 At the other end of the bar at L'Absinthe sat Gregory Boerum and Larry Wineland, two perfectly cool and likable men in their 30s who looked as if they had traveled from Williamsburg, or at least as if they didn't know Carl Bernstein. It turned out they had come uptown after work (Mr. Boerum is a graphic designer and Mr. Wineland produces sound effects for movies) just for the absinthe.
 ''I've been into it for 10 years,'' Mr. Boerum said. ''But this is the first time I've had it in a bar in the U.S. and have it be -- -- ''
 ''Legalized!'' Mr. Wineland said, finishing his thought. ''I started drinking it in college, at Bennington. A friend brought back a bottle from Spain. I'd heard rumors about van Gogh. I got really amazed, enchanted. There's this taste of deep, unusual herbs.''
 ''Wormwood, anise and fennel,'' Mr. Boerum said. ''The holy trinity.''
 They were true enthusiasts. They had met five years ago at the Louche Fest, an absinthe-themed gathering held ''at this great Victorian town house stuck in like, ghetto Allentown, Pa,'' Mr. Boerum said.
 ''It was lots of people who knew each other through the online absinthe community,'' he added. (Like Chuck Norris ephemera and role-play games, absinthe has a big Internet presence.) ''It wasn't all artists.''
 ''There were scientists, lots of home distillers,'' Mr. Wineland said. ''There was an amazing metalsmith who made this absinthe grille -- that's like the spoon -- shaped like an elephant. The ears extend over the rim of the glass and then the water drips down the elephant's trunk into the absinthe.''
 To everybody's credit, there was no mention of a pet name for the elephant.

HEADLINE: School Bells May Ring During Unemployment

BYLINE: By EILEEN ZIMMERMAN. 
E-mail: ccouch@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Q. You've been laid off and are having trouble finding another job. Should you consider applying to graduate school? 
 A. That depends on several things, including your industry, your long-term career goals and your financial situation.
 If a graduate degree makes sense generally for your career, this period of unemployment could be seen as a window of opportunity, said Jeffrey A. Heath, a managing director of the Landstone Group in Manhattan, an affiliate of the recruitment firm MRINetwork. 
 ''Let's say you've spent 10 years in finance and you want to stay in this career,'' Mr. Heath said. ''In a couple of years the market will be healthier and you will have your master's degree,'' he said.
 Being unemployed for a prolonged period can take a psychological toll, Mr. Heath said. ''People begin questioning their value, often for the first time in their lives. Knowing you're working toward something will make you feel better.''
 Graduate school can also be a way to reinvent yourself. If you have previously thought of going in another direction, now may be the time to do so, said Sean O'Neil, a principal of One to One Leadership, a recruiting and leadership training firm in Pelham, N.Y.
 You will need contacts in any new profession, and graduate programs can help connect you with alumni working in that field, said Eileen Kohan, executive director of the career planning and placement center at the University of Southern California.
 Regardless of your motivation, carefully consider your personal financial situation before making a decision. Graduate school isn't cheap. If your portfolio is down and cash reserves are short, it may not be a wise choice right now. Many students pay for their tuition with federal and private loans. Individual schools and certain organizations -- such as local bar associations, fraternities and sororities, social clubs and veterans groups -- may offer scholarships and grants based on merit, financial need or both.
 Ask yourself how much more marketable you will be after getting the degree. What do jobs in this industry pay for those with a master's degree? And is the industry growing or shrinking? ''You need to figure out what the return on your investment is going to be,'' Mr. O'Neil said. ''Before I did leadership training I got a master's in social work. That was a guaranteed negative return because it's a career that just doesn't pay well.'' 
 Q. If you want to move into a new field, how do you decide what to study?
 A. You may be want to explore the ''road not taken'' -- a career that previously appealed to you but that you never had a chance to pursue.
 Still, be realistic. Take a hard look at which areas in the economy are hiring and where the need for workers is growing, like science, health care and accounting, said Bernadette Kenny, chief career officer at Adecco Group North America, a human resources consulting firm.
 Join professional associations and do some research on their Web sites to learn about hiring trends and industry leaders, Ms. Kohan said. ''You don't want to go into another industry that is about to go belly up,'' she said.
 Q.Might some employers view going to graduate school as a way of ''hiding out'' during the recession?
 A. Because this recession is worse than any in recent memory, there is a common acceptance among employers that people are having a tough time finding jobs, especially in finance, said Mr. Heath, and graduate school most likely won't be seen as an escape hatch. 
 Still, the decision has to make sense for your larger career goals. ''The burden is going to be on you to prove to potential employers you didn't just do this because you lost your job,'' said Anna Ivey, president of the career counseling firm Ivey Consulting in Boston. ''Either a degree makes sense for you or it doesn't,'' she said. ''The only thing a layoff affects is your timing.'' 
 Q.Will you face stiff competition for admission because others who are unemployed are also heading back to school?
 A. Yes, because people often choose to ride out a recession in graduate school. All four previous United States recessions declared since 1980 have corresponded with an upswing in the number of Graduate Management Admissions Tests that are taken. The test is used to gain admission to M.B.A. programs.
 ''That's something applicants have going against them -- sheer volume -- which makes it much tougher to get in,'' Ms. Ivey said.
 Q. If you do decide to go back to school, should you attend full time, or on nights and weekends?
 A. Much depends on whether or not you can manage without a paycheck for two years. Attending part time takes longer, but gives you the flexibility to look for work during the day and take a new job, even a part-time one, Mr. Heath said. 
 For many graduate degrees, attending full time or part time doesn't affect how employers perceive the degree. But for some -- like an M.B.A. or a law degree -- full-time programs at top schools have a pedigree that is more attractive to employers. ''And daytime programs are where a school's career resource efforts and recruiting programs are focused,'' Mr. O'Neil said.

HEADLINE: On Feb. 18, Free TV Won't Be So Free

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''In Move to Digital TV, Confusion Is in the Air'' (Business Day, Dec. 22) doesn't discuss the economics of the transition. 
 My family enjoyed 20 channels of (free) antenna TV since buying our Ulster County home in 1989. We objected to a converter for the conversion to digital TV scheduled for Feb. 18, but we used the rebate. 
 A seemingly obvious problem resulted. While we could watch an analog broadcast with a little ''snow,'' in digital format there is either a signal or nothing. Too many channels became nothing, so we had to buy satellite.
 Did the Federal Communications Commission consider the economics of a forced switch, where many households must now buy a new TV, subscribe to cable or satellite, or go without? 
 Although we are firm advocates of going without, we do enjoy an occasional sports match or PBS show, so we knuckled under. 
 Did the F.C.C. legislate this digital switch knowing that more households would need to buy subscriptions? Did broadcasting corporations deceptively sell the F.C.C. on the ''benefits'' and the need to switch?
 Jeff Akins Highland, N.Y., Dec. 22, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Perhaps instead of accommodating the industry's demand that we upgrade to digital TV, many of us will give up in frustration and entertain ourselves the way our World War II-era forebears did -- with a good book, gathered around a piano or electronic keyboard, or with some board games. 
 Does the Federal Communications Commission really expect anyone who isn't techno-savvy to figure out how to set up his or her own converter box? 
 And should we get that far, how likely is it that we will be able to do what else needs to be done? For instance, you note: ''If they want an up-to-date electronic program guide, they will need to have the box rescan the channels regularly.''

HEADLINE: Mugabe Preparing to Install New Cabinet in Zimbabwe

BYLINE: By REUTERS

DATELINE: HARARE, Zimbabwe 

 BODY:
President Robert Mugabe has started preparations to form a new government in Zimbabwe over the objections of the opposition, firing a dozen ministers from his party to clear the way for a new cabinet, state news media reported Saturday. 
 The firing of nine ministers and three deputy ministers who lost their seats in March elections is the clearest sign yet that Mr. Mugabe may act on his threat to form a government without the opposition party, Movement for Democratic Change.
 Mr. Mugabe, the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai and Arthur Mutambara, who leads an opposition splinter faction, signed a power-sharing pact on Sept. 15, but efforts to carry out the deal have been delayed by a disagreement over cabinet posts.
 Under the deal, Mr. Mugabe would remain president and Mr. Tsvangirai would become prime minister. But the opposition says a new government cannot be formed because Mr. Mugabe allocated powerful ministries to his party, ZANU-PF, and relegated the opposition to a junior partner.
 Mr. Tsvangirai has turned down Mr. Mugabe's invitation to be sworn in, saying several outstanding issues remained.
 Mr. Mugabe's spokesman, George Charamba, told a state-owned newspaper, The Herald, that Mr. Mugabe had started forming a new government.
 ''What I can tell you is that President Mugabe has already started preparing an administration,'' Mr. Charamba said. ''He is taking steps towards an early realization of the formation of a new government as per the mandate given to him by all three parties to the dialogue.''
 Political analysts say a government without international support would be doomed and could worsen an economic meltdown and a humanitarian catastrophe, which includes a cholera outbreak that has killed more than 1,600 Zimbabweans.
 The United States says it will no longer support a unity government headed by Mr. Mugabe.
 Mr. Mugabe's party accuses Mr. Tsvangirai of taking instructions from London and Washington to sabotage the unity government, which Mr. Tsvangirai denies. The Herald said Mr. Mugabe met with Mr. Mutambara, leader of the splinter faction, last week to discuss forming a government. Mr. Mutambara has said he will not join a government without Mr. Tsvangirai.

HEADLINE: Let the Chips Fall ... Dec. 28-Jan. 3

 BODY:
THE NEWS Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois said he would appoint Roland W. Burris to fill the Senate seat vacated by Barack Obama.
 BEHIND THE NEWS After Governor Blagojevich was arrested Dec. 9 on federal corruption charges including trying to auction the seat for personal gain, Senate leaders said they would not seat anyone he chose. He seemed to dare them to carry out that threat when he named Mr. Burris, a former state attorney general who was the first black candidate to win statewide office in Illinois and who is regarded as an honest elder statesman. Legal experts disagreed on whether the Senate had valid grounds to exclude Mr. Burris. 
 THE NEWS Gazprom, the state-controlled Russian natural gas monopoly, cut off gas supplies to Ukraine.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Though a similar shutoff in 2006 was met with near hysteria when it caused a drop in gas pressure and spot shortages across Western Europe, this time the reaction was calm: Officials said gas bound for the West would flow without interruption, and Ukraine had enough gas stockpiled to get through the winter. This latest flare-up in the long-running tug of war between Russia and Ukraine over energy was touched off when Ukraine balked at Gazprom's demand for sharply higher prices, made necessary by the steep decline in Russia's oil earnings.
 THE NEWS To keep GMAC, the auto finance company, from collapsing, the Treasury injected $5 billion in fresh capital and loaned $1 billion more to General Motors so it could do the same, while bondholders agreed to swap $21.2 billion in debt for equity in the company.
 BEHIND THE NEWS GMAC's survival was seen as vital to saving G.M., whose dealers depend on GMAC to make car loans to their customers; it was threatened by the credit crisis and a troubled mortgage subsidiary. The new capital was needed to allow GMAC to convert itself into a bank and lower its borrowing costs. After the rescue, it announced that it would resume lending to people with less than spotless credit.
 THE NEWS The Parent Company, an Internet retailer of children's products, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection along with nine subsidiaries including eToys.
 BEHIND THE NEWS The downshifting economy has consumers holding down spending significantly, so a shakeout was expected after a weak holiday shopping season -- but analysts were looking for filings in January or February, not a mere four days after Christmas. Parent was the first well-known retailer to file after the holiday, but some big names didn't even make it that far, like Circuit City, Sharper Image, Mervyns, Linens 'n Things, Whitehall Jewelers and Steve & Barry's.
 THE NEWS President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed of Somalia resigned from office, saying he was unable to unite Somalia's feuding factions. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS Without a designated successor for the post, the embattled Somali transitional government must find someone to elevate within 30 days, a task likely to be bedeviled by the same fractiousness and disunity that Mr. Yusuf failed to overcome: a two-thirds vote of the Parliament is required. A cantankerous former warlord, Mr. Yusuf was seen by Western diplomats as more hindrance than help: he aroused ire by favoring his own clan and obstructed a power-sharing peace agreement with Islamist insurgents.

HEADLINE: Push for Gay Marriage Meets Election Concerns

BYLINE: By CAREN CHESLER

 BODY:
NEW JERSEY has never appeared so close to -- and yet so far from -- enacting gay marriage.
 Gov. Jon S. Corzine; Richard J. Codey, the State Senate president; and Joseph J. Roberts Jr., leader of the Democratic-controlled Assembly, have all recently stated publicly that gay marriage is an idea whose time has come. Echoing the sentiments of a state commission report released last month, some state officials said that civil unions -- the closest thing to marriage available to gay couples in the state -- were woefully inadequate and that the legalization of gay marriage in New Jersey was not a matter of ''if'' but ''when.''
 But with the governor and all 80 members of the Assembly up for re-election in November, most of the officials say the ''when'' may not be for some time. 
 The New Jersey Civil Union Review Commission, a 13-member panel convened to evaluate the impact of the state's 2006 civil union law, in its final report last month, called on the state to legalize same-sex marriage after finding that civil unions did not result in equal treatment. Likening the prohibition against gay couples marrying to the racial segregation laws imposed upon black Americans, the commission said hospitals were reluctant to recognize civil unions when it came to visitation rights, employers did not always extend health benefits to both partners, and the children of such unions were stigmatized.
 ''New Jersey stands the best shot of any U.S. state to be the first to enact 'marriage equality' through legislation rather than by court order,'' said Steven Goldstein, vice chairman of the commission and chairman of Garden State Equality, a gay rights organization. 
 Massachusetts and Connecticut are currently the only states that allow gay couples to marry, and in both instances the issue was decided by the courts rather than the legislatures. California was in that category until November, when gay marriage was overturned by voters.
 Mr. Goldstein says his organization has been lobbying to get a measure passed.
 ''We are very, very close,'' he said. ''Do I believe we have the votes yet? It depends on how you count them. Even under our very conservative vote counts, we're very close.'' 
 While the governor had asked state lawmakers to refrain from raising the issue during the presidential election, for fear that it would sidetrack voters, he is now encouraging lawmakers to seriously review the commission's report.
 ''While this administration is focused squarely on the economic crisis for the foreseeable future, it's clear that this issue of civil rights must be addressed sooner rather than later,'' Mr. Corzine said in a statement. 
 The governor promised to sign marriage-equality legislation when it reaches his desk. The question is whether state lawmakers will present him with the opportunity. ''Politics will play a role in whether it actually gets posted to a committee,'' said Assemblyman Reed Gusciora, a Democrat from Princeton and the deputy majority leader, who sponsored a gay marriage bill. ''With the Assembly up this November, there will be a lot of members unlikely to get involved with such a polarizing issue.''
 Opponents of gay marriage have pledged to make it an issue in the 2009 election. Len Deo, president of the New Jersey Family Policy Council, said his organization believed that some New Jerseyans might support same-sex marriage but that a majority do not want to see marriage redefined in the process. 
 Some veteran political strategists say lawmakers are reluctant to have voters think they have taken their eyes off the state's grave fiscal situation. With residents losing jobs and facing foreclosure and the prospect of higher property taxes, they do not want to appear sidetracked. 
 ''There could be a backlash,'' said Harold Hodes, a Democratic strategist. ''There are other issues that are more pressing at this time.''

HEADLINE: A Budding Revival in the Land of Obama's Roots

BYLINE: By JONATHAN VATNER

 BODY:
THE election of Barack Obama signaled more than a milestone in American politics. It also reverberated across the ocean, where the beleaguered tourism industry of Kenya is hoping that Obamamania will result in a resurgence of visitors to the ancestral homeland of the president-elect.
 And there could be no better time for that wave of visitors to come, as Kenya's own presidential election in December 2007 was accompanied by an outbreak of violence, including widespread killing, that brought tourism in the country close to a halt. On top of that, the State Department (www.travel.state.gov) continues to warn potential travelers about the risks of violence by criminals and terrorists in Kenya. 
 Now, the Kenyan government is predicting that Kogelo, the small farming village near Lake Victoria where Mr. Obama's father lived and where his step-grandmother, Mama Sarah, still resides, will draw Americans looking to trace Mr. Obama's roots and seeking a gateway to western Kenya. 
 In preparation, the government is literally paving the way for visitors to reach it. Already, the road to Kogelo is done, the airport in nearby Kisumu is being expanded, and a museum telling the story of the Obama heritage is under construction and set to open late this year. A delegation from the Kenya Ministry of Tourism traveled to Kogelo after Mr. Obama's victory to see if the infrastructure there could support a hotel, and the minister of tourism will attend the Inauguration on Jan. 20 to promote business. Delta Air Lines will begin four weekly flights from Atlanta to Nairobi in June. 
 In expectation of a surge of travelers -- perhaps including some of the thousands who read ''Dreams From My Father,'' Mr. Obama's 1995 memoir, in which Kogelo plays an important role -- several outfitters are devising itineraries around the village. Mutua Kivuitu, director of Intrepid Travel's Kenya division, knew the time was right to plan a tour when he visited Mama Sarah's home and flipped through the guestbook. ''You can see that quite a bit of visitors from all over the world came to see the house,'' he said.
 Intrepid Travel (www.intrepidtravel.com), based in Melbourne, Australia, has planned an eight-day Roots of Obama tour, which will traverse the popular game parks of Lake Nakuru and Masai Mara but will also include two nights in Kisumu and the intervening day in Kogelo. Once there, visitors will meet Kobilo Roy Obilo, one of Mr. Obama's many cousins (a claim so common that cars now sport bumper stickers with statements like ''Obama, first cousin''), who will show them the town center and a school named after the president-elect and will take them into Mama Sarah's home. Some visitors might even meet her. (Prices start at $2,750 a person, excluding airfare.)
 Mr. Kivuitu believes many itineraries will begin in Kisumu and head west, opening up regions of Kenya heretofore untouched by tourism.
 Somak Safaris (www.somaksafaris.com) of Brea, Calif., now offers two trips that spend a day in Kogelo. Travelers from Britain will spend the night in a tented camp that Somak will complete in April; those coming from the United States will stay in a Kisumu hotel. Prices start at $4,780 a person, including airfare, for an 11-day safari.
 BUT some tour operators question whether a small, nondescript village will be enough to draw visitors. 
 ''Our position is that you're going to Kenya to see the wildlife and to meet the people, and the trip to Kogelo would be anticlimactic,'' said Dennis Pinto, managing director of Micato Safaris (www.micato.com) in New York City. ''It's relatively difficult to get there. You'd have to fly to Kisumu, which is not terribly close to anything, and then you have to drive 40 miles just to see a village.'' For that reason, Micato is not planning to offer an Obama trip in 2009.
 Likewise, no formal Obama itinerary has been developed by Fairmont Hotels & Resorts (www.fairmont.com), based in Toronto, which manages three properties in Kenya, none particularly close to Kogelo. ''There's not a lot of attractions you're going to get to at the destination,'' said Sean Billing, managing director of Fairmont in East Africa. ''Going to see Mama Sarah's house is not going to be the kind of attraction that pulls people there. The expense associated with that would far outweigh the value.''
 Mr. Kivuitu of Intrepid Travel agrees that Kogelo only contains enough of a story for a day trip. ''There's not a lot apart from the home, the town and the school,'' he said. ''It's just a quiet town.''
 Other tour operators will offer Kogelo as a side trip upon request. For example, the luxury outfitter Abercrombie & Kent (www.abercrombiekent.com) of Downers Grove, Ill., will add it as an optional day trip by helicopter from Lake Nakuru nearby for $7,410 a person, based on two people traveling together.
 Kensington Tours (www.kensingtontours.com), a company based in Wilmington, Del., that devises private safaris, is happy to take guests to Kisumu and Kogelo as an extension to, say, a 10-day, $3,410 trip to Masai Mara for an additional $553 a person. The company had originally planned to promote its own Kogelo itinerary, but the influx of expected demand for the new destination has not materialized.
 ''No one has actually mentioned Obama when booking a Kenya safari,'' said Gabrielle Nijdam, senior East Africa consultant for Kensington. ''They care more about getting a less expensive tour than they do about Obama.''
 But whether or not people will flock to Kogelo in 2009, tour operators are still hopeful that Mr. Obama's election and the publicity surrounding his father's hometown will bring back the tourists who have disappeared since the violence of early 2008. 
 To some extent, that has begun to happen. In October, the most recent month for which the Kenya Tourist Board has tabulated statistics, American travel to Kenya was down only 6.4 percent from the same month in 2007. In the first quarter of 2008, when the violence occurred, travel was down over 43 percent. Calls to the reservation line at Micato increased 12 percent in November over November 2007, and Web traffic spiked 17 percent. There was so much interest in Kenya at the Luxury Travel Expo in Las Vegas last month that Micato ran out of brochures. ''Given the prevailing economic conditions,'' said Mr. Pinto of Micato, ''we can only attribute this to the Obama factor.''
 For the Fairmont hotels in Kenya, although interest from travel agents and tour operators increased in the final months of 2008, bookings for the year were still down about 22 percent from 2007. ''It's very difficult to gauge whether there's been an uptick or whether that's a bit of wishful thinking,'' Mr. Billing said. ''But Obama's win gave us an additional story to tell.''
 Mr. Kivuitu remains optimistic about the appeal of Mr. Obama's past. ''We have yet to feel it,'' he said, ''but we believe it is coming.''

 'The story that I have to tell is marked all the way through by a persistent tension between those who assert that the best decisions are based on quantification and numbers, determined by the patterns of the past, and those who base their decisions on more subjective degrees of belief about the uncertain future. This is a controversy that has never been resolved.'
 -- FROM THE INTRODUCTION TO ''AGAINST THE GODS: THE REMARKABLE STORY OF RISK,'' BY PETER L. BERNSTEIN 
 THERE AREN'T MANY widely told anecdotes about the current financial crisis, at least not yet, but there's one that made the rounds in 2007, back when the big investment banks were first starting to write down billions of dollars in mortgage-backed derivatives and other so-called toxic securities. This was well before Bear Stearns collapsed, before Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were taken over by the federal government, before Lehman fell and Merrill Lynch was sold and A.I.G. saved, before the $700 billion bailout bill was rushed into law. Before, that is, it became obvious that the risks taken by the largest banks and investment firms in the United States -- and, indeed, in much of the Western world -- were so excessive and foolhardy that they threatened to bring down the financial system itself. On the contrary: this was back when the major investment firms were still assuring investors that all was well, these little speed bumps notwithstanding -- assurances based, in part, on their fantastically complex mathematical models for measuring the risk in their various portfolios. 
 There are many such models, but by far the most widely used is called VaR -- Value at Risk. Built around statistical ideas and probability theories that have been around for centuries, VaR was developed and popularized in the early 1990s by a handful of scientists and mathematicians -- ''quants,'' they're called in the business -- who went to work for JPMorgan. VaR's great appeal, and its great selling point to people who do not happen to be quants, is that it expresses risk as a single number, a dollar figure, no less. 
 VaR isn't one model but rather a group of related models that share a mathematical framework. In its most common form, it measures the boundaries of risk in a portfolio over short durations, assuming a ''normal'' market. For instance, if you have $50 million of weekly VaR, that means that over the course of the next week, there is a 99 percent chance that your portfolio won't lose more than $50 million. That portfolio could consist of equities, bonds, derivatives or all of the above; one reason VaR became so popular is that it is the only commonly used risk measure that can be applied to just about any asset class. And it takes into account a head-spinning variety of variables, including diversification, leverage and volatility, that make up the kind of market risk that traders and firms face every day. 
 Another reason VaR is so appealing is that it can measure both individual risks -- the amount of risk contained in a single trader's portfolio, for instance -- and firmwide risk, which it does by combining the VaRs of a given firm's trading desks and coming up with a net number. Top executives usually know their firm's daily VaR within minutes of the market's close. 
 Risk managers use VaR to quantify their firm's risk positions to their board. In the late 1990s, as the use of derivatives was exploding, the Securities and Exchange Commission ruled that firms had to include a quantitative disclosure of market risks in their financial statements for the convenience of investors, and VaR became the main tool for doing so. Around the same time, an important international rule-making body, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, went even further to validate VaR by saying that firms and banks could rely on their own internal VaR calculations to set their capital requirements. So long as their VaR was reasonably low, the amount of money they had to set aside to cover risks that might go bad could also be low.
 Given the calamity that has since occurred, there has been a great deal of talk, even in quant circles, that this widespread institutional reliance on VaR was a terrible mistake. At the very least, the risks that VaR measured did not include the biggest risk of all: the possibility of a financial meltdown. ''Risk modeling didn't help as much as it should have,'' says Aaron Brown, a former risk manager at Morgan Stanley who now works at AQR, a big quant-oriented hedge fund. A risk consultant named Marc Groz says, ''VaR is a very limited tool.'' David Einhorn, who founded Greenlight Capital, a prominent hedge fund, wrote not long ago that VaR was ''relatively useless as a risk-management tool and potentially catastrophic when its use creates a false sense of security among senior managers and watchdogs. This is like an air bag that works all the time, except when you have a car accident.'' Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the best-selling author of ''The Black Swan,'' has crusaded against VaR for more than a decade. He calls it, flatly, ''a fraud.'' 
 How then do we account for that story that made the rounds in the summer of 2007? It concerns Goldman Sachs, the one Wall Street firm that was not, at that time, taking a hit for billions of dollars of suddenly devalued mortgage-backed securities. Reporters wanted to understand how Goldman had somehow sidestepped the disaster that had befallen everyone else. What they discovered was that in December 2006, Goldman's various indicators, including VaR and other risk models, began suggesting that something was wrong. Not hugely wrong, mind you, but wrong enough to warrant a closer look.
 ''We look at the P.& L. of our businesses every day,'' said Goldman Sachs' chief financial officer, David Viniar, when I went to see him recently to hear the story for myself. (P.& L. stands for profit and loss.) ''We have lots of models here that are important, but none are more important than the P.& L., and we check every day to make sure our P.& L. is consistent with where our risk models say it should be. In December our mortgage business lost money for 10 days in a row. It wasn't a lot of money, but by the 10th day we thought that we should sit down and talk about it.''
 So Goldman called a meeting of about 15 people, including several risk managers and the senior people on the various trading desks. They examined a thick report that included every trading position the firm held. For the next three hours, they pored over everything. They examined their VaR numbers and their other risk models. They talked about how the mortgage-backed securities market ''felt.'' ''Our guys said that it felt like it was going to get worse before it got better,'' Viniar recalled. ''So we made a decision: let's get closer to home.''
 In trading parlance, ''getting closer to home'' means reining in the risk, which in this case meant either getting rid of the mortgage-backed securities or hedging the positions so that if they declined in value, the hedges would counteract the loss with an equivalent gain. Goldman did both. And that's why, back in the summer of 2007, Goldman Sachs avoided the pain that was being suffered by Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers and the rest of Wall Street.
 The story was told and retold in the business pages. But what did it mean, exactly? The question was always left hanging. Was it an example of the futility of risk modeling or its utility? Did it show that risk models, properly understood, were not a fraud after all but a potentially important signal that trouble was brewing? Or did it suggest instead that a handful of human beings at Goldman Sachs acted wisely by putting their models aside and making ''decisions on more subjective degrees of belief about an uncertain future,'' as Peter L. Bernstein put it in ''Against the Gods?''
 To put it in blunter terms, could VaR and the other risk models Wall Street relies on have helped prevent the financial crisis if only Wall Street paid better attention to them? Or did Wall Street's reliance on them help lead us into the abyss?
 One Saturday a few months ago, Taleb, a trim, impeccably dressed, middle-aged man -- inexplicably, he won't give his age -- walked into a lobby in the Columbia Business School and headed for a classroom to give a guest lecture. Until that moment, the lobby was filled with students chatting and eating a quick lunch before the afternoon session began, but as soon as they saw Taleb, they streamed toward him, surrounding him and moving with him as he slowly inched his way up the stairs toward an already-crowded classroom. Those who couldn't get in had to make do with the next classroom over, which had been set up as an overflow room. It was jammed, too.
 It's not every day that an options trader becomes famous by writing a book, but that's what Taleb did, first with ''Fooled by Randomness,'' which was published in 2001 and became an immediate cult classic on Wall Street, and more recently with ''The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,'' which came out in 2007 and landed on a number of best-seller lists. He also went from being primarily an options trader to what he always really wanted to be: a public intellectual. When I made the mistake of asking him one day whether he was an adjunct professor, he quickly corrected me. ''I'm the Distinguished Professor of Risk Engineering at N.Y.U.,'' he responded. ''It's the highest title they give in that department.'' Humility is not among his virtues. On his Web site he has a link that reads, ''Quotes from 'The Black Swan' that the imbeciles did not want to hear.''
 ''How many of you took statistics at Columbia?'' he asked as he began his lecture. Most of the hands in the room shot up. ''You wasted your money,'' he sniffed. Behind him was a slide of Mickey Mouse that he had put up on the screen, he said, because it represented ''Mickey Mouse probabilities.'' That pretty much sums up his view of business-school statistics and probability courses.
 Taleb's ideas can be difficult to follow, in part because he uses the language of academic statisticians; words like ''Gaussian,'' ''kurtosis'' and ''variance'' roll off his tongue. But it's also because he speaks in a kind of brusque shorthand, acting as if any fool should be able to follow his train of thought, which he can't be bothered to fully explain. 
 ''This is a Stan O'Neal trade,'' he said, referring to the former chief executive of Merrill Lynch. He clicked to a slide that showed a trade that made slow, steady profits -- and then quickly spiraled downward for a giant, brutal loss.
 ''Why do people measure risks against events that took place in 1987?'' he asked, referring to Black Monday, the October day when the U.S. market lost more than 20 percent of its value and has been used ever since as the worst-case scenario in many risk models. ''Why is that a benchmark? I call it future-blindness. 
 ''If you have a pilot flying a plane who doesn't understand there can be storms, what is going to happen?'' he asked. ''He is not going to have a magnificent flight. Any small error is going to crash a plane. This is why the crisis that happened was predictable.''
 Eventually, though, you do start to get the point. Taleb says that Wall Street risk models, no matter how mathematically sophisticated, are bogus; indeed, he is the leader of the camp that believes that risk models have done far more harm than good. And the essential reason for this is that the greatest risks are never the ones you can see and measure, but the ones you can't see and therefore can never measure. The ones that seem so far outside the boundary of normal probability that you can't imagine they could happen in your lifetime -- even though, of course, they do happen, more often than you care to realize. Devastating hurricanes happen. Earthquakes happen. And once in a great while, huge financial catastrophes happen. Catastrophes that risk models somehow always manage to miss.
 VaR is Taleb's favorite case in point. The original VaR measured portfolio risk along what is called a ''normal distribution curve,'' a statistical measure that was first identified by Carl Friedrich Gauss in the early 1800s (hence the term ''Gaussian''). It is a simple bell curve of the sort we are all familiar with. 
 The reason the normal curve looks the way it does -- why it rises as it gets closer to the middle -- is that the closer you get to that point, the smaller the change in the thing you're measuring, and hence the more frequently it is likely to occur. A typical stock or portfolio of stocks, for example, is far likelier to gain or lose one point in a day (or a week) than it is to gain or lose 20 points. So the pattern of normal distribution will cluster around those smaller changes toward the middle of the curve, while the less-frequent distributions will fall along the ends of the curve. 
 VaR uses this normal distribution curve to plot the riskiness of a portfolio. But it makes certain assumptions. VaR is often measured daily and rarely extends beyond a few weeks, and because it is a very short-term measure, it assumes that tomorrow will be more or less like today. Even what's called ''historical VaR'' -- a variation of standard VaR that measures potential portfolio risk a year or two out, only uses the previous few years as its benchmark. As the risk consultant Marc Groz puts it, ''The years 2005-2006,'' which were the culmination of the housing bubble, ''aren't a very good universe for predicting what happened in 2007-2008.''
 This was one of Alan Greenspan's primary excuses when he made his mea culpa for the financial crisis before Congress a few months ago. After pointing out that a Nobel Prize had been awarded for work that led to some of the theories behind derivative pricing and risk management, he said: ''The whole intellectual edifice, however, collapsed in the summer of last year because the data input into the risk-management models generally covered only the past two decades, a period of euphoria. Had instead the models been fitted more appropriately to historic periods of stress, capital requirements would have been much higher and the financial world would be in far better shape today, in my judgment.'' Well, yes. That was also the point Taleb was making in his lecture when he referred to what he called future-blindness. People tend not to be able to anticipate a future they have never personally experienced.
 Yet even faulty historical data isn't Taleb's primary concern. What he cares about, with standard VaR, is not the number that falls within the 99 percent probability. He cares about what happens in the other 1 percent, at the extreme edge of the curve. The fact that you are not likely to lose more than a certain amount 99 percent of the time tells you absolutely nothing about what could happen the other 1 percent of the time. You could lose $51 million instead of $50 million -- no big deal. That happens two or three times a year, and no one blinks an eye. You could also lose billions and go out of business. VaR has no way of measuring which it will be. 
 What will cause you to lose billions instead of millions? Something rare, something you've never considered a possibility. Taleb calls these events ''fat tails'' or ''black swans,'' and he is convinced that they take place far more frequently than most human beings are willing to contemplate. Groz has his own way of illustrating the problem: he showed me a slide he made of a curve with the letters ''T.B.D.'' at the extreme ends of the curve. I thought the letters stood for ''To Be Determined,'' but that wasn't what Groz meant. ''T.B.D. stands for 'There Be Dragons,' '' he told me.
 And that's the point. Because we don't know what a black swan might look like or when it might appear and therefore don't plan for it, it will always get us in the end. ''Any system susceptible to a black swan will eventually blow up,'' Taleb says. The modern system of world finance, complex and interrelated and opaque, where what happened yesterday can and does affect what happens tomorrow, and where one wrong tug of the thread can cause it all to unravel, is just such a system.
 ''I have been calling for the abandonment of certain risk measures since 1996 because they cause people to cross the street blindfolded,'' he said toward the end of his lecture. ''The system went bust because nobody listened to me.'' 
 After the lecture, the professor who invited Taleb to Columbia took a handful of people out for a late lunch at a nearby diner. Somewhat surprisingly, given Taleb's well-known scorn for risk managers, the professor had also invited several risk managers who worked at two big investment banks. We had barely been seated before they tried to engage Taleb in a debate over the value of VaR. But Taleb is impossible to argue with on this subject; every time they raised an objection to his argument, he curtly dismissed them out of hand. ''VaR can be useful,'' said one of the risk managers. ''It depends on how you use it. It can be useful in identifying trends.''
 ''This argument is addressed in 'The Black Swan,' '' Taleb retorted. ''Not a single person has offered me an argument I haven't heard.''
 ''I think VaR is great,'' said another risk manager. ''I think it is a fantastic tool. It's like an altimeter in aircraft. It has some margin for error, but if you're a pilot, you know how to deal with it. But very few pilots give up using it.''
 Taleb replied: ''Altimeters have errors that are Gaussian. You can compensate. In the real world, the magnitude of errors is much less known.''
 Around and around they went, talking past each other for the next hour or so. It was engaging but unsatisfying; it didn't help illuminate the role risk management played in the crisis.
 The conversation had an energizing effect on Taleb, however. He walked out of the diner with a full head of steam, railing about the two ''imbeciles'' he just had to endure. I used the moment to ask if he knew the people at RiskMetrics, a successful risk-management consulting firm that spun out of the original JPMorgan quant effort in the mid-1990s. ''They're intellectual charlatans,'' he replied dismissively. ''You can quote me on that.''
 As we approached his car, he began talking about his own performance in 2008. Although he is no longer a full-time trader, he remains a principal in a hedge fund he helped found, Black Swan Protection Protocol. His fund makes trades that either gain or lose small amounts of money in normal times but can make oversize gains when a black swan appears. Taleb likes to say that, as a trader, he has made money only three times in his life -- in the crash of 1987, during the dot-com bust more than a decade later and now. But all three times he has made a killing. With the world crashing around it, his fund was up 65 to 115 percent for the year. Taleb chuckled. ''They wouldn't listen to me,'' he said finally. ''So I decided, to hell with them, I'll take their money instead.''
 ''VaR WAS INEVITABLE,'' Gregg Berman of RiskMetrics said when I went to see him a few days later. He didn't sound like an intellectual charlatan. His explanation of the utility of VaR -- and its limitations -- made a certain undeniable sense. He did, however, sound like somebody who was completely taken aback by the amount of blame placed on risk modeling since the financial crisis began.
 ''Obviously, we are big proponents of risk models,'' he said. ''But a computer does not do risk modeling. People do it. And people got overzealous and they stopped being careful. They took on too much leverage. And whether they had models that missed that, or they weren't paying enough attention, I don't know. But I do think that this was much more a failure of management than of risk management. I think blaming models for this would be very unfortunate because you are placing blame on a mathematical equation. You can't blame math,'' he added with some exasperation. 
 Although Berman, who is 42, was a founding partner of RiskMetrics, it turned out that he was one of the few at the firm who hadn't come from JPMorgan. Still, he knew the back story. How could he not? It was part of the lore of the place. Indeed, it was part of the lore of VaR.
 The late 1980s and the early 1990s were a time when many firms were trying to devise more sophisticated risk models because the world was changing around them. Banks, whose primary risk had long been credit risk -- the risk that a loan might not be paid back -- were starting to meld with investment banks, which traded stocks and bonds. Derivatives and securitizations -- those pools of mortgages or credit-card loans that were bundled by investment firms and sold to investors -- were becoming an increasingly important component of Wall Street. But they were devilishly complicated to value. For one thing, many of the more arcane instruments didn't trade very often, so you had to try to value them by finding a comparable security that did trade. And they were sliced into different pieces -- tranches they're called -- each of which had a different risk component. In addition every desk had its own way of measuring risk that was largely incompatible with every other desk. 
 JPMorgan's chairman at the time VaR took off was a man named Dennis Weatherstone. Weatherstone, who died in 2008 at the age of 77, was a working-class Englishman who acquired the bearing of a patrician during his long career at the bank. He was soft-spoken, polite, self-effacing. At the point at which he took over JPMorgan, it had moved from being purely a commercial bank into one of these new hybrids. Within the bank, Weatherstone had long been known as an expert on risk, especially when he was running the foreign-exchange trading desk. But as chairman, he quickly realized that he understood far less about the firm's overall risk than he needed to. Did the risk in JPMorgan's stock portfolio cancel out the risk being taken by its bond portfolio -- or did it heighten those risks? How could you compare different kinds of derivative risks? What happened to the portfolio when volatility increased or interest rates rose? How did currency fluctuations affect the fixed-income instruments? Weatherstone had no idea what the answers were. He needed a way to compare the risks of those various assets and to understand what his companywide risk was. 
 The answer the bank's quants had come up with was Value at Risk. To phrase it that way is to make it sound as if a handful of math whizzes locked themselves in a room one day, cranked out some formulas, and -- presto! -- they had a risk-management system. In fact, it took around seven years, according to Till Guldimann, an elegant, Swiss-born, former JPMorgan banker who ran the team that devised VaR and who is now vice chairman of SunGard Data Systems. ''VaR is not just one invention,'' he said. ''You solved one problem and another cropped up. At first it seemed unmanageable. But as we refined it, the methodologies got better.'' 
 Early on, the group decided that it wanted to come up with a number it could use to gauge the possibility that any kind of portfolio could lose a certain amount of money over the next 24 hours, within a 95 percent probability. (Many firms still use the 95 percent VaR, though others prefer 99 percent.) That became the core concept. When the portfolio changed, as traders bought and sold securities the next day, the VaR was then recalculated, allowing everyone to see whether the new trades had added to, or lessened, the firm's risk. 
 ''There was a lot of suspicion internally,'' recalls Guldimann, because traders and executives -- nonquants -- didn't believe that such a thing could be quantified mathematically. But they were wrong. Over time, as VaR was proved more correct than not day after day, quarter after quarter, the top executives came not only to believe in it but also to rely on it. 
 For instance, during his early years as a risk manager, pre-VaR, Guldimann often confronted the problem of what to do when a trader had reached his trading limit but believed he should be given more capital to play out his hand. ''How would I know if he should get the increase?'' Guldimann says. ''All I could do is ask around. Is he a good guy? Does he know what he's doing? It was ridiculous. Once we converted all the limits to VaR limits, we could compare. You could look at the profits the guy made and compare it to his VaR. If the guy who asked for a higher limit was making more money with lower VaR'' -- that is, with less risk -- ''it was a good basis to give him the money.''
 By the early 1990s, VaR had become such a fixture at JPMorgan that Weatherstone instituted what became known as the 415 report because it was handed out every day at 4:15, just after the market closed. It allowed him to see what every desk's estimated profit and loss was, as compared to its risk, and how it all added up for the entire firm. True, it didn't take into account Taleb's fat tails, but nobody really expected it to do that. Weatherstone had been a trader himself; he understood both the limits and the value of VaR. It told him things he hadn't known before. He could use it to help him make judgments about whether the firm should take on additional risk or pull back. And that's what he did.
 What caused VaR to catapult above the risk systems being developed by JPMorgan competitors was what the firm did next: it gave VaR away. In 1993, Guldimann made risk the theme of the firm's annual client conference. Many of the clients were so impressed with the JPMorgan approach that they asked if they could purchase the underlying system. JPMorgan decided it didn't want to get into that business, but proceeded instead to form a small group, RiskMetrics, that would teach the concept to anyone who wanted to learn it, while also posting it on the Internet so that other risk experts could make suggestions to improve it. As Guldimann wrote years later, ''Many wondered what the bank was trying to accomplish by giving away 'proprietary' methodologies and lots of data, but not selling any products or services.'' He continued, ''It popularized a methodology and made it a market standard, and it enhanced the image of JPMorgan.''
 JPMorgan later spun RiskMetrics off into its own consulting company. By then, VaR had become so popular that it was considered the risk-model gold standard. Here was the odd thing, though: the month RiskMetrics went out on its own, September 1998, was also when Long-Term Capital Management ''blew up.'' L.T.C.M. was a fantastically successful hedge fund famous for its quantitative trading approach and its belief, supposedly borne out by its risk models, that it was taking minimal risk. 
 L.T.C.M.'s collapse would seem to make a pretty good case for Taleb's theories. What brought the firm down was a black swan it never saw coming: the twin financial crises in Asia and Russia. Indeed, so sure were the firm's partners that the market would revert to ''normal'' -- which is what their model insisted would happen -- that they continued to take on exposures that would destroy the firm as the crisis worsened, according to Roger Lowenstein's account of the debacle, ''When Genius Failed.'' Oh, and another thing: among the risk models the firm relied on was VaR. 
 Aaron Brown, the former risk manager at Morgan Stanley, remembers thinking that the fall of L.T.C.M. could well lead to the demise of VaR. ''It thoroughly punctured the myth that VaR was invincible,'' he said. ''Something that fails to live up to perfection is more despised than something that was never idealized in the first place.'' After the 1987 market crash, for example, portfolio insurance, which had been sold by Wall Street as a risk-mitigation device, became largely discredited.
 But that didn't happen with VaR. There was so much schadenfreude associated with L.T.C.M. -- it had Nobel Prize winners among its partners! -- that it was easy for the rest of Wall Street to view its fall as an example of comeuppance. And for a hedge fund that promoted the ingeniousness of its risk measures, it took far greater risks than it ever acknowledged. 
 For these reasons, other firms took to rationalizing away the fall of L.T.C.M.; they viewed it as a human failure rather than a failure of risk modeling. The collapse only amplified the feeling on Wall Street that firms needed to be able to understand their risks for the entire firm. Only VaR could do that. And finally, there was a belief among some, especially after the crisis abated, that the events that brought down L.T.C.M. were one in a million. We would never see anything like that again in our lifetime.
 So instead of diminishing in importance, VaR become a more important part of the financial scene. The Securities and Exchange Commission, for instance, worried about the amount of risk that derivatives posed to the system, mandated that financial firms would have to disclose that risk to investors, and VaR became the de facto measure. If the VaR number increased from year to year in a company's annual report, it meant the firm was taking more risk. Rather than doing anything to limit the growth of derivatives, the agency concluded that disclosure, via VaR, was sufficient.
 That, in turn, meant that even firms that had resisted VaR now succumbed. It meant that chief executives of big banks and investment firms had to have at least a passing familiarity with VaR. It meant that traders all had to understand the VaR consequences of making a big bet or of changing their portfolios. Some firms continued to use VaR as a tool while adding other tools as well, like ''stress'' or ''scenario'' tests, to see where the weak links in the portfolio were or what might happen if the market dropped drastically. But others viewed VaR as the primary measure they had to concern themselves with.
 VaR, in other words, became institutionalized. RiskMetrics went from having a dozen risk-management clients to more than 600. Lots of competitors sprouted up. Long-Term Capital Management became an increasingly distant memory, overshadowed by the Internet boom and then the housing boom. Corporate chieftains like Stanley O'Neal at Merrill Lynch and Charles Prince at Citigroup pushed their divisions to take more risk because they were being left behind in the race for trading profits. All over Wall Street, VaR numbers increased, but it still all seemed manageable -- and besides, nothing bad was happening!
 VaR also became a crutch. When an international banking group that advises national regulators decided the world needed more sophisticated ways to gauge the amount of capital that firms had to hold, Wall Street firms lobbied the group to allow them to use their internal VaR numbers. Ultimately, the group came up with an accord that allowed just that. It doesn't seem too strong to say that as a direct result, banks didn't have nearly enough capital when the black swan began to emerge in the spring of 2007.
 ONE THING THAT surprised me, as I made the rounds of risk experts, was that if you listened closely, their views weren't really that far from Taleb's diagnosis of VaR. They agreed with him that VaR didn't measure the risk of a black swan. And they were critical in other ways as well. Yes, the old way of measuring capital requirements needed updating, but it was crazy to base it on a firm's internal VaR, partly because that VaR was not set by regulators and partly because it obviously didn't gauge the kind of extreme events that destroy capital and create a liquidity crisis -- precisely the moment when you need cash on hand. 
 Indeed, Ethan Berman, the chief executive of RiskMetrics (and no relation to Gregg Berman), told me that one of VaR's flaws, which only became obvious in this crisis, is that it didn't measure liquidity risk -- and of course a liquidity crisis is exactly what we're in the middle of right now. One reason nobody seems to know how to deal with this kind of crisis is because nobody envisioned it. 
 In a crisis, Brown, the risk manager at AQR, said, ''you want to know who can kill you and whether or not they will and who you can kill if necessary. You need to have an emergency backup plan that assumes everyone is out to get you. In peacetime, you think about other people's intentions. In wartime, only their capabilities matter. VaR is a peacetime statistic.''
 VaR DIDN'T GET EVERYTHING right even in what it purported to measure. All the triple-A-rated mortgage-backed securities churned out by Wall Street firms and that turned out to be little more than junk? VaR didn't see the risk because it generally relied on a two-year data history. Although it took into account the increased risk brought on by leverage, it failed to distinguish between leverage that came from long-term, fixed-rate debt -- bonds and such that come due at a set date -- and loans that can be called in at any time and can, as Brown put it ''blow you up in two minutes.'' That is, the kind of leverage that disappeared the minute something bad arose. 
 ''The old adage, 'garbage in, garbage out' certainly applies,'' Groz said. ''When you realize that VaR is using tame historical data to model a wildly different environment, the total losses of Bear Stearns' hedge funds become easier to understand. It's like the historic data only has rainstorms and then a tornado hits.''
 Guldimann, the great VaR proselytizer, sounded almost mournful when he talked about what he saw as another of VaR's shortcomings. To him, the big problem was that it turned out that VaR could be gamed. That is what happened when banks began reporting their VaRs. To motivate managers, the banks began to compensate them not just for making big profits but also for making profits with low risks. That sounds good in principle, but managers began to manipulate the VaR by loading up on what Guldimann calls ''asymmetric risk positions.'' These are products or contracts that, in general, generate small gains and very rarely have losses. But when they do have losses, they are huge. These positions made a manager's VaR look good because VaR ignored the slim likelihood of giant losses, which could only come about in the event of a true catastrophe. A good example was a credit-default swap, which is essentially insurance that a company won't default. The gains made from selling credit-default swaps are small and steady -- and the chance of ever having to pay off that insurance was assumed to be minuscule. It was outside the 99 percent probability, so it didn't show up in the VaR number. People didn't see the size of those hidden positions lurking in that 1 percent that VaR didn't measure. 
 EVEN MORE CRITICAL, it did not properly account for leverage that was employed through the use of options. For example, said Groz, if an asset manager borrows money to buy shares of a company, the VaR would usually increase. But say he instead enters into a contract that gives someone the right to sell him those shares at a lower price at a later time -- a put option. In that case, the VaR might remain unchanged. From the outside, he would look as if he were taking no risk, but in fact, he is. If the share price of the company falls steeply, he will have lost a great deal of money. Groz called this practice ''stuffing risk into the tails.'' 
 And yet, instead of dismissing VaR as worthless, most of the experts I talked to defended it. The issue, it seemed to me, was less what VaR did and did not do, but how you thought about it. Taleb says that because VaR didn't measure the 1 percent, it was worse than useless -- it was downright harmful. But most of the risk experts said there was a great deal to be said for being able to manage risk 99 percent of the time, however imperfectly, even though it meant you couldn't account for the last 1 percent.
 ''If you say that all risk is unknowable,'' Gregg Berman said, ''you don't have the basis of any sort of a bet or a trade. You cannot buy and sell anything unless you have some idea of the expectation of how it will move.'' In other words, if you spend all your time thinking about black swans, you'll be so risk averse you'll never do a trade. Brown put it this way: ''NT'' -- that is how he refers to Nassim Nicholas Taleb -- ''says that 1 percent will dominate your outcomes. I think the other 99 percent does matter. There are things you can do to control your risk. To not use VaR is to say that I won't care about the 99 percent, in which case you won't have a business. That is true even though you know the fate of the firm is going to be determined by some huge event. When you think about disasters, all you can rely on is the disasters of the past. And yet you know that it will be different in the future. How do you plan for that?''
 One risk-model critic, Richard Bookstaber, a hedge-fund risk manager and author of ''A Demon of Our Own Design,'' ranted about VaR for a half-hour over dinner one night. Then he finally said, ''If you put a gun to my head and asked me what my firm's risk was, I would use VaR.'' VaR may have been a flawed number, but it was the best number anyone had come up with.
 Of course, the experts I was speaking to were, well, experts. They had a deep understanding of risk modeling and all its inherent limitations. They thought about it all the time. Brown even thought VaR was good when the numbers seemed ''off,'' or when it started to ''miss'' on a regular basis -- it either meant that there was something wrong with the way VaR was being calculated, or it meant the market was no longer acting ''normally.'' Either way, he said, it told you something useful. 
 ''When I teach it,'' Christopher Donohue, the managing director of the research group at the Global Association of Risk Professionals, said, ''I immediately go into the shortcomings. You can't calculate a VaR number and think you know everything you need. On a day-to-day basis I don't care so much that the VaR is 42. I care about where it was yesterday and where it is going tomorrow. What direction is the risk going?'' Then he added, ''That is probably another danger: because we put a dollar number to it, they attach a meaning to it.''
 By ''they,'' Donohue meant everyone who wasn't a risk manager or a risk expert. There were the investors who saw the VaR numbers in the annual reports but didn't pay them the least bit of attention. There were the regulators who slept soundly in the knowledge that, thanks to VaR, they had the whole risk thing under control. There were the boards who heard a VaR number once or twice a year and thought it sounded good. There were chief executives like O'Neal and Prince. There was everyone, really, who, over time, forgot that the VaR number was only meant to describe what happened 99 percent of the time. That $50 million wasn't just the most you could lose 99 percent of the time. It was the least you could lose 1 percent of the time. In the bubble, with easy profits being made and risk having been transformed into mathematical conceit, the real meaning of risk had been forgotten. Instead of scrutinizing VaR for signs of impending trouble, they took comfort in a number and doubled down, putting more money at risk in the expectation of bigger gains. ''It has to do with the human condition,'' said one former risk manager. ''People like to have one number they can believe in.''
 Brown told me: ''You absolutely could see it coming. You could see the risks rising. However, in the two years before the crisis hit, instead of preparing for it, the opposite took place to an extreme degree. The real trouble we got into today is because of things that took place in the two years before, when the risk measures were saying that things were getting bad.''
 At most firms, risk managers are not viewed as ''profit centers,'' so they lack the clout of the moneymakers on the trading desks. That was especially true at the tail end of the bubble, when firms were grabbing for every last penny of profit. 
 At the height of the bubble, there was so much money to be made that any firm that pulled back because it was nervous about risk would forsake huge short-term gains and lose out to less cautious rivals. The fact that VaR didn't measure the possibility of an extreme event was a blessing to the executives. It made black swans all the easier to ignore. All the incentives -- profits, compensation, glory, even job security -- went in the direction of taking on more and more risk, even if you half suspected it would end badly. After all, it would end badly for everyone else too. As the former Citigroup chief executive Charles Prince famously put it, ''As long as the music is playing, you've got to get up and dance.'' Or, as John Maynard Keynes once wrote, a ''sound banker'' is one who, ''when he is ruined, is ruined in a conventional and orthodox way.''
 MAYBE IT WOULD HAVE been different if the people in charge had a better understanding of risk. Maybe it would have helped if Wall Street hadn't turned VaR into something it was never meant to be. ''If we stick with the Dennis Weatherstone example,'' Ethan Berman says, ''he recognized that he didn't have the transparency into risk that he needed to make a judgment. VaR gave him that, and he and his managers could make judgments. To me, that is how it should work. The role of VaR is as one input into that process. It is healthy for the head of the firm to have that kind of information. But people need to have incentives to give him that information.'' 
 Which brings me back to David Viniar and Goldman Sachs. ''VaR is a useful tool,'' he said as our interview was nearing its end. ''The more liquid the asset, the better the tool. The more history, the better the tool. The less of both, the worse it is. It helps you understand what you should expect to happen on a daily basis in an environment that is roughly the same. We had a trade last week in the mortgage universe where the VaR was $1 million. The same trade a week later had a VaR of $6 million. If you tell me my risk hasn't changed -- I say yes it has!'' Two years ago, VaR worked for Goldman Sachs the way it once worked for Dennis Weatherstone -- it gave the firm a signal that allowed it to make a judgment about risk. It wasn't the only signal, but it helped. It wasn't just the math that helped Goldman sidestep the early decline of mortgage-backed instruments. But it wasn't just judgment either. It was both. The problem on Wall Street at the end of the housing bubble is that all judgment was cast aside. The math alone was never going to be enough. 
 Like most firms, Goldman does have other models to test for the fat tails. But even Goldman has been caught flat-footed by the crisis, struggling with liquidity, turning itself into a bank holding company and even, at one dire moment, struggling to combat rumors that it would be the next to fall.
 ''The question is: how extreme is extreme?'' Viniar said. ''Things that we would have thought were so extreme have happened. We used to say, What will happen if every equity market in the world goes down by 30 percent at the same time? We used to think of that as an extreme event -- except that now it has happened. Nothing ever happens until it happens for the first time.''
 Which didn't mean you couldn't use risk models to sniff out risks. You just had to know that there were risks they didn't sniff out -- and be ever vigilant for the dragons. When Wall Street stopped looking for dragons, nothing was going to save it. Not even VaR.

HEADLINE: Innovation Should Mean More Jobs, Not Less

BYLINE: By JANET RAE-DUPREE. 
Janet Rae-Dupree writes about science and emerging technology in Silicon Valley.

 BODY:
CREATING new jobs is a good way to get America's economy moving again. That's not the controversial part of President-elect Barack Obama's economic stimulus plans. As usual, the devil is in the details. And innovation advocates fear that if the devil runs amok, a short-sighted emphasis on jobs over long-term productivity may bog down the economic recovery.
 The problem, as they see it, is a centuries-old misconception that innovation is synonymous with automation, which in turn leads to the elimination of jobs. 
 ''If you invest in a technology that makes something more efficient, the fear is that people will be put out of work,'' says Kevin Efrusy, the venture capitalist whose firm Accel Partners is the lead funder of several important Silicon Valley start-ups, including Facebook. ''But it's just the opposite. When anything becomes cheaper, we consume a lot more of it. The overall economic effect is, you create and expand entire new industries and employment goes up.''
 According to a 1995 study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, periods of high productivity -- often achieved through automation -- were correlated with periods of high job growth throughout the last half of the 20th century. ''Innovation leads to job growth directly and clearly,'' says Robert D. Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. The data collected since that study was published continue to prove the point, he says, noting that even with the trend toward off-shoring earlier this decade, unemployment rates in the United States remained quite low until the recent economic downturn began.
 While creating jobs by upgrading the nation's physical infrastructure may help in the short term, Mr. Atkinson says, ''there's another category of stimulus you could call innovation or digital stimulus -- 'stimovation,' as a colleague has referred to it.'' Although many economists believe that a stimulus package must be timely, targeted and temporary, Mr. Atkinson's organization argues that a fourth adjective -- transformative -- may be the most important. Transformative stimulus investments, he said, lead to economic growth that wouldn't be there otherwise.
 A new report by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation presents the case for investing $30 billion in the nation's digital infrastructure, including health information technology, broadband Internet access and the so-called smart grid, an effort to infuse detailed digital intelligence into the electricity distribution grid.
 The stimulus money, he says, is ''a wonderful opportunity'' to integrate innovative technologies at a far faster pace than would otherwise be possible. ''You'd have an economy and society within three to four years that would be a lot better than we have today,'' Mr. Atkinson says, ''and you'd create a lot of jobs.'' 
 Beyond direct stimulus investments, he supports an initiative being circulated in Silicon Valley that seeks an information technology investment tax credit to foster innovation through the downturn.
 Citing an Op-Ed essay on Nov. 30 in The New York Times by the economist Joseph E. Stiglitz, the Silicon Valley petition calls for a tax credit for companies that spend more than 80 percent of what they had been spending annually on information technology like computers and software.
 The petition's creator is David Thompson, the chief executive of Genius.com. ''I think it's great that they want to build more highways and bridges,'' Mr. Thompson says, ''but if you really want to invest in long-term job viability you need to invest in the innovation economy.'' 
 Various organizations have previously backed such a tax credit specifically for clean technologies, biotech and broadband development. But TechNet, an advocacy group for the technology industry, is pushing for a tax credit that would underwrite innovation more broadly.
 ''Innovation is the lifeblood of the American economy,'' says Jim Hock, a spokesman for TechNet. ''We're only as good as our next innovation. TechNet believes we shouldn't be picking and choosing technologies to back with a tax credit. We should be technology-neutral and create an atmosphere of innovation that will let a thousand flowers bloom.''
 Mr. Stiglitz, who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers from 1995 to 1997, noted in an interview that there has been a slow divergence between traditional economics and what may be called innovation economics.
 ''I've been a bit astonished that all the discussion around the private-sector stimulus has centered on infrastructure,'' he said. ''Bailouts, too, are aimed at correcting mistakes of the past, so they are backward-looking. We would be much better off spending our money forward-looking. If we spend $700 billion on new technology and innovation, we'd have a stronger, new, real economy. Up to now, the discussion has focused on the sectors that have been mismanaged rather than the sectors that are creating our future.''
 Geoffrey A. Moore, a partner with Mohr Davidow Ventures and author of five best-selling business books, says that whatever form the government stimulus takes, it must focus on the nation's greatest strength.
 ''America is probably the best culture in the world at failing,'' he said. ''We're willing to navigate in a fog and keep moving forward. Our competitive advantage tends to be at the fuzzy front end of things when you're still finding your way. Once the way has been found, we're back at a disadvantage. So, yes, investing in innovation is critical.''

HEADLINE: Police Polish Image, but Concerns Persist

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL; Abba Bhattarai contributed reporting.

 BODY:
These can be seen as grand days for the New York City police force. Crime rates remain at or near historic lows, Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly has unfurled new anticrime and antiterror initiatives, and visiting dignitaries salute his department as the nation's best.
 As police recruits -- a majority are nonwhite -- gathered for training at the Apollo Theater in Harlem recently, a black activist praised the commissioner as an all-time great.
 Yet the department has gained no immunity from the concerns that troubled it in years past, although fewer prominent New Yorkers speak out now. In December, the Brooklyn district attorney obtained an indictment of an officer accused of using his baton to sodomize a man. A little over two years ago, undercover officers fired a hail of 50 bullets outside a Queens nightclub, killing Sean Bell only hours before he was to be married. 
 Police officers frisked more than 500,000 New Yorkers in 2008, more than 80 percent of them young black or Latino men. The police arrest only 4 percent of those whom they frisk. 
 Since 2002, federal judges have suppressed guns as evidence in more than 20 cases after finding New York police officers' testimony to be unreliable, inconsistent or false; but the Police Department does not monitor such cases. In 2008, the Police Department declined to pursue 42 percent of the cases in which the independent Civilian Complaint Review Board issued a finding of police misconduct.
 A decade ago, when Rudolph W. Giuliani was mayor, police shootings and the frisking of 80,000 young men a year stirred citywide outrage. David A. Paterson, then a state senator, and former Mayor David N. Dinkins submitted to arrest in demonstrations outside Police Headquarters. The City Council held hearings and The New York Times wrote of ''a yawning chasm'' between officers and the citizens they served. 
 In the New York City of 2008, the political class rarely seemed to challenge the police.
 Explaining why is a complicated matter, as is any attempt to draw the measure of a heavily armed force of 36,000 officers, men and women tasked with safeguarding the nation's largest city against terrorists and criminals, not to mention dealing with the distraught and the mentally unbalanced.
 Part of the answer is that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Mr. Kelly have worked hard to explain themselves to the public and disarm their critics. 
 Where Mr. Giuliani barred City Hall's gates and doors against prominent black clergymen like the Rev. Al Sharpton and the Rev. Calvin O. Butts III, the current mayor and commissioner usher these critics into their offices. 
 Mr. Bloomberg has voiced his displeasure at some police shootings; when a police officer mistakenly shot Timothy Stansbury Jr., 19, on a rooftop in 2004, the mayor attended and spoke at the teenager's funeral. (New York records fewer fatal police shootings than most other large cities.)
 Councilman Albert Vann of Brooklyn, an often-fierce police critic, declared the mayor's eulogy a ''defining moment.'' 
 ''Things,'' he said, ''can happen differently in this city.''
 And Mr. Kelly projects an incorruptible brio. 
 ''So who do I speak to? I speak to a lot of people,'' Mr. Kelly said in an interview in his spacious office atop 1 Police Plaza. ''I go to mosques, I go to synagogues, I go anywhere and take questions and answers.''
 But muted voices speak also to a different New York, whiter and more middle-class, chastened by the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and more tolerant of tough tactics to tamp down crime. 
 ''There is a post-traumatic dynamic,'' noted Eugene J. O'Donnell, a professor of law and police studies at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a former police officer. ''Once you've seen what the city was 20 years ago, or the terror attacks, you're not cavalier about going back.''
 When Mr. Kelly's department delayed for years in turning over legally mandated reports recording the number of police stop-and-frisks, the New York Civil Liberties Union -- rather than the leadership of the City Council -- pushed for release of the data. 
 When reports showed that police frisks rose after the Sean Bell shooting, Peter F. Vallone Jr., the Council's public safety chairman, applauded. The department, he said, cannot cave to ''political correctness.''
 ''You can't listen to the people who attack the department,'' Mr. Vallone said in an interview. ''Over all, this is the best police force in the world.''
 Limits to Forgiveness
 That the New York Police Department is more strategically adept and technologically sophisticated than most in the United States is widely accepted in academic circles. But problems that have plagued the department for a century, from narcotics corruption to accusations that police too often use harsh -- even fatal -- tactics in handling emotionally disturbed people, have not disappeared.
 History suggests that New Yorkers are not endlessly forgiving. Mayor Edward I. Koch and Mayor Giuliani ended up politically wounded by the perception that they gave the police too long a leash. As New York tips into recession, and Mr. Bloomberg seeks a third term, the politics of crime and policing remain difficult to predict.
 ''Giuliani was everyone's favorite devil and an easy target,'' said Michael Meyers, executive director of the New York Civil Rights Coalition, which has clashed with both liberals and conservatives. ''Bloomberg and Kelly somehow have charmed everyone into believing all those problems went away.''
 Many black and Latino New Yorkers still express a wary and conflicted view of the police. Young black men on a college campus in Queens spoke of the churn in their stomach as a cop approaches; some spoke of swallowing rage as officers patted them down. 
 Councilman James Sanders Jr. represents a swath of southeast Queens that extends from Laurelton to Far Rockaway and encompasses neat homes and housing projects. The decline of crime, he notes, has opened doors for his constituents; they can barbecue and walk children to school, and fewer of their sons wind up dead. But so many young men now complain of humiliating police searches that he keeps a stack of complaint forms on his desk. 
 ''There is no question that we have seen a sea change in police-community relations since Rudy Giuliani's administration,'' he said. ''There's also no question that we have light years to go before we can say that the problems have been resolved.''
 In Mr. Kelly's mind's eye, two defining moments linger. There was the crack-fueled crime wave of the 1980s and early '90s. And there was the terror attack on the World Trade Center.
 The department he has fashioned reflects those concerns. He has built a 1,000-member intelligence division, attracted former Central Intelligence Agency officials and scholars in residence, and invested in computers and data mining. The city has a thousand surveillance cameras spread across Lower Manhattan. His intelligence analysts speak Urdu, Pashto, Farsi and Hindi and travel to Mumbai and Spain to sift evidence. (One-quarter of the new police class was born outside the United States.) 
 Mr. Kelly recently exchanged dueling letters with the United States attorney general, Michael B. Mukasey. The police commissioner argued, improbably, that the Bush administration was overly cautious about submitting surveillance requests for special court approval. ''Not only would your approach violate the law,'' Mr. Mukasey replied, ''it would make New York'' less safe. 
 ''Under Commissioner Kelly, the police see everything through a terrorism prism,'' said Christopher Dunn, associate legal director of the New York Civil Liberties Union. ''And the public has been more willing to accept aggressive policing in this climate.''
 Ask Mr. Kelly about this and he shrugs. Every intelligence report he sees shows New York in the terrorist cross hairs.
 ''We've certainly ramped it up -- we simply have to do everything we can do,'' he says.
 Mr. Kelly acknowledges the strain this puts on his police force, which has shrunk by 5,000 from a high of 41,000 officers. He has responded with programs like Operation Impact, twinning rookies with seasoned officers in high-crime neighborhoods. A Real Time Crime Center allows trained officers to rummage databases from parole to nicknames and tattoos, giving investigators information at the crime scene. And, using citywide databases on robbery complaints, the department's housing bureau has zeroed in on troubled teenagers and their families and has driven down crime in housing projects.
 ''There's no doubt we're trying to do more with less,'' Mr. Kelly said. 
 He does not hesitate to apply a police clamp, either, as the broader city experienced during the 2004 Republican National Convention.
 Mr. Kelly and Mr. Bloomberg defend such occasionally tough tactics as necessary. It is not just civil libertarians who disagree. During the week of the convention, officers arrested more than 1,800 people, often in highly disputed circumstances. The police held many for two days before arraignment.
 ''If I'm disappointed with the mayor and the commissioner, it's that they haven't moved beyond the notion of the garrison city,'' said Mr. O'Donnell, the former prosecutor. ''We should be able to be a safe city and a decent city.'' 
 Under Suspicion
 Bibash Malakar knows he fits the profile, which is to say he's a young black man who happens to live in a working-class neighborhood in Queens. He majors in criminal justice at York College. A year ago, this 18-year-old says he stepped out of Bryant High School and clasped hands with a Latino friend and a white buddy.
 A few moments later, he recalls, police officers put him against a wall and patted him down for drugs. Why me? he asked. Yours looked like a drug dealer's handshake, they replied.
 ''When I was younger, I never looked at cops and thought, 'Those are the bad guys,' '' he said. ''They were the good guys. But they started to look at me like I was the bad guy and everything changed.''
 That this is anecdotal evidence is indisputable. But interviews at York College two years apart found that 22 out of 23 black male students reported being stopped by the police, often more than a half-dozen times. Sometimes, they said, officers drew their guns, and sometimes they forced the young men face down on the sidewalk.
 Few police tactics stir more controversy than stop-and-frisks. Along with a spike in marijuana arrests in black neighborhoods -- there has been no corresponding crackdown in white neighborhoods where, studies suggest, marijuana use is at least as heavy -- these tactics could account for rising complaints to the review board these past five years.
 'A Slippery Slope'
 State Senator Bill Perkins of Harlem served in the 1990s on the City Council, where he was a persistent critic of Mr. Giuliani. He appreciates the tonal improvement but he does no cartwheels. His precinct in Harlem has roughly the same crime rate as an Upper West Side precinct; yet the police frisk vastly more youths in his neighborhood.
 ''I believe it's worse than under Giuliani because we expected so much better now,'' Mr. Perkins said. ''We are on a slippery slope. Respectful relations between police and the community should be a strong measure of success in any civilized society.'' 
 Mr. Kelly acknowledges there is a complicated moral calculus at play. He notes that the race and ethnicity of those whom the police stop reflect closely the race and ethnicity of those who commit felonies, and those suffering as well.
 And police training now puts much emphasis on understanding different cultures -- on Dec. 18, recruits sat in the Apollo Theater and heard Mr. Sharpton and the civil rights advocate and former talk show host Bob Law speak with great frankness of black hostility to police tactics.
 But frisks, Mr. Kelly says, make criminals think twice about carrying guns. ''I can understand if you have done nothing wrong, you can feel a loss of time, a loss of dignity,'' he said. ''And I understand that we are not winning great popularity, and if that's your point, we accept that.
 ''But we are saving lives.''
 Dennis C. Smith, a professor at the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at New York University, says his studies show that mass frisks significantly ratchet down crime. But Jeffrey A. Fagan, professor of law and public health at the Center for Crime, Community and Law at Columbia University Law School, studied the tactic for Attorney General Eliot Spitzer in the 1990s and found it corrosive.
 ''Middle-class New Yorkers enjoy a sense of security, but it's being paid for at the expense of extraordinarily inefficient stops of young black males,'' Professor Fagan asserted. Deputy Mayor Dennis M. Walcott lives in the predominantly Caribbean neighborhood of Cambria Heights, Queens, and he summarized the moral complication. On Nov. 11, three blocks from his home, a young man was gunned down on a troubled corner. Residents demanded a vigorous police presence, and the department complied, and just as quickly their sons began to complain of being stopped.
 The street violence slowed, too.
 ''We struggle with the duality of wanting a safe neighborhood and police who are respectful of our children,'' he says. ''It's an inherent challenge and I'm not sure there's an easy answer.''

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about the reputation and tactics of the New York Police Department under the Bloomberg administration misstated the size of the department's intelligence division and the number of surveillance cameras in Lower Manhattan. The division has more than 600 officers -- not 1,000, which is the total number assigned to counterterrorism duties. And although the department originally planned to have 1,000 cameras downtown at the end of 2008, only about 180 are up, with the deadline for the rest pushed back to 2011.
 The article also misstated the time period in which the Police Department declined to pursue 42 percent of the misconduct cases substantiated by the Civilian Complaint Review Board. That statistic was for October 2008 alone, not the entire year; the figure for January through November was 35 percent.

HEADLINE: The Irish Miracle Fizzles

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

DATELINE: Dublin 

 BODY:
 IT'S 3 a.m. at Doheny & Nesbitt, a favorite watering hole of Dublin's political and business elite, and the property tycoon Sean Dunne stoops to retrieve a penny from the pub's grimy floor.
 One would think that Mr. Dunne, Ireland's best-known building developer, would be in bed at this hour. It's a weeknight, after all, and he has meetings that begin before first light.
 What's more, the Irish economy, pummeled by the most severe housing bust in Europe, has collapsed. And the gossip around town is that Mr. Dunne, whose brazen deal-making and Donald Trump-like lifestyle epitomized the country's euphoric boom, might be going bankrupt. 
 But, no matter, a penny is a penny. 
 ''I am never, never too proud to pick a penny up from the floor,'' Mr. Dunne said. He is on perhaps his fifth pint of Guinness, capping a rollicking night of Champagne cocktails, followed by a wine-soaked dinner -- yet his thick brogue is clear of even the faintest slurring. 
 ''I grew up with nothing and I know the value of money,'' he adds. ''The Celtic Tiger may be dead and if the banking crisis continues I could be considered insolvent. But the one thing that I have is my wife and children -- that they can't take away from me.'' 
 It is not known whether Mr. Dunne will fall victim to today's world financial catastrophe, but there is no doubt that his country has.
 Everything, it seems, has grown worse here. The recession started earlier and its bite has been deeper. Housing prices have fallen by as much as 50 percent. Bank shares have plummeted by more than 90 percent. Unemployment is approaching 10 percent.
 The roots of Ireland's fall date to more than 20 years ago, when a clutch of economists, politicians and civil servants put their heads together in this very pub and planted the philosophical seeds for the Irish economic miracle. 
 Known widely as the ''Doheny & Nesbitt School of Economics,'' these beery musings soon became government policy that chopped taxes in half, sharply reduced import duties and embraced foreign investment -- a radical transformation that gave birth to the Celtic Tiger and perhaps the most open and vibrant economy in Europe.
 But beyond the glow of this sudden efflorescence that made Ireland the fourth most-affluent country in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a housing bubble had begun to form. Low interest rates, a wave of inward immigration and a bank lending spree drove housing's share of the economy to 14 percent, the highest in Europe, from 5 percent. 
 Developers like Mr. Dunne became multimillionaires and -- much like the hedge fund and private-equity elite in America -- became visible public and cultural figures. They were living large in a country just coming to grips with its ability to show a little swagger.
 Ireland's policy makers, like their counterparts in the United States and Britain, were seduced by record tax inflows and a full-employment economy. They paid little heed to the lonely voices that warned of the crash that finally came over the summer, when interest rates in Europe began to rise. Banks that had steered more than 60 percent of their loans toward property stopped lending, and asset values plummeted.
 ''We have repeatedly warned that the government's housing policy was extremely dangerous,'' said John Fitz Gerald, an economist at the Economic and Social Research Institute, a leading policy center in Dublin, who has long urged that the government stanch housing demand by raising taxes. ''You will now see unemployment going to 10 percent and we will experience a sharp drop in output.'' 
 He shakes his head and sighs: ''This was predictable, but the government just did not deal with it.''
 BY wide consensus here, two events have come to define -- both culturally and financially -- the sweep and excess of the Irish property boom. Both revolve around Sean Dunne. 
 In July 2005, Mr. Dunne paid 379 million euros for a seven-acre plot in the exclusive Ballsbridge neighborhood of Dublin and promptly announced that he would tear down the two luxury hotels on the site to build a high-end commercial and residential development. 
 That deal amounted to 54 million euros an acre, one of the highest amounts ever paid for land in Europe. His subsequent architectural plan featured a soaring Dubai-like office tower cut in the shape of a diamond that anchored a futuristic community of expensive houses and glamorous shops, and the price tag of one billion euros shocked Dubliners with its gall and ambition. 
 Hobbled by delays and vocal neighborhood opposition, the project sits before a local planning board that on Jan. 30 will either approve or scrap the plan.
 The second moment occurred in 2004 when Mr. Dunne, who is now 54, celebrated his second marriage, to Gayle Killilea, a former gossip columnist 20 years his junior, by inviting 44 of his friends on a two-week Mediterranean wedding cruise on the yacht Christina O, on which Aristotle Onassis and Jacqueline Kennedy married. 
 Much as the $3 million birthday party for Stephen A. Schwarzman, the Blackstone Group founder, came to be seen as a crass display of private equity's manifold riches, the Dunne wedding was viewed similarly in Ireland: as a conspicuous and garish expression of the man and his business. 
 That a billion euro property plan and a gaudy wedding celebration should be held up as cautionary exemplars of Ireland's pursuit of money angers Mr. Dunne. In his view, it speaks to what some call the Irish disease.
 ''Jealousy and begrudgery are still alive and well in Ireland, and whoever eradicates them should be prime minister for life,'' he says as he tucks into a heaping plate of gravy-drenched turkey and mashed potatoes in the restaurant of one of the two hotels he owns -- and is hoping to raze. ''It's part of the Irish psyche and it is the result of 800 years of being controlled by other people, of watching everything the master or landlord is doing.''
 Mr. Dunne's compact paunch, reddish cheeks and mischievous grin -- which he occasionally deploys with a wink of his eye -- can give him the air of a department store Santa. But his business methods are far from jolly: he is notorious for taking legal action against all who cross him, from local newspapers to rival property developers.
 He defends his purchase of the Ballsbridge site as responsible, not reckless, as his critics have deemed it. He points out, too, that his winning bid was just slightly more than the second-highest offer and that subsequent property sales had far exceeded his submission of 54 million euros an acre. 
 Still, he recognizes that times have changed. Just recently, he pruned staff at his development company, and some of his senior executives agreed to take 50 percent pay cuts.
 Asked where he will find the 600 million euros that he needs to tear down the two hotels, dig a massive hole in the ground and erect his vision of a new Dublin, he ruefully remarks: ''It is fair to say that there is not a queue of bankers lining up to lend to me right now.'' 
 But he says the project will be completed, assuming that it wins approval of the planning board. ''If anyone wants to bet I can't do this, I will take that bet,'' he says, citing, without specifics, talks with Asian banks and a sovereign wealth fund. ''You have to have steel in a certain part of your body to do this job, and as one of my bankers recently said to me, 'Sean, the only thing that will take you out is a stray bullet.' ''
 IN many ways, the ups and downs of Mr. Dunne's life and career mirror the Irish economy's own rise and fall. Born into a house without electricity or running water in the small provincial town of Tullow, outside Dublin, Mr. Dunne studied construction economics at a technical college in the 1970s.
 Along with many of his countrymen, he forsook the stagnant Irish economy -- in his case, choosing bartending in New York City and working on an oil rig in Canada. 
 With the Irish economy still afflicted by an unemployment rate of about 20 percent in the 1980s, and a punitive overall tax rate, he began his real estate career in London. He moved back to Ireland in 1990 and began a string of property deals. 
 He initially focused on government-sponsored housing projects. But as the Irish economy began its true take-off, demand came from the growing corps of newly wealthy Irish, many of whom were returning to Ireland from abroad. They were joined by a wave of foreign workers.
 After years of emigration and economic stagnation, Ireland's housing stock was depleted, precipitating a housing euphoria. Capital gains taxes were low, as were interest rates. Banks stood ready to lend, offering mortgages with no money down to a house-hungry population. 
 The projects of Mr. Dunne and a small circle of developers grew in size and scope until the skyline of Dublin, never known for its tall buildings, began to fill with cranes and great shiny towers. 
 Signs of a bubble were everywhere: a family home in Dublin cost as much as a similar abode in Beverly Hills; house prices more than doubled over a 10-year period; and household debt as a percentage of G.D.P. jumped to 160 percent from 60 percent during the same period.
 Irish banks, unlike those in the United States, didn't dole out that many subprime loans. Rather, they lent furiously to big property developers who themselves were liberated to build pell-mell by government-imposed tax breaks.
 Mr. Dunne, who says he put 35 percent cash down -- or about 125 million euros -- for the Ballsbridge project, says that even with the drop in asset values, he still has hope that the project can be completed. 
 ''This is the way God made me, with heavy shoulders and an ability to carry a great load,'' he says, forcefully rejecting the rumors of his financial demise buzzing around Dublin. (One of the more fantastic claims was that his financial troubles had forced him to take a month's recuperation in a mental institution.) 
 ''Failure is not an option for me,'' he says. But others aren't so sure. 
 The Irish government recently announced a $7.5 billion bank bailout and took majority stakes in the country's largest banks, a move that followed the government's earlier promise to guarantee all bank deposits. 
 Analysts are uncertain that the government will allow the banks to continue to support the type of high-risk, high-reward projects that have become the bane of their financial existence. 
 ''The banks in Ireland did not lend recklessly to individuals; they lent recklessly to developers,'' says Ronan Lyons, an economist at Daft, Ireland's largest property Web site. As for the Ballsbridge project, he may well take Mr. Dunne's bet. 
 ''I would be surprised if it gets built,'' Mr. Lyons says. ''The migrants are going home, there is a surplus of properties for sale, and even though this is a landmark project there is just not an appetite for large projects now.''
 WHILE the pain is acute in Dublin, at least the city has the small comfort of having enjoyed the full benefit of the boom. 
 Such is not the case in the city of Limerick. Traditionally one of Ireland's more depressed cities, Limerick was a latecomer to the property party. While there were some good times, the downturn has had a more wrenching effect there, with unemployment over 14 percent -- among the highest rates in Ireland. 
 The layoffs have picked up speed around Limerick in the last month, as construction companies have stopped work, seemingly on a dime, sending such a procession of jobless to seek assistance that the local unemployment office became the second busiest in the country.
 The waiting room in the office is dank and gloomy, and Dale McNamara, 20, wonders how a professional life once so charmed came to be so hopeless. Since graduating from high school as an electrician, flourishing building work in the area kept him more than busy and flush enough to buy a new car, start a family and consider buying a house. 
 Then, without warning on Dec. 5, he was told that it would be his last day of work, just six months before he would have received his certificate as an independent electrician. 
 Since then, he has been frantically knocking on doors, but to no avail. Now, as rent, heating bills and car payments pile up, he is beginning to feel desperate, unable to afford a night out or a Christmas present for his 20-month-old baby.
 ''If I don't get a job in the next two weeks, I am worried about losing my house,'' he says. ''We have no money.'' 
 He looks at his number in the unemployment lines and grimaces -- he has been waiting four hours now and his name has still not been called. 
 ''My grandfather says this reminds him of the 1930s when everyone left for America and Australia,'' he adds. ''There is just no work here.''
 More dire, however, is the condition of the permanently unemployed in Limerick's festering ghettoes, where experts say the unemployment rate touches 70 percent. During the early years of the economic revival, the government did its best to spread money to such areas, which are a feature of urban life all over Ireland. 
 IN fact, it was through social housing projects like these that Mr. Dunne got his start as a developer. But as the investment returns in the private sector became quite obviously more lucrative, the attention paid to so-called social estates like Moyross, on the northern outskirts of Limerick, wavered. 
 Crime, gangland disputes and a sense of anomie flourished as Moyross and other similar projects evolved as cocoons of poverty and hopelessness amid the riches and celebration of the Irish miracle.
 ''This place missed out entirely on the moment,'' says Stephen Kinsella, an economist at the University of Limerick. ''There has been no accumulation of wealth here.''
 Walking through the garbage-strewn, empty roads on a cold, misty afternoon, Mr. Kinsella points to the shuttered houses and the mothers still dressed in pajamas taking their children home from school. Social workers in Moyross refer to the ''pajama index'': the more men and women one sees who do not take the time and care to dress for the day, the worse the economic situation tends to be. 
 The Irish government has recently begun a regeneration project in Moyross that would result in large new investments in housing and infrastructure, but the going so far has been slow.
 For Brother Shawn O'Connor, a Franciscan monk who has been living and working with the poor in Moyross for more than a year now, the vicissitudes of the Irish property market are a notion as distant as is his hometown, Red Hook, a village in the Hudson Valley of New York. 
 Brother O'Connor is the local superior of the community of Franciscan Friars, who do their work in some of the world's most destitute communities. He and his fellow monks extend day-care assistance and spiritual counseling to the needy. They survive themselves on four hours of daily prayer and food handouts from neighbors -- as Franciscans, they take a vow of chastity, poverty and obedience and thus do not spend money on any personal items, including food. 
 He recognizes that the deprivation of his community is severe, but suggests that it may be an easier hardship than the experiences of many Irish who have seen their riches disappear.
 ''There was this one story of a guy who shot his wife, son and daughter,'' he says. ''He had overextended himself. There is this desperation for wealth and people go after it -- only to find out that it is not enough.''

HEADLINE: A President Forgotten but Not Gone

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH. 
Maureen Dowd and Thomas L. Friedman are off today. The public editor's column will return next week.

 BODY:
WE like our failed presidents to be Shakespearean, or at least large enough to inspire Oscar-worthy performances from magnificent tragedians like Frank Langella. So here, too, George W. Bush has let us down. Even the banality of evil is too grandiose a concept for 43. He is not a memorable villain so much as a sometimes affable second banana whom Josh Brolin and Will Ferrell can nail without breaking a sweat. He's the reckless Yalie Tom Buchanan, not Gatsby. He is smaller than life.
 The last NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll on Bush's presidency found that 79 percent of Americans will not miss him after he leaves the White House. He is being forgotten already, even if he's not yet gone. You start to pity him until you remember how vast the wreckage is. It stretches from the Middle East to Wall Street to Main Street and even into the heavens, which have been a safe haven for toxins under his passive stewardship. The discrepancy between the grandeur of the failure and the stature of the man is a puzzlement. We are still trying to compute it. 
 The one indisputable talent of his White House was its ability to create and sell propaganda both to the public and the press. Now that bag of tricks is empty as well. Bush's first and last photo-ops in Iraq could serve as bookends to his entire tenure. On Thanksgiving weekend 2003, even as the Iraqi insurgency was spiraling, his secret trip to the war zone was a P.R. slam-dunk. The photo of the beaming commander in chief bearing a supersized decorative turkey for the troops was designed to make every front page and newscast in the country, and it did. Five years later, in what was intended as a farewell victory lap to show off Iraq's improved post-surge security, Bush was reduced to ducking shoes. 
 He tried to spin the ruckus as another victory for his administration's program of democracy promotion. ''That's what people do in a free society,'' he said. He had made the same claim three years ago after the Palestinian elections, championed by his ''freedom agenda'' (and almost $500 million of American aid), led to a landslide victory for Hamas. ''There is something healthy about a system that does that,'' Bush observed at the time, as he congratulated Palestinian voters for rejecting ''the old guard.'' 
 The ruins of his administration's top policy priority can be found not only in Gaza but in the new ''democratic'' Iraq, where the local journalist who tossed the shoes was jailed without formal charges and may have been tortured. Almost simultaneously, opponents of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki accused him of making politically motivated arrestsof rival-party government officials in anticipation of this month's much-postponed provincial elections.
 Condi Rice blamed the press for the image that sullied Bush's Iraq swan song: ''That someone chose to throw a shoe at the president is what gets reported over and over.'' We are back where we came in. This was the same line Donald Rumsfeld used to deny the significance of the looting in Baghdad during his famous ''Stuff happens!'' press conference of April 2003. ''Images you are seeing on television you are seeing over, and over, and over,'' he said then, referring to the much-recycled video of a man stealing a vase from the Baghdad museum. ''Is it possible that there were that many vases in the whole country?'' he asked, playing for laughs.
 The joke was on us. Iraq burned, New Orleans flooded, and Bush remained oblivious to each and every pratfall on his watch. Americans essentially stopped listening to him after Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005, but he still doesn't grasp the finality of their defection. Lately he's promised not to steal the spotlight from Barack Obama once he's in retirement -- as if he could do so by any act short of running naked through downtown Dallas. The latest CNN poll finds that only one-third of his fellow citizens want him to play a post-presidency role in public life.
 Bush is equally blind to the collapse of his propaganda machinery. Almost poignantly, he keeps trying to hawk his goods in these final days, like a salesman who hasn't been told by the home office that his product has been discontinued. Though no one is listening, he has given more exit interviews than either Clinton or Reagan did. Along with old cronies like Karl Rove and Karen Hughes, he has also embarked on a Bush ''legacy project,'' as Stephen Hayes of The Weekly Standard described it on CNN.
 To this end, Rove has repeated a stunt he first fed to the press two years ago: he is once again claiming that he and Bush have an annual book-reading contest, with Bush chalking up as many as 95 books a year, by authors as hifalutin as Camus. This hagiographic portrait of Bush the Egghead might be easier to buy were the former national security official Richard Clarke not quoted in the new Vanity Fair saying that both Rice and her deputy, Stephen Hadley, had instructed him early on to keep his memos short because the president is ''not a big reader.''
 Another, far more elaborate example of legacy spin can be downloaded from the White House Web site: a booklet recounting ''highlights'' of the administration's ''accomplishments and results.'' With big type, much white space, children's-book-like trivia boxes titled ''Did You Know?'' and lots of color photos of the Bushes posing with blacks and troops, its 52 pages require a reading level closer to ''My Pet Goat'' than ''The Stranger.''
 This document is the literary correlative to ''Mission Accomplished.'' Bush kept America safe (provided his presidency began Sept. 12, 2001). He gave America record economic growth (provided his presidency ended December 2007). He vanquished all the leading Qaeda terrorists (if you don't count the leaders bin Laden and al-Zawahri). He gave Afghanistan a thriving ''market economy'' (if you count its skyrocketing opium trade) and a ''democratically elected president'' (presiding over one of the world's most corrupt governments). He supported elections in Pakistan (after propping up Pervez Musharraf past the point of no return). He ''led the world in providing food aid and natural disaster relief'' (if you leave out Brownie and Katrina). 
 If this is the best case that even Bush and his handlers can make for his achievements, you wonder why they bothered. Desperate for padding, they devote four risible pages to portraying our dear leader as a zealous environmentalist. 
 But the brazenness of Bush's alternative-reality history is itself revelatory. The audacity of its hype helps clear up the mystery of how someone so slight could inflict so much damage. So do hismanyprintandtelevisionexitinterviews. 
 The man who emerges is a narcissist with no self-awareness whatsoever. It's that arrogance that allowed him to tune out even the most calamitous of realities, freeing him to compound them without missing a step. The president who famously couldn't name a single mistake of his presidency at a press conference in 2004 still can't.
 He can, however, blame everyone else. Asked (by Charles Gibson) if he feels any responsibility for the economic meltdown, Bush says, ''People will realize a lot of the decisions that were made on Wall Street took place over a decade or so, before I arrived.'' Asked if the 2008 election was a repudiation of his administration, he says ''it was a repudiation of Republicans.'' 
 ''The attacks of September the 11th came out of nowhere,'' he said in another interview, as if he hadn't ignored frantic intelligence warnings that summer of a Qaeda attack. But it was an ''intelligence failure,'' not his relentless invocation of patently fictitious ''mushroom clouds,'' that sped us into Iraq. Did he take too long to change course in Iraq? ''What seems like an eternity today,'' he says, ''may seem like a moment tomorrow.'' Try telling that to the families of the thousands killed and maimed during that multiyear ''moment'' as Bush stubbornly stayed his disastrous course.
 The crowning personality tic revealed by Bush's final propaganda push is his bottomless capacity for self-pity. ''I was a wartime president, and war is very exhausting,'' he told C-Span. ''The president ends up carrying a lot of people's grief in his soul,'' he told Gibson. And so when he visits military hospitals, ''it's always been a healing experience,'' he told The Wall Street Journal. But, incredibly enough, it's his own healing he is concerned about, not that of the grievously wounded men and women he sent to war on false pretenses. It's ''the comforter in chief'' who ''gets comforted,'' he explained, by ''the character of the American people.'' The American people are surely relieved to hear it.
 With this level of self-regard, it's no wonder that Bush could remain undeterred as he drove the country off a cliff. The smugness is reinforced not just by his history as the entitled scion of one of America's aristocratic dynasties but also by his conviction that his every action is blessed from on high. Asked last month by an interviewer what he has learned from his time in office, he replied: ''I've learned that God is good. All the time.''
 Once again he is shifting the blame. This presidency was not about Him. Bush failed because in the end it was all about him.

HEADLINE: Shaking Up the Boardroom at World Government Inc.

BYLINE: By JAMES TRAUB. 
James Traub is a contributing writer for The Times Magazine and director of policy for the Global Center for the Responsibility to Protect.

 BODY:
Even before Israel launched attacks on Gaza last week, Barack Obama's incoming national security team understood that the consuming demands of crises could all too easily eclipse the transformational agenda on foreign affairs that Mr. Obama advanced during the campaign. 
 The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, instability in Pakistan and the threat of nuclear proliferation in Iran would have been more than enough to crowd out any thought of long-range planning. Now the Middle East is in flames again. And yet a wide range of foreign policy experts are urging the new president to look beyond the smoke and the bloodshed -- indeed, to leverage the pervasive sense of crisis -- to reshape the world's governing structures. 
 Those structures -- the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, among others -- date from World War II's end, when the victors enjoyed a monopoly on economic and political power, and the state system seemed impregnable. We no longer live in such a world. Vivid proof that we don't came in November, when President Bush, no dreamer of multilateral dreams, convened the ''G-20'' to deal with the financial crisis. 
 Until then, the planet's executive board had been known since it first assembled in 1975 as the Group of 7, or G-7 (G-8, when Russia attended). Robert Hormats, a former Treasury and State Department official present that first meeting, notes that for a long time the Western powers ''could manage the global economy among themselves.'' Now, he says, ''it's inconceivable.''
 China is by far the United States' biggest creditor; emerging nations like China, India, Brazil and Indonesia now account for most of the world's economic growth. The G-20 will meet again in April. By the time the G-8 convenes in Rome two months later, it may be all but defunct; Italy, this year's host, is considering whether to throw open the meeting to new members.
 Reinvention is in the air. Last January, Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain delivered a major speech in New Delhi in which he observed that globalization had brought new powers -- like India -- to the fore; he called for a new ''creation'' moment that would include changes in the composition of the postwar institutions and new mechanisms to deal with climate change, poverty, energy and nuclear nonproliferation.
 Many major diplomatic figures from both parties have been linked to such calls. Mr. Hormats, who served in the Reagan administration, was co-host of a recent event at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace: ''Present at the Creation 2.0: How Reinventing the International System Could Become One of the Central Legacies of the Obama Administration.'' Brent Scowcroft, former national security advisor to George H. W. Bush, says, ''We ought to have institutions that reflect the world we live in.'' It's the new realism.
 Indeed, the postwar institutions look increasingly like the Social Register, full of yesterday's great names. It's not just Italy in the G-8. Switzerland, the Netherlands and Belgium all have seats on the I.M.F. board (where they also represent other nations); Singapore and South Africa do not. China does, but it has barely more votes than Canada. 
 Far more provocative to the developing world is the composition of the United Nations Security Council, whose roster of veto-bearing permanent members has not changed since inception; the West still holds three of the five permanent seats. 
 Barack Obama, unlike his predecessor, views the United Nations as an essential instrument of American foreign policy, but he may find his initiatives blocked by third-world bitterness at the West's outsize influence. United Nations experts say he would win himself enormous good will if he openly supported Security Council seats for the current aspirants: India, Brazil, Germany, Japan and perhaps South Africa. 
 Would an enlarged Security Council help President Obama cut the Gordian knot in the Middle East? Alas, no. The United Nations plays only a marginal role now in adjudicating between Israel and Palestine, for whom the White House and select Middle Eastern powers will continue to be the interlocutors of choice. Nor could a new Security Council resolve tensions created by one of its permanent members, like an increasingly restive and bellicose Russia. 
 Another problem is the zero-sum nature of power. In a recent editorial, Sebastian Mallaby, an international economist at the Council on Foreign Relations, pointed out that the best way to persuade China to stop promoting exports by undervaluing its currency would be to give China ''a much bigger voice'' in the I.M.F. But, he noted, European countries have been reluctant to accept a smaller voice.
 I.M.F. reform will look like a walk in the park compared to the Security Council. The last time the United Nations made a serious run at expanding the council, in 2005, every candidate had its own sworn enemy -- generally a neighbor. Some advocates have suggested that Washington focus first on limiting the use of the veto and only later on inducting new members. Even that, however, would require an enormous diplomatic effort. 
 What's more, making an organization more representative does not necessarily make it more effective. The financial crisis has demonstrated the need for new global regulatory mechanisms. These will now be assembled according to instructions from developing-world finance ministers as well as those from the West. Will that make them more sound? Given the resistance last November of many G-20 members to stricter accounting standards, the answer is, ''Not necessarily.'' And since India, Brazil and South Africa, though thriving democracies, typically vote with the autocracies of the ''nonaligned movement'' on human rights, it's easy to imagine that the wished-for Security Council could be more ''legitimate'' but less effective even than the currently not-very-effective version. 
 Still, what's the alternative? The West wants China, Russia and the emerging economies to view themselves as responsible global players. That means giving them a stake in the system, and hoping that having stakes will make them better stakeholders. 
 The advocates of reinvention seem to have the merits on their side. But the central issue for an incoming administration is less, ''Is it right?'' than, ''How much effort is it worth?'' How important is it to create and reform these new structures, compared to crisis management? Transition officials were asked that question, and declined to comment.
 Of course, the United Nations can wait, while peace in the Middle East can't. But there is also another way of looking at the question: an administration that wants to work through institutions, as opposed to ''coalitions of the willing,'' will have to choose between reforming those institutions and watching them decline into irrelevance. 
 In other words, change is coming willy-nilly. The question, says David Rothkopf, a national security expert and consultant who is an apostle of reinvention, is: ''Do we allow it to happen at its own pace, uncoordinated, incrementally, or do we see this as an opportunity and produce a new vision for an international system that advances U.S. interests in the same way that the post-World War II vision did for 60 years?''

HEADLINE: A Donor's Gift Soon Followed Clinton's Help

BYLINE: By CHARLIE SAVAGE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
An upstate New York developer donated $100,000 to former President Bill Clinton's foundation in November 2004, around the same time that Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton helped secure millions of dollars in federal assistance for the businessman's mall project.
 Mrs. Clinton helped enact legislation allowing the developer, Robert J. Congel, to use tax-exempt bonds to help finance the construction of the Destiny USA entertainment and shopping complex, an expansion of the Carousel Center in Syracuse. 
 Mrs. Clinton also helped secure a provision in a highway bill that set aside $5 million for Destiny USA roadway construction.
 The bill with the tax-free bonds provision became law in October 2004, weeks before the donation, and the highway bill with the set-aside became law in August 2005, about nine months after the donation. 
 Mr. Congel and Philippe Reines, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, both said there was no connection between his donation and her legislative work on his project's behalf. Mr. Reines said Mrs. Clinton supported the expansion of Carousel mall ''purely as part of her unwavering commitment to improving upstate New York's struggling economy, and nothing more.'' 
 Mr. Clinton set up his foundation as he was leaving the White House and as his wife was transforming herself from first lady to United States senator from New York. The William J. Clinton Foundation finances Mr. Clinton's presidential library in Little Rock, Ark., as well as programs that work on AIDS, poverty, climate change and other causes worldwide.
 Donations to charities favored by lawmakers have been a recent ethics flashpoint in Congress, including the controversy over Representative Charles B. Rangel's fund-raising from businesses with interests before the House Ways and Means Committee, which he leads, for a center named after him at the City College of New York. In 2007, Congress enacted a law requiring companies and their lobbyists to disclose donations to charities associated with lawmakers.
 But there is no law requiring former presidents to disclose money they collect for their foundations. 
 Mr. Clinton's foundation last month revealed the identity of its donors as part of an agreement with President-elect Barack Obama, who selected Mrs. Clinton as his nominee for secretary of state. 
 Most of the attention on the disclosure list has focused on millions of dollars donated by foreign tycoons and Middle Eastern governments, like Saudi Arabia, which have an interest in the United States foreign policy that Mrs. Clinton would direct as the nation's chief diplomat. 
 But lower on the list was Mr. Congel's name, one of about 180 people who had donated $50,000 to $100,000. A Destiny USA spokesman said Mr. Congel made a $100,000 donation in November 2004.
 ''There was no connection with Bill Clinton and the 'green bonds' and the contribution,'' Mr. Congel said in an interview. ''None at all.''
 Mr. Congel had been a prime force behind Congress's passage of tax-exempt ''green bonds,'' a program to lower the financing costs of some $2 billion in environmentally friendly projects by exempting lenders from paying federal taxes on their income from the private bonds. By some estimates, the program could cost the Treasury about $200 million. 
 The way the legislation was written, Mr. Congel's Syracuse development, which he agreed to build and run in a way that promotes renewable energy and recycling, was one of just a handful of projects that would qualify. 
 His contribution is the only known situation so far in which an American donor gave a large sum to Mr. Clinton's foundation while benefiting from his wife's official actions. Mr. Reines said that Mrs. Clinton did not solicit the donation from Mr. Congel or discuss it with him or anyone on his behalf, and that she was unaware of its timing and size until last month.
 Mrs. Clinton, who as a Senate candidate in 2000 supported other tax breaks for a Carousel mall expansion to create jobs, did not work alone in getting the subsidies through Congress. The measures had other supporters in the New York delegation, including Senator Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat, and James T. Walsh, Syracuse's Republican representative at the time. 
 And the ''green bonds'' were backed by lawmakers from three other states with projects that would qualify for it.
 Still, Mrs. Clinton threw her weight behind the legislation. In April 2006, she took partial credit for enacting the program in an interview with The Post-Standard of Syracuse.
 ''I've been a big supporter of Destiny,'' Mrs. Clinton told the newspaper. ''I worked successfully to get the green bonds passed. I think it would be a big shot in the arm. It would be a destination site for the area.''
 And in July 2005, when the highway bill cleared the Senate, Mrs. Clinton's office put out a news release announcing the ''$5 million that Senators Schumer and Clinton secured'' for Destiny-related ''design, research, construction and improvements.'' 
 Although Mr. Congel has sometimes given money to Democrats, he is a major Republican campaign fund-raiser. In 2004, he was a ''Bush Ranger,'' gathering more than $200,000 in bundled contributions for the Bush-Cheney re-election effort. 
 In the most recent election cycle, he donated money to the Republican National Committee and to the Republican presidential primary campaigns of Rudolph W. Giuliani, Fred D. Thompson and Mitt Romney.
 But Mr. Congel said there was nothing incongruous about his donation to Mr. Clinton's foundation. ''I have a huge interest in our country, and I thought Clinton was a great president,'' Mr. Congel said. He added, ''I think he's a dedicated, dedicated American, and I'm a dedicated, dedicated American, and when we have a president I think we have a right, privilege and obligation to support that president. And I did that with Clinton, and I did that with Bush.''
 Mr. Congel also said he wanted to get to know Mr. Clinton because he was thinking of setting up his own foundation, devoted to environmental causes, and wanted the former president's advice. Mr. Congel said he had not yet set up such a foundation, though a Destiny USA spokesman later added that Mr. Congel had attended several Clinton Global Initiative events.
 Mr. Congel has also given campaign donations to Mrs. Clinton and other New York Democrats, including Mr. Schumer. 
 According to the Federal Election Commission Web site, Mr. Congel gave $2,000 to Mrs. Clinton's campaign in October 1999 and gave her political action committee a total of $12,500 from March 2002 to January 2005. He has continued to donate to Mrs. Clinton's campaigns in the years since the two bills helping Destiny USA passed.
 Mr. Congel's campaign contributions to Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Schumer were the subject of news media reports around the time that the ''green bonds'' measure passed. But his $100,000 donation to Mr. Clinton's foundation in November 2004 was not known at the time.
 Keith Ashdown, the chief investigator for Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonprofit group, said the money illustrated why donations to presidential foundations should be disclosed. 
 The Destiny USA project has attracted criticism. Stephanie Miner, a member of the Syracuse City Council, called it a ''boondoggle'' that won tax breaks with dubious economic and environmental promises.
 But a Destiny USA spokesman said the savings from the tax-exempt bonds is paying for extra ''green'' elements -- like recycled construction materials, solar power panels and an efficient climate control system -- whose cost a lender normally would not have approved.

HEADLINE: Colorado Senate Pick Vows Innovative Spirit

BYLINE: By DAN FROSCH

DATELINE: DENVER 

 BODY:
Michael F. Bennet, newly designated to fill a United States Senate seat from Colorado, said Saturday that he would go to Washington with the approach that ''there is no challenge without a solution and no problem too tough to withstand innovative thinking.'' 
 The state's governor, Bill Ritter Jr., named Mr. Bennet, who is the superintendent of the Denver Public Schools, as his choice to take over for Senator Ken Salazar. President-elect Barack Obama has tapped Mr. Salazar, a Democrat elected in 2004, to become interior secretary in his administration.
 ''I am humbled by the faith Governor Ritter has in me,'' said Mr. Bennet, a lawyer and now a rising star in Democratic circles here. ''This is the privilege of a lifetime.'' 
 Mr. Bennet, flanked by his wife, Susan Daggett, and their three young daughters, said he would focus on health care, the economy and education, and he promised to provide more policy details in the coming weeks. His positions on most prominent issues are relatively unknown. 
 ''Innovative thinking, pragmatic problem solving and bringing people together have been the hallmarks of my career,'' he said.
 Mr. Ritter's choice of Mr. Bennet, 44, came as a surprise when it was first reported on Friday, as several higher profile Colorado Democrats had been mentioned as possible candidates. Mr. Salazar's brother, John, who is a congressman, as well as fellow Representative Ed Perlmutter and Mayor John Hickenlooper of Denver, were all widely viewed as strong possibilities.
 Mr. Bennet was not as well known, having served as public schools superintendent since 2005, after two years as chief of staff for Mr. Hickenlooper.
 But it was Mr. Bennet's position as public schools chief that earned him prominence. 
 Mr. Bennet, who had been the managing director of a Denver investment company and served as counsel to the deputy attorney general in the Clinton administration, was able to help turn around a school system replete with problems despite his having little experience as an education administrator. Under his watch, grading systems were changed to highlight students' strengths and weaknesses, and performance on standardized tests, particularly in math and reading proficiency, improved. He has also been a proponent of a merit-based pay system for teachers. 
 ''An innovator in the public and private sectors, he has shown himself willing to challenge old thinking and stale policies,'' Mr. Obama said of Mr. Bennet in a statement. ''His breakthrough work at the helm of Denver's schools has reflected that commitment, and established Michael as one of the nation's leading education reformers.'' 
 Mr. Bennet will serve out the remaining two years of Mr. Salazar's term if he is confirmed as interior secretary.

HEADLINE: A New Chapter: Europe Is Ready to Work With Obama

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER and HELENE COOPER; Steven Lee Myers contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
After rebuffing the Bush administration on a number of fronts, European governments are signaling that they may be more willing to engage with the incoming Obama administration on a variety of stalled issues, including taking in prisoners from the Guantanamo Bay detention center and strengthening sanctions against Iran.
 But it may not be all honeymoon: European diplomats say they will push President-elect Barack Obama to soothe Russian anger over plans to establish missile defense bases in Europe. And American officials say that the Obama administration is certain to press countries to fulfill, or even increase, pledges for personnel and equipment for the NATO mission in Afghanistan, long a point of tension among allies. 
 ''There are expectations across Europe that the United States will be asking more,'' one senior American official said. ''The question is whether decisive amounts will come.''
 One issue that may be back on the table is resettling detainees from the Guantanamo Bay prison camp. Though there is still not consensus among European governments, several, led by Germany and Portugal, have said that they will consider taking in detainees if Mr. Obama follows through on his promise to close the Guantanamo prison. 
 Such a move would remove a major stumbling block to closing the camp and would represent a reversal on the part of European allies who have rejected requests by President Bush to resettle detainees. 
 Thomas Steg, a spokesman for the German government, said that such a deal would hinge on Mr. Obama's closing the military prison, and that even then, ''if we begin to review such closure plans and take a stance, then it can only be in a European context based on a discussion with all member states.''
 The French Foreign Ministry has also called for a common European Union policy on how to deal with the Guantanamo prisoners, and some European diplomats have said they will begin working toward such a plan.
 Reports about European countries' willingness to consider accepting some detainees from Guantanamo after Mr. Obama's inauguration have clearly irked the Bush administration, which has been intensively lobbying them to do so. 
 ''If European countries are willing to take detainees from Guantanamo, that'd be a constructive step,'' said Dana M. Perino, the White House press secretary. ''We've been asking them to do so for years. We're glad they're finally willing to share in this important responsibility in the global war on terror.''
 Sean McCormack, the State Department spokesman, said he believed that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice should get the credit for the European turnaround.
 ''I can't speak to motivations on the part of Germany or any other country, but I would say that this change in attitude hasn't come about overnight, and really is the result of just an awful lot of hard work by Secretary Rice,'' Mr. McCormack said. 
 He said that Portugal, in particular, ''should be praised for what they have done in sort of blazing a trail for a new European attitude in this regard.'' 
 Luis Amado, the foreign minister of Portugal, recently called on European governments to help the United States shut down Guantanamo by taking in detainees from third countries.
 European diplomats said privately that their willingness to help Mr. Obama on Guantanamo went beyond a honeymoon strategy. Some say that helping to re-establish the camp's prisoners would allow their countries to re-establish credibility with their Muslim populations at home.
 America's allies may also be more willing to help out Mr. Obama on Iran -- providing he makes good on his promise to allow his administration to engage directly with Iranian officials without preconditions, one European diplomat said.
 The United States, along with Europe, Russia and China, has been trying to get Iran to abandon its nuclear program through a mixture of economic sanctions and incentives, with no success so far. Bush administration officials have complained that part of the problem has been that Germany, Russia and China in particular have been unwilling to impose punitive sanctions against Iran. 
 But those countries might be more willing to toughen the sanctions against Iran if Mr. Obama ''softens the atmosphere,'' the diplomat said, by talking directly with Iranian officials -- a change that European negotiators have long pushed for. ''It would be easier to make the case then that we are trying everything,'' the European diplomat said.
 In exchange, America's allies are certain to expect a certain quid pro quo from the Obama administration, in particular on missile defense plans, according to European diplomats.
 The Kremlin has responded with outrage to the Bush administration's plans to place two American missile defense bases in Europe, one in Poland and one in the Czech Republic, and senior Russian generals have even threatened military retaliation against NATO members.
 Alarmed by the rising tension, European diplomats say they will ask the Obama administration -- in particular Hillary Rodham Clinton, nominated to be secretary of state -- to take a more conciliatory line toward Moscow.
 While Mr. Obama has not stated his specific policy plans on missile defense, he has routinely expressed great skepticism over financing the system until its abilities have been proved.
 On the war in Afghanistan, however, Mr. Obama has been outspoken in pushing for a bigger military effort against the Taliban. A particularly clear signal was sent by his decision to keep Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, who has called for more emphasis on Afghanistan -- and who has made headlines with what some frustrated NATO alliance partners have called his ''megaphone diplomacy'' of criticizing NATO nations for not doing more. 
 NATO has not met its pledges for combat troops, nor for the vitally important transport helicopters, military trainers and other support personnel. Mr. Gates has insisted that commitments made by NATO allies should be filled by alliance partners -- even by those nations who resist direct combat roles.
 To meet commanders' requests for more combat troops, the Obama administration is expected to deploy 20,000 to 30,000 additional American troops to Afghanistan, a significant portion within six months.

HEADLINE: Recession, Taxes and Mr. Obama

 BODY:
A year into the recession, millions of Americans have already lost their jobs, their incomes and their homes. Millions more are having their peace of mind tested daily by the certainty of harder times to come. Yet as the recession deepens, one small group could actually catch a break: the richest Americans, who are likely to see a proposed tax increase postponed. 
 During the campaign, President-elect Barack Obama pledged to raise taxes, starting in 2009, on roughly the top 5 percent of American households, generally defined as those making more than $250,000 a year. The objective was to restore fairness and raise revenue by undoing Bush-era tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefited the rich while worsening the budget deficit.
 The Obama team has not officially ditched that plan. But it is sounding increasingly reluctant to move soon. A delay is supported by the conventional wisdom that raising any taxes during a downturn is wrong. 
 That argument starts with the correct premise that a stalled economy needs all the juice it can get, hence the need for the roughly $800 billion recovery package to spur consumption and create jobs, taking shape in Congress and championed by Mr. Obama. But not all tax increases are damaging in a recession. An increase could help if it raised more in revenue than it subtracted in consumption and if that revenue was used for stimulus. 
 That sounds like the very definition of a tax increase for the richest Americans. The wealthy are unlikely to slow their consumption much if their income tax rates return -- as Mr. Obama has proposed -- to their pre-Bush levels (an increase from rates of 33 and 35 percent to 36 and 39.6 percent).
 We know that higher taxes are never an easy sell politically -- and would be especially difficult now, when Mr. Obama needs support from Republicans in Congress to quickly pass his recovery package. 
 We also acknowledge that a tax increase on the rich, though feasible, could backfire in these tense times. Because it is hard to explain and easy to demagogue, it could foster a confusing debate that might impair confidence just when confidence needs to be revived. 
 But even if he skips the income tax increase this year, Mr. Obama must press for increases in coming years. The fight for tax fairness -- and for the practice of paying for government services rather than borrowing or printing money -- must be a goal in itself, rather than becoming a perennial bargaining chip. 
 To that end, Mr. Obama should move forward in 2009 to close loopholes and make other long overdue changes in tax law. As promised during the campaign, he should push to alter the outmoded provision that has allowed private equity partners to pay about the lowest rate in the tax code on most of their multimillion-dollar earnings. He should also push for freezing the tax on multimillion-dollar estates at current levels, rather than letting the tax expire as scheduled in 2010. 
 Stimulus spending is front and center now, but over all, the nation needs far more tax revenue, generated more progressively. Mr. Obama needs to establish himself from the start as a proponent of fair and adequate taxation -- just as he promised during the campaign.

HEADLINE: American Troops Wound Woman in Baghdad

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON; Tareq Maher and Riyadh Mohammed contributed reporting.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD 

 BODY:
A woman was shot and badly wounded in Baghdad by American soldiers last week when she failed to respond to repeated warnings, according to a military statement. 
 The military said the woman, who was shot Thursday, had been ''acting erratically,'' adding that suicide bombers had recently taken aim at the area where the shooting occurred. 
 The woman who was shot, Hadeel Emad, is a 24-year-old editor for the Biladi satellite television channel, said Muhsin Kadem, a spokesman for the channel. 
 She suffered severe internal bleeding and organ damage, Mr. Kadem said, and she was taken by the Iraqi security forces to a hospital, where one of her kidneys was removed. 
 The American military said that it and Iraqi security officials were investigating the shooting.
 On Saturday, Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq, on a visit to Iran, told state television there that his government would not allow Iraq to be used as a base to threaten its neighbors, according to Reuters. Mr. Maliki added that Iraq, which fought a war with Iran in the 1980s, would be an ''axis for positive relations with Iran.''
 Mr. Maliki met with the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, on Saturday to discuss Iraq's progress. After the meeting, Mr. Maliki said that Iraq needed to ''increase political and economic ties'' with its neighbors because of mutual interests, the Iranian news agency IRNA reported.
 Mr. Ahmadinejad reportedly added, ''What is important for the Islamic Republic of Iran is Iraq's independence, construction, security as well as development.''

HEADLINE: Kennedy Was Spared Financial Disclosure as a Top Aide at City Schools

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
Like it or not, roughly 7,000 employees of New York City file 32-page disclosure forms each year divulging personal information about their family finances in an effort to bolster confidence in open government. 
 But when Caroline Kennedy was employed by the city Department of Education from 2002 to 2004, as the chief executive of the Office of Strategic Partnerships, she was not required to file, even though two people who worked for her had to disclose information about their finances.
 City officials have offered a variety of explanations over the last few weeks why Ms. Kennedy did not have to meet this filing requirement despite her title and the responsibilities she has cited in her efforts to convince the public that she has the experience to take Hillary Rodham Clinton's seat in the Senate. 
 City officials have most often pointed to Ms. Kennedy's decision to accept $1-a-year in salary. More recently, Joel I. Klein, chancellor of New York's schools, explained that she was ultimately exempt from the requirement because the department did not deem her to be a ''policymaker.''
 On Friday, Ms. Kennedy's spokesman, Stefan Friedman, declined to comment on the issue. 
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a billionaire who takes $1 a year from the city, is required to file disclosure forms each year. At least three of his appointees who have worked for nothing over the years have also filed -- a sometimes awkward process, but one intended to serve as a conflict-of-interest safeguard for city officials and the public.
 Ms. Kennedy's finances have been a source of curiosity since she entered the contest to be named New York's next senator. She has property in New York and on Martha's Vineyard, and estimates of their worth have varied greatly. Great wealth, of course, can be an asset in an age of expensive campaigns. 
 Until 2004, public servants were generally required to file disclosure forms if they were officers or directors of agencies or if their salaries indicated high-level responsibility. That year, the city was able to shrink the rolls of those required to file by scrapping the salary test, and instead declaring that anyone holding a policymaking position had to file, regardless of income.
 The city even spelled out what it meant to be considered a policymaker: someone who has ''major responsibilities and exercises independent judgment in connection with determining important agency matters.''
 ''Public servants with substantial policy discretion include, but are not limited to, agency heads, deputy agency heads, assistant agency heads and public servants in charge of any major office, division, bureau or unit of an agency,'' according to the city. Each agency or department makes the initial determination of who should be deemed a policymaker. The list is then subject to the review of the city's conflicts-of-interest board, which has ultimate responsibility for collecting the annual forms and making them available to the public. 
 Though the Education Department is supposed to follow the same rules as every other arm of city government, it has issued its own regulations over the years as to who must file. The conflicts-of-interest board has not protested the department's decisions regarding the Office of Strategic Partnerships, which Ms. Kennedy headed.
 Last week, the board again referred all questions about the matter to the Education Department.
 The department's own written regulations make no mention of a class of ''policymakers'' who must file. Instead, it notes that employees have to file if they are in the management pay plan or have responsibilities over ''contracts, leases, franchises, concessions and applications for variances and special permits'' or if they are ''serving in sensitive, confidential positions.'' 
 In interviews, Ms. Kennedy has said that should she be chosen for the Senate job, she is ''going to comply with every kind of disclosure that's available.''
 When she first went to work for Mr. Klein in October 2002, the job was a break from her former low profile. With fanfare, Mr. Klein put Ms. Kennedy in charge of raising money for the public schools from private sources, and said she would work closely with the department's affiliated nonprofit organization, the Fund for Public Schools. 
 The department also announced that she would be in charge of the office of special adviser for the arts, and volunteer efforts like tutoring and mentoring. The next year's official guide to New York City government listed Ms. Kennedy fifth from the top on the list of executives in the office of the chancellor. 
 By the middle of 2003, the department announced that Ms. Kennedy had second thoughts about accepting the $90,000 salary initially offered and would instead work for $1 a year.
 City officials told The Daily News that July that she alone among those who had elected to forgo a paycheck would not be filing disclosure forms for the prior year because ''the Ed Department deleted salary specifications from Kennedy's specially created post.'' 
 But people who drew nominal salaries at other city agencies at the time were still required to file. Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff filed, as did Andrew Alper, then serving as chief of the Economic Development Corporation. 
 ''The department determined that she did not fall into any of the categories in the pre-2004 disclosure law,'' that governed the filing for 2002, said Michael Best, the general counsel for the Department of Education. Likewise, he said, Ms. Kennedy was not obliged to file for 2003 or 2004 because ''she did not fit into any of the categories'' once the law changed and the department concluded that ''she did not have any policymaking position at the Department of Education.'' 
 In August 2004, Ms. Kennedy announced that she was quitting her post in city government, though she continues to raise millions of dollars for the schools through her role as vice chairwoman of the board of the Fund for Public Schools. 
 While her departure from the city's rolls cut short the debate over whether she should have been filing, two of those who worked for her were not spared.
 Aida Bekele, a lawyer who reported that she was making $115,000 a year as chief of staff for the Office of Strategic Partnerships in 2003, had to file disclosure forms for 2003. So did Charissa Fernandez, who listed herself that year as a director of the Office of Strategic Partnerships, making $100,000 a year.

HEADLINE: OBAMA CONSIDERS MAJOR EXPANSION IN AID TO JOBLESS

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES and CARL HULSE; Jackie Calmes reported from Chicago, and Carl Hulse from Washington. David M. Herszenhorn contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
President-elect Barack Obama and Congressional Democrats are considering major expansions of government-assisted health care insurance and unemployment compensation as they begin intensive work this week on a two-year economic recovery package.
 One proposal, as described by Democratic advisers, would extend unemployment compensation to part-time workers, an idea that Congressional Republicans have blocked in the past.
 Other policy changes would subsidize employers' expenses for temporarily continuing health insurance coverage to laid-off and retired workers and their dependents, as mandated under a 22-year-old federal law known as Cobra, and allow workers who lose jobs that did not come with insurance benefits to be eligible, for the first time, to apply for Medicaid coverage.
 The proposals indicate the sorts of potentially long-range changes that Mr. Obama intends to push in his promised American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan, as he named it in his weekly Saturday address on the radio and YouTube. They will be combined with one-time measures that are more typical of federal stimulus packages to jump-start a weak economy, like spending for roads and other job-creating public works projects. 
 As the economy worsened in the weeks after Mr. Obama's election, advisers and Congressional leaders suggested that a stimulus plan would be ready by the new year for House votes this week. But the House is not expected to vote until next week at the earliest, which will most likely push final action into February, Democratic aides said.
 The aides said delays were probably inevitable given the holiday interruptions, the big ambitions of the undertaking and internal tensions over the plan's components and their costs.
 Obama advisers have said the package will carry a total cost of at least $775 billion.
 Still, Democrats are wary of slowing down the economic stimulus by provoking the opposition of Republicans, who have warned in recent days that the package must be neither excessive nor rushed. They are also fielding concerns from fiscally conservative Democrats.
 In his address on Saturday, Mr. Obama, just off a two-week vacation, also announced that, as expected, he would begin meeting in Washington on Monday with Congressional leaders of both parties in a bid for bipartisan cooperation.
 ''Economists from across the political spectrum agree that if we don't act swiftly and boldly,'' Mr. Obama said, ''we could see a much deeper economic downturn that could lead to double digit unemployment and the American dream slipping further and further out of reach.''
 Mr. Obama has pledged to ''create or save'' three million jobs over the next two years. In his address, he omitted the word ''save,'' suggesting he would create three million jobs, a goal that many economists consider unattainable under current conditions.
 His plan, he said in his address, would ''put people back to work today and reduce our dependence on foreign oil tomorrow'' through spending and tax incentives to double production of renewable energy; make government buildings more energy efficient; build and renovate roads, bridges and schools; and modernize health care technology.
 A main factor slowing down the Obama team's drafting, it is now apparent, has been the difficulty of reconciling his sometimes conflicting directives.
 The president-elect called for including in the plan only proposals that would quickly stimulate the economy. Typically that means one-time spending that gets money into consumers' hands quickly to spark demand for goods and services.
 Both Mr. Obama and Congressional leaders are intent on keeping the price tag below the politically charged figure of $1 trillion.
 In the emerging Obama plan, such items will include $140 billion to $200 billion in relief to states to offset their budget-busting costs for Medicaid and education; extension of unemployment compensation for former full-time workers, which runs out in March; and billions of dollars for construction projects that Mr. Obama has called ''shovel ready.''
 But Mr. Obama has also said his recovery plan must make down-payments on his campaign promises for permanent changes that will reshape the economy, especially for the good of low-wage and middle-class workers. Such changes could carry permanent costs for new energy, education, health care and tax policies.
 For example, Mr. Obama previously indicated that he would seek money to develop a national energy grid to harness and distribute power from wind, water and other local alternative energy sources.
 Additional money to subsidize local governments' education costs in the downturn could become a fixture, increasing the once-small federal role beyond its expansion under President Bush. Besides money for school construction and renovations, Congressional aides said they expected an increase in financing to educate students with disabilities and special needs. Officials also are exploring potential increases for Head Start childhood education programs and Pell Grant scholarships for college students.
 Rather than propose a one-time tax rebate for all but the most affluent Americans, Mr. Obama is likely to propose what he called during his campaign a ''Making Work Pay'' tax credit of $500 for eligible individuals and $1,000 for couples. Those who earn too little to pay federal income taxes would receive the credit in the form of a check, intended to offset the payroll taxes they pay for Social Security and Medicare. 
 Disputes also are percolating in the Obama camp and between Congressional committees over what constitutes spending earmarks for special projects, which Mr. Obama has sworn to oppose. The disputes are similar to, if less testy than, past tiffs between Mr. Bush and Congress.
 Democratic leaders in Congress say they are serious about helping Mr. Obama keep the emerging legislation free of the pork-barrel projects that could invite criticism from Republicans and foster public skepticism.
 ''Every dollar will have to be justified as to whether it is targeted to our economy,'' Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, said last week. ''This is not a bill that will be an excuse to put things in that otherwise might not be justified.''
 To get around Mr. Obama's potential objections, some lawmakers are including projects that Congress previously authorized but failed to pass in appropriations. In a 41-page memorandum, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee has outlined $85 billion in previously authorized infrastructure spending over two years, including $30.2 billion for highway projects and $12 billion for local public transportation.
 The House approved money for many of the projects in September as part of a $61 billion stimulus package that was blocked by Republicans in the Senate.
 Still, officials said the size of the proposed two-year stimulus, equivalent to nearly a year of federal discretionary spending, had tested imaginations both in Congress and the Obama camp. Aides and advisers are struggling to identify enough projects that would meet Mr. Obama's criteria that they be truly stimulative, create jobs and not be open to being branded as pork.
 ''This has really forced people to think outside the box,'' one aide on the House Appropriations Committee said, ''because this is more money than anybody expected to be spending.''
 Tensions on the opposite side involve demands from fiscally conservative Blue Dog Democrats in the House and from some Senate Democrats -- notablythe Senate Budget Committee chairman, Kent Conrad of North Dakota -- for provisions imposing budgetary controls on future spending and tax cuts for the long-term health of the economy.
 According to both sides, Obama officials have assured the fiscal conservatives that Mr. Obama would propose long-term controls in his first five-year budget, which is due by late February. But the Blue Dogs see the recovery package as their best chance to get budget reforms enacted quickly.
 While the fiscally conservative Democrats support deficit spending to jump-start the economy, ''these are debts that will have to be paid,'' said Representative Jim Cooper, Democrat of Tennessee. 
 ''We have to combine short-term stimulus with a focus on the long term,'' he continued.
 Among their ideas are a bipartisan commission to propose limits on future benefits for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, the entitlement programs whose projected future costs would squeeze out all other spending; a nonpartisan entity to designate infrastructure projects, like roads and public buildings, based on merit; and federal pay-as-you-go rules that require offsetting savings for spending increases and new tax cuts.

HEADLINE: As Vacant Office Space Grows, So Does the Crisis for Lenders

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Vacancy rates in office buildings exceed 10 percent in virtually every major city in the country and are rising rapidly, a sign of economic distress that could lead to yet another wave of problems for troubled lenders. 
 With job cuts rampant and businesses retrenching, more empty space is expected from New York to Chicago to Los Angeles in the coming year. Rental income would then decline and property values would slide further. The Urban Land Institute predicts 2009 will be the worst year for the commercial real estate market ''since the wrenching 1991-1992 industry depression.'' 
 Banks and other financial companies have not had the problems with commercial properties in this recession that they have had with residential properties. But many building owners, while struggling with more vacancies and less rental income, will need to refinance commercial mortgages this year. 
 The persistent chill in lending from banks to the credit markets will make that difficult -- even for borrowers who are current on their payments -- setting the stage for loan defaults. 
 The prospect bodes ill for banks, along with pension funds, insurance companies, hedge funds and others holding the loans or pieces of them that were packaged and sold as securities. 
 Jeffrey DeBoer, chief executive of the Real Estate Roundtable, a lobbying group in Washington, is asking for government assistance for his industry and warns of the potential impact of defaults. ''Each one by itself is not significant,'' he said, ''but the cumulative effect will put tremendous stress on the financial sector.''
 Stock analysts say commercial real estate is the next ticking time bomb for banks, which have already received hundreds of billions of dollars in capital and other assistance from the federal government. Big banks -- like Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley -- each hold tens of billions of dollars in commercial real estate securities. The banks also invested directly in properties. 
 Regional banks may be an even bigger concern. In the last decade, they barreled their way into commercial real estate lending after being elbowed out of the credit card and consumer mortgage business by national players. The proportion of their lending that is in commercial real estate has nearly doubled in the last six years, according to government data.
 Just as home loans were pooled, then carved up and sold to investors as securities over the last two decades, commercial property loans were repackaged for the financial markets. In 2006 and 2007, nearly 60 percent of commercial property loans were turned into securities, according to Trepp, a research firm that tracks mortgage-backed securities. 
 Now that the market for those securities has dried up, borrowers cannot easily roll over the loans that are coming due.
 Many commercial property owners will face a dilemma similar to that of today's homeowners who cannot easily get mortgage relief because their loans were sliced and sold to many different parties. There often is not a single entity with whom to negotiate, because investors have different interests. 
 By many accounts, building owners have been caught off guard by how quickly the market has deteriorated in recent weeks.
 Rising vacancy rates were expected in Orange County, Calif., a center of the subprime mortgage crisis, and New York, where the now shrinking financial industry dominates office space. But vacancies are also suddenly climbing in Houston and Dallas, which had been shielded from the economic downturn until recently by skyrocketing oil prices and expanding energy businesses. In Chicago, brokers say demand has dried up just as new office towers are nearing completion.
 ''The economic recession is so widespread that we believe virtually every market in the country will see a rise in vacancy rates of between 2 and 5 percentage points by mid-2009,'' said Bill Goade, chief executive of CresaPartners, which advises corporations on leasing and buying office space.
 There is no relief in sight for Orange County, where subprime lenders and title companies once dominated the market but are now shedding space because their business has dried up, and big banks are now shrinking because of a wave of mergers. The vacancy rate has soared from 7 percent at the end of 2006 to 18 percent, a rate that the Tampa area should match this month, local real estate brokers say.
 In New York, where rents had risen the highest as financial companies gobbled up office space, vacancy rates are floating above 10 percent for the first time in years. 
 What looked like the worst possible case a few weeks ago for Chicago now appears to be the most likely outcome, said Bill Rogers, a managing director at Jones Lang LaSalle, a real estate broker. The vacancy rate, which was fairly stable at 10 percent, is now rising quickly and could hit 17 percent in 2009, he said. ''A lot of companies are trying to shed excess space ahead of what is expected to be a worse market in 2009,'' Mr. Rogers said.
 Newmark Knight Frank, a real estate broker, expects the vacancy rate in Dallas to rise to 19 percent this year, from 16.3 percent. 
 Houston, like Dallas, held up while many other cities were showing the strains of an economic slowdown. But job growth and the brisk business of oil and gas exploration have come to an abrupt halt. 
 Vacant or unfinished shopping centers dot the highways. Among the 8.4 million square feet of office space under construction or recently completed in the metropolitan area, 80 percent has not been leased. As a result, the vacancy rate is 11 percent and rising.
 ''I see a wave of troubled assets coming out of Texas in the near future,'' said Dan Fasulo, managing director of Real Capital Analytics, a real estate research firm.
 Effective rents, after free rent and other landlord concessions, have already started to fall and are expected to decline 30 percent or more across the country from the euphoric days of the real estate boom, according to real estate brokers and analysts. 
 That is making it all the more difficult for owners, who projected ever-rising rents when they financed their office buildings, hotels, shopping centers and other commercial property. Owners typically pay only the interest on loans of 5, 7 or 10 years and refinance the big principal payments necessary when the loans come due. 
 Without new financing, owners will have few options other than to try to negotiate terms with their lenders or hand over the keys to banks and bondholders.
 Among commercial properties, the most troubled have been hotels and shopping centers, where anemic sales and bankruptcies by retailers are leading to more vacancies and where heavily leveraged mall operators, like General Growth Properties and Centro, are under intense pressure to sell assets. But analysts are increasingly worried about the office market.
 The Real Estate Roundtable sees a rising risk of default and foreclosure on an estimated $400 billion in commercial mortgages that come due this year. In recent weeks, a group led by the New York developer William Rudin has pleaded with Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, and others to have the government include commercial real estate in a new $200 billion program intended to spur lending.
 Mr. DeBoer, the roundtable's leader, said building owners are by and large making their loan payments. It is the refinancing that is worrisome.
 Most loans, he said, were made at 50 percent to 70 percent of property values. At the top of the market in 2006 and 2007, though, some owners took advantage of available credit and borrowed 90 percent or more of the value of a property, a strategy that works only in a rising market. Since then, property values have dropped 20 percent, Mr. DeBoer said.
 Where possible, owners are trying to extend loans. A lender might agree to extend the term on a 10-year commercial mortgage, for example, if the borrower remains current on payments and can make an equity payment to compensate for the decline in the building's value. 
 Already, $107 billion worth of office towers, shopping centers and hotels are in some form of distress, ranging from mortgage delinquency to foreclosure, according to a report by Real Capital Analytics. 
 New York, the biggest market by far, leads the pack with 268 troubled properties valued at $12 billion. But there are 19 more cities, including Atlanta, Denver and Seattle, with more than $1 billion worth of distressed commercial properties.
 Analysts are especially concerned about buildings like 666 Fifth Avenue, One Park Avenue and the Riverton complex in New York, the Pacifica Tower in San Diego and the Sears Tower in Chicago, which were acquired in 2006 and 2007 with mortgage-backed financing based on future rents rather than existing income. 
 ''Many of those buildings are basically underwater,'' said Mr. Goade of CresaPartners. ''The price they paid was too high to begin with. There's no way anyone would lend that kind of money today.''

HEADLINE: Google Hopes to Open a Trove of Little-Seen Books

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

DATELINE: MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. 

 BODY:
Ben Zimmer, executive producer of a Web site and software package called the Visual Thesaurus, was seeking the earliest use of the phrase ''you're not the boss of me.'' Using a newspaper database, he had found a reference from 1953. 
 But while using Google's book search recently, he found the phrase in a short story contained in ''The Church,'' a periodical published in 1883 and scanned from the Bodleian Library at Oxford.
 Ever since Google began scanning printed books four years ago, scholars and others with specialized interests have been able to tap a trove of information that had been locked away on the dusty shelves of libraries and in antiquarian bookstores. 
 According to Dan Clancy, the engineering director for Google book search, every month users view at least 10 pages of more than half of the one million out-of-copyright books that Google has scanned into its servers. 
 Google's book search ''allows you to look for things that would be very difficult to search for otherwise,'' said Mr. Zimmer, whose site is visualthesaurus.com.
 A settlement in October with authors and publishers who had brought two copyright lawsuits against Google will make it possible for users to read a far greater collection of books, including many still under copyright protection. 
 The agreement, pending approval by a judge this year, also paved the way for both sides to make profits from digital versions of books. Just what kind of commercial opportunity the settlement represents is unknown, but few expect it to generate significant profits for any individual author. Even Google does not necessarily expect the book program to contribute significantly to its bottom line.
 ''We did not think necessarily we could make money,'' said Sergey Brin, a Google founder and its president of technology, in a brief interview at the company's headquarters. ''We just feel this is part of our core mission. There is fantastic information in books. Often when I do a search, what is in a book is miles ahead of what I find on a Web site.''
 Revenue will be generated through advertising sales on pages where previews of scanned books appear, through subscriptions by libraries and others to a database of all the scanned books in Google's collection, and through sales to consumers of digital access to copyrighted books. Google will take 37 percent of this revenue, leaving 63 percent for publishers and authors.
 The settlement may give new life to copyrighted out-of-print books in a digital form and allow writers to make money from titles that had been out of commercial circulation for years. Of the seven million books Google has scanned so far, about five million are in this category. 
 Even if Google had gone to trial and won the suits, said Alexander Macgillivray, associate general counsel for products and intellectual property at the company, it would have won the right to show only previews of these books' contents. ''What people want to do is read the book,'' Mr. Macgillivray said. 
 Users are already taking advantage of out-of-print books that have been scanned and are available for free download. Mr. Clancy was monitoring search queries recently when one for ''concrete fountain molds'' caught his attention. The search turned up a digital version of an obscure 1910 book, and the user had spent four hours perusing 350 pages of it. 
 For scholars and others researching topics not satisfied by a Wikipedia entry, the settlement will provide access to millions of books at the click of a mouse. ''More students in small towns around America are going to have a lot more stuff at their fingertips,'' said Michael A. Keller, the university librarian at Stanford. ''That is really important.''
 When the agreement was announced in October, all sides hailed it as a landmark settlement that permitted Google to proceed with its scanning project while protecting the rights and financial interests of authors and publishers. Both sides agreed to disagree on whether the book scanning itself violated authors' and publishers' copyrights. 
 In the months since, all parties to the lawsuits -- as well as those, like librarians, who will be affected by it -- have had the opportunity to examine the 303-page settlement document and try to digest its likely effects. 
 Some librarians privately expressed fears that Google might charge high prices for subscriptions to the book database as it grows. Although nonprofit groups like the Open Content Alliance are building their own digital collections, no other significant private-sector competitors are in the business. In May, Microsoft ended its book scanning project, effectively leaving Google as a monopoly corporate player.
 David Drummond, Google's chief legal officer, said the company wanted to push the book database to as many libraries as possible. ''If the price gets too high,'' he said, ''we are simply not going to have libraries that can afford to purchase it.'' 
 For readers who might want to buy digital access to an individual scanned book, Mr. Clancy said, Google was likely to sell at least half of the books for $5.99 or less. Students and faculty at universities who subscribe to the database will be able to get the full contents of all the books free.
 For the average author, ''this is not a game changer'' in an economic sense, said Richard Sarnoff, chairman of the Association of American Publishers and president of the digital media investments group at Bertelsmann, the parent company of Random House, the world's largest publisher of consumer books. 
 ''They will get paid for the use of their book, but whether they will get paid so much that they can start living large -- I think that's just a fantasy,'' Mr. Sarnoff said. ''I think there will be a few authors who do see significant dollars out of this, but there will be a vast number of authors who see insignificant dollars out of this.''
 But, he added, ''a few hundred dollars for an individual author can equate to a considerable sum for a publisher with rights to 10,000 books.''
 So far, publishers that have permitted Google to offer searchable digital versions of their new in-print books have seen a small payoff. Macmillan, the company that owns publishing houses including Farrar, Straus & Giroux and St. Martin's Press and represents authors including Jonathan Franzen and Janet Evanovich, offers 11,000 titles for search on Google. In 2007, Macmillan estimated that Google helped sell about 16,400 copies. 
 Authors view the possibility of readers finding their out-of-print books as a cultural victory more than a financial one.
 ''Our culture is not just Stephen King's latest novel or the new Harry Potter book,'' said James Gleick, a member of the board of the Authors Guild. ''It is also 1,000 completely obscure books that appeal not to the one million people who bought the Harry Potter book but to 100 people at a time.'' 
 Some scholars worry that Google users are more likely to search for narrow information than to read at length. ''I have to say that I think pedagogically and in terms of the advancement of scholarship, I have a concern that people will be encouraged to use books in this very fragmentary way,'' said Alice Prochaska, university librarian at Yale. 
 Others said they thought readers would continue to appreciate long texts and that Google's book search would simply help readers find them. 
 ''There is no short way to appreciate Jane Austen, and I hope I'm right about that,'' said Paul Courant, university librarian at the University of Michigan. ''But a lotof reading is going to happen on screens. One of the important things about this settlement is that it brings the literature of the 20th century back into a form that the students of the 21st century will be able to find it.'' 
 Google's book search has already entered the popular culture, in the film version of ''Twilight,'' based on the novel by Stephenie Meyer about a teenage girl who falls in love with a vampire. Bella, one of the main characters, uses Google to find information about a local American Indian tribe. When the search leads her to a book, what does she do? 
 She goes to a bookstore and buys it.

HEADLINE: Hollywood's Superheroes Save the Day

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
As companies big and small -- if they still exist at all -- trudge into January after a dismal 2008, the movie business is quietly celebrating solid if not spectacular results at the multiplex.
 Ticket sales at North American movie theaters totaled $9.6 billion, a decrease of less than 1 percent over the previous year, according to Media by Numbers, a box office tracking company. Although attendance declined 5 percent, to about 1.3 billion, the industry was able to buttress revenue with higher ticket prices and premium 3-D offerings.
 ''Considering the economic climate, I think that's a pretty terrific result,'' said Michael L. Campbell, the chief executive of the Regal Entertainment Group, which owns the nation's largest chain of movie theaters. ''This industry is as recession-resistant as any I can think of,'' he added. 
 The results were largely attributable to superheroes, either reinvented ones like ''The Dark Knight'' (the top moneymaker) or newcomers like ''Iron Man'' (the runner-up). Four computer-animated movies delivered giant returns, with ''Wall-E,'' ''Kung Fu Panda,'' ''Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa'' and ''Horton Hears a Who'' all in the top 10. A new franchise about a well-behaved teenage vampire was born to tiny Summit Entertainment in ''Twilight.'' 
 And never underestimate a well-executed marketing campaign and a dollop of nostalgia: ''Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'' overcame dreary reviews to sell $317 million in tickets and place third in the top 10, according to Box Office Mojo, an online tracking site.
 Beneath the numbers, however, are some gnawing concerns. Executives must confront drooping DVD sales -- where most profits are made -- and a messy, unresolved labor dispute with the powerful Screen Actors Guild. 
 Parent companies like General Electric, Sony and the Walt Disney Company are demanding leaner studio operations and some are looking to sell noncore units like specialty film divisions as they wrestle with television, publishing and consumer product troubles. 
 But studio chiefs want to forget all of that for now. ''We're more than holding our own as a business,'' said Marc Shmuger, the chairman of Universal Pictures. The studio, part of NBC Universal, which is owned by G.E., recorded its biggest box office year ever in 2008, with global grosses totaling $2.83 billion.
 It is foolhardy to read too much into what worked and what did not at the box office in any given year. Successes and failures usually involve the mechanics of individual titles and do not signal any clear trends. And in Hollywood, the wind changes perhaps faster than anywhere else.
 In 2008, the musical ''Mamma Mia'' became a smash for Universal, selling $572 million in tickets around the world, and ''Sex and the City'' was a surprise hit for Warner Brothers, selling $415 million in tickets. It might have seemed that movies attracting women were back, but then came Warner's remake of ''The Women'' with $46 million, Box Office Mojo figures show. 
 Still, movie executives say a few clear signals can be gleaned from the last 12 months.
 People love watching a dog on the big screen, including dancing ones. ''Beverly Hills Chihuahua'' sold $93 million in tickets for Walt Disney Studios in the United States, while the company's animated ''Bolt'' overcame a soft opening to sell nearly $110 million through Sunday, according to Box Office Mojo estimates. 
 Fox's ''Marley & Me,'' about a naughty yellow lab, has generated estimated sales of $106 million as of Sunday, Box Office Mojo said, and is still going strong. 
 The ability of stars to open a movie may be fading in North America, but it remains powerful overseas. ''Body of Lies,'' a Warner release starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe, did not do well in the United States, selling just $39 million in tickets. But it went on to do respectable business overseas, with its global total now over $100 million.
 The definition of what counts as a success in the modern movie business might have changed. ''The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian'' sold $420 million in tickets around the world for Disney and Walden Media. But because that was almost half of what the first ''Narnia'' film had generated, and because Disney had to share the profits and lacked a big consumer products offshoot, the company dumped the franchise.
 Finally, it appears that premium pricing -- a longtime challenge for the business -- is here to stay. In 2008, the studios discovered that audiences would pay ticket prices of up to $25 to see a movie in 3-D (''Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert Tour''). Screenings of ''The Dark Knight'' and ''Kung Fu Panda'' at Imax theaters, also carrying premium prices, did blockbuster business.
 ''We had our best year ever by some measures, which suggests to me that people are rewarding themselves with little pleasures,'' said Richard L. Gelfond, the chief executive for Imax.
 The results for last year varied studio by studio, and sometimes within the same studio.
 Warner, for instance, was easily the industry leader, with an 18 percent market share, according to Box Office Mojo. ''The Dark Knight,'' now the No. 2 most popular film in modern movie history without adjusting for inflation, behind ''Titanic,'' was largely the reason. But the studio also released the biggest flop of 2008, the disastrous ''Speed Racer.''
 The road ahead for Warner could be difficult. The studio is the largest seller of DVDs, and it is locked in a legal battle with Fox -- so far, Warner is losing -- over ''Watchmen,'' a potential blockbuster based on the graphic novel. While the studio considers its next entry in the superhero genre (it could be a movie based on the Green Lantern comic book character), it has at least one surefire hit on the way, ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.''
 Paramount, more than any studio, exhibited marketing prowess in 2008, analysts said, helping to turn movies made by other production companies like Marvel (''Iron Man'') and DreamWorks (''Tropic Thunder'') into hits. With ''The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,'' Paramount would like to quiet industry sniping about its thin track record with homegrown hits.
 In many ways, the 2009 spotlight will be on Paramount, analysts say, as the studio tries to resuscitate a franchise (''Star Trek,'' due in May) and introduce another (''G.I. Joe,'' set for August). The studio, in partnership with DreamWorks, is also preparing a sequel for June release that is sure to get heavy scrutiny: ''Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.''
 Sony had success by sticking to its knitting. A Will Smith blockbuster in summer (''Hancock''), a blockbuster James Bond entry in the fall (''Quantum of Solace'') and a smattering of sophomoric comedies (''Step Brothers,'' ''You Don't Mess With the Zohan'' and ''Pineapple Express'') delivered another solid year. Coming up: a strike-delayed ''Angels & Demons,'' based on the book by the author of ''The Da Vinci Code.''
 On the surface, Disney's year was just fine. ''High School Musical 3: Senior Year'' sold $237 million in tickets around the world (against an $11 million production budget), according to Box Office Mojo, and ''Wall-E'' outperformed its immediate Pixar predecessor, ''Ratatouille.'' 
 A few big hits, however, are not enough any more for this studio. Because Disney decided a couple of years ago to drastically reduce the number of pictures it released each year, every release must deliver huge profits. As ''Prince Caspian'' demonstrated, big ticket sales do not translate to a fatter bottom line. One crucial test ahead for Disney involves Ms. Cyrus. ''Hannah Montana: The Movie,'' set for April release, will give investors a read on how much potential remains in the important franchise.
 Fox started the year with a blockbuster DVD (''Alvin and the Chipmunks'') and solid returns for ''Horton'' and the inexpensive comedies ''27 Dresses'' and ''What Happens in Vegas.'' But the studio stumbled badly over the summer, failing to release a single blockbuster movie and recorded a $111 million decline in operating income for the third quarter over the previous year. 
 For Fox, the pain of the much-maligned ''Australia'' was eased by the Australian government, which covered 40 percent of the production costs, and Fox has several films in its pipeline that could soon make 2008 a distant memory. Among them are ''X-Men Origins: Wolverine'' and sequels to ''Ice Age'' and ''Night at the Museum.''

 IRANIAN PILGRIMS KILLED IN BAGHDAD
 At least 40 people were killed and 72 wounded in Baghdad, many of them Iranian pilgrims, in a suicide bombing at the doorstep of one of Iraq's holiest Shiite shrines, government and hospital officials said. The attacker appeared to be targeting a procession of Iranian pilgrims visiting the shrine. PAGE A6 
 PATIENTS SUFFER UNDER OLD LAWS
 In Bulgaria, as in many former Communist countries in Europe, people with mental disabilities are stripped of rights and sequestered without recourse under rules left over from the Communist era. The laws give control of the patients to guardians, often regardless of the severity of the patient's disability, according to human rights groups. And the laws in Bulgaria and the region often fail to ensure any oversight of the guardians. Memo from Pravda PAGE A7 
 RUSSIA RAISES GAS PRICE FOR UKRAINE
 Gazprom, the Russian gas monopoly, raised the price it wants Ukraine to pay for fuel again, escalating a politically tinged dispute that led to a complete halt in supplies to Ukraine and disruptions to four other Eastern European countries.

 TRADING SAFETY FOR PRIVACY TO END A PREGNANCY AT HOME
 In the socially conservative Dominican neighborhoods of Manhattan, many Latinas want to end their pregnancy at home. Experts offer a variety of reasons, like mistrust of doctors and a culture where women solve their own problems. Two new studies found reports of women mixing malted beverages with aspirin, salt or nutmeg; throwing themselves down stairs or having people punch them in the stomach; and drinking teas of avocado leaf, pine wood and oak bark.

 THE EAGLES TOPPLE THE VIKINGS, AND GET TO MEET THE GIANTS AGAIN
 For the better part of the National Football Conference wild-card game, the Philadelphia Eagles' offense suffered an afternoon of frustration against the Minnesota Vikings. Philadelphia led by 2 points late in the game, but the Vikings seemed one big Adrian Peterson play away from stealing the game. Then, with less than seven minutes to play, Brian Westbrook took a short pass, turned upfield and dashed for a 71-yard touchdown, earning a trip to the second round, where the Eagles will face the New York Giants.

 AMID LAYOFFS AND CUTBACKS,
 A New Austerity in Publishing
 For decades, the New York publishing world promised employees a romantic life of fancy lunches and sparkling parties. If the salaries were not exactly Wall Street caliber, well, they came with a milieu that mixed cultural swagger with pure Manhattan high life. But amid a relentless string of layoffs and pay freezes, book publishers are clamping down on some of the industry's cozy traditions, and the cushy schmooze fest seems to be winding down. PAGE C1

 Bandleader Accents Cuban Roots
 Cuban music is the core of the Cuban saxophonist, clarinetist and composer Paquito D'Rivera's repertory, but he has never before now, with a first-time run of shows at Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, led a Cuban band in this country. Mr. D'Rivera is a complicated performer: a virtuoso, a scholar and a gold-plated ham in equal parts, Ben Ratliff writes. PAGE C1

 Spinoffs Plucked From 'The Hills'
 In MTV's new series ''The City,'' the person-character of Whitney Port from the ''The Hills'' moves to New York to work as a publicity assistant. She describes it as ''an opportunity of a lifetime,'' but the job seems to require only that she show up in good shoes. Still, its pleasures are greater than any attempted in ''Bromance,'' which ''The City'' follows in the broadcast lineup, in which Brody Jenner, also from ''The Hills,'' sets out to find a best friend among a bunch of competing chumps, Ginia Bellafante writes.

HEADLINE: A 50-Year Farm Bill

BYLINE: By WES JACKSON and WENDELL BERRY. 
Wes Jackson is a plant geneticist and president of The Land Institute in Salina, Kan. Wendell Berry is a farmer and writer in Port Royal, Ky.

 BODY:
THE extraordinary rainstorms last June caused catastrophic soil erosion in the grain lands of Iowa, where there were gullies 200 feet wide. But even worse damage is done over the long term under normal rainfall -- by the little rills and sheets of erosion on incompletely covered or denuded cropland, and by various degradations resulting from industrial procedures and technologies alien to both agriculture and nature. 
 Soil that is used and abused in this way is as nonrenewable as (and far more valuable than) oil. Unlike oil, it has no technological substitute -- and no powerful friends in the halls of government. 
 Agriculture has too often involved an insupportable abuse and waste of soil, ever since the first farmers took away the soil-saving cover and roots of perennial plants. Civilizations have destroyed themselves by destroying their farmland. This irremediable loss, never enough noticed, has been made worse by the huge monocultures and continuous soil-exposure of the agriculture we now practice.
 To the problem of soil loss, the industrialization of agriculture has added pollution by toxic chemicals, now universally present in our farmlands and streams. Some of this toxicity is associated with the widely acclaimed method of minimum tillage. We should not poison our soils to save them. 
 Industrial agricultural has made our food supply entirely dependent on fossil fuels and, by substituting technological ''solutions'' for human work and care, has virtually destroyed the cultures of husbandry (imperfect as they may have been) once indigenous to family farms and farming neighborhoods.
 Clearly, our present ways of agriculture are not sustainable, and so our food supply is not sustainable. We must restore ecological health to our agricultural landscapes, as well as economic and cultural stability to our rural communities. 
 For 50 or 60 years, we have let ourselves believe that as long as we have money we will have food. That is a mistake. If we continue our offenses against the land and the labor by which we are fed, the food supply will decline, and we will have a problem far more complex than the failure of our paper economy. The government will bring forth no food by providing hundreds of billons of dollars to the agribusiness corporations. 
 Any restorations will require, above all else, a substantial increase in the acreages of perennial plants. The most immediately practicable way of doing this is to go back to crop rotations that include hay, pasture and grazing animals. 
 But a more radical response is necessary if we are to keep eating and preserve our land at the same time. In fact, research in Canada, Australia, China and the United States over the last 30 years suggests that perennialization of the major grain crops like wheat, rice, sorghum and sunflowers can be developed in the foreseeable future. By increasing the use of mixtures of grain-bearing perennials, we can better protect the soil and substantially reduce greenhouse gases, fossil-fuel use and toxic pollution. 
 Carbon sequestration would increase, and the husbandry of water and soil nutrients would become much more efficient. And with an increase in the use of perennial plants and grazing animals would come more employment opportunities in agriculture -- provided, of course, that farmers would be paid justly for their work and their goods.
 Thoughtful farmers and consumers everywhere are already making many necessary changes in the production and marketing of food. But we also need a national agricultural policy that is based upon ecological principles. We need a 50-year farm bill that addresses forthrightly the problems of soil loss and degradation, toxic pollution, fossil-fuel dependency and the destruction of rural communities. 
 This is a political issue, certainly, but it far transcends the farm politics we are used to. It is an issue as close to every one of us as our own stomachs.

NEW YORK
 DAYBOOK
 Gifted? There's a Test
 Monday. These days, the anxiety-racked testing process begins practically at birth, and by age 5, children are hardly shocked by the gantlet that is the public school system. So try to relax, parents, as the city starts testing the potentially ''gifted and talented'' for entry into its kindergarten and first-grade programs. Just think, after that, the only goal is to stay sane until results come out in April. 
 Recession Relief
 Friday, 10 a.m. If the sight of money -- even the unspendable ancient kind -- will cheer you in these bleak times, choose your salve at the 37th Annual New York International Numismatic Convention, which is open to the public for its final three days. Put on your best suit and peruse the booths, caress the glossy catalogs, ogle the gleaming coins ... anything to forget for one morning that this is currency you can't afford to buy, much less spend. Waldorf-Astoria, 301 Park Avenue, Manhattan. Cost: $10.
 Ups, Downs and Aches
 Saturday, 2 p.m. When was the last time you went to a library to see wrestling? Well, not wrestling so much as a talk about wrestling, featuring washed-up former pros doing demonstrations and signing autographs. It's ''Down for the Count: The Ups and Downs of Professional Wrestling,'' featuring Tito Torres, a six-time American Wrestling Federation champion, and Crusher Townsend. There will be a short film, don't-do-this-at-home warnings, and refreshments -- after the demonstration of ''dangerous moves,'' one hopes. St. George Library Center, 5 Central Avenue, Staten Island.
 Back to the Indoors
 Sunday. The Brooklyn Flea, by its expansive nature an outdoor affair, is in hibernation until April. But those of you who can't possibly halt your antiquing for that long, fear not: The organizers are taking it inside. The Flea's ''Winter Pop-Up Market,'' in Dumbo, will have all you'd expect -- vintage stuff, furniture, art, clothing -- along with ''curiosities,'' which you'll turn your nose up at but secretly buy in abundance. 76 Front Street, Brooklyn.
 Trees After Death
 Sunday. No more procrastinating; it's officially time to surrender your Christmas tree. Depending on where you go, you may even get some free mulch out of it. Drop it off at parks all over the city. Details: www.nycgovparks.org.
 NICOLE COLLINS TAKING
 QUESTIONS
 This week, Michael Brandow, the author of ''New York's Poop Scoop Law: Dogs, the Dirt, and Due Process,'' will be answering readers' questions about the history, science and politics of picking up after your dog. Submit questions online; the first set of answers will appear on Wednesday on the blog.

HEADLINE: Some Attics Yield Treasures; One Yields Parallels

BYLINE: By SUSAN DOMINUS. 
E-mail: susan.dominus@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The attic is a home's subconscious, the repository for memories in the form of stuff, some of it buried so deep it may never be recovered. It was pure chance that when a crew of contractors recently invaded the attic of our 1913 Victorian we found suppressed memories dating back to its early life. 
 Last year, we paid a small fortune for oil but still shivered our way through the winter, our twin toddlers wearing turtlenecks under their footie pajamas. 
 Given the record-high oil rates when we locked in this summer (judiciously, we thought), we decided to invest in insulation, which is why the contractors had traipsed up to the third floor. We knew we'd still pay a fortune for fuel, but maybe at least we'd be warm.
 The contractors, a band of former fraternity brothers from the Midwest, promised as they left that we would feel the difference right away, and almost forgot to mention the massive stash of old newspapers they had unearthed in the attic's crawl space. Those that had not completely disintegrated were so old they had not so much yellowed as deeply tanned, as if they'd absorbed the dark in which they'd been persevering all those years. Most of them were from Jan. 5, 1930; one of the workers theorized that whoever owned the house back then was probably doing just as we were -- trying desperately, and as cheaply as possible, to keep the cold in the attic at bay. 
 I tried to read as much of the crumbling papers as I could, curious as to what insights they might yield about an early owner of my home in Hastings-on-Hudson, a hilly village north of Yonkers that was, in 1930, still known for its industrial waterfront juxtaposed with a developing suburban community. 
 Some of the ads put today's reader a million miles away: car companies bragged about popular features like safer plate glass, Saks was selling ''smart print dresses'' for $10, and the clothes dryers being pitched looked more like torture devices than the familiar basement appliances we know today.
 Some of the articles, however, suggest that New York has not made all that much progress in the intervening 79 years. The front page of the real estate section of The New York American, Jan. 5, 1930, had this headline: ''Second Avenue Transit Held Inadequate; Vigorous Campaign Launched by First Avenue Association to Speed New Subway Route.'' Just not vigorous enough.
 What jumped off every page were reminders that the former owner of the home was situated, not just geographically, but psychically, right about where I am, where many of us are, in our relationship to the economy. The stock market had crashed at the end of the previous October, so Jan. 5 then had a similar feel to Jan. 5 right now -- everyone still reeling from disaster, hoping the new year would bring better news, but fearing it could only get worse.
 At first I thought the former owner might have been a car buff, since so many of the yellowed sheets were from the automobile sections of various papers, one featuring a message from the president of the Cadillac Motor Company about its 16-cylinder model or a spread from one or another now-defunct car manufacturer, like Durant.
 But it's at least as likely that those sections ended up in the attic because they were the ones for which the person who lived here had no use -- a little bit like me these days, using the real estate listings to line the floor when my kids do arts and crafts. In 1929, the relatively new American automotive industry sold a then-record 5 million cars, according to a quick Google search; in 1930, despite slashed prices, the number of cars sold dropped to 2 million. By 1932, half the male population of Detroit was unemployed. 
 The real estate pages also got dumped into the stash in the crawl space. On Jan. 5, 1930, The New York American's real estate editor, J. P. Lohman, wrote on the front page of his section a meditative column looking back on the previous year, which, with a few words changed around, could have been reprinted now on its 79th anniversary (had the paper itself not died in 1967, after eventually becoming part of The World Journal Tribune).
 ''We saw a year of comparative decline, first, because of a restriction of loans due to overbuilding in certain classes of structures, and second, because of a diversion of funds from mortgage and construction channels into Wall Street,'' he wrote. 
 Why was Mr. Lohman, bespectacled and moustached, with a small, smug smile in his column photo, bothering with such a retrospective? ''For experience is undoubtedly the best teacher and the curriculum is the record of the past by which we must profit if we seek to progress.'' A few paragraphs later, the text has crumbled away, disintegrated, beyond the reach of posterity. 
 Sifting through the papers, I cannot decide whether it's comforting or disturbing to know that nearly eight decades ago, someone else was sitting in the same house I sit in now, fighting the January cold, scanning the grim news of the day, feeling the kind of chill that's hard to shake.

HEADLINE: Auto Industry Still Coming to Grips With the Damage of 2008

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
Carmakers will close out one of the most tumultuous and miserable years in their history Monday when they report what is certain to be another dreadful batch of monthly sales figures.
 Each of the six largest automakers, including foreign and domestic brands, is expected to say that its sales in the United States fell at least 30 percent in December. The bleakest numbers will most likely come from General Motors and Chrysler, which both received billions of dollars in loans from the federal government at the end of December to help them remain solvent.
 Over all, analysts say 2008 will end up as the worst year for selling cars and trucks since 1992. But that comparison does not capture how quickly business deteriorated in recent months, as credit markets tightened and consumer confidence sank. 
 ''This is the kind of automotive recession that, quite frankly, many of us have never been through,'' Erich Merkle, an automotive analyst in Grand Rapids, Mich., with the consulting firm Crowe Horwath, said Sunday. ''We know that people who have lost their jobs aren't in the market for a new car, but even those who have jobs aren't in the market right now, because they're concerned if they'll still have a job in three, six or nine months.''
 George Pipas, Ford Motor Company's chief sales analyst, projected total industry sales for 2008 of about 13.5 million, a full three million fewer than in 2007. Not since 1974 has the market collapsed that much in a single year, he said.
 Analysts said December's sales rate would probably be worse than even the 26-year lows reached in October and November.
 ''And since the early '80s, there are 70 million more people that can drive a vehicle,'' Mr. Pipas told reporters during a briefing Friday. ''So this is even worse per capita than 1982.''
 Though high gas prices significantly affected the number and types of vehicles sold throughout much of 2008, the rapid drop of prices recently has done little to help the industry rebound. Sales from September through November were 31 percent lower than the same period in 2007, even as gas prices plummeted by 54 percent. Sales of sport utility vehicles, which used to generate huge profits for the Detroit automakers, were down 51 percent.
 Mr. Pipas said passenger cars outsold S.U.V.'s and other light trucks last year for the first time since 2000. The sudden shift in consumers' buying habits has left the automakers scrambling to build more cars and fewer trucks. 
 Ford is retooling three former truck factories so they can make compact and subcompact cars; Toyota now plans to make its Prius hybrid sedan in a new plant where it had intended to build S.U.V.'s. Last month, the company said it would delay the plant's opening because of the market's decline.
 ''In the late '90s, our assumption was that light trucks could just continue, and would never turn back,'' Mr. Pipas said. Now, he added, ''we don't think passenger cars will ever look back again.''
 Sales of trucks and S.U.V.'s were probably higher in December than in the preceding months, most likely even outselling cars, analysts said, but that is primarily driven by big discounts on many larger models. The average value of incentives per vehicle was almost $1,000 higher in December than a year ago, but on trucks the increase was nearly $1,500, Mr. Pipas said. Full-size pickup trucks now are being discounted by an average of $7,000 to $8,000.
 G.M. last week began offering zero percent or low-rate loans on many vehicles in a bid to attract shoppers who had been scared off by a lack of credit. Its lending arm, GMAC Financial Services, received a $5 billion investment from the Treasury Department and immediately reduced its minimum credit-scoring requirements for customers.
 Edmunds.com, a Web site that gives car-buying advice to consumers, cited that news in noting an unusual flurry of inquiries on its site and at dealers in the final days of December. Edmunds said some dealers reported making 40 percent of their entire month's sales in the last week and that site research on G.M. vehicles rose more than for other brands.
 ''Normally, I would say that such an increase in the last week of December is just at the high end of the usual seasonal pattern, but in the current environment I would say that it is dramatically good news,'' David Tompkins, a senior analyst with Edmunds, said.
 Yet the automakers are not optimistic about even a modest recovery in vehicle sales for at least several more months. Recent jobless numbers show continued weakening in the economy, and consumer confidence remains at historic lows.
 ''Consumer confidence, of all the factors you look at, that's the No. 1 driver of new vehicle business,'' Mark LaNeve, G.M.'s vice president for North American sales and marketing, said in a conference call last week.
 Still, Mr. LaNeve said, ''you've got to believe that 2009 is going to be a better year than 2008 was.''

HEADLINE: In Silicon Valley, Venture Capitalists Turn Cautious and Focus on the Short Term

BYLINE: By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER

DATELINE: MENLO PARK, Calif. 

 BODY:
Venture capitalists make their fortunes, or lose them, on the strength of their predictions. As they hunt for barely hatched ideas and nurture them with money and advice, they are hoping that the new idea grows into the next Google. 
 On Sand Hill Road, the wide boulevard here where investors study ideas in offices tucked behind palm trees and redwoods, the recession has tempered their optimism with caution. 
 Conversations with some of the leading venture capitalists about the types of companies that will receive some of the estimated $31 billion venture capital firms raised in 2008 offer a glimpse at the future of technology. 
 WEB 2.0 HEYDAY IS OVER Venture capitalists once poured money into Web sites that were free to users and that made money selling advertisements. If the site involved social networking, so much the better. 
 But as growth in ad spending online cools and social networking becomes commonplace, the days of trying to be the next YouTube, Facebook or Yelp are over, said Jeremy Liew, managing director at Lightspeed Venture Partners. 
 ''In 2005, Yelp could say, 'I'm going to unseat Citysearch,' '' Mr. Liew said. ''Today, someone has to say, 'I'll be more viral and user-generated than Yelp.' The evolutionary niche that got opened up got filled.'' 
 Even Accel, an early investor in Facebook, might have turned that company away if it approached the firm today, said Theresia Gouw Ranzetta, an Accel partner. 
 For Web sites that do not already have large audiences, ''your business model may be just as plausible as it was 18 months ago, but we're all more cautious about giving you a slug of money,'' she said. 
 Instead, investors are looking for sites that make money in ways other than selling ads, like selling subscriptions or virtual goods. Selling 50-cent costumes for online avatars might not seem to be much of a revenue model, but pennies add up. 
 ENTERPRISE IS BACK Though investors are shifting their focus from the consumer to businesses, they are still reluctant to back makers of expensive software that manages data for companies. 
 ''Big-ticket enterprise ideas that take $50 million to $100 million to get to market are going to be few and far between,'' said Dana Stalder, a general partner at Matrix Partners. 
 Instead, venture capitalists will invest in open-source software, Web-based software, Internet-based cloud computing and virtualization software that lets companies use less hardware to run applications. ''Oracle, Microsoft and all of that will shift to the cloud. It will be a transformational mega-shift in technology,'' Mr. Stalder said. 
 THE YEAR OF MOBILE? The iPhone and Apple App Store caught on with consumers in 2008, but investors are not convinced that selling ads or content like applications on mobile phones can make much money for them. More skeptical venture capitalists are sticking with what they know makes money in telecommunications, like carriers and makers of phones and accessories. ''Pure mobile content is overinvested, but hardware is underhyped,'' said David Weiden, a partner at Khosla Ventures. Revenue from the iPhone and BlackBerry exceeds that of the entire mobile content market, he said. Battery Ventures is focusing on carriers, said Roger Lee, a general partner. His firm invested in MetroPCS, which went public in 2007, and last year put money into Pocket Communications, a wireless carrier in Texas that is expanding to the Northeast.
 CLEAN TECH GETS REALISTIC Venture capitalists are still chasing clean technology. Through September, $3 billion was invested in technologies that create alternative energy and conserve power, up from $1.9 billion the year before, according to the National Venture Capital Association. But big, expensive projects like building factories to manufacture solar panels or biofuels are falling out of favor. 
 ''The economic arguments for those businesses literally went upside down in a year,'' said Paul Holland, the general partner in charge of the clean tech practice at Foundation Capital. 
 Instead, some venture capitalists are looking at technologies that monitor energy demand, like software that tracks and regulates a building's energy use. 
 PERSONALIZED HEALTH CARE Venture capitalists say one sector of the economy that technology has not yet transformed is personalized health care. 
 Jennifer Fonstad, a managing director at Draper Fisher Jurvetson, is looking at companies that use information about a person's genetic code to offer predictive medical advice or preventive health services or devices. 
 Internet companies that help patients, banks and insurance companies manage health savings accounts or help people find assisted-living homes for aging parents are other likely recipients of investors' largess. 
 ''Cisco was founded two weeks before a stock market crash. Oracle was founded during the Reagan recession,'' Mr. Holland said. ''In bad times, that's when the best opportunities come up.''

HEADLINE: San Francisco Theater In Dire Straits

BYLINE: Compiled by STEVEN McELROY

 BODY:
The Magic Theater in San Francisco, a 42-year-old institution that has staged the premieres of works by Sam Shepard, David Mamet, Nilo Cruz and others, may be on the verge of closing unless the company can raise $350,000 by Friday, according to the theater's Web site, magictheatre.org. The Magic is facing a $600,000 debt and is one of a number of regional theaters on the precipice because of the dismal economic climate. By Sunday afternoon the fund-raising goal seemed to be within reach, as the Magic's Web site reported $213,000 in donations received. Perhaps it will follow in the footsteps of another California company, Shakespeare Santa Cruz, which was in similar straits a few weeks ago and was able to raise more than $400,000 quickly. Some recent stories of economic ills in regional theater have not ended happily, though: the Carousel Dinner Theater in Akron, Ohio, closed its doors for good following Saturday night's performance of ''All Shook Up.''

HEADLINE: Puttin' Off the Ritz: The New Austerity in Publishing

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
For decades the New York publishing world promised a romantic life of fancy lunches, sparkling parties, sophisticated banter and trips to spots like the Caribbean to pitch books to sales representatives. If the salaries were not exactly Wall Street caliber, well, they came with a milieu that mixed cultural swagger with pure Manhattan high life. 
 But that cushy schmooze fest seems to be winding down.
 Just two weeks before announcing staff cuts and a substantial corporate restructuring in December, the publishing giant Macmillan gathered its sales and marketing staff at the historic Hotel del Coronado in San Diego -- where Billy Wilder filmed Tony Curtis wooing Marilyn Monroe in ''Some Like It Hot'' -- to talk about titles on the spring lists. Between marathon meetings to discuss plans for new books, the sales reps were invited to take part in wine tastings and spa treatments. 
 This year the meetings will be held via Webcam. In a memo to staff members announcing the layoffs on Dec. 15, John Sargent, chief executive of Macmillan, said the company would hold only one of its three annual sales conferences in person, and the other two would be conducted on the Web and by telephone. 
 Amid a relentless string of layoffs and pay-freeze announcements, book publishers are clamping down on some of the business's most glittery and cozy traditions. Austerity measures are rippling throughout the industry as it confronts the worst retailing landscape in memory.
 ''This business was never meant to sustain limousines,'' said Amanda Urban, a literary agent who represents Cormac McCarthy and Toni Morrison, among other authors. Ms. Urban said she believed Bennett Cerf, a founder of Random House, once said something to that very effect. ''At best, you can get a Town Car now and then,'' she said. ''It's gotten out of scale, like a lot of businesses in this country.''
 Venerable houses including HarperCollins, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Penguin Group, Random House and Simon & Schuster have all announced salary freezes or layoffs, or both. Simon & Schuster canceled its annual holiday party, held for the last few years at Tavern on the Green and scheduled in 2008 for Guastavino's, a splashy banquet hall in Manhattan. One division of Random House had pizza, beer and wine in a room off the cafeteria for its holiday lunch instead of going out for pricey cocktails. Across the city, editors with Four Seasons taste are being asked to scale back on their lunch tabs.
 Random House has postponed its spring sales conference and has yet to choose a location. Stuart Applebaum, a spokesman, said one thing was certain: After holding a meeting in Bermuda this year the company ''will not be returning there in 2009.''
 Book sales have deteriorated since the beginning of October, falling about 7 percent compared with the same period the previous year, according to Nielsen BookScan, which tracks about 70 percent of sales. That slide is driving much of the immediate cutbacks, but the publishing industry is also being convulsed by longer-term trends, including a shift toward digital reading and competition from an array of entertainment options like video games and online social networking.
 Ms. Urban said some of the more lavish practices could not be sustained by a slow-growth, low-margin industry that can't charge luxury prices. ''Books can only support a certain retail price,'' she said. ''It's not like you have books that can be Manolo Blahniks and books that can be Cole Haan. Books are books. A book by James Patterson costs the same as a book by some poet.''
 But the economic downturn is forcing publishers to scrutinize some of the industry's hoariest traditions. One ripe target: the international book fairs in London and Frankfurt at which publishers and agents gather, ostensibly to make deals. But in reality they spend much of their time making the rounds of parties and dinners. 
 Many houses that previously have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on flights, hotel bills and cocktail hours are planning to prune the size of the contingents they send to the fairs this year. Similarly, companies are revising their budgets for BookExpo America, the annual spring jamboree at which publishers promote their fall lineups to booksellers. 
 For authors it means the prospect of smaller advances and fewer books being acquired.
 ''Through these economic crunches that we're all facing, some of the shibboleths of the business are being looked at with a very hard eye,'' said Jonathan Burnham, publisher of Harper, an imprint of HarperCollins whose authors include Ann Patchett, Barbara Kingsolver and Michael Crichton.
 Nobody expects one of the staples of the business -- the long lunch -- to die off completely because of these straitened circumstances. But publishers, editors and literary agents, who have often been among the best diners in the city, are now reconsidering their favorite restaurants. 
 ''We've all naturally been thinking about whether it's absolutely essential to have a lunch here or there,'' Mr. Burnham added, ''or whether it can be a phone call or a meeting.''
 Industry veterans said bloated expense accounts were the least of publishing's problems. ''I don't think the dire situation of the publishing world is going to be solved by tightening that particular belt,'' said Robert Gottlieb, the renowned editor who has shepherded authors like Doris Lessing, Robert Caro and Joseph Heller. Mr. Gottlieb, who worked at Simon & Schuster and Alfred A. Knopf, was famous for always eating lunch at his desk. ''It's small potatoes compared to the problems they face,'' he said.
 It is not just publishing's flashy customs that are getting a tough look. Other sacred cows, like the distribution of advance print galleys of coming titles and the costly practice of permitting retailers to return unsold books, are being examined.
 Cash advances for authors, which have risen in recent years, are being reviewed. 
 ''Everybody is trying to look at acquisitions in the prism of a reduced and a hurting retail market,'' said David Rosenthal, publisher of Simon & Schuster. ''You used to buy some books and you paid X because you figured it would sell 100,000 copies. Now you have to do the math saying this book may sell only 50,000 copies.''
 At HarperCollins a new unit is experimenting with a model that substitutes profit sharing with authors for cash advances and eliminates returns of unsold copies from booksellers.
 ''The two biggest sucking sounds on profits in our business are on advances and returns,'' said Robert S. Miller, president and publisher of the new HarperStudio, which was set up last year. The group is limiting advances to no more than $100,000 in exchange for giving authors half of the profits from book sales, as opposed to the 10 percent to 15 percent of the hardcover price they traditionally earn in royalties. Borders Group recently agreed to take the first 14 books on the new unit's 2009 list on a nonreturnable basis. 
 Some publishers said that they would like to reduce the costs of returned books -- which have to be shipped and then pulped or sold at deep discounts -- but that it might be unrealistic to abolish the practice in tough economic times.
 Jonathan Galassi, publisher of the literary powerhouse Farrar, Straus & Giroux, said the custom of accepting returns from booksellers was created during the Great Depression to persuade bookstores to take more copies. ''In a moment where getting people to put stock in a store of anything, not just books, is harder because of the money it costs to front them,'' Mr. Galassi said. ''I think it might be counterproductive to have a return-free business at this point.''
 Booksellers hope that the publishing industry can use the current downturn as an opportunity to publish fewer books. ''They need to have some sense of what is going on in the country and what the readers are really looking for,'' said Vivien Jennings, owner of Rainy Day Books, an independent bookstore in Fairway, Kan. 
 Of course longtime industry insiders have seen it all before. Michael Korda, former editor in chief of Simon & Schuster, who often held court from his favorite table in the Grill Room at the Four Seasons, recalled a period in the 1970s when his bosses banned editors from dining at certain restaurants. ''And then after a while business got better,'' Mr. Korda said. ''And everybody went back to doing what they were doing before.''

HEADLINE: Urban Tool In Recruiting By the Army: An Arcade

BYLINE: By JOHN LELAND

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA 

 BODY:
Amid the last-minute shopping bustle, the voice in the Black Hawk helicopter simulator shouted with an urgency that exceeded even the holiday mall frenzy. 
 ''Enemy right! Enemy right!''
 Triggers squeezed. Pixels exploded. Shopping waited. 
 At the Franklin Mills mall here, past the Gap Outlet and the China Buddha Express, is a $13 million video arcade that the Army hopes will become a model for recruitment in urban areas, where the armed services typically have a hard time attracting recruits. 
 The Army Experience Center is a fitting counterpart to the retail experience: 14,500 square feet of mostly shoot-'em-up video games and three full-scale simulators, including an AH-64 Apache Longbow helicopter, an armed Humvee and a Black Hawk copter with M4 carbine assault rifles. For those who want to take the experience deeper, the center has 22 recruiters. Or for more immediate full-contact mayhem, there are the outlet stores. 
 The facility, which opened in August, is the first of its kind. It replaces five smaller recruitment stations in the Philadelphia area, at about the same annual operating cost, not counting the initial expenses, said Maj. Larry Dillard, the program manager. Philadelphia has been a particularly difficult area for recruitment. 
 The Army recruited 80,517 active personnel in the fiscal year that ended in October, slightly surpassing its goal of 80,000, though as in recent years it fell below its goal of having 90 percent of recruits be high school graduates. 
 In recent years the Army has tried a number of ways to increase enlistment, including home video games, direct marketing promotions, a stronger online presence and recruitment-themed music videos. In 2007 it added bonuses of up to $2,000 for Army reservists who signed up new recruits. Civil liberties groups have criticized the Pentagon for its efforts to reach high school students. 
 But while recruitment remains strong in rural areas where there are military bases, it is weak in cities like Philadelphia, Major Dillard said. ''The question is, how can we get our stories out to urban centers where most of the population lives, but where we don't have a big presence?'' he said. He added that the center did not recruit anyone under 17. 
 On a recent afternoon, about a dozen more-to-less-likely recruits stepped away from the mall's screaming markdowns to try the simulators and play free video games, including Madden football and Rainbow Six: Vegas. 
 Mikel Smith, 19, and Jovan McCreary, 21, sat at Alienware game stations, maneuvering the camouflaged antiterrorist troopers of Rainbow Six through a series of casinos under siege. Muzzles flared on screen; sounds burst in their headphones.
 ''We're just here to play the games,'' said Mr. Smith, who said he was not considering enlisting in the Army. At the sign-in desk, where visitors fill out an information sheets and receive bar-coded photo identification cards, he indicated that he did not want to be contacted by a recruiter. 
 Beside Mr. Smith, Mr. McCreary leaned back in his black mesh chair. ''I got the same game at home, but it's better here,'' he said. He, too, was not interested in the Army Experience Center's other purposes. ''We're going to college next year,'' he said. 
 First Sgt. Randy Jennings, the supervising officer on this day, said the center's intent was not just to recruit personnel, but also to inform young people about the Army, in an area where they have little contact with service members. Most recruits live near rural bases. 
 If the program is deemed a success, the Army might replicate it in other cities.
 ''We want to put people in the Army, but that's about our third priority,'' Sergeant Jennings said, gesturing to a kiosk with descriptions of 179 jobs in the Army, including details on salaries and benefits. ''Most people think joining the Army means being a grunt, and that Iraq equals death. We try to show them that there's more to the Army than carrying a gun. If people come in here and they learn that but they don't join, that's O.K.'' 
 Most of the staff -- both military and civilian -- wore casual clothing; there was no hard sell. Conversations with recruiters might take place in an adjacent room or the central lounge area, where there were comfortable leather chairs and a soundtrack of Jane's Addiction and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. But on this afternoon, the only action was on the video games and simulators. 
 The three simulators play out missions to support the delivery of humanitarian aid in Iraq or Afghanistan; unlike in the video games, the participants do not come under fire. 
 In recent years, the Army has had great success with using video games like America's Army to attract recruits. But for the Army Experience Center, the results so far have been less than spectacular. Since it opened, about 35 visitors have enlisted. That is slightly below the previous recruitment rate at the five smaller stations, Sergeant Jennings said, at a time when the slumping economy would be expected to drive more people to enlist. 
 ''We're not at the point where we can say this is an effective strategy,'' Major Dillard said, adding that the Army had not set a numerical threshold for success for the center.
 ''We won't be measured by the number of people we put in the Army,'' Sgt. Jennings said. ''We're basically a learning lab for the military, a way for us to interact with kids and find out what they're interested in. People are going to join the Army, whether we had this or four or five recruitment stations.''
 At another video console, Graceson George, 29, a graduate student at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Chicago, led a squad of Army special forces through the battle zones of the game Ghost Recon. 
 He said that he was considering enlisting, but that he had spinal problems that might limit his ability to serve. 
 ''I just wanted to see exactly what they provide,'' Mr. George said. ''We got a briefing on what the Army is all about. It's a great experience serving this country, and it takes commitment and determination. They said there were other areas I can get involved. So I said, give me time.''
 Mr. George said he did not think the video game accurately conveyed the combat experience. 
 ''In this one, you can die as much as you like, but in real war it's not possible,'' he said. ''The reality of military service is beyond what you think. Here you can go back and replay, but in real life if you get shot you get shot. So it's an entertainment, but it makes you think.''
 He turned back to the combat on the screen. In the cocoon of the headphones, he did not hear the sound of prices hitting the floor.

HEADLINE: Kidnappings, Long Feared in Mexico, Send Shivers Across Border

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
FELIPE ANGELES, Mexico -- Four hooded men smashed in the door to the adobe home of an 80-year-old farmer here in November, handcuffing his frail wrists and driving him to a makeshift jail. They released him after relatives and friends paid a $9,000 ransom, which included his life savings.
The kidnapping was a dismal story of cruelty and heartbreak, familiar all across Mexico, but with a new twist: the daughter of this victim lived in the United States and was able to wire money to help assemble his ransom, the farmer, who insisted that he not be identified by name, said in an interview.
A string of similar kidnappings, singling out people with children or spouses in the United States, so panicked this village in the state of Zacatecas that many people boarded up their homes and headed north, some legally and some not, seeking havens with relatives in California and other American states. 
''The relatives of Mexicans in the United States have become a new profit center for Mexico's crime industry,'' said Rodolfo Garcia Zamora, a professor at the Autonomous University of Zacatecas who studies migration trends. ''Hundreds of families are emigrating out of fear of kidnap or extortion, and Mexicans in the U.S. are doing everything they can to avoid returning. Instead, they're getting their relatives out.''
The reported rush into the United States by people from the state of Zacatecas is another sign that Mexico's growing lawlessness is a volatile new factor affecting the flow of migrant workers across America's border. The violence is adding a new layer of uncertainty to the always fraught issue of Mexican emigration, already in flux because of the economic downturn in the United States.
Academics and policy makers on both sides of the border, who are watching closely for shifts in migration patterns, say it is too early to know the long-term impact of either the drug-related violence or the loss of jobs by thousands of migrant workers in the United States. But so far, earlier predictions of an exodus of out-of-work Mexicans back to their hometowns seem to have been premature.
Instead, it appears that the pattern in the state of Zacatecas -- where many people have family in the United States -- may be a good indicator of what is happening throughout Mexico. The country's spiraling criminality appears not only to be keeping some Mexicans in the United States, but it may also be leading more Mexicans to flee their country. ''It's a toxic combination right now,'' said Denise Dresser, a political scientist based in Mexico City. ''Mexicans north of the border are facing joblessness and persecution, but in their own country the government can't provide basic security for many of its citizens.''
The extraordinary increase in violence in Mexico in recent years has resulted in part from President Felipe Calderon's war against drug lords. His campaign to arrest the leaders of the cartels and the military officers and law enforcement officials they have compromised has unleashed factional fighting among rival drug groups, as well as violence against the government.
Traditionally, most of Mexico's criminal violence has been concentrated in northern border cities like Tijuana where cocaine enters the United States. But law and order have been deteriorating in many regions; and heartland states like Michoacan, Jalisco and Zacatecas, which are the homes of millions of migrants to the United States and are longtime drug smuggling routes, are now also reporting spikes in killings and kidnappings.
Jerez, a town of 60,000 a few miles northwest of Felipe Angeles in Zacatecas, was until recently a calm place, largely untouched by organized crime, said Abel Marquez Haro, a grocery wholesaler.
But recently, scores of men driving Chevrolet Suburbans and carrying automatic rifles established a menacing presence, threatening residents on the street and extorting businesspeople. The identities of the men remain a mystery, but many people in the town say they assume they are traffickers who have abandoned another Mexican state, perhaps to avoid an army crackdown.
On Nov. 10, a dozen of the gunmen arrived at Mr. Marquez's warehouse, dragging him out, bashing him and several employees with rifle butts and then hauling him away. He was held blindfolded for 30 hours as the kidnappers demanded $500,000 for his freedom, Mr. Marquez said in an interview. Eventually his family agreed to a smaller ransom, Mr. Marquez said. When his son delivered the money, the kidnappers released Mr. Marquez but seized his son, demanding a second ransom, which the family also paid, Mr. Marquez said.
He is trying to sell his business, he said, and hopes to relocate to some safer city in Mexico. But he said that a friend who witnessed his kidnapping was so rattled that he had since gone to live with a brother in California.
Residents described several other recent kidnappings and extortions across the state of Zacatecas: a cattleman held until a daughter in Las Vegas sent money to help pay a $35,000 ransom; a rancher who was tied to a tree during a five-day period of captivity; a car-parts dealer who avoided capture by immediately paying gunmen the ransom they demanded.
Those who live in the region say such crimes -- and the attention they receive on Spanish-language television in the United States -- appear to have frightened not only those who live here year-round. Most years at Christmastime, hundreds of men in cowboy hats who work north of the border return to Jerez, jamming the streets with pickup trucks and cars with California and Illinois license plates and reuniting with old friends and family in the town square.
This holiday season, Jerez and surrounding towns have had few migrants return. And demographers based in Jalisco and Michoacan said in interviews that few migrants had returned to those states either.
Those reports surprised many who study immigration, including Douglas S. Massey, a sociology professor at Princeton University.
''What I thought would be happening this Christmas is that more migrants would go home to Mexico than usual and just stay there,'' Dr. Massey said. Surveys of Mexican migrants that he conducted last summer in North Carolina after a large poultry processing plant closed there showed that ''people were heading back to Mexico because they couldn't find another job'' and because federal raids had spread so much fear among migrants, he said.
''People were saying, 'If it's a matter of surviving day to day, I'd rather do that in Mexico,' '' Dr. Massey said.
Other experts also expected to see larger than usual flows of Mexicans home this Christmas. A caucus of Mexican legislators who specialize in migration issues predicted in October that some three million Mexicans might return from the United States as a result of the recession. But the same group reported in a study released in late December that in fact fewer migrants seemed to have returned this holiday season than in previous years, in part because of what they delicately termed ''the insecurity in Mexico.''
And in Felipe Angeles, the flow of people ran north rather than south at year-end.
Residents here were so frightened by the kidnappings of the octogenarian and of about a dozen other people who lived in or near this village in recent months that hundreds of them set up a roadblock with their tractors and trucks on the main highway here last month. They demanded that the army send troops to protect them. Soldiers were deployed to patrol the town for a few days, but that did not leave the residents feeling secure.
''The kidnappers were targeting people with relatives in the United States, because they knew these families have money,'' said Santana Lujan, a local farmer who participated in the blockade. ''It's left a psychosis of fear and worry.''
A teacher who spoke on the condition of anonymity estimated that of the town's 400 houses, about 200 were now vacant, with 50 of them emptied in recent weeks. About half of the departing families left for the United States, he said, while the rest sought safety elsewhere in Mexico.
In an interview, the 80-year-old man who was kidnapped trembled when describing his six-day captivity. He said he was repeatedly kicked by his captors.
His daughter has since urged him to go live with her in the United States, but he said he felt too old to emigrate.
''But many people have left,'' he said, ''and more are going to leave.''

DAYBOOK
Gifted? There's a Test
Monday. These days, the anxiety-racked testing process begins practically at birth, and by age 5, children are hardly shocked by the gantlet that is the public school system. So try to relax, parents, as the city starts testing the potentially ''gifted and talented'' for entry into its kindergarten and first-grade programs. Just think, after that, the only goal is to stay sane until results come out in April. 
Recession Relief
Friday, 10 a.m. If the sight of money -- even the unspendable ancient kind -- will cheer you in these bleak times, choose your salve at the 37th Annual New York International Numismatic Convention, which is open to the public for its final three days. Put on your best suit and peruse the booths, caress the glossy catalogs, ogle the gleaming coins ... anything to forget for one morning that this is currency you can't afford to buy, much less spend. Waldorf-Astoria, 301 Park Avenue, Manhattan. Cost: $10.
Ups, Downs and Aches
Saturday, 2 p.m. When was the last time you went to a library to see wrestling? Well, not wrestling so much as a talk about wrestling, featuring washed-up former pros doing demonstrations and signing autographs. It's ''Down for the Count: The Ups and Downs of Professional Wrestling,'' featuring Tito Torres, a six-time American Wrestling Federation champion, and Crusher Townsend. There will be a short film, don't-do-this-at-home warnings, and refreshments -- after the demonstration of ''dangerous moves,'' one hopes. St. George Library Center, 5 Central Avenue, Staten Island.
Back to the Indoors
Sunday. The Brooklyn Flea, by its expansive nature an outdoor affair, is in hibernation until April. But those of you who can't possibly halt your antiquing for that long, fear not: The organizers are taking it inside. The Flea's ''Winter Pop-Up Market,'' in Dumbo, will have all you'd expect -- vintage stuff, furniture, art, clothing -- along with ''curiosities,'' which you'll turn your nose up at but secretly buy in abundance. 76 Front Street, Brooklyn.
Trees After Death
Sunday. No more procrastinating; it's officially time to surrender your Christmas tree. Depending on where you go, you may even get some free mulch out of it. Drop it off at parks all over the city. Details: www.nycgovparks.org.
NICOLE COLLINS TAKING

THE EAGLES TOPPLE THE VIKINGS, AND GET TO MEET THE GIANTS AGAIN
For the better part of the National Football Conference wild-card game, the Philadelphia Eagles' offense suffered an afternoon of frustration against the Minnesota Vikings. Philadelphia led by 2 points late in the game, but the Vikings seemed one big Adrian Peterson play away from stealing the game. Then, with less than seven minutes to play, Brian Westbrook took a short pass, turned upfield and dashed for a 71-yard touchdown, earning a trip to the second round, where the Eagles will face the New York Giants.

HEADLINE: Obama Plan Includes $300 Billion in Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER and CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President-elect Barack Obama plans to include about $300 billion in tax cuts for workers and businesses in his economic recovery program, advisers said Sunday, as his team seeks to win over Congressional skeptics worried that he was too focused on government spending. 
 The legislation Mr. Obama is developing with Congressional Democrats will devote about 40 percent of the cost to tax cuts, including his centerpiece campaign promise to provide credits up to $500 for most workers, costing roughly $150 billion. The package will also include more than $100 billion in tax incentives for businesses to create jobs and invest in equipment or factories.
 The overall economic package, of $675 billion to $775 billion, is taking shape as Mr. Obama arrived in Washington and planned to begin trying to build support in Congress and among the broader public for his approach to stimulating the economy. Mr. Obama, who flew to the capital on Sunday to join his family in a hotel suite while awaiting his inauguration, planned to meet with Congressional leaders on Monday and deliver a speech on Thursday laying the ground for his emerging economic program. 
 Although some tax cuts were always expected to be included in Mr. Obama's economic package, his team disclosed the scope and some details of the plans on Sunday at a time when Republicans have begun voicing criticism of what they describe as an open-checkbook approach to spending. By focusing more attention on the tax cuts in the plan, Obama aides hope to frame it as a balanced, pragmatic approach.
 Mr. Obama will use his public events this week to promise what one adviser called ''radical reforms'' to impose more control over the regular federal budget down the road. Among other areas, the president-elect will focus on changing Pentagon contracting and aid to corporate America, advisers said. He will also designate a chief performance officer and a chief technology officer on Wednesday to help make government more efficient, they said. 
 Still, Democratic leaders in Congress acknowledged that the economic package would not be ready for Mr. Obama's signature immediately after his inauguration on Jan. 20, as they once hoped. 
 ''It's going to be very difficult to get the package put together that early so that it can have sufficient time to be reviewed, and then sufficient time to be debated and passed,'' Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the House majority leader, said on ''Fox News Sunday.'' 
 Mr. Hoyer said a more likely goal would be mid-February before Congress leaves on a Presidents' Day recess. ''We certainly want to see this package passed through the House of Representatives no later than the end of this month, get it over to the Senate, and have it to the president before we break for the presidential break,'' Mr. Hoyer said.
 Congressional Republicans continued to press for more public hearings and study, and some of their leaders threw out their own ideas for what should be in the plan. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, proposed Sunday that any money distributed to the states be provided as loans rather than outright grants.
 ''Nobody thinks we ought to be spending this money on things like mob museums and waterslides,'' Mr. McConnell said on ''This Week'' on ABC. ''And if the money were lent rather than just granted, states would I think spend it wisely, and the states that didn't need it at all wouldn't take any.''
 Mr. McConnell said Republicans were more likely to favor tax relief and tax credits as part of the economic measure and said Congress should consider reducing the 25 percent income tax rate to 15 percent. 
 Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House speaker, said Congress would also take on the issue of waste in federal agencies, though she was not ready to disclose details of her approach. ''We will have reforms related to waste, fraud and abuse,'' she said in an interview. 
 Other Congressional officials said House Democrats would consider a plan this week requiring a new audit of all federal agencies and mandating Congressional hearings whenever inspectors general identify potential waste or fraud.
 Mr. Obama's team argued Sunday that the short-term cost of its economic plan was not a priority in the face of the dire problems in the economy. ''There is no short run, other than keeping the economy from absolutely tanking. That's the only short run,'' Vice President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. said on ''This Week.'' He added, ''We've got to begin to stem this bleeding here, and begin to stop the loss of jobs and the creation of jobs.''
 The economic package under consideration by the president-elect and his Congressional allies would commit $675 billion to $775 billion over two years. If the tax cuts represent 40 percent of that, as Mr. Obama's advisers said Sunday, that would mean about $270 billion to $310 billion.
 About half of that would go to workers under what Mr. Obama during his campaign called the Making Work Pay credit, worth up to $500 for individuals and $1,000 for families. The Obama campaign estimated that about 150 million Americans making less than $200,000 would qualify, including those who make too little to pay federal income taxes but would receive a check that would offset Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes.
 Mr. Obama's advisers said Sunday that they were searching for a way to get that credit into Americans' pockets quickly to help stimulate spending, but would not duplicate the rebate checks sent last year as part of an economic package signed by President Bush. Instead, they said, they were discussing making the credit retroactive to the 2008 tax year and adjusting withholding formulas so paychecks would start reflecting that right away.
 Mr. Obama's advisers said they were still discussing with Congressional leaders the precise plan for phasing out the credit for wealthier Americans. They said no tax increases were included in the plan because it was focused on measures that create jobs. Obama aides have signaled that they will wait to let Mr. Bush's tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans expire in 2010, rather than try to repeal them sooner.
 Likewise, other tax proposals Mr. Obama made in the campaign are not in the economic package because they are not aimed directly at job creation. Aides said the president-elect might return to those later on, possibly as early as the annual budget proposal he is to present in February. 
 ''There are lots of priorities that are not included here, not because they are any less important in the long run but because we really want to stick to the principle that this is an economic recovery plan,'' one adviser said.
 To encourage businesses to expand their work forces and operations, Mr. Obama wants a tax credit for each job created. During the campaign, he proposed $3,000 for each job. Advisers said he was now also trying to figure out a way to give incentives to businesses to resist cutting jobs, as so many have been doing.
 The economic plan will also include other tax breaks intended to stir capital investment. The stimulus package Mr. Bush signed last year included a provision generally allowing businesses immediate depreciation of half of their spending in 2008 on new equipment, rather than spreading out that depreciation over years, reducing their immediate tax burdens. Mr. Obama's advisers said they were planning to build on that, either by extending it to investment in 2009 and 2010 or through some other mechanism.
 The Obama plan would also allow businesses to apply net operating losses from last year to offset tax liabilities from prior years,enabling them to claim refunds from the government now in hopes of encouraging capital investment, much as was done in a 2002 economic stimulus plan.

HEADLINE: Fighting Off Depression

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
''If we don't act swiftly and boldly,'' declared President-elect Barack Obama in his latest weekly address, ''we could see a much deeper economic downturn that could lead to double-digit unemployment.'' If you ask me, he was understating the case.
 The fact is that recent economic numbers have been terrifying, not just in the United States but around the world. Manufacturing, in particular, is plunging everywhere. Banks aren't lending; businesses and consumers aren't spending. Let's not mince words: This looks an awful lot like the beginning of a second Great Depression. 
 So will we ''act swiftly and boldly'' enough to stop that from happening? We'll soon find out.
 We weren't supposed to find ourselves in this situation. For many years most economists believed that preventing another Great Depression would be easy. In 2003, Robert Lucas of the University of Chicago, in his presidential address to the American Economic Association, declared that the ''central problem of depression-prevention has been solved, for all practical purposes, and has in fact been solved for many decades.'' 
 Milton Friedman, in particular, persuaded many economists that the Federal Reserve could have stopped the Depression in its tracks simply by providing banks with more liquidity, which would have prevented a sharp fall in the money supply. Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, famously apologized to Friedman on his institution's behalf: ''You're right. We did it. We're very sorry. But thanks to you, we won't do it again.''
 It turns out, however, that preventing depressions isn't that easy after all. Under Mr. Bernanke's leadership, the Fed has been supplying liquidity like an engine crew trying to put out a five-alarm fire, and the money supply has been rising rapidly. Yet credit remains scarce, and the economy is still in free fall.
 Friedman's claim that monetary policy could have prevented the Great Depression was an attempt to refute the analysis of John Maynard Keynes, who argued that monetary policy is ineffective under depression conditions and that fiscal policy -- large-scale deficit spending by the government -- is needed to fight mass unemployment. The failure of monetary policy in the current crisis shows that Keynes had it right the first time. And Keynesian thinking lies behind Mr. Obama's plans to rescue the economy.
 But these plans may turn out to be a hard sell.
 News reports say that Democrats hope to pass an economic plan with broad bipartisan support. Good luck with that. 
 In reality, the political posturing has already started, with Republican leaders setting up roadblocks to stimulus legislation while posing as the champions of careful Congressional deliberation -- which is pretty rich considering their party's behavior over the past eight years. 
 More broadly, after decades of declaring that government is the problem, not the solution, not to mention reviling both Keynesian economics and the New Deal, most Republicans aren't going to accept the need for a big-spending, F.D.R.-type solution to the economic crisis. 
 The biggest problem facing the Obama plan, however, is likely to be the demand of many politicians for proof that the benefits of the proposed public spending justify its costs -- a burden of proof never imposed on proposals for tax cuts. 
 This is a problem with which Keynes was familiar: giving money away, he pointed out, tends to be met with fewer objections than plans for public investment ''which, because they are not wholly wasteful, tend to be judged on strict 'business' principles.'' What gets lost in such discussions is the key argument for economic stimulus -- namely, that under current conditions, a surge in public spending would employ Americans who would otherwise be unemployed and money that would otherwise be sitting idle, and put both to work producing something useful.
 All of this leaves me concerned about the prospects for the Obama plan. I'm sure that Congress will pass a stimulus plan, but I worry that the plan may be delayed and/or downsized. And Mr. Obama is right: We really do need swift, bold action. 
 Here's my nightmare scenario: It takes Congress months to pass a stimulus plan, and the legislation that actually emerges is too cautious. As a result, the economy plunges for most of 2009, and when the plan finally starts to kick in, it's only enough to slow the descent, not stop it. Meanwhile, deflation is setting in, while businesses and consumers start to base their spending plans on the expectation of a permanently depressed economy -- well, you can see where this is going.
 So this is our moment of truth. Will we in fact do what's necessary to prevent Great Depression II?

PERSON: Victor H. Krulak 

HEADLINE: Victor H. Krulak, 95, Marine Behind U.S. Landing Craft

BYLINE: By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN

 BODY:
Lt. Gen. Victor H. Krulak, a highly decorated Marine commander who championed innovative tactics in World War II, Korea and Vietnam, died Dec. 29 in San Diego. He was 95.
 His death was announced by his son Gen. Charles C. Krulak, the Marine commandant from 1995 to 1999.
 When he attended the Naval Academy, he was nicknamed Brute by his fellow midshipmen, a wry reference to the fact that he was only 5 feet 4 and weighed 120 pounds or so. 
 But General Krulak became a renowned figure in the Marines. He helped develop the landing craft that carried troops, vehicles and supplies onto the invasion beaches of World War II. He received the Navy Cross, the Marines' highest award for valor after the Medal of Honor, for his exploits against the Japanese. He told of the corps' history and ethos in his book ''First to Fight'' (1984).
 Victor Harold Krulak, a native of Denver, joined the Marines after graduating from Annapolis in 1934.
 In 1937, while a lieutenant in an intelligence outfit in Shanghai, when the Japanese were trying to conquer China, he used a telephoto lens to take pictures of Japanese landing craft with a square bow that became a retractable ramp, enabling troops and equipment to be dispatched quickly onto an enemy beach.
 Envisioning those ramps as answering the Marines' needs in a looming world war, Lieutenant Krulak showed the photographs to his superiors, who passed on his report to Washington. But two years later, he found that the Navy had simply filed it away with a notation saying it was the work of ''some nut out in China.''
 He persevered, building a balsa wood model of the Japanese boat design and discussing the retractable ramp concept with the New Orleans boat builder Andrew Higgins. That bow design became the basis for the thousands of Higgins landing craft of World War II. 
 ''There would not have been a Normandy or an Okinawa or an Iwo Jima without that boat,'' his son Charles said in an interview on Sunday.
 In the fall of 1943, General Krulak, a lieutenant colonel at the time, commanded a battalion in a diversionary raid on Choiseul Island in the Solomons that enabled a larger Marine contingent to capture the more important island of Bougainville. Although wounded, he continued to lead his marines in battle, bringing him the Navy Cross. Some of his wounded men were evacuated by a Navy torpedo boat skippered by Lt. John F. Kennedy.
 In the late 1940s, General Krulak helped pioneer the use of helicopters to carry marines and supplies into battle, a maneuver employed in the Korean War, when he was chief of staff of the First Marine Division.
 When Kennedy became president, General Krulak reminded him of their meeting on Choiseul. He presented Kennedy with a bottle of whiskey, something he had promised him for his rescue work back in 1943 but never had a chance to deliver. In 1962, Kennedy named General Krulak the counterinsurgency adviser to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
 During the Vietnam War's early stages, General Krulak expressed optimism over the prospects for American and South Vietnamese success. But in the mid-1960s, when he commanded all marines in the Pacific, he opposed the strategy pursued by Gen. William C. Westmoreland, the overall American commander in Vietnam.
 General Westmoreland proposed the use of marines in large-scale battles. General Krulak wanted to emphasize pacification, the effort to win over the South Vietnamese villagers by assisting in economic projects and protecting them from the enemy. He also advocated the bombing and mining of Haiphong's harbor to cut off supplies to North Vietnam. He met with President Lyndon B. Johnson in mid-1966 to press those ideas, but, as General Krulak later put it, ''as soon as he heard me speak of mining and unrestrained bombing of the ports, Mr. Johnson got to his feet, put his arm around my shoulder, and propelled me firmly toward the door.''
 General Krulak retired from the Marines in 1968. He settled in the San Diego area and became an executive and writer for the Copley Newspapers.
 In addition to his son Charles, he is survived by his sons Victor Jr. and William; four grandchildren, and 10 great-grandchildren. His wife, Amy, died in 2001. 
 In a speech to the Marine Corps Association in 2007, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates told of the young marine lieutenant of the late 1930s who pursued his ideas for an innovative landing craft after being written off as a ''nut.'' Mr. Gates said that ''Victor Krulak's story and accomplishments'' provided lessons in ''overcoming conventional wisdom and bureaucratic obstacles.''
 In his history of the Marines, General Krulak expressed concern over an ''all-encompassing military bureaucracy'' that ''represents a more formidable battlefield than many the corps has known.'' 
 ''The marines,'' he wrote, ''are an assemblage of warriors, nothing more.''

HEADLINE: For Israel, a Chance to Strike Before a Stalwart Ally Steps Down

BYLINE: By SCOTT SHANE

 BODY:
For nine days, as European and United Nations officials have called urgently for a cease-fire in Gaza, the Bush administration has squarely blamed the rocket attacks of the Palestinian militant group Hamas for Israel's assault, maintaining to the end its eight-year record of stalwart support for Israel.
 Mr. Bush, in his weekly radio address on Saturday, said the United States did not want a ''one-way cease-fire'' that allowed Hamas to keep up its rocket fire, and Vice President Dick Cheney on Sunday echoed the point, declaring that only a ''sustainable, durable'' peace would be acceptable. 
 Many Middle East experts say Israel timed its move against Hamas, which began with airstrikes on Dec. 27, 24 days before Mr. Bush leaves office, with the expectation of such backing in Washington. Israeli officials could not be certain that President-elect Barack Obama, despite past statements of sympathy for Israel's right of self-defense, would match the Bush administration's unconditional endorsement.
 ''Obviously Bush, even by comparison with past U.S. presidents, has been very, very pro-Israel,'' said Sami G. Hajjar, a longtime scholar of Middle East politics and a visiting professor at the National Defense University. ''Despite Obama's statements, and his advisers who are quite pro-Israel, the Israelis really didn't know how he'd react. His first instinct is for diplomacy, not military action.''
 Mr. Hajjar said that in addition to relying on the backing of Mr. Bush, Israeli officials may not have wanted to begin their relationship with the new president by forcing him to respond to their military action. On Dec. 19, just one month before Mr. Obama's inauguration, Hamas declared an end to an Egyptian-mediated truce with Israel that had taken effect in June, and rocket attacks from Gaza have been increasing since then.
 Mr. Obama has disappointed many commentators in the Muslim world by steadfastly declining to condemn the Gaza operation, and he maintained his silence over the weekend as Israel began a ground invasion. ''President-elect Obama is closely monitoring global events, including the situation in Gaza, but there is one president at a time,'' said Brooke Anderson, chief national security spokeswoman for Mr. Obama, repeating what has become a mantra for the incoming administration.
 Mr. Obama's stance has been interpreted by Hamas spokesmen and others as tacit assent both to Israel's actions and to the Bush administration's policy. Aides to the president-elect say he has spoken with President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice about the situation in Gaza but they do not expect him to carve out a distinct position before his inauguration.
 In the meantime, Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney, while expressing concern about the deaths and suffering of Palestinian civilians, have offered unqualified understanding for Israel's assault.
 In an interview Sunday with Bob Schieffer of the CBS News program ''Face the Nation,'' Mr. Cheney said Israel ''didn't seek clearance or approval from us'' before beginning a ground invasion on Saturday. But he said that in previous discussions, Israeli officials said they would respond forcefully to rocket attacks, ''and if they did, they would be very aggressive in terms of trying to take down Hamas.''
 Asked whether sending troops into Gaza was a mistake, the vice president replied that ''it's important to remember who the enemy is here,'' adding, ''You haven't had a conflict between two U.N. charter-member states, you've got a U.N. member state being attacked by a terrorist organization.''
 Leading Democrats, including Senators Harry Reid of Nevada and Dick Durbin of Illinois, both of whom appeared on programs on Sunday, have also expressed support for Israel. ''I think this terrorist organization, Hamas, has got to be put away,'' Mr. Reid said on NBC's ''Meet the Press.''
 The fighting between Israeli troops and Hamas comes as a dismal coda to the Bush administration's second-term push for Middle East peace, which has occupied much of Ms. Rice's tenure as secretary of state. For Mr. Obama, who flew to Washington on Sunday to join his family, it adds a new crisis to an agenda already packed with challenges, beginning with the economy.
 During his presidential campaign, Mr. Obama promised a new, positive approach to the Muslim world, including ''America Houses'' offering English lessons in Muslim countries and an ''America's Voice Corps'' to spread the truth about American values. Mr. Obama's aides have said he will unveil the new approach with a speech in a Muslim capital during his first 100 days in office. But Israel's invasion of Gaza, and Mr. Obama's studied silence about it, threatens to short-circuit his plans for an American image makeover.
 Critics abroad and at home have noted that Mr. Obama's ''one president at a time'' policy did not prevent the president-elect from speaking out against the terrorist attacks in Mumbai, India, in November, when he condemned what he called the ''hateful ideology'' of militant Islam.
 In the absence of any new statement, many have recalled Mr. Obama's remarks last July in the Israeli town of Sderot, where he implicitly recognized Israel's right to respond militarily.
 ''If somebody was sending rockets into my house, where my two daughters sleep at night, I'm going to do everything in my power to stop that,'' he told reporters. The Israeli defense minister, Ehud Barak, quoted Mr. Obama's statement in justifying the attack on Hamas during a news briefing on Dec. 29.
 Martha Joynt Kumar, a political scientist at Towson University who studies presidential transitions, said Mr. Obama's predicament exemplified the treacherous weeks between election and inauguration, and the way inspiring visions inevitably give way before unexpected events.
 ''On a campaign, you control what you talk about and when you talk about it,'' Ms. Kumar said. ''When you begin governing, you have to respond to what happens in the world.''

HEADLINE: Before Presidential Election, Iran's Hard-Liners Crack Down on Reformists

BYLINE: By NAZILA FATHI

DATELINE: TEHRAN 

 BODY:
As the race for Iran's presidential election heats up, hard-liners are cracking down on activists who have supported reformist candidates in the past.
 It is not clear who will run against President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the June election, but Mohammad Khatami, the reformist former president, has hinted that he may enter the race. Mehdi Karroubi, a former speaker of Parliament and a reformer, has said he will run.
 Although Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme religious leader, has repeatedly backed Mr. Ahmadinejad in public speeches, hard-line support for Mr. Ahmadinejad may be weaker than it appears and fear of Mr. Khatami's candidacy is high. 
 Last week, the authorities shut down the daily Kargozaran, one of the few major reformist newspapers, accusing it of reporting misinformation about Palestinian fighters in Gaza. Iranian Web sites say pressure on students to end their political activities has also increased. That comes after several thousand students gathered in December to hear Mr. Khatami speak at Tehran University, a center of vocal protest against Mr. Ahmadinejad.
 The conservative daily newspaper Kayhan, which is close to Mr. Ahmadinejad, supported the closing of Kargozaran and called for more pressure on students. 
 And in another clear signal to activists, some 150 radical students demonstrated outside the house of Shirin Ebadi, the human rights lawyer and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, on Thursday, accusing her of supporting the killing of Palestinians in Gaza. Ms. Ebadi had issued a statement condemning the killing of civilians two days earlier. 
 The demonstrators scrawled graffiti on the walls suggesting she was an American spy, and ripped down the sign for her law office, which is in the same building.
 Last month, government officials shut down the group she founded, the Center for Defenders of Human Rights, and last week they raided her office, taking her computers and files. Ms. Ebadi has received death threats in the past but this was the first time that authorities had taken action against her.
 Ms. Ebadi, who has supported Mr. Khatami in the past, has repeatedly called for free elections and criticized human rights violations.
 ''The crackdowns are all part of the efforts to prevent Mr. Khatami from winning the elections,'' said Farzaneh Roostai, the foreign editor of the daily newspaper Etemad. ''All the groups which support Khatami in one way or another are faced with increasing pressure now in order to force them to back down,'' she added. ''They are increasing the price for their political activities.''
 Hard-liners have increased pressure on political activists before previous elections. And the Guardian Council, a body of clerics and jurists that vets candidates for office, has prevented many reformers from running. But Mr. Khatami is a high-profile and charismatic leader, and it would be difficult for the Guardian Council to block his candidacy. 
 In addition, Mr. Ahmadinejad's stewardship of the ailing economy and his defiant posture on the world stage have upset many conservatives. According to a senior reformist who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, many veteran politicians who have been marginalized by Mr. Ahmadinejad are backing Mr. Khatami. The official said that group included Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a former president and an influential cleric.
 Meanwhile, the issue of whether Mr. Khatami should run has set off a debate in political circles. Mohammad Ali Abtahi, a former vice president to Mr. Khatami, said on his Web site last week that a senior conservative politician asked him in a meeting to urge Mr. Khatami not to run. ''If he becomes a candidate, we will be forced to support Ahmadinejad,'' Mr. Abtahi said the official told him. 
 ''With the situation that Mr. Ahmadinejad has created, it is not good for the country to let him become president for another four years,'' Mr. Abtahi said the official told him, referring to Mr. Ahmadinejad's political and economic policies.
 Mr. Abtahi said another conservative said in a meeting the previous week that ''if Mr. Khatami becomes a candidate, we have to vote for Mr. Ahmadinejad with tearful eyes.'' 
 Mr. Khatami's supporters believe he is the only Iranian leader who can easily win and then begin to change the country's image. Iran has been the target of three sets of United Nations Security Council sanctions over its nuclear program, and its economy is suffering from an inflation rate of 30 percent.
 ''Without doubt, he would be entering a minefield if he gets elected,'' said Ms. Roostai, the foreign editor of Etemad. ''But he is the only dynamic leader who can deal with our crippling internal and external problems.''
 Yet Saeed Leylaz, a reformist political and economics analyst, said that many reformers were urging Mr. Khatami not to run. ''First of all, there are many who think even if Khatami gets elected, he will face the same obstacles that he did when he was president before,'' he said, referring to the opposition of powerful conservative institutions when Mr. Khatami was president from 1997 to 2005. 
 ''Secondly, there are serious concerns that they won't let Mr. Khatami win under any circumstances, even if it means rigging the elections,'' Mr. Leylaz said.

HEADLINE: 2009 Resolutions For Washington

BYLINE: By ROB COX

 BODY:
2009 Resolutions
 For Washington
 Everyone has their new year's resolutions. But vowing to watch less ''Family Guy'' or do more yoga pales against the challenges the president-elect must confront: a slumping economy, consumers in retreat, banks hoarding cash and entire industries on the brink.
 His predecessor has already created some mechanisms for handling the mess, including the Troubled Asset Relief Program. And the anticipated dimensions of an expected stimulus plan expand hourly as the Jan. 20 inauguration approaches. But here are a few other resolutions we think Barack Obama should make: 
 GASOLINE TAX Raising the federal excise tax on every gallon sold has been considered for years, but the idea is gaining currency with the decline in prices to around $1.65 a gallon. The measure would serve several of Mr. Obama's promises by potentially reducing pollution, spurring innovation and preserving jobs in the auto industry, while also raising government revenues.
 Of course, raising taxes during a recession might be hard for Congress to fathom. But it's precisely while the memories of wallet-busting trips to the pump are still vivid that a modest increase could be levied. Even a 40-cent increase would take the gallon price only a smidge above $2. And it could be gradually eased in by a few cents a month over the rest of the year, making it hardly noticeable. The tax could also be elastic, declining when the average price of a gallon reaches, say, $4. On the 140 billions of gasoline sold every year, this would raise some $56 billion.
 Most important, expectations of higher gas prices over time would condition consumer behavior and give drivers an incentive to buy more fuel-efficient vehicles. By gradually imposing the tax, United States automakers would have time to modify their fleets and catch up with Asian rivals. If the Wobbly Three failed to heed these market signals, then they would deserve to go the way of the Corvair.
 AUTO INCENTIVES How has Fiat remained a going concern? Italy repeatedly offers incentives to consumers to exchange their old clunkers to buy new cars. Mr. Obama could do the same, but with a green twist. The size of the incentive could be correlated to how much more fuel-efficient the new car is, say $100 for every mile more that it gets for each gallon. That way a consumer trading in his 15-mile-a-gallon Hummer for a Chevy Volt that gets 40 miles would receive a $2,500 incentive to do so.
 CAPITAL GAINS AND DIVIDEND TAXES The Bush tax cuts are set to expire after this year. Given the slump in most investment portfolios, these taxes won't bring in anything like the income they had in previous years. Even so, it seems odd to create impediments to capital flows when industry is struggling for private money. The government should be encouraging consumers and businesses to invest and shore up their balance sheets. Making these capital gains and dividend tax cuts permanent would help.
 COST CUTS Families and corporations are cutting back, and so too should the government. The federal bureaucracy has become an unruly beast -- if it were a corporation, its stakeholders would long ago have called for a breakup. Mr. Obama could start by voluntarily taking a 10 percent salary cut and asking Congress to do the same. It's the kind of symbolic act that could drive every agency to reduce nonessential spending and redirect it to areas that vitally need it, including financial regulatory bodies and tax authorities that have allowed far too many scofflaws to flourish.
 ENFORCEMENT A lack of legislated regulation is not to blame for Bernard Madoff's $50 billion scam, the hedge funds and Wall Street firms that have proved poor stewards of investors' capital or predatory mortgage brokers. But better enforcement of the existing rules might have prevented some of the swindles, inappropriate capital structures and dodgy practices that led the financial system astray. 
 So why not hire a sort of supercop who reports to the president and is tasked with ensuring that financial regulators are doing their utmost to enforce the law? This czar -- someone like the former Securities and Exchange chairman Arthur Levitt or the New York police chief Ray Kelly, if not his boss Mike Bloomberg -- could also play a role in making reforms like those suggested by Treasury boss Hank Paulson.

 BODY:
ECONOMIC INDICATORS Dismal, but not unexpected, news on auto sales in December will come from automakers on Monday. On Tuesday, retailers get their chance to reveal how cheerless their holidays were when they report same-store sales for December. 
 Other economic reports this week will include construction spending for November (Monday); pending home sales for November, the Institute for Supply Management service index for December, factory orders for November, and minutes of the Dec. 16 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Board (Tuesday); the ADP National Employment Report (Wednesday); weekly jobless claims and consumer credit for November (Thursday); unemployment for December and wholesale trade inventories for November (Friday).
 CORPORATE EARNINGS Only a few companies are reporting earnings this week: Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea (Tuesday); Constellation Brands, Family Dollar Stores, Monsanto and Bed Bath & Beyond (Wednesday); and KB Home (Friday).
 THE LAWMAKERS The House Financial Services Committee will conduct a hearing Monday into the Ponzi schemeBernard L. Madoff is accused of running. On Tuesday, Congress will be sworn in and may begin drafting an economic stimulus package.
 TECHNOLOGY SHOWS The Macworld Conference and Expo takes place in San Francisco Monday through Friday, but Steven P. Jobs, Apple's chief executive, broke tradition by declining to speak at the show of Apple products. The Consumer Electronics Show, the biggest technology gathering, will begin Thursday in Las Vegas with fewer participants as the global recession hits the tech sector.
 ET CETERA On Friday, the Screen Actors Guild plans to send strike-authorization ballots to more than 100,000 members. Opposition to a strike among its membership has stifled the union's negotiating abilities. The actors' contract with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents Hollywood's major production companies and studios, expired on June 30.

HEADLINE: Richardson Won't Pursue Cabinet Post

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG; Jeff Zeleny and Adam Nagourney contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, President-elect Barack Obama's choice for commerce secretary, withdrew from consideration for that job on Sunday, saying a pending investigation into whether his administration gave lucrative contracts to a political donor would have ''forced an untenable delay'' in his confirmation.
 The president-elect and the governor, close friends as well as political allies, announced the withdrawal in joint statements. Mr. Richardson, one of the nation's best-known Latino politicians, promised to stay on as governor and said his administration had ''acted properly in all matters.'' But he said he had concluded that the inquiry could last weeks or even months, drawing out his confirmation hearings and distracting the new administration as it grappled with the economic crisis. 
 Mr. Obama said he accepted ''with deep regret'' Mr. Richardson's decision to bow out. People familiar with discussions between the two men said that while the president-elect did not press Mr. Richardson to step aside, neither did Mr. Obama try to talk him out of it.
 The announcement, just days before the Senate is to begin confirmation hearings for some of Mr. Obama's cabinet selections, was a setback for the president-elect, who has assembled his cabinet in near-record time. It raises questions about the thoroughness of Mr. Richardson's vetting, deprives the Obama administration of a prominent Hispanic -- Mr. Obama has, however, named two other Latinos, Representative Hilda L. Solis of California and Senator Ken Salazar of Colorado, to cabinet posts -- and leaves a hole in the new White House economics team at a critical juncture. 
 Obama officials could not say on Sunday how quickly the president-elect would move to fill the job, or who may be on his short list. Mr. Obama is hoping to persuade Congress to pass an ambitious economic stimulus plan that he can sign quickly after taking office, and he is set to meet with his economic advisers on Monday. The commerce secretary would play an integral role in that process, as Mr. Richardson himself noted on Sunday.
 ''Given the gravity of the economic situation the nation is facing,'' the governor said, ''I could not in good conscience ask the president-elect to delay for one day the important work that needs to be done.''
 The investigation concerns CDR Financial Products Inc., a Beverly Hills, Calif., company that in 2004 was awarded two consulting contracts worth about $1.4 million to advise the State of New Mexico on a large bond issue for building infrastructure, one of Mr. Richardson's initiatives. The company's president, David Rubin, a major Democratic contributor, gave about $100,000 to two political action committees controlled by Mr. Richardson, as well as $10,000 to his re-election campaign in 2005, according to published reports.
 The F.B.I. began examining the contracts last year; in August, the inquiry was reported in the New Mexico news media. But an Obama transition official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the president-elect's team, while aware that one of Mr. Richardson's donors was being investigated, did not know that the inquiry extended to Mr. Richardson until after Mr. Obama announced the New Mexico governor as his commerce secretary choice in early December. 
 About two weeks after the announcement, newspapers reported that a federal grand jury was examining accusations that the Richardson administration had awarded the contracts because of the political contributions. Whether the Obama team learned of the grand jury inquiry through news reports, or perhaps from Mr. Richardson himself, was unclear on Sunday. Obama officials would not say.
 But Robert Gibbs, the incoming White House press secretary, defended the vetting process. ''The totality of our cabinet picks, it's impressive and I think our vetters have done a good job,'' he said.
 Sunday's announcement comes as Mr. Obama was still dealing with the uproar over another inquiry, this one into whether Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois had tried to sell Mr. Obama's Senate seat. But while the president-elect has distanced himself from the Illinois governor, he praised Mr. Richardson on Sunday as ''an outstanding public servant'' who would have brought ''great insights accumulated through an extraordinary career'' to the Obama administration.
 ''It is a measure of his willingness to put the nation first that he has removed himself as a candidate for the cabinet in order to avoid any delay in filling this important economic post at this critical time,'' Mr. Obama said.
 Mr. Richardson and Mr. Obama spoke Friday, officials familiar with the conversation said, and Mr. Richardson informed the president-elect that he intended to withdraw his name from consideration. The Obama transition team had grown concerned that Mr. Richardson's confirmation could be delayed because of the federal investigation, which would have kept Mr. Obama's full economic team from being in place as the new president tried to jump start the economy.
 Associates of Mr. Richardson said the governor was convinced that the investigation would clear him, and that ultimately he would be confirmed. But they said the inquiry was taking longer than he thought, and that he decided to drop out on his own.
 Mr. Obama did not ask Mr. Richardson to step aside, associates close to both men said. But when Mr. Richardson offered to withdraw, the officials said, Mr. Obama simply accepted, without trying to persuade Mr. Richardson otherwise. 
 Mr. Richardson, whose mother is Mexican, has long been a fixture of Democratic politics and has deep experience in public life. He is known for his easy sense of humor -- during the 2004 Democratic convention, he distributed jars of salsa with his picture on them -- and remains popular in his home state. Prior to becoming governor, he served in Congress and in the Clinton administration as energy secretary and ambassador to the United Nations. But after his own bid for the Democratic nomination for president failed last year, he made a public -- and by his own account, painful -- break with the Clintons to endorse Mr. Obama; in return, some speculated he might be selected for a top-tier cabinet position, like secretary of state. 
 Instead, Mr. Obama rewarded him with the commerce secretary's job; at the press conference announcing the appointment, the president-elect dismissed the notion that the post was a ''consolation prize,'' adding, ''I think the notion that somehow commerce secretary is not going to be central to everything we do is fundamentally mistaken.''

HEADLINE: A Pitch for Mass Transit

 BODY:
Unlike President Bush, Barack Obama is going to enter office with a clear appreciation of the urgent problems of climate change and America's growing dependency on foreign oil -- and a strong commitment to address both. 
 One way he can do this is to give mass transit -- trains, buses, commuter rails -- the priority it deserves and the full financial and technological help it needs and has long been denied. 
 Mass transit has always played second fiddle to the automobile, so Mr. Obama will need strong allies. Ray LaHood, Mr. Obama's choice for transportation secretary, must be not only an ally but a champion for mass transit. Mr. LaHood is a Republican and former member of Congress from rural Illinois, where farmers produce a lot of ethanol and where people mostly drive. His resume on transportation issues is thin, and we fear he may need some coaxing in this new direction. 
 Another important ally should be -- and almost certainly will be -- James Oberstar, a Minnesota Democrat who is chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. 
 For years, the division of transportation money in Washington has heavily favored cars and trucks -- more than 80 percent of the big transit money from gas taxes goes to highways and bridges, and less than 20 percent to railroads or mass transit. Mr. Oberstar is leading the charge to change that formula and divide this money a little more evenly. This will not be easy. Automobiles will be with us a long time, and old spending habits die hard. But as part of the stimulus package now under discussion for transportation, Mr. Oberstar is proposing $30 billion for highways and bridges and $12 billion for public transit. That is certainly a far healthier mix. 
 The new administration could further help mass transit by shelving the unfair ''cost effectiveness index'' that President Bush put in place several years ago for new transit programs. The net effect of this index was to make it easier to build highways and almost impossible to use federal money for buses, streetcars, light rail, trolleys -- indeed, any commuter-rail projects. 
 For Mr. Obama's transit agenda and for Mr. LaHood, the next big challenge will be a transit bill that Congress must pass by September. Mr. LaHood is widely praised for his management skills and his ability to work well with others. Those abilities will certainly be needed if he and the Congress are to find and then finance the best, the most-efficient and the most-advanced ways for Americans to move around.

HEADLINE: Restore the Senate's Treaty Power

BYLINE: By JOHN R. BOLTON and JOHN YOO. 
John R. Bolton, the ambassador to the United Nations from 2005 to 2006, is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and the author of ''Surrender Is Not an Option.'' John Yoo, a deputy assistant attorney general from 2001 to 2003, is a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley and a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.

 BODY:
THE Constitution's Treaty Clause has long been seen, rightly, as a bulwark against presidential inclinations to lock the United States into unwise foreign commitments. The clause will likely be tested by Barack Obama's administration, as the new president and Secretary of State-designate Hillary Clinton, led by the legal academics in whose circles they have long traveled, contemplate binding down American power and interests in a dense web of treaties and international bureaucracies.
 Like past presidents, Mr. Obama will likely be tempted to avoid the requirement that treaties must be approved by two-thirds of the Senate. The usual methods around this constitutional constraint are executive agreements or a majority vote in the House and Senate to pass a treaty as a simple law (known as a Congressional-executive agreement). 
 Executive agreements have an acknowledged but limited place in our foreign affairs.Congressional-executive agreements are far more troubling. They have evoked scathing attacks by constitutional experts and have been strongly resisted in the Senate, at least so far. 
 The framers of the Constitution designed the treaty process with a bias against ''entangling alliances,'' as Thomas Jefferson described them in his first inaugural address. They designated the Senate as the body responsible to protect the interests of the states from being bargained away by the president in deals with foreign nations. The framers required a supermajority to ensure that treaties would reflect a broad consensus and careful, mature decision-making.
 America needs to maintain its sovereignty and autonomy, not to subordinate its policies, foreign or domestic, to international control. On a broad variety of issues -- many of which sound more like domestic rather than foreign policy -- the re-emergence of the benignly labeled ''global governance'' movement is well under way in the Obama transition. 
 Candidate Obama promised to ''re-engage'' and ''work constructively within'' the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Will the new president pass a new Kyoto climate accord through Congress by sidestepping the constitutional requirement to persuade two-thirds of the Senate? 
 Draconian restrictions on energy use would follow. A majority of the Congress would be much easier for Mr. Obama to get than a supermajority of the Senate. A scholar at the Brookings Institution has already proposed that a new president overcome objections to this environmentalists' holy grail by evading the Treaty Clause. 
 President George W. Bush resisted many efforts at global governance. But his administration still sometimes fell into the temptation to flout the constitutional requirement of a two-thirds majority in the Senate. 
 In 2002, the administration considered submitting the Treaty of Moscow, a nuclear arms reduction agreement, for majority approval of Congress. Vice President-elect Joe Biden, who was then the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, privately made clear that he would vigorously oppose such an attempt to evade the Senate's constitutional prerogatives. The administration agreed to submit the agreement as a treaty, and the Moscow agreement cleared the Senate. 
 We hope the new vice president will not reverse his commitment to the Senate's constitutional authority. But an administration determined to tie one hand behind America's back might use Congressional-executive agreements to push the nation all too easily into quixotic and impractical global governance regimes. 
 President Bill Clinton signed Kyoto, but the Senate in effect rejected it. He also signed the Rome Treaty of 1998 that established an International Criminal Court, which would subject American soldiers and officials to unaccountable international prosecutors and judges for alleged war crimes (including, potentially, the undefined crime of ''aggression''). Mr. Clinton did not even send this agreement to the Senate. Mr. Bush ''unsigned'' it. Mr. Obama might re-sign it and seek approval by only a majority of both houses of Congress.
 Other international regimes might restrict America's freedom of action to defend itself. In 1999, the Senate rejected the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which would have undermined America's ability to verify the reliability and effectiveness of its nuclear deterrent. Mr. Obama has said he supports ratification. The historical precedents are that major arms control agreements must receive the approval of two-thirds of the Senate. 
 President Bush, like President Clinton, did not sign a global agreement that would ban antipersonnel land mines, on the grounds that they are a key component of the American defense of South Korea. But his administration has pressed for ratification of the treaty on the law of the sea, which would subject disputes over the free passage of American naval vessels to the jurisdiction of an international maritime court -- which the Senate has so far refused to ratify. 
 If Mr. Obama were to submit either of these agreements for approval by a simple majority of the House and Senate, his actions would pose a serious challenge to American principles of law and democratic governance. Global governance schemes delegate power to independent international organizations to make and enforce laws that would apply domestically, by international bureaucrats who are unaccountable to Congress, the president, American public opinion or the democratic process. 
 It is true that some multinational economic agreements, like Bretton Woods, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the North American Free Trade Agreement, went into effect after approval by majorities of Congress rather than two-thirds of the Senate. But international agreements that go beyond the rules of international trade and finance -- that involve significant national-security commitments,or that purport to delegate lawmaking and enforcement functions to international organizations, or that could fundamentally alter the American constitutional system of individual rights -- should receive the intense scrutiny of the treaty process, regardless of their policy merits. 
 By insisting on the proper constitutional process for treaty-making, Republicans can join Mr. Obama in advancing a bipartisan foreign policy. They can also help strike the proper balance between the legislative and executive branches that so many have called for in recent years.

HEADLINE: Speaker Makes Room For New No. 1 Democrat

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
When the 111th Congress convenes Tuesday, Representative Nancy Pelosi will return to her post as House speaker but in an entirely new role.
 For the last two years, Ms. Pelosi, 68, of California, has been the driving force behind the Democratic Party's ambitions, using her firm grip on the House to set the agenda. Now she finds herself about to become facilitator in chief, working with her Senate counterpart, Harry Reid of Nevada, to advance the ideals of the nation's new No. 1 Democrat: Barack Obama. 
 Ms. Pelosi said she was more than willing to make room at the top, saying she was overjoyed to be working with a fellow Democrat in the Oval Office after two years of butting heads with President Bush on everything from the war in Iraq to children's health care to overall spending. 
 ''It is for me thrilling to be speaker with a Democrat in the White House. This is what we have worked for for such a long time,'' Ms. Pelosi said in an interview. ''I feel in a stronger position now. For me, my responsibility as speaker is enormously enhanced by a president whose vision I respect and whose agenda I will help stamp.''
 Yet even some Pelosi allies predict the coming months could be an adjustment for a speaker who has relished being in command.
 ''She has been queen of her castle for quite a while now and the face of the Democratic Party, and I think she is going to want to continue to be at least the co-face as much as possible,'' said one longtime senior Congressional official who did not want to be identified talking about the speaker's outlook.
 But those close to Ms. Pelosi say she recognizes that the events of the coming months will be crucial in shaping her own legacy as a political leader, giving her a powerful incentive to work hand in hand with the new administration to address the nation's mounting economic problems and the unsettled international situation.
 Putting together a string of accomplishments would cement her position as a pivotal Congressional figure, the first woman to be speaker, joining forces with the first black president at a time of national crisis. 
 ''The prestige of someone like Sam Rayburn was really enhanced by the fact that he was able to work with Democratic presidents,'' said Ross K. Baker, a Congressional expert at Rutgers University, speaking of the Texan who was House speaker for 17 years. ''She is an institutionalist. I think she will defend the prerogatives of the House. But I think she understands that with a Democratic president, the initiative comes from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.'' 
 And success can only translate into political benefits for the majority she helped build through years of constant fund-raising and campaigning.
 ''She understands strategically that if we do well, they will do well,'' said Rahm Emanuel, the former member of the House Democratic leadership who will be the next White House chief of staff.
 The Pelosi-Emanuel nexus looms large. The two built a very close relationship as they mapped the Democratic takeover of the House in 2006, and Ms. Pelosi has looked to Mr. Emanuel for counsel over the last four years. But they both have strong personalities and will have to sort through their new roles and responsibilities in the months ahead.
 As for Mr. Obama, Ms. Pelosi considers herself a fervent admirer even though she remained studiously neutral in his primary battle with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. But while she played referee, Ms. Pelosi also took stances at moments that were viewed as beneficial to Mr. Obama, and she sees their cooperation as crucial.
 ''Few Congresses and few presidents have had the daunting responsibilities that this Congress and president have,'' she said. ''It is essential that we work together to get as much bipartisan support as possible in our policies as we go forward.''
 Aides and advisers say Ms. Pelosi is more than willing to follow Mr. Obama's lead and has already demonstrated a willingness to defer to him even on an issue of high import to her. While Ms. Pelosi has said she would prefer a quick legislative repeal of the Bush administration's restrictions on embryonic stem cell research, she indicated that she would go along if Mr. Obama chooses to act more quickly through executive order. 
 Yet tensions with the White House -- even a White House run by one's own party -- are inevitable as situations arise where the administration and members of Congress have conflicting priorities. Congressional Democrats and President Bill Clinton struggled at times during the two years that Democrats controlled Congress in the Clinton years. Even President Bush and Congressional Republicans clashed despite the willingness of those on Capitol Hill to give way regularly to the administration.
 It is doubtful that Democrats will go as far as Republicans did. ''We are an independent branch of government,'' Ms. Pelosi said, pointing out that members of Congress have their own views of how to contend with many issues. ''The fact is that we have many ideas that will need the signature of the president.''
 While she shared leadership responsibilities last session with Mr. Reid, Ms. Pelosi was often the more prominent party voice given Mr. Reid's affinity for the background and the fact that House rules gave her much more leverage in advancing legislation.
 Though she and Mr. Reid worked well together, the inability of Senate Democrats to overcome Republican filibusters on House-passed legislation caused some friction between the two chambers. A larger Senate majority should allow Democrats to clear more procedural hurdles this session, easing some of the House frustration.
 But Ms. Pelosi's main frustration was clearly with Mr. Bush. Though the two had a cordial personal relationship, their political and policy goals could hardly have been more different, resulting in two years marked by deep differences over the war in Iraq, economic matters and domestic policy. She said she was not sure how she would have responded had Mr. Obama lost.
 ''This administration has failed on so many scores that it was absolutely essential that this take place,'' she said about the Obama victory and his impending presidency. ''It is in the interest of every American that he succeed, and that includes the speaker of the House.''

HEADLINE: More Isn't Always Better in Coronary Care

BYLINE: By JANE E. BRODY

 BODY:
Ira's story is a classic example of invasive cardiology run amok.
 Ira, of Hewlett, N.Y., was 53 when he had an exercise stress test as part of an insurance policy application. Though he lasted the full 12 minutes on the treadmill with no chest pain, an abnormality on the EKG led to an angiogram, which prompted the cardiologist to suggest that a coronary artery narrowed by atherosclerosis be widened by balloon angioplasty, with a wire-mesh tube called a stent inserted to keep the artery open.
 The goal, he was told, was to prevent a clot from blocking the artery and causing a heart attack or sudden cardiac death.
 Wanting to avoid an invasive procedure, Ira decided to pursue a less drastic course of dieting, weight loss and cholesterol-lowering medication. But three years later, the specter of a stent arose again. An abnormal reading on a presurgical EKG led to another angiogram, which indicated that the original narrowing had worsened. Cowed by the stature of the cardiologist, Ira finally agreed to have not one but three coronary arteries treated with angioplasty and drug-coated stents, making him one of about a million Americans who last year underwent angioplasties, most of whom had stents inserted. 
 Being Treated While Healthy
 For patients in the throes of a heart attack and those with crippling chest pain from even minor exertion, angioplasty and stents can be lifesaving, says Dr. Michael Ozner, a Miami cardiologist and the author of ''The Great American Heart Hoax'' (Benbella Books, $24.95). But, Dr. Ozner said in an interview, such ''unstable'' patients represent only a minority of those undergoing these costly and sometimes risky procedures.
 Most stent patients are healthy like Ira, who was experiencing no chest pain or cardiac symptoms of any sort. Yet Ira was afraid not to follow the doctor's advice, despite the fact that no study has shown that these procedures in otherwise healthy patients can reduce the risk of heart attacks, crippling angina or sudden cardiac death. ''We've extended the indications for surgical angioplasty and stent placement without any data to support the procedures in the vast majority of patients -- stable patients with blockages in their arteries,'' Dr. Ozner said. 
 What the studies do show, Dr. Ozner said, is that putting stents in such patients is no more protective than following a heart-healthy lifestyle and taking medication and, if necessary, nutritional supplements to reduce cardiac risk. The studies have also shown that stents sometimes make matters worse by increasing the chance that a dangerous clot will form in a coronary artery, as noted in 2006 by an advisory panel to the Food and Drug Administration. 
 Dr. Ozner, medical director of the Cardiovascular Prevention Institute of South Florida, is one of many prevention-oriented cardiologists vocal about the overuse of ''interventional cardiology,'' a specialty involving invasive coronary treatments that have become lucrative for the hospitals and doctors who perform them. 
 Even some interventional cardiologists have expressed concern about the many patients without symptoms who are treated surgically. ''The only justification for these procedures is to prolong life or improve the quality of life,'' said Dr. David L. Brown, an interventional cardiologist and chief of cardiology at Stony Brook University Medical Center, ''and there are plenty of patients undergoing them who fit into neither category.''
 Mistaken Assumptions
 The treatments -- coronary artery bypass surgery, angioplasty and the placement of drug-coated stents -- cost about $60 billion a year in the United States. Though they are not known to prevent heart attacks or coronary mortality in most patients, they are covered by insurance. Counseling patients about diet, exercise and stress management -- which is relatively inexpensive and has been proved to be life-extending -- is rarely reimbursed. In other words, procedure-oriented modern cardiology is pound wise and penny foolish. And in these economic times, it makes great sense to reconsider the approaches to reducing morbidity and mortality from the nation's leading killer.
 Most people mistakenly think of coronary artery disease as a plumbing problem. Influenced by genetics, diet, diabetes, hypertension, smoking and other factors, major arteries through which oxygen-rich blood flows to the heart gradually become narrowed by deposits of cholesterol-rich plaques until blood can no longer pass through, resulting in a heart attack. 
 In coronary bypass surgery, a blood vessel taken from elsewhere in the body is reattached to a clogged coronary artery to bypass the narrowed part. 
 However, as Dr. Ozner points out in his book, ''three major studies performed in the late 1970s and early 1980s clearly proved that for the majority of patients, bypass surgery is no more effective than conservative medical treatment.'' The exceptions -- patients whose health and lives could be saved -- were those with advanced disease of the left main coronary artery and those with severe crippling, or unstable, angina. 
 Bypass surgery does relieve the pain of angina, though recent studies suggest this may happen because pain receptors around the heart are destroyed during surgery.
 ''The studies on angioplasty delivered even worse news,'' Dr. Ozner wrote. ''Unless the patient was in the midst of a heart attack, the opening of a blocked coronary artery with a balloon catheter resulted in a worse outcome compared to management through medication.'' In fact, one trial, published in 2003 in The Journal of the American College of Cardiology, found that balloon angioplasty, which flattens plaque against arterial walls, actually raised the risk of a heart attack or death.
 Stents were designed to keep the flattened plaque in place. But studies of stable patients found no greater protection against heart attacks from stents than from treatments like making lifestyle changes and taking drugs to lower cholesterol and blood pressure.
 A Small Culprit
 A new understanding of how most heart attacks occur suggests why these procedures have not lived up to their promise. According to current evidence, most heart attacks do not occur because an artery is closed by a large plaque. Rather, a relatively small, unstable plaque ruptures and attracts inflammatory cells and coagulating agents, leading to an artery-blocking clot. 
 In most Americans middle age and older, small plaques are ubiquitous in coronary arteries and there is no surgical way to treat them all.
 ''Interventional cardiology is doing cosmetic surgery on the coronary arteries, making them look pretty, but it's not treating the underlying biology of these arteries,'' said Dr. Ozner, who received the 2008 American Heart Association Humanitarian Award. ''If some of the billions spent on intervention were put into prevention, we'd have a much healthier America at a lower cost.'' 
 Dr. Ozner advises patients who are told they need surgery to get an independent second opinion from a specialist. 
 This is the first of two columns on preventing heart attacks. Next week: Noninvasive remedies that work.

HEADLINE: For a High Scorer, No More Dropping Out

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
On a wall of East Side House Settlement, a nonprofit group in the South Bronx, there is a name and a number on a yellow card. The name is Jennine Lynes, and the number is 3,320: Ms. Lynes's score on the General Educational Development test.
Of the thousands of students who have prepared for the G.E.D. exam at East Side House Settlement, no one ever earned 3,320 before, officials there said. The minimum needed to pass the test, which provides those who did not finish high school with a New York State high school equivalency diploma, is 2,250 out of 4,000. 
The yellow card on the wall is a modest tribute to Ms. Lynes's quiet determination to refocus on her education after dropping out of high school midway through her senior year, even as she struggles to find ways to pay for that education.
Ms. Lynes is a freshman majoring in history at City College in Manhattan, with dreams of one day attending George Washington University in Washington.
''I want my Ph.D. in history, and I want my master's in economics and I want a master's in political science,'' said Ms. Lynes, a 25-year-old Bronx resident.
Such academic striving is a sharp turnaround from nine years ago, when Ms. Lynes dropped out of Brooklyn Technical High School.
She was working at the time at a health food store in the East Village, earning $18 an hour, and the manager asked her to take on more responsibility. She thought she could always go back to school, but as the years passed, the idea of going back seemed more and more daunting.
But starting in late 2007, she began focusing once more on her education, inspired in part by her church, Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem; her mother, Joyce Lynes, whom she calls ''my driving force''; and her political frustration with the Bush administration.
''I felt like my voice wasn't being heard,'' Ms. Lynes said.
So in April 2008 she went to East Side House Settlement, which provides free G.E.D. courses, social services and other programs in the Mott Haven neighborhood of the Bronx. She performed so well on a G.E.D. predictor exam that she took the real test in July.
She applied for federal and state tuition aid to attend City College but did not qualify, because she was working in 2007 at a Manhattan chain restaurant and her income was too high. Since quitting that company, she has struggled financially.
Her tuition for her first semester at City College, which began in August, was about $2,000. Her rent was about $700 for the apartment in the Bronx she shared with her brother. At the start of the semester, she was working two part-time jobs as a waitress and bartender at two Manhattan restaurants, struggling to pay utility, cellphone and credit card bills, and to keep up with her three classes.
East Side House Settlement, which is a member of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, used a $1,500 grant from the fund to help pay Ms. Lynes's tuition. East Side House also paid $500 toward her rent.
''They're my guardian angels,'' Ms. Lynes said of the East Side House. ''They came out of nowhere.''
Ms. Lynes cannot afford a computer or Internet access, so she uses the computers on campus, at East Side House or at public libraries. She had to quit one of the bartending jobs to focus more on her studies. Now she has the one job, earning about $10 an hour as a waitress and bartender at a pan-Asian restaurant on East 34th Street.
Dropping out again is not an option, she said. She is already planning her classes for next semester. ''I want to prove to myself that my expectations for myself were way lower than I should have had them,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Belgian Market's Luster Dims, but Legacy Stays

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE

DATELINE: ANTWERP, Belgium 

 BODY:
Teetering on their bicycles or strolling amiably while chattering into cellphones in Yiddish, Dutch, French, Hebrew or English, the Orthodox Jews of this Belgian port city have set the tone of its lively diamond market for more than a century.
 Hoveniersstraat, or Gardener's Street, is the backbone of the market, where four-fifths of the world's uncut diamonds are traded. It winds past the L & A Jewelry Factory and the office of Brinks, the armored car company, and on to the World Diamond Center just opposite the little Sephardic synagogue. On any given day but Friday, it is sprinkled liberally with Orthodox Jewish diamond traders, many of them Hasidim. 
 But today their livelihoods, perhaps even their way of life, are beginning to seem threatened as foreigners move in, most notably Indians, but also Lebanese, Israelis, Russians, Canadians and others. Moreover, many jobs traditionally linked to the diamond trade, like cutting and polishing the stones, have emigrated in recent years, driven away by high taxes and salaries, to Tel Aviv or to low-wage countries, particularly India.
 And now the financial crisis and the jolt to the United States are shaking the diamond trade, especially in the holiday season, when a large part of the world's retail diamonds are bought and sold. 
 ''Roughly half of all the polished diamonds traded in Antwerp are sold to consumers in the United States,'' said Philip Claes, spokesman for the World Diamond Center, a trade promotion group. ''And half again of those are sold between Christmas and New Year's, with a little extension trailing to St. Valentine's Day.
 ''What we see is exports down more than 10 percent,'' he added. ''It means trouble.''
 Diamond miners from Russia and South Africa reported that deliveries of rough diamonds to the market were off as much as 40 percent. Dealers talk of a ripple effect: when retail sales are off, sales of polished diamonds are off even more, and of uncut diamonds even more. Last month, the center laid off 24 employees, from a staff of 320. 
 Many Jews came to Antwerp's diamond trade in the late 19th century, when they fled pogroms in Eastern Europe. Many were on their way to the United States but settled here in Antwerp, hindered from crossing the Atlantic by illness or a lack of money.
 Over the years they have been shielded from the storms of the diamond market by the family structure of the business, in which companies are handed down father to son or shared among brothers. 
 ''The total assets of a diamond company are its trading assets,'' said Freddy J. Hanard, 60, a former diamond banker who is now chief executive of the Diamond Center. ''You're not talking huge investments in equipment. So knowledge of who you are dealing with is important.''
 Jewish dealers can often be seen with a large briefcase, chained to their belt, containing much of their inventory. To this day, when a diamond changes hands, the seller, regardless of his ethnic background, says in Hebrew, mazel, meaning good luck. 
 In all, the market employs about 7,000 people and creates work indirectly for another 26,000 as insurers, bankers, security guards and drivers. But the market has lost 25,000 jobs, directly and indirectly, since the 1970s, Mr. Claes said, with the exodus of cutters and polishers to markets like Mumbai, Tel Aviv and Dubai.
 Despite the current gloom, however, Antwerp remains a vital Jewish community. ''There are only a few places today where you can see the way the Jews lived in the 17th and 18th century in Eastern Europe,'' said Julien Klener, 69, who is president of the Consistory, an umbrella organization of Jews in Belgium. 
 Indeed, to wander today through the former Jewish districts in Polish cities like Krakow or Lodz is to encounter mainly ghosts. But the streets of Antwerp's main Jewish quarter, adjacent to the diamond market, are full of life. 
 Moskowitz's butcher shop (''Since 1933'') is filled with customers, as is Kosher King across the street. In the evening, Hoffy's restaurant on Lange Kievitstraat is filled with diners, conversing animatedly in French and Dutch but mostly Yiddish, the language of the community. Antwerp remains one of the world's few centers of spoken Yiddish.
 Ari Epstein, 33, is the son of a diamond trader, whose father emigrated from a village in Romania in the 1960s. ''It's a typical shtetl environment,'' he said, wearing the yarmulke with a business suit. ''It's live and let live. Most important is to do business together and to be honorable.''
 About a year ago, Meilech Bindinger, 30, a native of Newcastle, England, who married an Antwerp woman about 10 years ago, was asked by the rabbis of his Orthodox community to organize local social services, especially the Jewish Welfare and Health Care. He now has about 200 men and 150 women as volunteers whose main task is to visit the elderly and sick and help establish rooms in local hospitals where the Orthodox can feel comfortable with a place to pray or read and kosher meals to eat.
 Many of the aged, he said, wearing a yarmulke under his black, broad-rimmed hat and toying with his earlocks, are ''Holocaust survivors in their twilight years, with unique requirements and sensibilities.''
 ''Vivid memories resurface. We are trying to find how to work in sensitive areas.''
 But now with the mounting trouble on the diamond market, the organization faces other challenges. ''Every not-for-profit organization feels the credit crunch in a big way,'' he said, acknowledging that the organization ''is in the red.'' He added, ''It is tight.''
 Some, like Mr. Epstein, said that even with charity, things will never be the same again in the Jewish diamond world. ''Buying and selling is not enough,'' he said. ''We need accountants, administrative directors, specialists for all you do.''
 As the son of a diamond trader, he grew up in the world of buying and selling. Yet he opted to study law, then went into management at the Diamond Center. 
 ''This comes as a shock to the diamond dealers,'' Mr. Epstein said. ''But the time of the grocery stores is over,'' he said. ''We live in a world of the supermarket.''

HEADLINE: Markets Decline as Auto Sales Plummet

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY; David Jolly contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The first full trading week of 2009 began with a wobble on Wall Street, then a slide.
Stock markets finished lower on Monday, ending three consecutive sessions of gains, as car companies posted double-digit sales declines for December and oil prices rose.
The Dow Jones industrial average dipped below 9,000 to close at 8,952.89, down 81.80 points, or 0.91 percent. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 4.35 points, or 0.47 percent, to 927.45, while the Nasdaq composite index lost 4.18 points, or 0.26 percent, to 1,628.03. 
Even with Monday's losses, the markets have been making incremental gains over the last month, adding to the hopes of investors that Wall Street could be turning a corner, even if the recession continues to drag on.
While the S.& P. 500 has risen 25 percent from its November lows, analysts said that financial markets were likely to remain volatile as investors waited for more details on an economic stimulus package whose price tag could approach $1 trillion.
''It's a different year but the same problems,'' said Stuart Schweitzer, global markets strategist at J. P. Morgan Private Bank. ''What is nagging at people is the risk that this could be just another bear market rally, and history is replete with exactly such patterns of markets going up and getting knocked back down.''
Shares of Ford Motor and General Motors finished higher after the Big Three automakers announced their worst sales totals in nearly 50 years. While the figures were bleak, analysts had been bracing for even worse reports. Shares of Ford rose 12 cents, to $2.58, while G.M. gained 6 cents, to $3.71.
Ford said its sales sank 32 percent in December, while G.M. reported a drop of 31 percent. Chrysler said that its sales plummeted 53 percent last month. Toyota and Honda reported that their sales in the United States fell by more than 30 percent.
Shares of Apple rose more than 4 percent, or $3.83, to $94.58, after Steven P. Jobs, the computer maker's chief executive, released a letter addressing concerns about his health that have persisted since he decided not to make a keynote appearance at the annual Macworld Conference this week.
Mr. Jobs said a hormone imbalance had been ''robbing'' his body of necessary proteins, but he said he had begun treatment and would remain at Apple's helm.
Despite the housing slump and restricted credit for building loans, construction spending in November was stronger than economists had expected. Spending dropped by 0.6 percent, less than an expected 1.3 percent decline, the Commerce Department reported Monday.
Overall spending was pulled down by a 4 percent decline in spending on home building, but nonresidential construction rose 1 percent from October.
''This is just a matter of time, though, because the lead time for construction projects is long and the credit crunch has not yet had time to make itself felt in full,'' Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote in a note. Sooner or later, he said, nonresidential construction ''will fall very sharply indeed.''
Crude oil prices extended their rally, rising $2.47, to settle at $48.81 a barrel in New York Mercantile Exchange trading.
Although oil prices are still down sharply from their July peak of more than $145 a barrel, they have risen nearly 20 percent over the last week, from $40 a barrel last Monday, as Russia shut off gas supplies to Ukraine and new fighting in Gaza unsettled the Middle East.
The price of long-term government debt, which spiked in November and December as investors fled from riskier investments, fell on Monday.
Yields on 10- and 30-year Treasuries have rebounded from record lows and worries about vast new issues of government and corporate debt.
The yield on a 30-year Treasury bond, which increases as the price falls, rose above 3 percent for the first time since mid-December.
''We were at all-time low yield levels, and once the buying dried up, there wasn't anybody there to protect the market,'' said Tom di Galoma, head of Treasury trading at Jefferies and Company. ''I think there's great worry about supply coming.''
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 1 1/32, to 111 1/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 2.48 percent, up from 2.37 percent late Friday.
Asian markets began the day higher on Tuesday after gaining ground on Monday. The Nikkei 225 stock average rose 1 percent in early trading on Tuesday in Tokyo.
Following are the results of Monday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Rent Reprieve for the Emerald Inn, Where Somebody May Know Your Name

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
And now, courtesy of the great recession: a stay of execution for the Emerald Inn, a fixture on the Upper West Side of Manhattan for more than six decades, where the Guinness will continue to flow from the tap for at least two more years. 
 Like so many other stalwart-but-doomed Manhattan holdouts that have lost their leases under the pressure of gentrification, the Emerald -- as its habitues call it -- was scheduled to close at the end of April; its rent was to more than double. 
 But the watering hole, at 205 Columbus Avenue near 69th Street, has won a two-year lease extension thanks to ''the whole down economy, where they can't find a tenant who will pay that much,'' said Mike Campbell, 77, the Emerald's owner. 
 Indeed, the reprieve ''has to do with the economy -- and the kind of people the Campbells are,'' said Mike Clarke, an owner of the A. J. Clarke Real Estate Corporation, which manages the five-story apartment building in which the Emerald resides. Mr. Campbell's son Charlie, 49, manages the bar. 
 Mr. Clarke declined to provide details about the lease, but Mike Campbell said that his old rent was $15,700 per month, and that the landlord originally asked for more than double that. He said the two-year extension, which he signed two weeks ago, raised the monthly rent by several thousand dollars. 
 The world of the Emerald learned about the rent increase in September when the bar appeared in a real estate listing. 
 ''It was quite a shock,'' Charlie Campbell said from behind the bar on Monday. Customers, learning about the lease extension, expressed delight.
 ''It's a Cheers bar without being in Boston,'' said Ali Otstott, 32, a saleswoman. ''A lot of people here know my name.'' 
 Or as Charlie Campbell put it as he pulled a beer, ''It is what it is.'' 
 The diminutive establishment, all 800 square feet of it, has a bare-bones brick wall, walnut paneling and red vinyl booths that could never, at the Emerald, be thought of as banquettes.
 ''Columbus Avenue,'' said Ms. Otstott, ''has been turning into a strip mall, with chain stores and restaurants. Maybe the recession will help the mom-and-pops stay in business.'' 
 But there has been no death-row reprieve for some other classics facing rent increases, like the P&G Bar, at 279 Amsterdam Avenue at 73d Street. The P&G, with the iconic neon sign that has been designated a landmark -- is moving after February, to 380 Columbus Avenue at 78th Street, the former Evelyn Lounge.
 Mike Campbell's father (also Mike) opened the Emerald with his brother William. ''Exactly when, we're not sure, but it was 1943 or 1944,'' Charlie Campbell said. 
 The Emerald has been an enduring link to the West Side's raffish past, when Columbus and Amsterdam Avenues were populated by gin mills and where brawls among patrons, enthusiastically mediated by bruiser bartenders, were not unusual. 
 ''We were called Spanish Harlem until the '60s, when they put in Lincoln Center,'' said Charlie Campbell. In recent decades, the clientele has gone upscale, to professionals who can afford Upper West Side housing, along with a sprinkling of loyal locals, some of them survivors of the era when ''West Side Story'' was a contemporary narrative.
 For years the Emerald bore a yellow and green neon sign, but about a decade ago the old sign yielded to an awning (green, necessarily). These days the front of the bar is graced only by a green neon window shamrock affixed to a blue Corona sign. 
 About that Scottish moniker -- Campbell -- in relation to an Irish bar: ''My people are from Galway,'' said Charlie Campbell proudly, ''after the Scottish kicked us out.'' 
 Because Harry Reasoner, the ABC News anchor, lived around the corner, Mike Campbell said, the Emerald became a hangout for many ABC television figures, including Hugh Downs and Charlie Gibson.
 And since the bar television was perpetually locked on sports, ''the Emerald always got the spillover from Columbus,'' Mike Campbell said, referring to the celebrity-drawing restaurant that used to be next door (it is now an outlet for Lancome). ''I remember when they dragged Mike Tyson in from Columbus, so he could see a TV fight.'' 
 The Emerald has been proud of its antediluvian steadfastness, though the younger Mr. Campbell has ''put technology in the place,'' he said. He referred specifically to the juke box he imported some years ago. ''But that didn't make it too froo froo.'' 
 Carmel Keelan, a waitress at the Emerald for 10 years, said in her Irish lilt that ''you used to have to come off the boat to wait the tables.'' 
 Then, Mike Campbell said, ''the Irish economy got really good,'' adding: ''this is a new era. But Irish waitresses still predominate.'' 
 Now, the bar's 10 employees ''will be able to keep working,'' Charlie Campbell said. ''In a time when there's such bad news, it's great to get a little good news,'' he added. His Irish Campbell eyes were smiling.

HEADLINE: Striking Declines Seen in Manhattan Real Estate Market

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
For those New Yorkers who wondered what the Manhattan real estate market might be like without the ever-rising bonuses of Wall Street's elite, the answer is now emerging: an abrupt decline in transactions, tottering prices and buyers who are still looking but unwilling to sign a contract. Those are some of the conclusions in a series of market reports on the fourth quarter of 2008 released on Monday by brokerage firms, appraisers and other real estate analysts. 
 Prices on completed sales of co-ops and condominiums, some negotiated months or years ago, were flat or down slightly, but the number of completed sales and newly signed contracts had plummeted, analysts said, as the economy faltered. 
 Pamela Liebman, president of the Corcoran Group, a real estate brokerage, said that though the Manhattan market had continued to rise in the past year when most of the American housing market was in decline, it ''came to a grinding halt on Sept. 15,'' when credit markets collapsed and buyers lost confidence.
 ''Now we see the effects of buyers sitting on the sidelines, and they will remain on the sidelines until they get some confidence back,'' Ms. Liebman said. ''A lot of brokers are making friends with lawyers and doctors and all those people who were left behind in the heyday of Wall Street, three months ago.'' 
 One market report, by the Corcoran Group, found that the number of closed sales declined by at least 30 percent compared with the fourth quarter a year earlier as the Manhattan market all but stopped after the failure of Lehman Brothers in mid-September. 
 Other reports, using different data and criteria, found somewhat smaller but still striking declines. A report by the Prudential Douglas Elliman brokerage found that resales of existing Manhattan apartments fell by 24.8 percent, to 1,408 sales, while the sales of condominiums in newly completed buildings rose sharply. Contracts for many of those new condominiums were negotiated in a different market, a year or more ago. 
 Another report, by Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property, put the average apartment sale price at $1.45 million in the fourth quarter, up slightly from the same period in 2007, but down 2 percent from the third quarter last year. The median price was $895,000. 
 These reports found the average co-op price was $1.1 million, down 8 percent from the third quarter, but up 3 percent compared with the fourth quarter a year earlier. The median price of a co-op was down 8 percent from the third quarter last year and down 4 percent compared with the fourth quarter in 2007. The average condominium price was $1.7 million in the last quarter. The reports found that the number of transactions declined by 9 percent. 
 But all the analysts agreed that the prices did not yet show the full impact of the recession, which will likely show up in closings in the first quarter this year. Jonathan Miller, an appraiser who prepared the data for Prudential Douglas Elliman, said that the prices of apartments in contract declined 20 percent between August and December last year, with an abrupt drop in late September and early October. 
 The Corcoran report noted that the number of listings on the market peaked in November, since some discouraged sellers took their apartments off the market in December. But the number of listings going into contract has fallen off each month since July. In December, the report showed 484 listings going into contract, a 57 percent decline from the 1,122 listings that went into contract in December 2007.
 ''The worst is yet to come; there is a blood bath coming,'' said Matthew Haines, a founder of the real estate site Propertyshark.com who prepared the Corcoran report.
 Beyond the first quarter this year, assessments varied. A number of brokers said that as sellers cut prices, they will create an opportunity for buyers to get good deals that were unimaginable a few months ago, especially at a time when mortgage rates are falling. Several said they were counting on the Obama administration to bring in a wave of confidence that will change the psychology of the market.
 ''When the market solidifies itself and everyone feels confident that we are on solid ground, you are going to have hordes of buyers,'' said Diane M. Ramirez, the president of Halstead.
 But others worry that the market will need more than psychology to support it. Gregory J. Heym, an economist who prepared the reports for Halstead and Brown Harris Stevens, said that unless the economy strengthens, the weakening job market in New York City could further dampen enthusiasm for real estate. He said the city had lost about 18,000 jobs in the 12 months that ended in November, while city economists are now predicting a loss of 170,000 over the next year or two.
 ''Each time they update the forecast, it gets worse,'' Mr. Heym said.

HEADLINE: Automakers Fear a New Normal of Low Sales

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC and NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
The historic collapse of the new-car market dragged on in December, raising questions of whether the auto industry will ever again have sales levels that it took for granted just a few years ago.
 The across-the-board decline of 35 percent, reported by auto companies on Monday, is certain to put more pressure on the fragile finances of several manufacturers, particularly General Motors and Chrysler.
 G.M. and Chrysler received emergency federal loans last week to stave off bankruptcy while they accelerated their reorganization efforts.
 But unless consumers change course and return to vehicle showrooms, the entire industry will be forced to make sweeping adjustments to cope with declining demand. 
 After several years of sales topping 16 million vehicles, the United States market plummeted to 13.2 million cars and trucks sold in 2008. Analysts expect another sizable decrease this year and do not predict a year with 15 million in sales until 2012 or later.
 ''After an era of excess indulgence, we're now entering a prolonged period of conservation,'' said John A. Casesa of the consulting firm Casesa Shapiro Group. ''Trading in a car every three years is a luxury that the average American can no longer afford.''
 The dismal sales reports for December punctuated the worst year for vehicles sales since 1992. Sales dropped 31 percent at G.M., 32 percent at the Ford Motor Company and a stunning 53 percent at Chrysler, a unit of the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management.
 Foreign automakers hardly fared better, with sales plunging 37 percent at Toyota, 36 percent at BMW and 35 percent at Honda.
 For the year, industrywide sales declined by 18 percent -- the worst year-to-year drop-off since the early 1970s.
 The impact of the shrinking market could be felt for years to come, as automakers will continue to cut production and employment, and reduce the number of new vehicles they bring to the market.
 ''With these declines in revenues, you will see research and development budgets cut,'' said Jesse Toprak, chief auto analyst for Edmunds.com, a Web site that offers car-buying advice. ''We are going to have fewer new vehicles and less variety for at least the next couple of years.''
 Mr. Toprak is forecasting sales of 12.4 million vehicles this year and 13.5 million in 2010. He said the chances of the industry reaching annual sales of 16 million were slim for the foreseeable future.
 ''The question is, What will be the natural level of demand in the U.S. market when the economy recovers?'' he said. ''Based on our best guess, it is probably in the range of 14.5 million to 15 million.''
 Auto executives said on Monday that the industry had little chance of improving in the first half of 2009 because of a continued lack of available credit for prospective car buyers and a profound lack of confidence in an overall economic recovery.
 ''The first quarter is going to be bad no matter how you look at it,'' said Emily Kolinski Morris, a senior Ford economist. ''Once we get into the second quarter, we'll have a better idea.''
 G.M.'s chief market analyst, Michael C. DiGiovanni, said the automaker was predicting industry sales of 10.5 million to 12 million vehicles for the year.
 While the Bush administration approved up to $17.4 billion in loans to G.M. and Chrysler, analysts say they expect the Detroit auto companies to need longer-term assistance from the incoming president, Barack Obama.
 ''The internal problems of the Big Three are so great, there is no way they can survive without government help for several years,'' Mr. Casesa said.
 Both G.M. and Chrysler have to submit reorganization plans to the Treasury Department by mid-February as a condition of their loans.
 ''We have prepared our restructuring plan at a worst-case scenario,'' said James E. Press, a Chrysler vice chairman. ''We're hoping for the best, but we're prepared for the worst case.''
 Mr. Press said Chrysler was operating as if the severe fall in demand in recent months was the ''new reality'' for an industry that had grown accustomed to nearly unfettered growth since the mid-1990s.
 The industry thrived on cheap credit that allowed automakers to offer low-interest loans and rock-bottom lease payments to encourage consumers to regularly trade in and upgrade their vehicles.
 As a result, American consumers went on a sustained buying spree for new cars, trucks and S.U.V.'s.
 In 1970, less than 6 percent of American households owned three or more vehicles, according to the Department of Transportation. By 2000, that percentage had jumped to 18.
 More than 244 million vehicles were in operation in 2006, far outnumbering the 202 million licensed drivers in the country, according to the most recent federal statistics.
 Auto companies fed the growing appetite for vehicles by broadening their lineups with new products, like car-based crossover vehicles, inexpensive sports cars and a wide array of luxury models. 
 Companies were forced to redesign their cars more frequently to keep up in the race to put ever-fresher products in dealerships. 
 ''In 1988, the average age of a car in a U.S. showroom was 4.1 years,'' said Mr. Casesa, referring to the time that lapsed in model redesigns. ''Today it is 2.9 years, which is a tremendous difference.''
 With annual sales of 16 million as the norm, the industry expanded its infrastructure to meet demand.
 Even though the Detroit automakers have been shutting excess factory capacity and shedding jobs to cut costs, their foreign rivals have been adding new plants in the United States to make up the difference.
 Now, with sales plunging to levels not seen since the early 1990s, the industry will be forced to cut back significantly on product development.
 Analysts also predict that the era of expansion of foreign companies in the United States is probably over, as well.
 ''So many foreign transplants came so quickly because they had visions of grandeur in their eyes,'' David E. Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich., said. ''Now they're saying, 'Oh my, what have we done?' ''
 Besides the drop in demand caused by the tight credit and a weak economy, the quality of vehicles themselves has improved to the point where consumers do not need to replace them as often.
 Twenty years ago, the median age of cars and trucks in use in the United States was about six years. Now the typical vehicle on the road is nine years old, according to federal statistics.
 ''You may not want to drive your car for 10 years, but you can if you need to,'' Mr. Cole said.

HEADLINE: As Prices Rise, Some See $2 Gas

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
The five-month slide in gasoline prices has come to an abrupt halt, with gasoline rising by several cents in recent days amid indicators that the national average could jump to $2 a gallon or higher this spring.
 A broad shift in the psychology of the oil market seems to be under way. Oil prices are up more than 40 percent since they bottomed out just below $33 a barrel on Dec. 19. The reversal, after months of declines, suggests that production cuts by the OPEC cartel may be having an effect, along with growing tensions in the Middle East and the sentiment by traders that the precipitous drop in prices went too far. 
 For six days in a row, drivers have been paying a few more cents a gallon than they did before Christmas. The change has been almost imperceptible for drivers who remember prices soaring above $4 a gallon last summer. 
 But if the price of gasoline continues rising, it may become another headache for consumers worried about their jobs and the dropping value of their homes and investments. 
 Oil prices are up about 25 percent in the last week alone, in part because of the escalating conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Rising oil prices have helped push the wholesale price of gasoline up by 40 percent since Dec. 24, leading to predictions by energy experts that retail gasoline prices will spike by as much as 25 percent in coming weeks.
 ''A lot of people are talking about dollar-a-gallon gasoline, when the wholesale market seems to be pointing to $2 a gallon,'' said Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service. As of Monday, regular gasoline was selling for $1.67 a gallon, on average, up from a recent low of $1.62 on Dec. 30.
 The decline in gasoline prices has offered badly needed relief to consumers. A driver buying 50 gallons of gasoline a month has been saving $2 a day compared to a year ago, and $4 a day compared to the price peak in July. For the national economy as a whole, the savings came to around $1 billion a day, according to the Oil Price Information Service.
 Among the big winners have been businesses like shipping companies with large transportation costs, commuters who drive long distances to work and consumers with moderate incomes who spend a relatively high percentage of their paychecks on fuel.
 The summer's high prices prompted Americans to cut their driving, and the drastic downturn of the economy this fall led to the huge decline in oil prices. But with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries cutting production, and with refineries trimming their output of gasoline, supply and demand may be coming back into balance.
 Refineries have cut the number of barrels of crude oil they processed weekly to 14.5 million during December, from 15.4 million, according to the Energy Department. The tighter supplies are putting pressure on retail prices.
 Analysts say the decline in gasoline use may have bottomed out, barring a further big downturn in the economy. MasterCard's SpendingPulse data service, which measures both cash and credit card sales of gasoline, had shown volume declines as sharp as 9 percent during some weeks in the fall. But that number has narrowed considerably as prices have fallen, and one recent week even showed a slight increase in gasoline sales compared to the same week the year before.
 ''There will be a real spike in gasoline prices coming in the next four to six weeks,'' predicted Chris Ruppel, an energy analyst at Execution, a brokerage and research firm. ''We are witnessing a sea change in energy market sentiment as Americans appear to be returning to some of their old driving habits just as geopolitical risk is once again a factor in crude prices.''
 Oil prices jumped more than 5 percent on Monday alone to close at $48.81 in New York trading, as fighting continued in the Gaza Strip and Iran's OPEC representative said the cartel would hold a special meeting in February. The cartel decided last month to cut output by 2.2 million barrels, on top of earlier cutbacks. 
 The AAA auto club reported that the average price for a gallon of unleaded gasoline on Monday was $1.67, up nearly a penny and a half from the day before. That still compares favorably to the national average of $3.10 a gallon a year ago and the record high national average price of $4.11 last July 17. 
 In contrast to gasoline, diesel prices have not yet bottomed out. A gallon cost $2.40 on Monday, down a fraction of a penny from the day before.
 Mr. Kloza said he thought gasoline prices probably hit a bottom last month. He said gasoline prices in California, which frequently leads the rest of the nation in gasoline price swings, bottomed the first week of December and had been rising since.
 While gasoline prices felt like a great weight to many consumers on the way up, they have not been an economic cure-all on the way down.
 ''In comparison with between roughly a 40 percent drop in the stock market and a 20 percent drop in home values, the drop in gasoline prices is just a drop in the bucket,'' said Adam J. Robinson, director of commodities at Armored Wolf L.L.C., a hedge fund. 
 Mr. Robinson said he was unconvinced that oil and gasoline prices would go back up for long. ''I think it is too soon to call a bottom in oil or gasoline because demand is falling faster than OPEC is cutting,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Investors Strain to Sell Start-Up Companies

BYLINE: By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
In 2008, entrepreneurs and venture capitalists had difficulty cashing out of start-ups, underscoring just how much the financial crisis has pummeled the technology sector. 
 Only six venture-backed start-ups went public last year, the fewest since 1977 and down from 86 in 2007, according to data released Monday by the National Venture Capital Association and ThomsonReuters. Venture capitalists sold 260 companies in 2008, down from 360 in 2007. 
 Stock market investors do not want to invest in initial public offerings, said Mark Heesen, president of the association. And ''potential acquirers have just become much more conservative in buying -- stock prices are so volatile that they don't know how much money they have.'' 
 Cisco Systems, the leading maker of computer networking equipment, is typically an active acquirer, buying 10 to 15 technology companies a year. In 2008, it bought only five. 
 The few companies that did go public have performed poorly. They raised $470 million in their public offerings, the lowest amount since 1979 and down from $10 billion in 2007. As of Dec. 31, only one company, CardioNet, which makes technology to monitor cardiac patients' hearts outside of hospitals, was trading above its offering price. 
 Acquisitions were more financially successful. Almost half of the companies acquired returned more than four times the amount of capital invested in them, according to the venture association. The largest sale of the year occurred when Dell bought EqualLogic, which makes storage systems for virtualization, for $1.4 billion in January 2008. 
 However, corporate acquirers may not continue to pay such attractive prices for venture-backed companies, Mr. Heesen said. He said that he feared Silicon Valley would return ''to the postbubble period where we saw a lot of acquisitions, but most of them were fire sales.'' 
 If venture-backed companies cannot achieve public offerings or acquisitions, it could have a ripple effect. Some limited partners, like universities and pension funds, have sought to put off their commitments to invest, and venture capitalists said they are reluctant to back many early-stage companies without more certain gains. 
 ''Right now, it's really hard for us to think about doing a start-up investment,'' said Annette Campbell-White, founder of MedVenture Associates, a venture firm in Emeryville, Calif., that invests in medical technology companies. 
 Instead of start-ups, she said, ''we are looking for companies that are in revenue mode and don't have a whole lot of technology or regulatory risk, and those deals are few and far between.''

HEADLINE: Spending Rise for Health Care and Prescription Drugs Slows

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
National health spending grew in 2007 at the lowest rate in nine years, mainly because prescription drug spending increased at the slowest pace since 1963, the government reported Monday.
 But other types of health spending rose at a brisk pace, pushing the total to $2.2 trillion, or 16.2 percent of the gross domestic product, a record. Spending averaged $7,421 for each person. Total health spending rose 6.1 percent, compared with a 6.7 percent increase in 2006.
 The report, published in the journal Health Affairs, offers the most current and comprehensive data on the nation's health care sector, providing a context for the sweeping changes that President-elect Barack Obama has promised. 
 In recessions, when the economy contracts, health spending usually continues to increase. So federal economists and statisticians said that health spending probably accounted for an even larger share of the nation's economic output in 2008. The economy sank into a recession in December 2007, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private group that tracks business cycles.
 Retail spending on prescription drugs rose 4.9 percent in 2007, to $227.5 billion, the government said. By contrast, drug spending rose by 8.6 percent in 2006 and by an average of 9.4 percent a year from 2001 to 2006.
 The main author of the report, Micah B. Hartman, a statistician at the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, listed three reasons for the deceleration of drug spending.
 More prescriptions are being filled with generic drugs, Mr. Hartman said. Drug prices are increasing more slowly, and safety concerns have depressed sales of some drugs, he added.
 In 2007, Mr. Hartman said, 67 percent of prescriptions were filled with generic drugs, up from 63 percent in 2006 and 60 percent in 2005. Moreover, he said, in 2006, the Food and Drug Administration approved lower-cost generic versions of the allergy medicine Flonase, the cholesterol drugs Pravachol and Zocor, the antidepressant Zoloft and several other widely used brand-name products. In 2007, the sleeping pill Ambien also lost patent exclusivity.
 Dr. Robert S. Epstein, chief medical officer of Medco Health Solutions, which manages drug benefits for more than 60 million people, said the approval of generic versions of blockbuster drugs in 2006 and 2007 ''had a tremendous influence'' in slowing the growth of drug spending. 
 Over all, the report said, prescription drug prices rose 1.4 percent in 2007, much less than the 3.5 percent growth recorded in 2006. The slower growth results, in part, from generic drug discount programs offered by large retail chains like Walmart, the government said. Consumer groups have found much higher price increases for many top-selling brand-name drugs.
 Federal health officials said the trend in drug spending was also influenced by increased safety concerns, reflected in the number of serious alerts, known as black-box warnings, issued by the F.D.A.: 68 in 2007, compared with 58 in 2006 and 21 in 2003.
 With the exception of prescription drugs, spending for most other health care goods and services grew at about the same rate as in 2006, or faster. And some of those other categories are more significant in the overall picture. Prescription drugs account for 10 percent of all health spending, much less than either hospitals (31 percent of the total) or doctors (18 percent). 
 Spending on hospital care rose 7.3 percent in 2007, to $696.5 billion, compared with an increase of 6.9 percent in 2006, the government reported.
 Spending for doctors' services rose 5.9 percent in 2007, to $393.8 billion. That is less than the 6.4 percent increase in 2006, in part because Congress reduced Medicare payments to doctors for imaging services. 
 Out-of-pocket spending on health care increased 5.3 percent in 2007, to $268.6 billion. Such expenses have been growing more slowly than total health spending, but faster than household income, so many consumers have felt a squeeze on their pocketbooks, federal officials said.

HEADLINE: Thanking N.H.L. for a Holiday on Ice

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The National Hockey League has done something I never thought possible. It has stolen New Year's Day. 
 The first day of the year used to be a daylong celebration of foo'ball in warm places, but the Bowl Championship Series has made other bowl games virtually irrelevant, leaving the day open for wiser heads. 
 The N.H.L. has played carpe diem by giving us steambreath under a gray sky, the exact opposite of the traditional appeal of sun-dappled bowl games. 
 I am referring to last Thursday's outdoor game between two ancient franchises, the Detroit Red Wings and the Chicago Blackhawks, played at Chicago's Wrigley Field. It was a spectacle bigger than the sum of its parts. One did not have to understand the rules for icing the puck to appreciate a ballpark full of 40,000 bundled-up fans screaming for nearly three hours as two crack teams went at each other.
 Boys will be boys. I loved the moment when Detroit's Daniel Cleary was dumped skates-over-teakettle into the Chicago bench, and the lads hooked their mitts into his gear to keep him from rejoining the fray. The normal shenanigans of any mundane night across North America from October through March became epic in the frigid confines of Wrigley. 
 Of course, some of us love hockey not just for its ferocity and skill but for its underlying code of civility off the ice. The sport was already looking good on Nov. 23, when the Blackhawks' players chose to give up a day at home to make a detour from Toronto for the wake of the father of their general manager, Dale Tallon, in a tiny Ontario town two hours away. 
 Not that the players made that journey out of self-interest, but there may be a moral to the fact that mostly good things have followed the Blackhawks ever since. The league needs a presence from its six ''original'' franchises in order to preserve the culture of the sport. 
 This was the third outdoor game for the N.H.L. in recent years, starting with Montreal at Edmonton in 2003 and then moving to a Winter Classic on Jan. 1, 2008, putting Pittsburgh in snowy Orchard Park, N.Y., outside Buffalo. This year, the league went for total tradition, putting elders like Bobby Hull and Ted Lindsay and baseball's Ferguson Jenkins in the same ballpark.
 Part of the appeal, of course, came from the juxtaposition with historic Wrigley, borrowing another sport's glamour. If so, let's have more of it -- Fenway Park or the new version of Yankee Stadium. And what about historic Quebec City, with the Plains of Abraham in the background?
 The league has its problems with the economy and incursions from soccer and Nascar and golf and all the rest. But the N.H.L. has now established a once-a-year spectacle.
 Sometimes, sport is just plain pleasing to the eye, like watching La Belle France flit by on television during the Tour de France. I can do that for hours. By claiming the first day of the new year, hockey has created a grand new tradition akin to Breakfast at Wimbledon back when NBC had the courage to display Bud Collins in those amazing strawberry-and-cream slacks. 
 The early afternoon hockey game made me glad I had fallen asleep right after midnight with nothing unhealthy in my system. Aerial shots showed the elevated train gliding prosaically just outside Wrigley, with the stunning skyline of wintry Chicago (what a place for the Summer Games) glittering just to the south and the east. I also liked the shots of some players clumping their way down the steep steps from the clubhouse to the runway to the dugout. I loved the warm-ups with bright sweaters and ski caps and the cowboy hats on the Red Wings' coaches. Nice touch.
 I asked Frank Brown, the N.H.L.'s vice president for media relations, and formerly a writer, and a knowledgeable one at that, about the sport, what the highlight had been for him. He had wondered if the 80,000 hands and 40,000 larynxes could produce a din equal to the anthem in the old Chicago Stadium, where he covered 50 or more games. 
 ''It gave me chills every time,'' Brown recalled, adding that the roar at Wrigley lived up to his hopes. The game was pretty neat, too, with the Red Wings winning, 6-4, showing their poise and skill from their European transfusion of the past generation. 
 With NBC and Bob Costas providing the gravitas it deserved, the game earned an overnight rating of 2.9 with a 6 share, the best rating for a regular-season N.H.L. game in nearly 13 years. 
 Now the N.H.L lunges onward with a full half of its season remaining. On Monday night, I put myself in Madison Square Garden to watch the Rangers take on the Penguins, whose Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin are supposed to be the Gretzky and Messier of this generation.
 However, the Penguins, the Stanley Cup runners-up, continued to play in an inexplicable funk Monday, as the Rangers outplayed them all the way, surviving a 5-on-3 disadvantage for 1 minute 58 seconds early in the game and scoring a 4-0 victory. The Rangers seized the night, the way the N.H.L. has seized New Year's Day.

HEADLINE: California's Budget

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Fifty Herbert Hoovers,'' by Paul Krugman (column, Dec. 29): 
 California's budgetary problem is a function of wild swings in revenue combined with spending commitments that don't take those swings into account. Since taking office, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has made three attempts to rationalize that dysfunctional system, only to be opposed by recalcitrant legislators and dogged special interests. 
 This year the governor was successful in passing a sturdy rainy-day fund. Additionally, he created a bipartisan commission to reform California's tax system. On April 15, the commission will present a proposal to stabilize those revenue swings.
 In the meantime, despite facing a powerful spending lobby, Governor Schwarzenegger has held expenditure growth to less than 1 percent each of the last two years. If his special session budget proposal is adopted, the general fund spending growth rate during his five years in office will be lower than four of the last five governors.
 We agree with Mr. Krugman that governments should be doing all they can to stimulate growth. That's why Governor Schwarzenegger has teamed his budget proposal with an aggressive economic stimulus plan designed to create jobs when they're needed most.
 David Crane Sacramento, Dec. 31, 2008
 The writer is a special adviser to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger for jobs and the economy.

HEADLINE: We Know About the Mess. Please, Clean Up Carefully.

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN. 
E-mail: haberman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Here's one way to tell early in the new year if politicians are lying (beyond the time-honored check of their lips to see if they're moving). Listen to the ''State of'' speeches coming your way soon.
 This is the season for them -- you know, State of the Union, State of the State, State of the City and so on. Invariably, or just about, elected leaders assure us that the state of whatever is strong. ''Strong'' is their favorite ''state of'' word. 
 Like most of his predecessors, soon-to-be-former-President Bush used it all the time. Gov. George E. Pataki favored it, too, especially in a year when he was up for re-election. Same goes for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. Eliot Spitzer would have probably cottoned to it as well had he been able to hang around longer as governor.
 If you hear any of our leaders use the word this time around, when it's beginning to look a lot like 1931, you'll have a pretty good sense that they and reality are barely on speaking terms.
 And if you believe them, then you are setting yourself up to be played for a sucker. But then, some have been setting themselves up that way for a while.
 Most of the attention lately has gone to the scoundrels, scam artists and supposedly genius moneymen who have dragged us into the worst economic debacle ever experienced by any American under the age of 70. Perhaps a bit more might be said about all those who turned themselves into willing dupes. That means most of us, we who didn't raise an eyebrow when banks were doling out easy loans to borrowers with shaky credit ratings, we who bought Detroit's gas guzzlers without questioning for a second whether the American addiction to waste made sense.
 Bernard L. Madoff is the season's archvillain, accused of having run a Ponzi scheme so vast that future generations may well describe similar swindles as Madoff schemes. Not much has been said about the complicity of Madoff clients, who never asked how it was that they reaped healthy returns in lean times as well as fat, who blithely ignored the amply proved maxim that anything that seems too good to be true usually is.
 Now we all want quick fixes. The sponsors of recovery and budget-balancing plans at federal, state and city levels all demand swift action. Move fast or we'll be in deeper trouble. In one form or another that has been the cry raised by President-elect Barack Obama, Gov. David A. Paterson and Mayor Bloomberg.
 Perhaps they are right. But perhaps, too, it is worth recalling where hasty, unreflective action has taken us in recent years.
 Haste gave us the September 11 Victim Compensation Fund, which doled out nearly $7 billion to families of those who died in the 2001 terrorist attacks. For a variety of reasons, many people, including some of the lawyers who worked on compensation cases, concluded that a bad precedent had been set in the event of future terrorism and that it unfairly measured in dollars the relative worth of human life.
 Haste gave us the USA Patriot Act, the broad antiterrorism law that was enacted soon after 9/11 and that quickly came under fire from Americans who believed that it stepped too heavily on civil liberties. Haste -- remember Vice President Dick Cheney's ''time is not on our side'' pronouncement in 2002, coupled with Condoleezza Rice's ''mushroom cloud'' warning -- produced the war to eliminate Saddam Hussein's nonexistent stockpile of illicit weapons in Iraq.
 More recently, haste produced from Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. a three-page draft of a bailout plan for financial firms that gave himself enormous power -- and that Congress rejected out of hand.
 Locally, haste led to the scrapping of a two-term limit for elected city officials that New York voters had approved. The mayor and a majority of the City Council took a mere 32 days to undo the results of two plebiscites.
 Now some say that Governor Paterson must act hastily to appoint a successor to Hillary Rodham Clinton, even though she is still a sitting senator and has yet to be confirmed as Mr. Obama's secretary of state. Mr. Bloomberg is among those who have urged speed because, he said, ''this is just getting out of control.'' Exactly what's out of control is not clear. The last time we looked, New York is allowed only two senators at a time, and that's what we have.
 On New Year's Day, a tabloid headline went so far as to demand that Mr. Paterson announce his Senate choice ''right now!'' Otherwise, the accompanying article said ominously, a news media ''frenzy'' will hound the new senator when he or she ought to be settling into the job. It sounded almost like a threat.
 Thus far, Mr. Paterson has refused to be bullied into a snap decision that gains New York precious little. Let's see if he holds his ground. We all know what the state of the state is. It's miserable. But it may be said, at least for now on this matter of the Senate seat, that the resolve of the governor is strong.

HEADLINE: The Afghan Quagmire

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
The economy is obviously issue No. 1 as Barack Obama prepares to take over the presidency. He's charged with no less a task than pulling the country out of a brutal recession. If the worst-case scenarios materialize, his job will be to stave off a depression.
 That's enough to keep any president pretty well occupied. What Mr. Obama doesn't need, and what the U.S. cannot under any circumstances afford, is any more unnecessary warfare. And yet, while we haven't even figured out how to extricate ourselves from the disaster in Iraq, Mr. Obama is planning to commit thousands of additional American troops to the war in Afghanistan, which is already more than seven years old and which long ago turned into a quagmire. 
 Andrew Bacevich, a retired Army colonel who is now a professor of history and international relations at Boston University, wrote an important piece for Newsweek warning against the proposed buildup. ''Afghanistan will be a sinkhole,'' he said, ''consuming resources neither the U.S. military nor the U.S. government can afford to waste.''
 In an analysis in The Times last month, Michael Gordon noted that ''Afghanistan presents a unique set of problems: a rural-based insurgency, an enemy sanctuary in neighboring Pakistan, the chronic weakness of the Afghan government, a thriving narcotics trade, poorly developed infrastructure, and forbidding terrain.''
 The U.S. military is worn out from years of warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan. The troops are stressed from multiple deployments. Equipment is in disrepair. Budgets are beyond strained. Sending thousands of additional men and women (some to die, some to be horribly wounded) on a fool's errand in the rural, mountainous guerrilla paradise of Afghanistan would be madness.
 The time to go all out in Afghanistan was in the immediate aftermath of the 2001 terror attacks. That time has passed.
 With no personal military background and a reputation as a liberal, President-elect Obama may feel he has to demonstrate his toughness, and that Afghanistan is the place to do it. What would really show toughness would be an assertion by Mr. Obama as commander in chief that the era of mindless military misadventures is over.
 ''I hate war,'' said Dwight Eisenhower, ''as only a soldier who has lived it can, as only one who has seen its brutality, its futility, its stupidity.''
 What's the upside to the U.S., a nation in dire economic distress, of an escalation in Afghanistan? If we send 20,000, or 30,000, or however many thousand more troops in there, what will their mission be?
 In his article for Newsweek, Mr. Bacevich said: ''The chief effect of military operations in Afghanistan so far has been to push radical Islamists across the Pakistani border. As a result, efforts to stabilize Afghanistan are contributing to the destabilization of Pakistan, with potentially devastating implications.
 ''No country poses a greater potential threat to U.S. national security -- today and for the foreseeable future -- than Pakistan. To risk the stability of that nuclear-armed state in the vain hope of salvaging Afghanistan would be a terrible mistake.''
 Our interest in Afghanistan is to prevent it from becoming a haven for terrorists bent on attacking us. That does not require the scale of military operations that the incoming administration is contemplating. It does not require a wholesale occupation. It does not require the endless funneling of human treasure and countless billions of taxpayer dollars to the Afghan government at the expense of rebuilding the United States, which is falling apart before our very eyes.
 The government we are supporting in Afghanistan is a fetid hothouse of corruption, a government of gangsters and weasels whose customary salute is the upturned palm. Listen to this devastating assessment by Dexter Filkins of The Times:
 ''Kept afloat by billions of dollars in American and other foreign aid, the government of Afghanistan is shot through with corruption and graft. From the lowliest traffic policeman to the family of President Hamid Karzai himself, the state built on the ruins of the Taliban government seven years ago now often seems to exist for little more than the enrichment of those who run it.''
 Think about putting your life on the line for that gang. 
 If Mr. Obama does send more troops to Afghanistan, he should go on television and tell the American people, in the clearest possible language, what he is trying to achieve. He should spell out the mission's goals, and lay out an exit strategy.
 He will owe that to the public because he will own the conflict at that point. It will be Barack Obama's war.

 SPAIN IS ON THE FRONT LINES
 Of a Battle for Church's Future
 Spain may be the Vatican's last real foothold in an increasingly secular Europe, but battle lines were drawn when a judge ruled in November that crucifixes must be removed from a school's walls in a small Spanish town. The Vatican criticized the move as an unjust attack against a historical symbol, and the fight could sway the future of Catholicism on the Continent. Page A6 
 CHaVEZ AID TO U.S. SUSPENDED
 Hugo Chavez's humanitarian heating oil project for serving poor communities in the United States -- one that seemed tailor-made for shots at the Bush administration -- has been halted amid plunging fuel prices. Page A6 
 INDIA IMPLICATES PAKISTAN IN ATTACK
 India handed Pakistan what it called comprehensive evidence that the attack in Mumbai in late November was planned in Pakistan. India demanded that those responsible be turned over to be tried in Indian courts. The evidence was a dossier containing transcripts of phone conversations between the gunmen and their handlers during the attack, according to diplomats speaking on the condition of anonymity.

 CHINA PUBLISHES CRACKDOWN DATA
 China published some information in an official newspaper about its crackdown prior to the Beijing Olympics. More than 1,100 people had been indicted in a region in Western China on suspicion of ''endangering state security.'' Page A8 
 RUSSIA REDUCES FUEL TO EUROPE
 The Russian fuel monopoly, Gazprom, reduced fuel supplies to Western Europe that travel through Ukraine. Recently, the company ceased shipments to Ukraine after a financial dispute. Gazprom said that upset Western European countries should blame Ukraine for the shortage. Page A8 
 BUSH TO SEND DARFUR MILITARY AID
 President Bush announced that he would be sending supplies into the war-shattered Darfur region of Sudan. The shipment, which would be airlifted into the region, is to include vehicles and equipment to help support the international peace-keeping force already in place. Page A9 
 WEARINESS IN THE WEST BANK
 Fewer than 100 people showed up to a muted protest in the West Bank, and even they were not willing to expend much effort. The reason was certainly not lack of anger over recent military actions by Israel and what some say is the Palestinian Authority's lackluster diplomatic response to Israel, but what experts say is the fatigue among Palestinians from poverty, struggle and constant conflict.

 DEMOCRAT NAMED WINNER 
 Of Minnesota Senate Race
 Minnesota's independent canvassing board certified that Al Franken, the comedian who became a Democratic pundit and then a politician, won the election in November for the United States Senate by 225 votes out of 2.9 million cast. But Mr. Franken's opponent said that the board's work had been flawed and that he would challenge the recount in court. PAGE A15

 Obama Pushes for Support Of Economic Recovery Plan
 Two weeks before assuming power, President-elect Barack Obama pitched his economic recovery package to Congressional lawmakers and urged them to pass the legislation within a month.

 SPENDING RISES FOR HEALTH CARE
 A government study found that national health spending grew in 2007 at the lowest rate in nine years, mainly because prescription drug spending increased at the slowest pace since 1963.

 WHERE IS OUR FERDINAND PECORA?
 In an Op-Ed article, Ron Chernow, the author of ''The House of Morgan,'' recalls the example set by Ferdinand Pecora, the lawyer for the Senate Banking and Currency Committee who in the 1930s publicly grilled Wall Street bankers and exposed the abuses that led to the crash of 1929. Now, Mr. Chernow argues, Congress should conduct the same kind of investigation into the twin housing and stock market crashes. Page 25

HEADLINE: Where Is Our Ferdinand Pecora?

BYLINE: By RON CHERNOW. 
Ron Chernow is the author of ''The House of Morgan'' and ''Alexander Hamilton.''

 BODY:
BARACK OBAMA has assigned a top priority to financial reform when the new Congress assembles today. If history is any guide, legislators can perform a signal service by moving beyond the myriad details of the rescue plans to provide a coherent account of the origins of the current crisis. The moment calls for nothing less than a sweeping inquest into the twin housing and stock market crashes to create both the intellectual context and the political constituency for change.
 For inspiration, Congress should turn to the electrifying hearings of the Senate Banking and Currency Committee, held in the waning months of the Hoover presidency and the early days of the New Deal. In historical shorthand, these hearings have taken their name from the committee counsel, Ferdinand Pecora, a former assistant district attorney from New York who, starting in January 1933, was chief counsel for the investigation. Under Pecora's expert and often withering questioning, the Senate committee unearthed a secret financial history of the 1920s, demystifying the assorted frauds, scams and abuses that culminated in the 1929 crash. 
 The riveting confrontation between Pecora and the Wall Street grandees was so theatrically apt it might have been concocted by Hollywood. The combative Pecora was the perfect foil to the posh bankers who paraded before the microphones. Born in Sicily, the son of an immigrant cobbler, Pecora had campaigned for Teddy Roosevelt and been imbued with the crusading fervor of the Progressive Era. As a prosecutor in the 1920s, he had shut down more than 100 ''bucket shops'' -- seamy, fly-by-night brokerage houses -- and this had tutored him in the shady side of Wall Street. 
 With crinkly black hair and flashing eyes, Pecora was an earthy populist who appealed to Depression audiences. He was fond of playing pinochle and was often portrayed with a thick cigar clamped between his teeth. When he was hired for $255 per month by the Senate committee, Pecora was earning less money than most Wall Street mandarins disbursed weekly in pocket change.
 Pecora was meticulous in preparation and legendary in stamina, mastering reams of material and staying up half the night before interrogations, aided by John T. Flynn, an Irish-American journalist, and Max Lowenthal, a Jewish lawyer. As Flynn wrote, ''I looked with astonishment at this man who, through the intricate mazes of banking, syndicates, market deals, chicanery of all sorts, and in a field new to him, never forgot a name, never made an error in a figure, and never lost his temper.'' 
 As Pecora relentlessly grilled the most famous names in finance, the nation relived the 1920s boom in a collective act of national remembrance. The hearings started in a modest committee room, but as the public was swept up in the drama, they shifted to a stately caucus room, illuminated by chandeliers and flashbulbs. As it gained momentum, the inquiry expanded until it shined a searchlight into every murky corner of Wall Street. Pecora exposed a stock market manipulated by speculators to the detriment of small investors who could suddenly attach names and faces to their losses.
 Bankers had been demigods in the 1920s, their doings followed avidly, their market commentary quoted with reverence. They had inhabited a clubby world of chauffeured limousines and wood-paneled rooms, insulated from ordinary Americans. Now Pecora defrocked these high priests, making them seem small and shabby. 
 On Black Thursday of 1929, the nation had applauded a seemingly heroic attempt by major bankers, including Albert Wiggin of Chase and Charles Mitchell of National City, to stem the market decline. Pecora showed that Wiggin had actually shorted Chase shares during the crash, profiting from falling prices. He also revealed that Mitchell and top officers at National City had helped themselves to $2.4 million in interest-free loans from the bank's coffers to ease them through the crash. National City, it turned out, had also palmed off bad loans to Latin American countries by packing them into securities and selling them to unsuspecting investors. By the time Pecora got through with the bankers, Senator Burton Wheeler of Montana was likening them to Al Capone and the public referred to them as ''banksters,'' rhyming with gangsters.
 With a public aching for retribution, Pecora was playing with combustible chemicals, and Wall Street complained that he was destroying confidence. President Franklin Roosevelt retorted that the bankers ''should have thought of that when they did the things that are being exposed now.'' It was hard for Wall Street to mount a legitimate defense as Pecora pilloried them daily. 
 His prosecutorial methods grew questionable when he turned to the mysterious world of private banking, exemplified by the House of Morgan. In implacable style, Pecora badgered Morgan partners into admitting that they had paid no taxes for 1931 and 1932 -- an incendiary revelation when the country was undertaking huge public works projects to combat unemployment. That the Morgan men had avoided taxes because of stock market losses was lost amid the hubbub. 
 No less inflammatory was exposure of Morgan's ''preferred list'' by which the bank's influential friends participated in stock offerings at steeply discounted rates. The renowned names on the list, including Calvin Coolidge, the former president, and Owen J. Roberts, a Supreme Court justice, shocked the nation with its unseemly association of money and power. 
 One Morgan partner, George Whitney, lamely explained that the intent was to safeguard small investors by preventing them from assuming such risk. To which Pecora responded tartly in his best-selling book, ''Wall Street Under Oath,'' ''Many there were who would gladly have helped them share that appalling peril!''
 Such was the furor over the Morgan testimony that Senator Carter Glass of Virginia shook his head and sighed, ''We are having a circus, and the only things lacking now are peanuts and colored lemonade.'' Seizing on the comment, a press agent for the Ringling Brothers Circus took advantage of a pause in the hearings to pop Lya Graf, a midget in a blue satin dress, on the lap of the portly and surprised J. P. Morgan Jr. The committee chairman, Senator Duncan Fletcher of Florida, pleaded with newspapers not to print the pictures, which only made them rush to do so. 
 The photo of Morgan with a circus midget planted on his lap became the signature shot of the hearings, emblematic of Wall Street's fallen state. An embittered J. P. Morgan Jr. said Pecora had ''the manners of a prosecuting attorney who is trying to convict a horse thief.''
 Whatever their failings, the Pecora hearings laid the groundwork for financial reform legislation. By the time they ended in May 1934, they had generated 12,000 printed pages of testimony, collected in several thick volumes. These documents have served generations of historians. Our national narrative of stock market mayhem in the 1920s is largely composed of characters and anecdotes gleaned from their pages. 
 Pecora not only documented a litany of abuses, but also paved the way for remedial legislation. The Securities Act of 1933, the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 -- all addressed abuses exposed by Pecora. It was only poetic justice when Roosevelt tapped him as a commissioner of the newborn Securities and Exchange Commission.
 Our current stock market slump and housing bust can seem like natural calamities without identifiable culprits, creating free-floating anger in the land. A public deeply disenchanted with our financial leadership is desperately searching for answers. The new Congress has a chance to lead the nation, step by step, through all the machinations that led to the present debacle and to shape wise legislation to prevent a recurrence.

HEADLINE: Waterford Wedgwood Is in Receivership

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
Queen Elizabeth, the Kremlin and the White House have been customers, but in the current economic climate, luxury crystal and ceramics are a hard sell, as Waterford Wedgwood conceded Monday.
 The company, which is based in Dublin and whose roots go back 250 years, makes and sells crystal vases, glasses and ceramic figurines and kitchenware. It made the ball that drops each New Year's Eve in Times Square, and its crystal chandeliers decorate Windsor Castle. 
 Waterford Wedgwood said on Monday that its 10 British units and 4 businesses in Ireland had been placed into administration, similar to bankruptcy protection in the United States, after running out of money and failing to find a buyer. The remaining subsidiaries, including those in the United States, Germany and Canada, remain unaffected. 
 The auditor, Deloitte, was appointed as administrator of the troubled businesses, which employ 2,700, or more than half of Waterford's 5,000 employees. The units will continue to operate until the administrator decides to sell, close or reorganize them.
 ''I am disappointed that certain of the group's U.K. and Irish subsidiaries have had to go into administration and receivership, but we remain optimistic that ongoing discussions will result in a buyer being found for the business,'' the chief executive of Waterford, David Sculley, said.
 Waterford Wedgwood was created in 1986 when the Irish crystal maker Waterford acquired the British ceramics company Wedgwood. Both companies have a rich history. 
 Wedgwood was founded in 1759 by Josiah Wedgwood in Stoke-on-Trent, England. Charles Darwin, who formulated the theory of evolution, married a member of the Wedgwood family in the 19th century and was able to finance his research with the help of the family fortunes.
 Waterford was founded in 1783 by the brothers William and George Penrose and named after the Irish harbor town where they lived. Waterford faced difficult times in 1851, when it closed because of rising taxes, but the business reopened almost 100 years later. The Irish government gave Waterford glassware as a present to each American president from Dwight Eisenhower to Ronald Reagan, who kept his jelly beans in a Waterford dish.
 Takeover talks with an unidentified private equity firm failed to come to fruition Friday and a group of lenders led by Bank of America declined to suspend a so-called covenant that is part of Waterford's loan agreement.
 Talks with the lenders started four months ago, and the banks agreed three times to suspend the covenant, which requires Waterford to have a certain amount of cash on hand, to give the company more time to find a buyer.
 The company, which generates about half of its revenue in the United States, has struggled for the last five years to return to profit by cutting costs and jobs, and by hiring designers to develop new products.
 Some analysts attribute Waterford's losses to management's reluctance to move manufacturing jobs to countries with lower labor costs, like Indonesia. The combination of high manufacturing costs, declining demand for luxury goods and a weak dollar last year overstretched the company's finances.
 Waterford, which also owns the German china company Rosenthal, is the latest retailer in Britain and Ireland to run into financial difficulties as consumers curb spending because of concern about unemployment and the first recession in 17 years.
 Woolworths, a variety store which sold things like chocolate bars, and toasters, started to close stores in December after failing to secure financing. Administrators were also called in for the music retailer Zavvi; Whittard, a tea retailer; and the Mfi Group, a furniture chain. 
 Waterford's top shareholders, led by the chairman, Anthony O'Reilly, have repeatedly pumped more money into the company. Waterford also sought a loan from the Irish government last year but was rebuffed.
 The company's shares have declined steadily since 2001 and have traded at less than one euro cent a share since 2004. Waterford Wedgwood now has a market value of about 5.35 million euros but in October had net debt of 448.9 million euros ($625.1 million).
 Sales for the year that ended in April 2008 were 672 million euros, down 9.4 percent from a year earlier. The company posted a loss of 231 million euros, up from 71 million euros.

HEADLINE: Looking at President Bush and His Place in History

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''A President Forgotten but Not Gone,'' by Frank Rich (column, Jan. 4): 
 The past eight years of the George W. Bush presidency have been a nightmare. Mr. Bush chose to be a ''wartime president'' by taking our country unnecessarily into Iraq. He then used the war to get himself elected to a second term. 
 His administration's handling of the consequences from Hurricane Katrina was a fiasco. 
 Mr. Bush headed a government of the rich, by the rich, for the rich, whose economic engine could run only on his tax cuts for the rich. During the last year of his presidency, the economy tanked. 
 Mr. Bush leaves enormous domestic and foreign policy problems for his successor and for the country. He believes that historians will view his presidency favorably. I believe that history will not be kind to his administration. 
 Paul L. Whiteley Sr. Louisville, Ky., Jan. 4, 2009
 To the Editor:
 President Bush has always been the first to accept responsibility for the decisions he has made. 
 His comment that the decisions of many fed into the current economic crisis is fair. An extended period of easy money inflated the housing bubble. Some financial institutions made bets we can see were far too risky, now that we can view them in hindsight.
 Democratic politicians who wanted the disadvantaged to have the opportunity to own their own homes meant well when they insisted that banks allocate a percentage of their loan capacity to these borrowers. But they also thwarted every attempt by the Bush administration to rein in the government entities that guaranteed this subprime debt and then threw their hands up in horror when the institutions went under. 
 Thank heaven for the pragmatists who are busy hammering out solutions while onlookers enjoy the satisfactions of the blame game.

HEADLINE: Coming Down On Tobacco

BYLINE: By DUFF WILSON

 BODY:
The new Congress plans to move aggressively against the tobacco industry in coming months by regulating cigarettes, raising per-pack sales taxes and ratifying an international antitobacco treaty, according to aides for key lawmakers and experts who expect the Obama administration to break a logjam on smoking issues. 
 The measures, which even tobacco executives acknowledge as nearly inevitable, are ones that the Bush administration opposed, vetoed or declined to act upon but that President-elect Barack Obama, himself an intermittent smoker, supported as a senator. 
 The steps include legislation giving the Food and Drug Administration broad authority over cigarettes for the first time. 
 ''We hope for early action on the bill in the new Congress,'' Melissa Wagoner, a spokeswoman for Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, said of the landmark legislation, which Mr. Kennedy has promoted for years. 
 Robert Gibbs, Mr. Obama's spokesman and incoming press secretary, said by e-mail on Sunday that Mr. Obama supported the measures when he was in Congress but had not made any decisions yet about actions on them in the White House.
 Matthew L. Myers, the head of a nonprofit antismoking group, said on Monday, ''The election of Barack Obama changes everything.''
 Mr. Myers, who is president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, a Washington group that has taken a lead in promoting the legislation, added, ''I think that 2009 has the potential to be the most historic year in making progress on tobacco at the federal level since the first surgeon general's report in 1964.''
 Mr. Myers said talks between antitobacco groups and the Obama transition team ''have gone very well'' but declined to be more specific.
 In the House, Henry A. Waxman of California, a Democrat and chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, plans to move quickly with the F.D.A. legislation, said his spokeswoman, Karen Lightfoot. A majority of House and Senate members are co-sponsors, and Mr. Waxman's former chief of staff, Philip M. Schiliro, has been named Mr. Obama's White House liaison to Congress.
 Democratic leaders in both houses of Congress, whose new members will be sworn in on Tuesday, have also said they hope to pass legislation to raise federal cigarette taxes by 61 cents, to $1 a pack. That may even be among the economic measures awaiting Mr. Obama's signature as soon as he takes office Jan. 20, according to Congressional aides and antismoking lobbyists. 
 President Bush vetoed the cigarette tax increase in 2007.
 The projected $35 billion in new tax revenue over five years would help finance the State Children's Health Insurance Program. As a senator, Mr. Obama co-sponsored the measure, and his campaign lists it among planned actions for revamping health care. 
 ''That should go quickly,'' said Edward L. Sweda, senior lawyer with the Tobacco Products Liability Project at the Northeastern University School of Law in Boston. ''It's easy to do first on a fast track and provides the additional benefit of health benefits for millions of children.'' 
 The legislation empowering the F.D.A. to regulate tobacco had passed by wide measures in the Senate in 2004 and in the House last July, but faced opposition from the Bush administration. The proposal's broad range of supporters includes the industry sales leader, Philip Morris, although other cigarette makers oppose it. 
 ''They're anticipating it going through reasonably soon, after many years of battle,'' said Clifford E. Douglas, executive director of the University of Michigan Tobacco Research Network, which opposes smoking. Mr. Douglas praised Mr. Obama for an extensive record of fighting tobacco since his days in the Illinois Legislature.
 As a third step against smoking, Congressional aides and lobbyists on both sides expect the new president to submit an international tobacco control treaty to the Senate for ratification. Although the Bush administration signed the treaty in 2004, it opposed some of the limits on marketing and did not send it to the Senate. The United States is one of only two populous countries -- the other is Indonesia, another major tobacco producer and consumer -- that have not yet ratified the treaty, known as the World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.
 The pact's main provisions -- advertising restrictions, health warnings, tobacco taxes -- are already in place in the United States. But the tobacco pact, which is the world's first public health treaty, would go further to exclude industry executives from policy making. 
 The treaty could also hamper the expansion plans of foreign cigarette sellers, including Philip Morris International. That unit was spun off by its parent company, the Altria Group, last March, in part to pursue growth opportunities in foreign markets outside the legal and regulatory constraints of the United States. Philip Morris now controls about 15 percent of the global cigarette trade. 
 The treaty would have much less impact on Altria than the F.D.A. legislation would, said David M. Sylvia, an Altria spokesman. But Altria objects to the treaty's calls for higher taxes and less participation by the industry in regulatory discussions, he added. Altria also opposes the cigarette tax increase as an unfair and inefficient way to finance children's health, he said.
 In this country, an estimated 45 million people smoke. That number is unchanged since 1990, the American Lung Association says, although the number of cigarettes smoked has declined by one-third. More than 400,000 people die of smoking-related diseases each year.
 The tobacco companies themselves are healthy financially, with total United States wholesale revenue estimated at well over $40 billion this year and a profit margin exceeding 30 percent. 
 ''Especially when you compare with some other businesses, we're in really good shape,'' Mr. Sylvia said. 
 The tobacco industry received something of a setback on Dec. 16, when the Supreme Court narrowly upheld the right of people to file fraud suits over the marketing claims of so-called light cigarettes. 
 But that ruling is not expected to have much of a financial impact on cigarette companies, which say in shareholder filings that they face more favorable prospects in court than they did years ago, partly because class-action claims have been rejected.
 In fact, a Morgan Stanley research note on Dec. 19 upgraded tobacco stocks and predicted further gains, even assuming a March start of the $1-a-pack excise tax. But the report was based, in part, on a predicted ''low'' likelihood of fast action on the F.D.A. regulation, on the assumption that Congress would be busy with other priorities.
 The Democrats who are expected to help reinforce the efforts against tobacco include Tom Daschle, the president-elect's choice for health and human services secretary, who has been an ardent opponent of the cigarette industry. 
 And among those whose names are being circulated as candidates to head the F.D.A. is Dr. Joshua M. Sharfstein, the antismoking health commissioner for Baltimore and a former investigator for Representative Waxman. It was Mr. Waxman who convened the memorable 1994 hearing where seven tobacco executives swore under oath that nicotine was not addictive. 
 The F.D.A. legislation would set up a new office to deal especially with tobacco, financed entirely by new industry fees. A director would have to be named, a staff hired, procedures written. The legislation allows further restraints on sales and marketing to young people and provides for stronger warning labels, similar to ones in Canada with graphic depictions of smoking-related illnesses. 
 But the legislation does not ban cigarettes entirely, which is widely viewed as a Prohibition-style impossibility. Nor, despite outlawing various cigarette flavorings, would it ban menthol. A legislative compromise reached last year would leave it up to the F.D.A. to decide whether menthol should be restricted. 
 Altria supports the F.D.A. regulation because ''from a pure business standpoint, it will bring predictability to regulation over the tobacco industry,'' said Mr. Sylvia, the company's spokesman. 
 But all the other major cigarette makers oppose the legislation, saying the marketing restrictions would help Philip Morris lock in its 50 percent share of the domestic market. The law would not allow the introduction of any new tobacco products unless they were ruled ''appropriate for the protection of public health.''
 Industry executives also say they object to the cost of regulating tobacco. ''The F.D.A. office would cost $6 billion over 10 years in hopes of reducing smoking by 2 percent, a use of government resources that some might see as inefficient,'' Michael W. Robinson, a spokesman for Lorillard, the nation's third-largest tobacco company, said in an interview.
 More generally, the industry is hoping the Obama administration adopts a ''harm reduction'' strategy toward cigarettes, rather than a policy of strict cessation. Such an approach would be in contrast to earlier strategies -- like the smoking-cessation goal set forth in 1984 by Dr. C. Everett Koop, then the surgeon general, which envisioned a tobacco-free society by the year 2000.
 Harm reduction, a phrase promoted by tobacco companies, would allow the government or industry to promote some products as safer than others. ''We think we should work with the F.D.A. on that,'' said Mr. Sylvia of Altria.
 Mr. Obama smokes intermittently, according to his doctor, and tried but failed to kick tobacco during the presidential campaign. His wife pleads with him to quit. 
 How much he now smokes has not been disclosed, but he chews nicotine gum and has promised not to smoke in the White House.

HEADLINE: In Fatah-Governed West Bank, Solidarity With Hamas

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER; Khaled Abu Aker contributed reporting.

DATELINE: NABLUS, West Bank 

 BODY:
Fewer than 100 people showed up on Monday in the busy center of Nablus for a demonstration in solidarity with the suffering Palestinians of Gaza. There were a few Palestinian flags, and some posters that featured bombs with Jewish stars and dripping blood and demanded, ''Where is the conscience of the world?'' But when an organizer asked passers-by to join the rally, only a handful responded. 
 The lack of interest was not, for certain, lack of support for Hamas. Fury is rising here over the war in Gaza, as are support for Hamas and anger with the Palestinian Authority in this city, which has long been the beating heart of opposition to Israeli occupation of the West Bank. Many want the authority and the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas of the Fatah party, to do more to criticize Israel.
 But a complicated internal struggle is also playing out here in the West Bank, separate geographically and governed by the Palestinian Authority, not, like Gaza, by Hamas. Fatah leaders are growing deeply worried over popular reaction and support for its rival, Hamas, to the point of crushing recent demonstrations. 
 There is also, after so many years of struggle, of Palestinian against Israeli and of Palestinian against Palestinian, no small degree of weariness with yet another deadly round. Even with the war in Gaza, there is no sign of a third intifada, or uprising, despite Hamas's call for one. 
 ''The people are tired,'' said Jamal Fayez, who runs a modest restaurant in the city center. ''They're tired, and they're poor. They're tired of the conflict between Hamas and Fatah, and they're tired from trying to earn bread to eat.''
 In a series of interviews, people here said they were enraged by the photographs and television images of the Palestinian dead in Hamas-controlled Gaza, which they consider part of themselves. 
 They said that support for Hamas would grow as this conflict went on, and that they were intimidated by the Palestinian security forces of Mr. Abbas and his appointed prime minister, Salam Fayyad -- forces subsidized by the United States and trained by Jordan -- which have cracked down on a series of demonstrations and banned the showing of the Hamas flag. 
 With American support, Mr. Fayyad, an economist, is trying to create stability, security and a working model of productive life in the region that can provide an alternative to the vision of Hamas. But the same newly organized police forces that are providing better security on the streets of Nablus, Jenin and Hebron in the West Bank are trying to repress popular anger over Gaza. That is a balancing act they may not be delicate enough to pull off.
 On Monday afternoon, for example, a march of several hundred students from Birzeit University outside Ramallah toward the nearby Atarot checkpoint was broken up by Palestinian security forces wielding clubs. The students wanted to confront Israeli soldiers at Atarot, and the security forces wanted to prevent the confrontation. 
 Last Friday, security forces broke up larger demonstrations in Hebron and Ramallah, arresting Hamas supporters, confiscating Hamas flags and ripping up placards with pro-Hamas slogans. For the first time in memory, the Palestinian police used tear gas against their own people.
 ''The Palestinian Authority is preventing people from going to the streets,'' said an angry Hassan Hassan, 50, a lawyer. ''They only want their point of view to pertain, and they share the view of Israel and the United States that Hamas should be crushed. They only want Fatah here, they don't want anyone else, despite the fact that 80 percent of the people are in total solidarity with Gaza and against the repression of the Palestinian Authority.''
 Mahmoud Hanaisheh, 69, a weather-beaten farmer, went to the demonstration to show solidarity. ''It was important for me to be here,'' he said. ''I have to raise my voice, even if no one listens.''
 Asked if Mr. Abbas was doing enough for the people of Gaza, he yelled, ''No, no, no!'' He said Mr. Abbas was negotiating with no result and was complicit with Israel in the attacks on Hamas. The Israelis will negotiate seriously only with a partner they respect, he said.
 ''The only right thing is resistance,'' Mr. Hanaisheh said. ''If there is no resistance against the occupation, there is no Palestinian cause. But if you resist now, everyone says you're Hamas, and it's wrong!''
 Khalil Shikaki is one of the most highly regarded Palestinian pollsters, director of the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research in Ramallah, and a sometime adviser to Mr. Abbas. ''This conflict will destabilize what Salam Fayyad has tried to do in the West Bank,'' Mr. Shikaki said. ''There is certainly destabilization already, and if Hamas sees itself on the way to some kind of victory in Gaza, the West Bank will be a different ballgame. As the war drags on, Abbas and Fayyad are more on the defensive, and their ability to crack down will be affected, too.'' 
 The impact of the Fatah-Hamas struggle is strong, Mr. Shikaki said, with Fatah having lost legislative elections to Hamas in January 2006 and having lost control of Gaza to Hamas in a short but fierce civil war in June 2007. 
 ''There is anger with the Israelis over Gaza, but also anger with Hamas, and for the first time, Israel is waging war with a faction of the Palestinian people that has been in a bloody conflict with another Palestinian faction,'' Mr. Shikaki said. ''There is a sense of frustration with both Hamas and Abu Mazen,'' as Mr. Abbas is known.
 Palestinians have conflicting sentiments, Mr. Shikaki said. There is sympathy for those under attack, respect for those who fight and the need to show support for the victims of Israel. ''All this is affecting Abu Mazen and Fatah,'' he said, ''and if Hamas can declare some kind of victory in Gaza, this support for Hamas will remain, and Hamas will be able to regain the initiative in the West Bank that they lost after the civil war in Gaza.'' 
 On the West Bank, he said, people do not blame Hamas now, as Mr. Abbas did. ''This is not the moment for blame,'' Mr. Shikaki said, ''which is why Abu Mazen saying that Hamas is responsible for the Israeli attacks did not go down well.'' But he said that much would depend, in both Israeli and Palestinian politics, on the outcome of the conflict and on whether Hamas or Israel was perceived to have won. 
 Raida Yassin, 30, was one of the teachers who demonstrated. ''You see this atmosphere,'' she said, shrugging and readjusting her head scarf. ''We are here for solidarity, but we can do nothing more for Gaza. We have nothing in our hands.''
 She hoped the Palestinian Authority would do more, she said. ''But the Palestinian Authority is one thing and the people are another,'' she said. ''What I care about is the people; the Palestinian Authority is in a different world.'' 
 Mr. Fayez, the restaurateur, said: ''People feel caught in this conflict between Hamas and Fatah. If you have a business here, it's better to be neutral; I have customers from both sides.''
 The mood is unstable, he said. ''There is no question, this generates more support and sympathy for Hamas, so it really worries the Palestinian Authority,'' he said. Then he stopped and said, not really joking, ''I hope tomorrow I won't find myself in jail.''

HEADLINE: Recession Delays Bloomberg Plan for Low-Cost Housing

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's plan to create or preserve 165,000 units of housing for low- and moderate-income families by 2013 has been pushed back one year because the economic recession has stifled the financing of low-cost housing.
 The one-year extension is the first major setback for one of the mayor's oldest and most ambitious initiatives: his 10-year, $7.5 billion effort to build or preserve housing affordable to 500,000 low- and moderate-income New Yorkers. It officially began in 2003 and had progressed five years later to the point that in September, Mr. Bloomberg and city housing officials celebrated reaching the halfway mark on schedule, with 82,500 units financed. 
 But Mr. Bloomberg announced the extension in December during a speech and in one of his weekly radio addresses, neither of which received much attention beyond housing advocates. 
 Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the city's housing agency, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, said in a statement last Wednesday that the mayor's goal of creating or preserving 165,000 units remained unchanged and that ''only the timeline is altered.'' He said that the delay affected less than 10 percent of the overall plan and that ''we continue to close on new developments at a time when many others are having to abandon their plans.''
 Advocates and developers of low-income housing described the one-year extension as a reasonable concession in uncertain and difficult economic times, though some believed the plan could stretch not just to 2014 but perhaps 2015.
 ''It's not a surprise to me that the mayor's housing plan has had to adjust to the times,'' said Josh Lockwood, executive director of Habitat for Humanity -- New York City, a nonprofit developer of low-income housing. ''There's only so much that's under the mayor's control.''
 Many of the projects in the plan rely not only on government subsidies but also on private financing from lenders, a stream of money that has tightened in recent months. Another factor that has slowed development of so-called affordable housing is the drop in price of low-income housing tax credits. The sale of the federal tax credits to investors helps finance the building of housing for low-income families.
 ''You've got this kind of perfect storm of factors that is making the financing difficult,'' said Bernie Carr, executive director of the New York State Association for Affordable Housing, a trade group made up of developers, general contractors, lenders and others. ''To extend the plan for a year seems actually very reasonable to me.''
 Mr. Carr and other housing advocates said they believed the mayor remains committed to the plan, which they said has now become more than a housing initiative. ''It's not just a matter of needing 165,000 affordable housing units,'' said David M. Muchnick, coordinator of Housing First!, a coalition of builders, community groups and others. ''It's very much needing the thousands of jobs that production of those units saves and creates.''
 Mr. Bloomberg, during his weekly radio address on Dec. 14, spoke about the challenges facing his housing plan.
 ''Now, with the economy stalling and even the most qualified developers having a hard time getting credit, we know we can't keep that pace up,'' Mr. Bloomberg said, according to his prepared remarks. ''So we're stretching out our schedule for completing the second half of our housing program to six years instead of the five years we'd planned for at first.''
 The mayor's radio address came the day after President-elect Barack Obama announced that he had selected Shaun Donovan, the city's housing commissioner, to lead the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. Mr. Donovan had been the driving force behind the mayor's plan.
 A spokesman for the mayor, Marc LaVorgna, said the extension was tied to the mayor's announcement in May that he would stretch a four-year construction plan for the city to five years amid signs of a declining economy, delaying a number of projects involving not just housing but also transportation and school construction, to save money.
 Mr. Bloomberg first announced the plan in December 2002, 49 weeks after he was sworn into office in January 2002. Known as the New Housing Marketplace Plan, it had a goal of 65,000 units by 2008 and was expanded in 2006 to 165,000 units by 2013.
 It was and has been a huge undertaking, the largest housing plan of its kind in the country, with enough units, as the mayor often points out, to house the population of the city of Atlanta. It relies on a number of strategies to reach the 165,000-unit goal, including zoning changes, financing incentives for developers and the identification of land that city and state agencies own but no longer use.
 Nearly 57,000 units of the 82,500 financed have been rental housing, and the rest have been homeownership units, including single-family homes and condo units, according to city data as of September.
 The plan had until recently been marked by signs of success. One of its key elements, the New York City Acquisition Fund, which helps small developers and nonprofit groups compete for land in the private market, received an award in September from Harvard's Ash Institute for Democratic Governance and Innovation.
 In 2007, the city's Independent Budget Office released a report that found that the plan was on track toward completion, though it raised questions about the financing. The report noted that most of the units to be preserved could be financed through the capital budget of the city's housing agency. But the bigger challenge for the plan was in building tens of thousands of new units by 2013, and the report predicted that ''a reassessment of its goals and assumptions may be necessary.''

HEADLINE: Obama Seeks Wide Support In Congress For Stimulus

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Two weeks before assuming power, President-elect Barack Obama took his economic recovery package to Capitol Hill on Monday and worked to build a bipartisan coalition to endorse his plan of tax cuts and new spending with an urgent appeal ''to break the momentum of this recession.''
 Mr. Obama, on his first full day in Washington since the election, held a series of face-to-face meetings with Democrats and Republicans as he began spending his political capital. He spoke of the nation's economic condition in dark terms and urged Congress to pass the legislation within a month.
 ''Right now, the most important task for us is to stabilize the patient,'' Mr. Obama said. ''The economy is badly damaged -- it is very sick. So we have to take whatever steps are required to make sure that it is stabilized.'' 
 The meetings were a mix of symbolism and substance between the man who will be sworn in as the 44th president and the Congressional leaders who hold the fate of his agenda in their hands. The sessions, aides said, were particularly aimed at encouraging Republicans to buy into the plan and help ease resistance over a $775 billion price tag. 
 Mr. Obama pledged to help advance the legislation in any way he could, participants said, including inviting skeptical members of Congress to meet with him at his transition headquarters or at his temporary residence, the Hay-Adams Hotel. 
 ''This is not a Republican problem or a Democratic problem at this stage,'' Mr. Obama said Monday afternoon. ''It is an American problem, and we're going to all have to chip in and do what the American people expect.''
 After meeting for about an hour in the Lyndon B. Johnson Room near the Senate chamber, Congressional leaders said they expected a bipartisan effort to approve the economic stimulus package by early February. Lawmakers said they were waiting for Mr. Obama to present a written proposal -- perhaps even draft legislation -- within days. Various House and Senate committees would fill out the details.
 For Mr. Obama, it was his first return to the Capitol since he was elected on Nov. 4, and another reminder of how rapid his ascent has been. Four years after he took his first steps into the building, arriving as a freshman senator from Illinois, he swept in Monday under the cover of considerable security, with some roads barricaded outside the building and corridors inside closed off to accommodate his movements. At one point, large groups of tourists were forced to linger in the Rotunda to wait for Mr. Obama to leave his morning meeting with Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
 The president-elect returned to the Capitol in the afternoon for a meeting with Vice President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader. He then proceeded past a huge crowd of photographers to the meeting with House and Senate leaders from both parties. 
 Mr. Obama listened as Republicans raised concerns about waste and transparency in the economic stimulus plan. He agreed with a suggestion raised by Representative Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia, about putting the entire contents of the legislation online in a user-friendly way to see how the money is being spent.
 But participants in the private meetings said there did not seem to be agreement on the scale of the package. Mr. Reid said many economists have urged a bill of $800 billion to $1.2 trillion, while Mr. Obama's advisers estimated legislation at no more than $775 billion. 
 The House Republican leader, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, said he was concerned about the overall size of the stimulus package. He said the American public was rightly agitated by the lack of accountability in the bailout bills that were abruptly approved last fall.
 ''While we want to get the economy moving again,'' Mr. Boehner said, ''the overall size and how we craft this is going to be very important.'' 
 Still, Republicans praised Mr. Obama's willingness to hear their ideas, which is something they have often felt did not take place under President Bush. They urged Mr. Obama to use the stimulus bill to provide a substantial tax cut to middle-class families and small businesses, but also pressed him to ensure that the legislative process would be fair to the diminished Republican minorities in both chambers.
 The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, also said he encouraged Mr. Obama to consider providing aid to states in the form of loans that would have to be repaid, as a means of preventing wasteful spending. 
 ''I thought the atmosphere for bipartisan cooperation was sincere on all sides,'' Mr. McConnell said after the meeting. The legislation, which Mr. Obama and his economic advisers discussed Monday, includes about $300 billion in tax cuts for workers and businesses. A part of the plan that was a centerpiece of the presidential campaign would provide credits of up to $500 for most workers at an overall price of $150 billion. The plan also includes more than $100 billion in tax incentives for business to create jobs and invest in factories and equipment.
 The series of meetings with lawmakers on Capitol Hill highlighted the fact that the new president is coming from their own ranks, for the first time since John F. Kennedy.
 Mr. Reid, speaking to reporters after the meeting, said lawmakers were committed to adopting the economic plan as quickly as possible. But Congressional Democrats and the Obama transition team have pushed back their timetable, which originally called for the legislation to be ready for Mr. Obama to sign on the day of his inauguration. Instead, they said their goal was to have the bill completed no later than mid-February.
 Ms. Pelosi, who met with Mr. Obama twice on Monday, said that the stimulus bill would be taken up first in the House and that there was agreement to move swiftly.
 ''I won't make any announcement about how soon, but we all know what our tasks are,'' Ms. Pelosi said. ''We know what the time constraints are. They are dictated by the sense of urgency that the American people have about their economic well-being.'' 
 At one of their meetings, .Mr. Obama and Ms. Pelosi discussed a plan to push forward quickly with a bill to expand the State Children's Health Insurance Program, an effort that President Bush has blocked. Democrats had considered including additional money for the program, which provides medical coverage for low-income children and families, in the stimulus measure. As the stimulus plan began to take shape, the search intensified for a new commerce secretary, one day after Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico withdrew from consideration for the position. Democratic officials familiar with the search said prospective candidates include William Daley, who served as commerce secretary in the Clinton administration, and Laura Tyson, who has advised Mr. Obama on the economy.

HEADLINE: Venezuela Suspends Heating Aid To the U.S.

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela 

 BODY:
Venezuela's national oil company is suspending a program that provides discounted heating oil to poor communities in the United States, as officials here struggle to find ways of preserving hard currency reserves amid a plunge in oil revenues. 
 The move, announced on Monday, halts one of President Hugo Chavez's most ambitious foreign aid projects -- and one that allowed him to poke at the Bush administration, which had proposed a cut in funds for heating assistance to the poor.
 Citizens Energy, an American company that helped distribute the heating oil, announced the decision, citing officials from Citgo Petroleum, the Houston-based arm of Petroleos de Venezuela. The move will increase heating costs for about 200,000 households in 23 states. 
 ''The heating oil program has been suspended until further notice,'' Joseph P. Kennedy II, the president of Citizens Energy, said in a statement. A spokesman for Citgo declined to comment on the announcement but said a statement would be issued shortly.
 The heating oil program was unveiled in 2005 in poor urban areas of Massachusetts and New York. Last winter, Petroleos de Venezuela provided about $100 million for the program, which was expanded to include 220 Native American communities in Alaska and 11 other states, according to Brian O'Connor, a spokesman for Citizens Energy. 
 But with oil prices falling to less than $50 a barrel from a high of $147 a barrel in July, Venezuela faces a far different economic climate than it forecast six months ago. Senior government officials insist they will continue financing aid projects in Bolivia, Cuba and other nations, but pressures are increasing to focus on basic needs in Venezuela. 
 The drop in oil prices has exposed a reliance on oil to finance imports of food, cars and other goods, with nationalizations and abrupt policy changes creating a dearth of investment in sectors other than oil. Oil accounted for about 93 percent of Venezuela's export revenue in 2008, up from 69 percent in 1998, when Mr. Chavez was first elected. 
 The suspension of the heating oil program follows a decision to tighten currency controls in an attempt to stanch the flow of dollars leaving the country. On New Year's Eve, officials cut in half the amount that Venezuelans can spend abroad on their credit cards, to $2,500 a year. 
 Still, Venezuela has avoided the deeper adjustments sought by other oil-rich nations like Iran, where the government has proposed scrapping energy subsidies. 
 Indeed, Mr. Chavez is expected to delay a devaluation of the currency, the bolivar, until after a referendum to be held as early as February on a measure allowing him to seek re-election indefinitely. While campaigning on Monday, he proposed lifting term limits for other elected officials while insisting Venezuela would weather the drop in oil prices. 
 ''Chavez doesn't want to do anything that would jeopardize his chances of winning the vote,'' said Russell M. Dallen Jr., head of Caracas capital markets for BBO Financial Services, an investment bank here.

HEADLINE: In Santa Fe, Staying Can Also Be Such Sweet Sorrow

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: SANTA FE, N.M. 

 BODY:
The conversations inside one adobe-walled office after another in New Mexico's state capital could be summarized in two words: He's back.
 Some said it with pleasure, some with irritation, some with such caution that they tried to let their voices betray no emotion. Gov. Bill Richardson's withdrawal on Sunday as the choice for commerce secretary in an Obama cabinet brings an outsize political personality back to a small town in a small state, both of which had already begun planning to proceed without him.
 ''Everyone was thinking he would be gone,'' said Michael Sanchez, the majority leader of the State Senate, which, like much of the political establishment in this state of about 2 million people, is controlled by Democrats. ''It is what it is,'' added Mr. Sanchez, whose caucus in the Senate has been increasingly at odds with Mr. Richardson in recent years. 
 Mr. Richardson has dominated state government by force of personality and a single-minded pursuit of economic development and raising the state's profile -- along with his own. But now, things are not quite the same. 
 A federal investigation is looking into ''pay for play'' accusations involving a state financial contract given to a company run by a donor to the governor's political action committees. While denying any involvement, Mr. Richardson said the inquiry would have ''forced an untenable delay'' in his confirmation as commerce secretary.
 But with the recent convictions on corruption charges of three officials who had held high state posts -- two former state treasurers and the former speaker pro tem of the State Senate -- the federal investigation is being carefully watched by the politicians and power brokers with whom Mr. Richardson has dealt in the past. Most politicians called for comment by reporters on Monday spoke cautiously, if at all.
 The governor himself, in a brief news conference at the State Capitol on Monday and in a round-robin letter to members of the political and legal community, affirmed his statement that ''I acted properly and my administration acted appropriately'' in connection with the two contracts. The contracts, worth $1.4 million, were to CDR Financial Products, a Beverly Hills, Calif., company. 
 At the news conference, Mr. Richardson said he was ''disappointed in the turn of events.''
 ''There were a lot of things in which I thought I could help the country in a time of financial crisis,'' he said. ''Sometimes your own dreams and plans must take a back seat to what is best for the nation.''
 Heath Haussamen, a former state capitol reporter for two New Mexico newspapers who now writes a blog, said in an interview Monday, ''We've been dealing with scandal after scandal -- it's been a big mess.'' 
 Of Mr. Richardson Mr. Haussamen said: ''We call him the Teflon governor. We've all written a lot of stories about pay to play, and none of them have stuck. He plays the political game at a higher level than pretty much anyone in the state's history and does it very successfully.''
 The governor's biggest successes have come in the area of economic development. One project, a $400 million rail line between Santa Fe and Albuquerque that opened last month, was marred by a political dust-up when it was disclosed that one station involved a land swap with a politically powerful developer and major Richardson contributor.
 Economic development projects have also included lowering state taxes for movie companies willing to film in New Mexico -- a move that helped attract projects like ''No Country for Old Men'' -- and the inclusion of large New Mexico floats in the annual Rose Parade in Pasadena.
 James B. Alley Jr., a lawyer who said he was friendly with the governor, interrupted his lunch at Tia Sophia, a luncheonette popular with politicians, to say he was disappointed that Mr. Richardson's commerce post had fallen through. ''In spite of all the warts all politicians have,'' Mr. Alley said, ''I think he'd have done a good job in Washington.''
 But Mr. Sanchez, the state senator, said the governor's successes had come in years when the state was flush with revenues from the oil, natural gas and mining industries. New Mexico must now cut or tax its way out of a deficit of about $450 million on a budget of about $6 billion.
 John Grubesic, a lawyer and former state senator who fell out with the governor after he wrote an op-ed article that referred to him as ''the flabby king,'' said Mr. Richardson demanded loyalty and was quick to turn on those who disagreed with him.
 ''Part of the governor's style is he's very hard charging and he can sometimes be seen as a bully,'' Mr. Grubesic said. ''People are very reluctant to think outside of Richardson's box.''
 On Saturday, when Mr. Richardson still seemed to be a short-timer, a photograph of Diane Denish, the lieutenant governor, was prominently featured on the front page of The Santa Fe New Mexican under the headline ''Out of the Shadow.'' Two days later, Mr. Richardson was talking about how he looked forward with her as his lieutenant governor.
 Santa Fe residents outside the political arena watched the events with mild interest. Asked about the governor's withdrawal from the commerce job, Mark Terry, who recently lost his job as a veterinarian, said: ''He's been laid off. Like half the population.''

HEADLINE: Skiing in Vermont, by Bus

BYLINE: MATT GROSS


HIGHLIGHT: With the recession cutting into everyone's vacation budgets, the Alps are an extravagance few can afford. But from New York City, one can find several low-budget day trips to Vermont resorts. 

 BODY:
The daylong expedition to Okemo Mountain Resort did not begin auspiciously. It was almost 5 a.m. last Saturday, and my bus was supposed to have left the Upper East Side 30 minutes earlier on the four-hour journey to Ludlow, Vt. Outside, in the yellow predawn street light, stood five friends who'd bought tickets for the trip. Inside, however, were only three empty seats. The trip, operated by Emilio's Ski Shop, was overbooked. The Okemo Five could either split up or go home.
"This is the worst scenario," said Richard Tio, the trip leader, who arranged refunds and free tickets for Sunday by way of apology.
My seat mate, a young woman named Min Kim, turned to me and asked, "Is it always this crowded?"
Indeed, it is - although this year the crowding feels more acute. With the recession cutting into everyone's vacation budgets, the Rockies and the Alps are extravagances that fewer can afford. Even down-to-earth Banff, which I wrote about last Sunday ("Canada's Quiet Star"), is a luxury.
But in New York City, inexpensive day trips to nearby mountains seem more popular than ever. Operated by ski and sports shops like Emilio's (112-32 Queens Boulevard, Forest Hills; 718-544-0404; www.emiliosskishop.com), Blades Board & Skate (two Manhattan locations; 212-787-3911; www.bladesnyc.com) and Paragon Sports (867 Broadway, 212-255-8889; www.paragonsports.com), these trips typically depart from the store between 3:30 and 6:30 in the morning, deposit you at the mountain just after 9 a.m. and leave for the city about 4:30 p.m.

Trips to Catskills resorts - Hunter, Windham and Belleayre are the only ones with regular service - run about $80 for transportation and lift ticket (rental gear is extra). Similar trips are also run by ZogSports, a charity-minded social club (www.zogsports.com), for $90 and up. You can also catch the Adirondack Trailways bus from Port Authority to Belleayre for $81 (lift ticket and beginner lesson included), or make it a multiday excursion for $170 and up, hotel included (see www.belleayre.com/winter/skibus.htm for details).
But the Vermont resorts - Okemo, Stratton and Mount Snow, all of which put the Catskills slopes to shame - represent the best bargains: $89.95 for transportation and lift ticket. By comparison, lift tickets alone run $75 at Mount Snow, $77 at Okemo and $79 at Stratton.
There is, of course, a catch. The only shop offering regular service to Vermont is Emilio's, whose chaos factor is extremely high. (NYC Ski & Board, a tour company, goes there somewhat less regularly; see www.nycski.com). On my first Emilio's excursion, six years ago, the trip leaders - all volunteers, working in exchange for lift tickets - struck me as rude and joyless. On a trip last year, however, the leader was the exact opposite: timid, quiet and hardly in charge. In fact, when the bus returned home to Brooklyn, my snowboard had mysteriously vanished from the cargo bay. It had been unloaded during a dropoff in Queens and left on the sidewalk. Luckily, a fellow passenger rescued it.
By contrast, I've never witnessed such problems with trips organized by Blades Board & Skate. Their trip leaders may seem like Jeff Spicoli wannabes, but they're actually quite professional. Free hot bagels, bottled water and Red Bull, plus dawn screenings of the latest snowboarding videos, get you revved up for the mountain. Unfortunately, Blades goes only to Hunter.
Perhaps I'm too hard on Emilio's. After all, any annoyance evaporated once we reached Okemo. With 624 skiable acres and the biggest vertical drop in southern Vermont (2,201 feet), it has enough variety and challenge to keep an intermediate-to-advanced skier or boarder well occupied for a weekend. And yet it's rarely busy - Killington, about 24 miles north, draws the crowds, leaving Okemo's 19 lifts with short lines.
Last Saturday was perfect: 15 to 20 degrees, mostly sunny, with the wind gusting only at the 3,344-foot summit. It hadn't snowed in three days, but what lay on the mountain (96 percent of which is covered by snowmaking) was dry and well-packed, with soft drifts at trail's edge.
I strapped on my board and got reacquainted with the mountain, roaming from the breezy Tomahawk trails to the south slopes. At noon, I ate a humongous pulled-pork sandwich (plus coleslaw and chili) and drank a Long Trail ale at Smokey Jo's in the Sugar House Lodge. At $15.30, it wasn't totally cheap, but no more expensive than any other meal at the mountain.
Once I'd digested lunch, I made for the speedy World Cup trails, and rode them again and again, forgetting entirely to explore Okemo's second mountain, Jackson-Gore.
By 2:30, the day was winding down as it usually does on East Coast mountains. The activity and the wind had revealed bald, icy spots at the summit and on many trails, and the bars at the base were hopping. Tired and sore, I pulled off my boots, bought a chocolate-chip cookie and a coffee ($4.90) and boarded the bus at 4 p.m. It left 20 minutes later, and I fell asleep not long after that. Around 10 p.m., after dropping off passengers in Manhattan and Queens, the bus finally arrived in Brooklyn. This time, so did my snowboard.

HEADLINE: State's Unemployment System Buckles Under Surging Demand

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN; Mathew R. Warren contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Swamped by a post-holiday surge of claims from laid-off workers, New York State's computerized unemployment insurance system shut down briefly Monday afternoon and then again for several hours on Tuesday, according to the state Department of Labor.
 The system, which serves as the gateway to unemployment benefits for New York residents, could not handle the volume of calls and online inquiries it was receiving, said Leo Rosales, a spokesman for the department. As many as 10,000 people an hour tried to log into the system to file new unemployment claims or to check on existing claims, Mr. Rosales said. 
 ''It is really unprecedented, the number of calls we're getting per hour,'' Mr. Rosales said. He attributed the unusually heavy volume to the confluence of ''the high unemployment rate, the time of the week, the time of the year and the high number of new claims.''
 In the week that ended Dec. 26, 30,161 people filed new applications for unemployment benefits, an increase of more than 32 percent over the same week in 2007. The number of first-time claims has averaged more than 30,000 per week for the last few weeks. 
 Though it remains lower than the nation's, the state's unemployment rate rose to 6.1 percent in November from 5.7 percent in October. New York City's unemployment rate rose to 6.3 percent in November, from 5.7 percent in October. Economists expect unemployment to continue rising, possibly at an accelerated rate, in early 2009.
 ''I think a lot of employers tried to keep people on the payrolls through the end of the year, but the sense was that there was going to be a surge in layoffs come the first of the year,'' said James A. Parrott, chief economist for the Fiscal Policy Institute, a research group that advocates on behalf of low-wage workers. ''That's probably what's hitting the claims system right now.''
 The demands on the state-administered unemployment insurance program have been building for several weeks and increased after an emergency extension of benefits in November as more people called to inquire about their eligibility, Mr. Rosales said. That seven-week extension followed a 13-week extension earlier in the year. All told, workers who were eligible for both extensions could collect unemployment checks for a maximum of 46 weeks.
 In early December, the state Labor Department doubled its staff of representatives who field calls about unemployment benefits and extended their working hours in response to growing wait times on the phone lines, Mr. Rosales said.
 ''We've been experiencing high call volumes for several months,'' Mr. Rosales said. ''There was a long wait time for callers. We had a lot of complaints. People were upset.''
 Mr. Rosales said that the system was repaired around midday on Tuesday, and that anyone seeking to file a claim for benefits has until Sunday to apply in time to receive a check next week.
 Unemployed New Yorkers must apply for benefits either online or over the phone, but some frustrated claimants have been showing up at employment offices, whose purpose is to provide guidance on finding work. The state began phasing out unemployment offices several years ago and has not allowed in-person applications since 2005. 
 Several people interviewed at an employment center on in Harlem reported that the system has had technical problems for some time. Joe Ruiz said he went to the Workforce1 Career Center on West 125th Street to use a computer to apply for benefits online after he was dismissed from a job in a restaurant kitchen last month. But after the machine crashed repeatedly, he said, he went to a friend's apartment and eventually got through on the telephone.
 On Tuesday afternoon, in his third week of collecting benefits, Mr. Ruiz, 40, was back at the employment office to talk with a counselor. 
 ''I'm applying for a lot of jobs, so hopefully I won't need benefits for too long,'' Mr. Ruiz said. ''It's not a lot of money, but it helps.''

HEADLINE: Hundreds of Coal Ash Dumps, With Virtually No Regulation

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

 BODY:
The coal ash pond that ruptured and sent a billion gallons of toxic sludge across 300 acres of East Tennessee last month was only one of more than 1,300 similar dumps across the United States -- most of them unregulated and unmonitored -- that contain billions more gallons of fly ash and other byproducts of burning coal.
Like the one in Tennessee, most of these dumps, which reach up to 1,500 acres, contain heavy metals like arsenic, lead, mercury and selenium, which are considered by the Environmental Protection Agency to be a threat to water supplies and human health. Yet they are not subject to any federal regulation, which experts say could have prevented the spill, and there is little monitoring of their effects on the surrounding environment.
In fact, coal ash is used throughout the country for construction fill, mine reclamation and other ''beneficial uses.'' In 2007, according to a coal industry estimate, 50 tons of fly ash even went to agricultural uses, like improving soil's ability to hold water, despite a 1999 E.P.A. warning about high levels of arsenic. The industry has promoted the reuse of coal combustion products because of the growing amount of them being produced each year -- 131 million tons in 2007, up from less than 90 million tons in 1990. 
The amount of coal ash has ballooned in part because of increased demand for electricity, but more because air pollution controls have improved. Contaminants and waste products that once spewed through the coal plants' smokestacks are increasingly captured in the form of solid waste, held in huge piles in 46 states, near cities like Pittsburgh, St. Louis and Tampa, Fla., and on the shores of Lake Erie, Lake Michigan and the Mississippi River.
Numerous studies have shown that the ash can leach toxic substances that can cause cancer, birth defects and other health problems in humans, and can decimate fish, bird and frog populations in and around ash dumps, causing developmental problems like tadpoles born without teeth, or fish with severe spinal deformities.
''Your household garbage is managed much more consistently'' than coal combustion waste, said Dr. Thomas A. Burke, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who testified on the health effects of coal ash before a Congressional subcommittee last year. ''It's such a large volume of waste, and it's so essential to the country's energy supply; it's basically been a loophole in the country's waste management strategy.''
As the E.P.A. has studied whether to regulate coal ash waste, the cases of drinking wells and surface water contaminated by leaching from the dumps or the use of the ash has swelled. In 2007, an E.P.A. report identified 63 sites in 26 states where the water was contaminated by heavy metals from such dumps, including three other Tennessee Valley Authority dumps. Environmental advocacy groups have submitted at least 17 additional cases that they say should be added to that list.
Just last week, a judge approved a $54 million class-action settlement against Constellation Power Generation after it had dumped coal ash for more than a decade in a sand and gravel pit near Gambrills, Md., about 20 miles south of Baltimore, contaminating wells. And Town of Pines, Ind., a hamlet about 40 miles east of Chicago, was declared a Superfund site after wells there were found to be contaminated by ash dumped in a landfill and used to make roads starting in 1983.
Contamination can be swift. In Chesapeake, Va., high levels of lead, arsenic and other contaminants were found last year in the groundwater beneath a golf course sculptured with 1.5 million tons of fly ash, the same type of coal ash involved in the Tennessee spill. The golf course opened in 2007.
State requirements for the handling of coal ash vary widely. Some states, like Alabama, do not regulate it at all, except by means of federally required water discharge permits. In Texas, the vast majority of coal ash is not considered a solid waste, according to a review of state regulations by environmental groups. There are no groundwater monitoring or engineering requirements for utilities that dump the ash on site, as most utilities do, the analysis says.
The lack of uniform regulation stems from the E.P.A.'s inaction on the issue, which it has been studying for 28 years. In 2000, the agency came close to designating coal ash a hazardous waste, but backpedaled in the face of an industry campaign that argued that tighter controls would cost it $5 billion a year. (In 2007, the Department of Energy estimated that it would cost $11 billion a year.) At the time, the E.P.A. said it would issue national regulations governing the disposal of coal ash as a nonhazardous waste, but it has not done so.
''We're still working on coming up with those standards,'' said Matthew Hale, director of the office of solid waste at the E.P.A. ''We don't have a schedule at this point.''
Last year, the agency invited public comment on new data on coal combustion wastes, including a finding that the concentrations of arsenic to which people might be exposed through drinking water contaminated by fly ash could increase cancer risks several hundredfold.
If such regulations were issued, the agency could require that utilities dispose of dry ash in lined landfills, considered the most environmentally sound method of disposal, but also the most expensive. A 2006 federal report found that at least 45 percent of relatively new disposal sites did not use composite liners, the only kind that the E.P.A. says diminishes the leaching of cancer-causing metals to acceptable risk levels. The vast majority of older disposal sites are unlined.
Most coal ash is stored wet in ponds, like the one in Tennessee, almost always located on waterways because they need to take in and release water. But scientists say that the key to the safe disposal of coal ash is to keep it away from water, by putting dry ash into landfills with caps, linings and collection systems for contaminated water.
Environmentalists, scientists and other experts say that regulations could have prevented the Tennessee spill. Andrew Wittner, an economist who was working in the E.P.A.'s office of solid waste in 2000 when the issue of whether to designate coal ash as hazardous was being debated, said the agency came close to prohibiting ash ponds like the one at Kingston. ''We were going to suggest that these materials not be wet-handled, and that existing surface impoundments should be drained,'' Mr. Wittner said.
If storing coal ash were more expensive, environmental advocates say, utilities might be pushed to find more ways to recycle it safely. Experts say that some ''beneficial uses'' of coal ash can be just that, like substituting ash for cement in concrete, which binds the heavy metals and prevents them from leaching, or as a base for roads, where the ash is covered by an impermeable material. But using the ash as backfill or to level abandoned mines requires intensive study and monitoring, which environmentalists say is rarely done right.
The industry takes the position that states can regulate the disposal of coal ash on their own, and it has come up with a voluntary plan to close some gaps, like in the monitoring of older disposal sites.
''There probably isn't a need for a comprehensive regulatory approach to coal ash in light of what the states have and our action plan,'' said Jim Roewer, the executive director of the Utility Solid Wastes Activity Group.
Mr. Roewer said there was a trend toward dry ash disposal in lined landfills, though that trend was not identified in the 2006 federal report on disposal methods.
Environmentalists are skeptical of the industry's voluntary self-policing plan and the states' ability to tighten controls.
''The states have proven that they can't regulate this waste adequately, and that's seen in the damage that is occurring all over the United States,'' said Lisa Evans, a former E.P.A. lawyer who now works on hazardous-waste issues for the environmental advocacy group Earthjustice. ''If the states could regulate the industry appropriately, they would have done so by now.''
Utility companies are often aware of problems with their disposal system, Ms. Evans said, but they put off improvements because of the cost.
The Tennessee Valley Authority, which owns the Kingston Fossil Plant, where the Tennessee spill occurred, tried for decades to fix leaks at its ash pond. In 2003, it considered switching to dry disposal, but balked at the estimated cost of $25 million, according to a report in The Knoxville News Sentinel. That is less than the cost of cleaning up an ash spill in Pennsylvania in 2005 that was a 10th of the size of the one in Tennessee.

HEADLINE: Denver Aims to Ride Out the Recession

BYLINE: By DAN LUZADDER

DATELINE: DENVER 

 BODY:
Randy Nichols mounted the podium before a full house at the Rocky Mountain Commercial Real Estate Expo in November with a wry smile and the air of a defendant mounting the dock to plead insanity.
 ''I'm here,'' said Mr. Nichols, the president of the Nichols Partnership, a commercial real estate developer, ''to talk to you about why we would be stupid enough to build 500 housing units'' during a national economic downturn. 
 He was talking about the Spire -- a 42-story condominium and retail development going up across the street from the Colorado Convention Center, where the Expo was unfolding. His quip brought ripples of laughter and a wave of applause from hundreds of real estate professionals who had paid to hear the annual fall forecast for Denver's commercial real estate market. 
 At a time of high anxiety about both short- and long-term prospects for real estate development nationwide, Mr. Nichols's subsequent remarks -- coupled with those of economists and real estate entrepreneurs -- had a curiously calming effect. It isn't that Denver expects to avoid rough economic seas, but there is a sense that leaders here have constructed an ark on which to weather just such a storm. 
 A number of elements are cited as keeping this region afloat as other areas founder: investments in public transportation, aggressive economic development and, most significant, a two-decade campaign to diversify the region's economic base from oil and gas to alternative energy, aerospace, technology and telecommunications. 
 As a result, said Scott Anderson, a Wells Fargo economist who also spoke to the assembly, Denver and its region are ''in for a more mild recession'' than the rest of the country.
 While local office vacancy rates are rising -- 13.1 percent at the end of the third quarter, up from 12.4 percent in the second quarter, according to the most recent CoStar Group report on the Denver office market -- they stand below the national average, which was 13.6 percent in the third quarter, according to Reis Inc., a real estate research firm, and well below some other cities.
 Still, absorption rates were negative in both the second and third quarters, meaning that more space came onto the market than was leased or bought. The rate was a negative 39,000 square feet in the third quarter, compared with a positive absorption of 43,000 square feet in the first quarter. In addition, more than one million square feet of new commercial space is expected to become available next year.
 But a challenging time for the office market is expected to be mitigated somewhat by residential projects. Mr. Nichols told his audience that the Spire was aimed at downtown office professionals inclined to eschew the suburbs for convenient transit, recreation areas in the building where they lived, close-by shopping and cultural amenities and entertainment.
 The Spire will begin sales in March with units starting at $200,000 and ranging to more than $500,000. Its 33,000 square feet of amenities, Mr. Nichols said, includes pools, barbecue grills and media rooms, and the building's own fleet of bicycles. Retailing on the ground floor is expected to include an upscale restaurant-nightclub, a coffeehouse, a Pilates or yoga-oriented business and a car rental agency.
 The tower is being built at 14th Street near Curtis Street, in the heart of the city's new Theater District, a transformative project designed ''in Times Square fashion'' around the Convention Center and the city's new Center for the Performing Arts.
 The Theater District's chairman, Walter L. Isenberg, a Denver-based hotel developer and president of the Sage Hospitality Group, envisions the new district as a bright-lights environment that will draw new retailing and restaurants and attract tourists.
 ''There is history for this,'' Mr. Isenberg said. ''Thomas Edison once called Curtis the brightest street in America, and historic photos show it lit up with theater marquees up and down. The vision is to bring back that vitality.''
 With the Spire, three planned hotel projects and other developments, more than $1 billion in public and private investment is expected in the area in the next two years, he said.
 The Urban Land Institute and PricewaterhouseCoopers, in a report titled ''Emerging Trends in Real Estate 2009,'' listed Denver among 15 American cities expected to outperform the rest of the country. The report cites a good balance in housing supply and demand, a strong federal and state government presence to support jobs, continued population growth and a widely diverse economy.
 This has not always been the case here. ''A lot has changed in the past 25 years,'' said Tom Clark, the executive vice president of the Metro Denver Economic Development Corporation, an affiliate of the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Clark was an original player in the Greater Denver Corporation, which was formed to chart a course after the oil-shale boom fizzled in the early 1980s, leaving Colorado's oil and gas industry in a sinkhole. 
 A string of critical events took place, he said, after local leaders determined that the Rocky Mountain region had the potential to replace the industrial Midwest as the country's economic heartland. 
 By the early 1990s, Stapleton, Denver's ''pocket'' airport, hemmed in by urban development, had been dismantled, and the much larger Denver International had opened. The Stapleton site now consists of single- and multifamily housing, shopping areas, schools and office developments.
 A similar transformation has occurred in Lower Downtown, a former warehouse district, where major league sports venues, restaurants, stores and hotels have sprung up.
 These efforts have been augmented by the region's light-rail system, which has demonstrated that new commercial development will follow the building of transit stations, said Cal Marsella, the general manager of the Regional Transportation District. 
 After the 1980s recession, the region had a talent pool of unemployed oil and gas engineers. That helped to attract aerospace companies like Lockheed Martin and eventually the Ball Corporation. Technology companies were later persuaded to relocate here during the dot-com boom, and when that ended, entrepreneurs pushed into biotechnology and finally alternative energy. 
 Colorado's governor, Bill Ritter Jr., has pushed for investments in renewable energy to build on the presence of the Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory at Golden, Colo., about 12 miles west of downtown Denver. A broader research initiative through the newly created Colorado Renewable Energy Collaboratory, which combines statewide university researchers with those at the national laboratory, has helped create a reputation for Colorado as ''a new world leader'' in solar, wind and biofuel research, said the Collaboratory's executive director, David Hiller. 
 Such efforts have already attracted a Danish wind-turbine manufacturer, Vestas. It is building turbine blades at a plant in Windsor, Colo., 58 miles north of Denver, and has plans for two more plants that will employ hundreds.
 While new capital for commercial real estate projects remains tight -- no new office project is likely to find financing until it is 85 percent leased, Mr. Clark said -- a number of major projects in the Denver area are already under way with full financing. 
 Eric L. Nesbitt, a commercial real estate broker and president of the Denver Metro Commercial Association of Realtors, said commercial real estate continued to sell, ''though it takes a lot longer to do a deal, and it takes more attention to detail.'' 
 Like many others, Mr. Nesbitt said Denver would not be immune to economic challenges. ''We're going to suffer like the rest of the country in the coming year, without a doubt,'' he said. ''But hopefully we just won't suffer quite as long or quite as hard.''

HEADLINE: New York Store's Ads Play Funny and Rude, Like the City

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS QUENQUA

 BODY:
A LOT about New York has changed in the 37 years since Joseph and Rachelle Friedman opened J&R Music World across from City Hall in Lower Manhattan. The same could not be always said of the store's advertising. 
 J&R's TV spots, known for their bubbly exhortations to ''run, don't walk'' to its downtown location, are familiar to longtime New Yorkers, as are its newspaper circulars and ads. All are created in-house at J&R; none has ever been described as edgy. 
 But the music and electronics retailer is hoping to change that with a series of TV spots that use dark humor to remind shoppers of J&R's New York heritage -- and make no mention of three-day sales or unbelievable prices on digital cameras. The spots were created by Toy, an independent agency based in New York, representing the first time J&R has worked with an advertising agency.
 The timing of the campaign will strike some as curious. With the economy in recession and consumers on the hunt for value, even prominent national advertisers like McDonald's and Home Depot are trading high-concept branding efforts for commercials that promise big savings. 
 But the time was right for J&R to focus on its brand, Mrs. Friedman said. 
 ''We've become a big tourist destination,'' she said. ''Our bags are seen everywhere, in TV shows like 'Sex and the City' and in movies, but people aren't really aware of who we are.''
 ''So we decided to do something a little bit different, to run an ad that a big-box retailer wouldn't run,'' she said. ''We wanted to do something very New York.''
 The first of the five spots centers on an unflappable J&R salesman who coolly assists a customer despite a pair of sidewalk Santas who are seen brawling just outside the store. Another features a stockbroker who walks into J&R and stomps on his Bluetooth earpiece in frustration, then does the same to one he borrows from an employee. 
 Each of the commercials closes with the store's new tagline, ''Since 1971.''
 The Santa commercial began running before Christmas, and the others will make their debuts this month. They will run locally in New York, mostly on cable channels like MTV, ESPN, CNN and Bravo. The spots will also run in movie theaters and as ''pre-roll'' ads before videos on Web sites like CNet.com. 
 As of now, there are no plans to extend the branding effort to J&R's print ads, meaning its circulars and newspaper ads will maintain their look. Mrs. Friedman said the cost of the TV campaign was in the low seven figures. 
 While it's easy to question the wisdom of running a branding campaign based on dark humor in the middle of a painful recession, it is also easy to see why J&R feels justified in taking a victory lap. Much of its local competition -- stores like Nobody Beats the Wiz and Crazy Eddie's -- went out of business thanks to the influx of national chains like Best Buy and Circuit City (which itself recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection). 
 Stephen Baker, vice president of industry analysis at the research firm NPD Group, said J&R was wise to focus on its New York roots. ''This has been a business of survival of the fittest for the last 20 to 25 years, and we still see a pretty strong regional marketplace for electronics,'' he said. ''In general, the electronics business comes down to a handful of national players and then lots of smaller regional players.''
 Many consumers prefer to buy electronics from local retailers because there is a sense the regional companies have a better understanding of their needs, Mr. Baker said.
 ''Different products sell well in different parts of the country,'' he said. ''One area might be great for Apple products, while another may not. There is definitely an advantage to being able to understand your specific market.''
 It's just such a focus on the New York consumer that has helped J&R survive where others have failed, Mrs. Friedman said. 
 ''We made a decision very early on that we don't want to expand, we don't want to become a cookie-cutter store around the tri-state area,'' she said. ''This way we can really get to know and focus on our customers.''
 The privately owned J&R continues to occupy its original Lower Manhattan location, though it has expanded into other buildings on the block and now occupies 300,000 square feet of retail space. That is its only location, except for a small presence inside Macy's Herald Square store. 
 J&R -- which is alternately referred to in its advertising as ''J&R Music World'' and ''J&R Music and Computer World'' but is officially known simply as J&R -- also has a healthy online presence, said Mrs. Friedman, though she declined to say what percentage of the company's revenue comes from Web sales. 
 While the discounts may be gone from J&R's advertising, they are still alive and well in the store. Mrs. Friedman said that the holiday shopping season was a successful one for J&R, largely because of lower prices.
 ''I'd say sales were up a bit, but margins were down,'' she said. ''We had to run a lot of specials, and we did lower prices in many categories. People were looking for deals.''

HEADLINE: Roll Out the Barrel, Open Your Wallet

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV

 BODY:
I AM about to take your breath away. How do I know this? Because I felt as if the wind had been knocked out of me when I realized that in the middle of a deep recession I am recommending a beer that costs $35 a bottle.
 What? Am I insane? 
 Probably. It would take a rare occasion for me to pay $35 for a bottle, but I'll tell you about this extraordinary beer anyway. It is the 2006 vintage -- for a beer this expensive must have a vintage -- of the Abbaye de Saint Bon-Chien, an unfiltered, unpasteurized, limited-edition ale brewed by Brasserie des Franches-Montagnes in Switzerland. In its favor, the beer comes in a 25.4-ounce bottle, rather than the more typical 12 ounces. More important, it is superb: brown in color yet bright in the mouth, with a bracing, spicy, tart, almost woolly complexity reminiscent of a Belgian lambic. 
 About the only thing against it is the price. 
 Aside from that, what makes this beer so unusual? The Abbaye de Saint Bon-Chien is one of a growing number of beers that spend some time aging in oak barrels, which may be typical for wine and whiskey but is a rare thing indeed for beer. In a way, the brewers of these barrel-aged beers have reached backward into the future.
 Centuries ago, barrels were the only vessels in which to brew and store beers. Most brewers strove to eliminate any flavorings that wood might impart to the beers, soaking and scrubbing the wood to make the barrels as neutral as possible. In industrialized times, of course, steel and aluminum serve a brewer's purpose with far less effort and wear than wood.
 But in the last decade or so, brewers have given barrels another look. Inspired by winemakers, whiskey producers and even lambic brewers, who never stopped using barrels, these brewers see oak barrels not as storage vessels but as tools that can make beer more complex and interesting. 
 Recently the beer panel tasted 25 oak-aged beers. For the tasting, Florence Fabricant and I were joined by two guests: Richard Scholz, an owner of Bierkraft in Park Slope, Brooklyn, and Matt Stinton, the bar manager at Hearth in the East Village, which serves several different barrel-aged beers.
 We all agreed that the tasting was fascinating, with many highly refined beers and few that indulged in extravagance for the sake of extravagance. Most striking was the number of styles on display in the tasting.
 Some of the beers were dry and some were sweet. Some were black as stout and full of toasty malt flavors. Others were almost golden, with complex fruit flavors. In very few of the beers were the flavors of hops evident; the barrel aging seems to suppress their character.
 In some beers, brewers had clearly encouraged the effects of different yeasts in the barrel, which, in the style of the lambic beers, produce intense sour flavors that people love or hate. Personally, I find them fascinating. In others, the barrels were used primarily to expose the beers to minuscule amounts of oxygen, which when done carefully can add attractive toffee or sherry-like characters to the beer. In still other cases, brewers used barrels that had once contained something else, like bourbon, Scotch, Port or even pinot noir, hoping to impart to the beer trace elements of the past contents. 
 The Abbaye de Saint Bon-Chien, which was our No. 1 beer, was in fact aged in barrels that had previously been used for rum, grappa, Burgundy, cabernet sauvignon and other wines. None of these flavors were evident in the beer, or perhaps they were so well integrated that they could not be detected. In fact, in only one of the 25 beers was the taste of oak obvious, as in a bad vanilla-scented chardonnay: we rejected this bottle.
 Clearly, though, oaky flavors are occasionally the aim. A couple of beers in our tasting were aged with oak chips rather than in barrels, a practice I generally abhor in wine. One of these, the Yeti Imperial Stout from Great Divide, even made our top 10. We thought it was complex and creamy, though with less finesse than the higher-ranked beers.
 Most of these barrel-aged brews are potent, with 14 of the 25 brews at 10 percent alcohol or more. Yet the ones we liked best were not in any way overbearing or unbalanced. Our No. 2 brew, the Pozharnik Espresso Russian Imperial Stout from Pennichuck in New Hampshire, weighed in at a not exactly svelte 10 percent. While it was rich and full bodied, it was nonetheless balanced and smooth, with flavors of coffee and toffee.
 Sounding lighter notes were our No. 3 and No. 4 beers, the Petrus Aged Pale from Bavik in Belgium, a tart, refreshing golden ale at 7.3 percent, and La Roja Amber Ale from Jolly Pumpkin in Michigan, rich, robust and spicy but only 7.2 percent. The Bavik was also our best value, relatively speaking, at $3.50 for an 11.2-ounce bottle.
 So, why are these beers so expensive? Garrett Oliver, the brewmaster at the Brooklyn Brewery, cites the high cost of labor and storage for these beers, which are made by hand in small lots. What's more, barrels themselves can be very expensive. Brooklyn has just issued its own barrel-aged beer, Black Ops, which was not available in time for our tasting. It costs around $20 for a 25.4-ounce bottle.
 Obviously, these are not beers for chugging. They are specialized brews that can go beautifully with food. The tangy lambic-style beers would go well with seafood or cheeses. The richer imperial stout-style brews could be just the thing with chocolate. As for the cost, well, think of them as you would of a bottle of wine for sharing. You wouldn't mind paying $35 for a bottle of wine, would you? Don't answer that.
 Recipe: Duck Fried Rice Time: 45 minutes, plus 30 minutes' cooling
 From one barrel-aged beer to the next, bitterness, citrus and sweet fruit, coffee, tea, licorice, molasses, smoke and spice came through. The colors ran the gamut from pale gold to espresso. So what to serve with them?
 Oysters, seared steak and glazed short ribs would be safe choices with many of them. Others needed a hunk of Cheddar or a wedge of chocolate cake.
 Many of the earthy beers, those that are intensely flavored but not tilting to sweetness, would be happy matches for this fried rice dish, to serve alongside grilled meat or poultry, or even spiced fish blackened in a skillet or under the broiler. The texture of the rice will be best if it is cooked in advance and given a chance to cool thoroughly before reheating it with the other ingredients. 
 Time: 45 minutes, plus 30 minutes' cooling
 2 cups long-grain rice
 1 confit duck leg and thigh, skinned and boned
 1 tablespoon soy sauce
 Freshly ground black pepper
 2 tablespoons peanut oil
 4 ounces smoked country bacon, diced
 1 medium-size onion, finely chopped
 2 teaspoons garam masala or curry powder
 2 large eggs, lightly beaten
 Salt to taste
 4 scallions, trimmed and minced. 
 1. Place rice in a saucepan and add 3 1/4 cups cold water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to very low, cover tightly and continue cooking 12 to 15 minutes, until water has evaporated and surface of rice is pitted with little holes. Remove from heat and set aside, covered and undisturbed, 15 minutes more. Transfer rice to a bowl, fluff with chopsticks, refrigerate at least 30 minutes. 
 2. Shred duck meat, mix with soy sauce, add pepper to taste and set aside. 
 3. When rice has cooled, heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large wok or skillet. Add bacon and fry just until golden, not browned. Remove. Add onion and saute on medium until golden. Stir in garam masala. Add remaining oil, stir in eggs and quickly scramble them. Fold in duck meat with soy sauce, cooked bacon and rice. Cook on medium heat until rice is heated through and ingredients are well blended. Season with salt. 
 4. Fold in half thescallions, transfer rice to a serving dish and scatter remaining scallions on top. Serve.
 Yield: 6 servings.

HEADLINE: A Sector Holds Its Own

BYLINE: By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
Despite rising vacancies, slower sales and diminished economic prospects, the market for warehouses in northern New Jersey is still getting passable grades from real estate market analysts, especially if they grade on a curve.
 Nationally, the vacancy rate for industrial property is estimated at about 11 percent, and it has soared above 50 percent in parts of Southern California. In New Jersey, however, various market specialists pegged the statewide vacancy rate at 7 to 9 percent in late December. The market is tightest for new buildings in New Jersey's northern tier; this swath covers the whole width of the state and has Newark toward its southern edge.
 Generally, the Eastern Seaboard is faring better than the West Coast, said Jay Cornforth, who manages the eastern division of the AMB Property Corporation, a company that has recently built a number of distribution centers in New Jersey. ''The shipping lanes are starting to shift from West to East,'' he explained, ''because distributors are looking ahead a few years to when there will be an all-water route to the East Coast from Asia, after a wider, deeper Panama Canal is completed,'' which is expected in 2014. 
 In the last five years, the volume of shipping containers handled at New Jersey's ports steadily increased, but that started leveling off in late summer, according to market watchers.
 The economic slump may also have taken some wind out of the sails of the Portfields Initiative, a joint effort of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and state economic development officials begun in 2004. The initiative supports and helps to finance the restoration of polluted ''brownfields'' and underused sites in the Port District -- land within a 25-mile radius of the Statue of Liberty -- to make them usable for construction of new intermodal distribution centers, which can handle shipments that arrive by road, rail or water.
 The initiative helped to generate the new million-square-foot IPort 12 in Carteret, the AMB Portview in Elizabeth, the AMB Liberty Logistics Center in Newark and the planned AMB Pulaski Distribution Center, which is to be built on a 50-acre former landfill site in Jersey City.
 But now, concerns are starting to be raised about filling all these new facilities in the midst of a downturn. The IPort 12 was given a high-impact geometric facade, with abundant windows and cutting-edge energy-saving features, by KSS Architects and was completed last summer by its builders -- the Panattoni Development Company and PA Associates -- but it has yet to snag a tenant. 
 On the other hand, ''the market is still hanging in there over all,'' said William R. Waxman of CB Richard Ellis. He pointed to an estimated 9.4 percent industrial property vacancy rate in northern New Jersey at year's end, and noted that this was almost two points below the national rate.
 Meanwhile, Cushman & Wakefield and Colliers International estimated the North Jersey vacancy rate to be considerably lower, 5.9 and 6.4 percent, respectively. Their figures focus on Class A distribution centers -- the newest and most modern facilities -- while CB Richard Ellis's data includes older warehouses as well.
 All of the large real estate companies define northern New Jersey to be the counties of Bergen, Essex, Morris, Passaic, Sussex and Warren, and all of their calculations for the fourth quarter are still preliminary.
 Central New Jersey, meanwhile, is keeping a closer pace with the national average, with a vacancy rate of 11.4 percent, according to Mr. Waxman, and 8.5 percent, according to Cushman's figures.
 But in the central part of the state, at the 60-million-square-foot industrial area around Exit 8A of the New Jersey Turnpike, the vacancy rate -- only about 4 percent during the early part of the decade -- has climbed to about 20 percent, Mr. Waxman said. That submarket has also experienced a drop of roughly 15 percent in rental rates over the past year, he said.
 Meanwhile, average annual rents are higher in northern New Jersey than statewide, about $7 a square foot, compared with $5 to $6 in central New Jersey, according to market specialists from both CB Richard Ellis and Cushman & Wakefield.
 At the aging Exit 8A center, near Monroe Township, Fortunoff, the jewelry and home furnishings chain, evidently took advantage of tough market conditions to sign a lease for 600,000 square feet of bulk warehouse space at $3.50 a square foot, Mr. Cornforth said. But at the AMB Liberty Logistics Center, an environmentally friendly facility designed by KSS Architects that opened last month, Mimeo.com, which provides online on-demand printing for business documents and marketing materials, signed a lease for close to $9 a square foot for a 75,000-square-foot space.
 Robert C. Kossar, who heads Jones Lang LaSalle's industrial real estate division in the state, said flatly, ''There has not been a significant decline in net effective rental rates in northern New Jersey, in the Meadowlands and around the ports,'' even though the pace of leasing has dropped by about half in the last year, to 18 months. Of course, he added, incentives are being extended to those who sign new leases -- rent-free months, moving expenses or building improvements -- that don't show up in the average rent calculations.
 ''Interestingly, sale prices have also remained strong,'' added Mr. Waxman of CB Richard Ellis. ''There is still a strong demand to purchase a quality building,'' he said, giving the example of the December sale, which his company brokered, of the Liz Claiborne warehouse in North Bergen to Hudson News. 
 Currently, he said, CB Richard Ellis is working with a number of companies looking to relocate from older buildings in the outer boroughs of New York City to new structures in northern New Jersey. These include companies in the pharmaceutical, ethnic food and cosmetic industries, Mr. Waxman said.
 About 85 percent of cargo going into and out of New Jersey's ports is handled by truck, he noted. 
 ''This is why the location of distribution sites in urban areas and near population centers can significantly reduce shipping costs and help sustain the environment,'' he said. CB Richard Ellis has calculated that reducing trucking distance by 55 miles, for example, could save as much energy in a year as is needed to power a 100,000-square-foot distribution center.

HEADLINE: When a Surrogate Family Improves on the Original

BYLINE: By JENNIFER 8. LEE

 BODY:
Her father would use the same suitcases that he brought from China years earlier, when the two of them first moved to America. Tucked inside were cartons of his favorite Chinese cigarettes, the ones he chain-smoked every day, leaving an odor that Jun Chen hated to have on her clothes.
 Her father had lost his construction job in the spring, and the day work that he found waiting at Eldridge Street in Chinatown with the other unemployed men had become more and more sporadic. 
 Jun knew her father was making preparations to leave, with or without her. In the end, he would leave without her.
 He paid two months of advance rent for the single room in the fourth-floor walk-up that they shared with three other families on East Broadway. Then, one evening in September, just as Jun was beginning her senior year at Pace High School on Hester Street, her father packed the suitcases, headed to the airport, returned to China, and left Jun by herself. 
 They did not hug goodbye.
 It was a few months before her 18th birthday. Some people would have called it abandonment. Jun didn't want to return to Fuzhou, the southern coastal city in China where she was born. She had bad memories of summer visits, when she would be locked up inside the house for fear that she would be kidnapped, because people assumed that visitors from the United States were rich. 
 But well before her father left, Jun had stopped thinking of him as her father, she said. She ignored him when passing him on the streets in Chinatown, telling friends he was a neighbor who lived in her apartment. On her cellphone, when he called, his number did not show up as ''Dad'' or even ''Mr. Chen.'' Instead, his calls brought up the phrase ''duomingzuihun,'' which means ''life-stealer/spirit-chaser.'' 
 Since returning to China, he has called twice to check on her, but she kept conversation to a minimum.
 As she put it bluntly, ''My dad is jerk.'' 
 Having not finished elementary school himself, he did not really take an interest in her transformation from a 10-year-old student struggling in English as a Second Language classes to her near-perfect grades in high school. 
 He had provided her a disjointed sense of family over the years, divorcing from her mother in China and then separating from her stepmother in New York City. But Jun had found a family a few doors down from her building, at the Edgies Teen Center at the Educational Alliance, a beneficiary of UJA-Federation of New York, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. She showed up the day the center opened three years ago, after learning about it from a librarian.
 ''This is my first home; I don't call it a second home, because my family is here,'' she said. ''There are so many nights when I stay until the building closes down.''
 On a yellow sheet of paper, she drew an alternative family tree: Lily, her girlfriend; Sonia, the mom; Chino, the dad; Ami, the older sister. The last three are all staff at the center.
 It is through them that she built her personal identity. ''I wrote my college essay bout being a quarter Chinese, quarter black, quarter Dominican, and quarter Indian,'' she said. It helped her earn a full scholarship to Middlebury College in Vermont.
 The members of her Edgies family are the ones who attended her parent-teacher conferences. They are the ones who helped her apply for food stamps after her father left. They are the ones who helped her tap the Neediest Cases Fund for $1,500 to pay for rent, food and school supplies. They are the ones who bring her cooked meals.
 And they are the ones who will be in the audience when she expects to give a speech at her high school graduation in June. It is already booked on their calendar, Jun said.

HEADLINE: Ruling Could Open Door To New Trial In Enron Case

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
A federal appeals court has upheld the conviction of Jeffrey K. Skilling on charges of fraud stemming from the 2001 collapse of Enron, the company he once ran. 
 But the ruling, released on Tuesday, left open the possibility that Mr. Skilling might yet win a new trial because of what the judges called ''troubling'' indications of possible prosecutorial misconduct.
 The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit did order the trial judge to reconsider the sentence of 24 years imposed on Mr. Skilling, who was chief executive of Enron, because it said the judge misinterpreted one part of the voluntary sentencing guidelines. 
 The appeals court decision, by Judge Edward C. Prado, was critical of the trial judge, Simeon T. Lake III, for turning aside Mr. Skilling's request to move his 2006 trial out of Houston. Anger was intense in that city over the collapse of the company, which wiped out the retirement accounts of many former Enron employees and led to Congressional passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley law, which imposed new rules on corporate conduct.
 ''Given the unique circumstances of this case, the pervasive community bias against those who oversaw Enron's collapse, and the inflammatory pretrial publicity in the Houston area, Skilling was entitled to a presumption of prejudice,'' the appeals court ruled. But it said Judge Lake did an ''exemplary'' job of questioning potential jurors, and that Mr. Skilling had received a fair trial.
 The new trial request may represent Mr. Skilling's best remaining hope to avoid spending most or all of the rest of his life in prison. The ruling on sentencing held that one of the less important factors listed by the judge as justifying a longer sentence -- that his conduct had led to the collapse of a financial institution -- was not applicable. The guidelines list pension funds as financial institutions, but the court ruled the Enron retirement plans did not qualify as pension plans.
 Even with that change, the guidelines would still allow a very long sentence, and in any case the judge could decide to exceed the recommended sentence if he wished to do so, although he would have to explain why he thought that was appropriate.
 The new trial possibility stems from the failure of prosecutors to tell Mr. Skilling of a statement made to government investigators by Andrew S. Fastow, the former Enron chief financial officer who testified against Mr. Skilling. In that interview, Mr. Fastow said, according to F.B.I. interview notes, that he ''doesn't think [he] discussed list w/JS.'' The F.B.I. report, known as a Form 302, that the government provided to the defense did not mention that statement. And when the judge asked to see all the interview notes to decide whether any of them needed to be disclosed to Mr. Skilling, that page was left out.
 It is not clear what list Mr. Fastow was discussing. He testified that he discussed a list of talking points on one Enron deal with Mr. Skilling, and Mr. Skilling says that was the list being referred to. But the government said Mr. Fastow was discussing a different Enron transaction that was not part of the case against Mr. Skilling.
 ''We find the omission of this statement from the 302s troubling,'' wrote Judge Prado in a unanimous ruling by a three-judge panel. 
 But the appeals court concluded it could not consider that issue because Judge Lake never saw the interview notes and thus never decided whether they needed to be disclosed to the defense. ''Thus, there is nothing for us to review,'' the appeals court judges concluded. ''Skilling must bring this claim to the district court before we can address it.''
 To get a new trial, Mr. Skilling would have to convince the trial judge that the failure to disclose that page for the judge's review was prosecutorial misconduct. 
 In saying that Mr. Skilling was entitled to a ''presumption of prejudice,'' the judges focused on local news coverage before the trial and said Judge Lake's conclusion that the articles were largely factual was not sufficient to dismiss the request for a change of venue.

HEADLINE: Retail Chain Is Liquidating

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The discount retail chain Goody's Family Clothing will begin liquidating its stores on Friday as the retailer becomes one of the year's first victims of the worsening economy. 
 Goody's, based in Knoxville, Tenn., has 9,800 employees and 287 stores in the Midwest and South. It was uncertain what will happen to the company's workers after the liquidation. 
 Executives with the company are speaking with competitors about whether they would like to purchase some of the chain's stores.
 Goody's is owned by PGDYS Lending, which is managed by Prentice Capital Management.
 The move comes less than four months after the privately held retailer emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after closing dozens of stores, a distribution center and a corporate office.

HEADLINE: An Oil Sandstorm

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

DATELINE: OTTAWA 

 BODY:
The oil that is extracted from Canadian dirt is being portrayed as saving America from energy dependence on the unstable Middle East, or an environmental catastrophe in the making -- depending on the perspective.
 As Barack Obama prepares to take office in two weeks, the debate is no longer academic. The president-elect has promised to move forward with an ambitious program aimed at fighting climate change.
 Not all oil is alike when it comes to environmental impact, and many environmentalists single out production from the oil sands as the epitome of ''dirty oil.'' In a recent study, the RAND Corporation estimated that oil from the oil sands generates about 10 to 30 percent more greenhouse gases than conventional crude.
 Canada, in large part because of the production capacity of its oil sands, is now the largest oil supplier to the United States. But environmental groups in both countries are pushing for a slowdown or even a halt to further oil sands development, which is concentrated in northern Alberta. 
 Operators of oil sands projects and Canadian governments are eager to point to its potential to reduce America's dependence on oil from politically unstable regions. Canadian oil sands produce about 1.2 million barrels a day, or about 9 percent of the imported oil consumed in the United States. 
 Production was headed toward 3.5 million barrels a day by 2015 before the economic slowdown; with the vast reserves available, Canadian oil sands have the potential to produce the equivalent of 1.7 trillion barrels of oil.
 The oil sands companies, however, have been scaling back as falling oil prices and the general market turmoil create a significant economic challenge for the projects. The entire process adds up to the world's most capital-intensive method for extracting oil. A tiny example: each of the tires on the cartoonishly oversize dump trucks used in oil sands mining costs about $60,000.
 While no one is about to park their giant dump trucks, several companies have recently announced delays in future oil sands investments. In November, a consortium led by Petro-Canada said it would temporarily stop 23.8 billion Canadian dollars ($19.5 billion) worth of expansions to its oil sands operations in Alberta. 
 ''We're not in megaproject mode anymore,'' Steve W. Laut, the president and chief executive of Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., said to analysts after cutting his company's capital spending plans in half.
 And as Washington prepares to deal with climate change, environmentalists, who generally prefer to use the deposits' traditional name of tar sands, are already pressing for restrictions on the projects.
 ''It's one of the most destructive projects on earth,'' said Susan Casey-Lefkowitz, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington. ''It would be strongly resisted in the United States to exempt the tar sands from any climate agreement.''
 Transforming the tar, more properly known as bitumen, which is mixed with sand, into petroleum is energy intensive and creates significant carbon emissions. Steam created by burning natural gas separates the semisolid bitumen. Then, more natural gas is needed to turn the bitumen into synthetic crude, which can be processed by refineries.
 The development of oil sands projects has created North America's greatest boomtown in recent years, Fort McMurray, Alberta. Its outsize economic importance has prompted Canada's Conservative government, led by Prime Minister Stephen Harper, to champion the industry. 
 After the November election in the United States, Mr. Harper said he would seek to devise a continental climate change pact with the Obama administration. Mr. Harper suggested that any such agreement would include an apparent escape hatch for the oil sands because, he argued, of the energy security benefits they offer the United States. 
 Since then, however, Mr. Harper avoided an early defeat of his government, which does not control a majority of seats in the House of Commons, by shutting Parliament. Even if the Obama administration is willing to hold talks with Canada, Mr. Harper's grip on power is now uncertain.
 Recent environmental assessments, including the RAND study, also do not further the cause of the oil sands industry. While climate change is the current focus, it is not the only environmental issue surrounding the projects. 
 Spent water used in oil sands projects is placed in lake-size tailings ponds, one of which killed about 500 migrating birds in April. Seepage from the ponds is polluting rivers in northern Canada, some scientists argue. In December, Environmental Defence, an environmental lobby group based in Toronto, estimated that about four billion liters of contaminated water leaked from the ponds each year. (The Alberta government and the oil industry dispute that finding.)
 Strip mining of the oil sands, the most common method of extraction, has destroyed large swaths of boreal forest, an important habitat for migratory birds and other wildlife. In December, a study published by the Natural Resources Defense Council and two other groups found that six million to 166 million birds could be lost over the next 30 to 50 years because of that disruption.
 Producers say they are making efforts to address environmental concerns. Mr. Laut's company, which recently completed a 110,000-barrel-a-day oil sands project, is developing systems to capture and store much of the carbon dioxide it emits. It has applied for government grants to test a system that will trap some of its carbon dioxide output by bubbling the exhaust gases from an upgrading plant through the spent water from a strip mine's steam.
 Large-scale programs to capture and store carbon dioxide are not yet in place. The demonstration project of Canadian Natural Resources, for example, is not scheduled to begin until 2010.
 With oil prices around $49 a barrel, profitability is fast eroding at oil sands projects and may already be vanishing at some operations. Producers have widely differing cost structures and varying definitions of profitability. But Andrew J. Leach, a professor of environmental economics at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, estimates that long-established plants can operate with prices as low as $30 a barrel. But he said newer operations need $60 to $70 a barrel for acceptable returns, and no one will proceed with proposed projects until prices return to the $80 to $90 range. 
 Exactly how Canada could participate in the shaping of an American strategy for climate change is unclear.
 Mr. Harper, who is from Alberta, initially dismissed concerns about climate change. After taking power in 2006, he abandoned commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions made by the previous Liberal government when it signed the Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
 Instead, Mr. Harper's government has promised a 20 percent reduction in Canada's greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. What is more significant, however, is that the proposal wants to use as a baseline 2006 -- a year with more pollution -- rather than the Kyoto standard of 1990.
 In addition, the new plan requires companies, including oil sands operators, only to reduce the rate at which they emit greenhouse gases. If they achieve those efficiencies, they will still be allowed to raise their total emissions through increased production.
 Even if Canadian producers dislike American climate change policies, they will be hard-pressed to sell their oil elsewhere. Canada's pipeline network takes oil sands production south and offers no routes to ports for export to other countries.
 But some people are optimistic about the prospect of a two-nation climate pact. 
 ''It would be a big mistake for Congress to impose restrictions on the oil sands,'' said Paul Cellucci, a former governor of Massachusetts and former United States ambassador to Canada who now works on energy issues for the law firm McCarter & English, in Boston. ''That would not be good for the United States.''

HEADLINE: Hardball Economics: The Yankees introduced the latest piece to their winter spending spree: Mark Teixeira, their $180 million man.

BYLINE: By TYLER KEPNER

 BODY:
As the Yankees plowed money into pitching early this winter, General Manager Brian Cashman could not shake the Mark Teixeira highlights embedded in his brain.
There was the four-hit night for the Texas Rangers at Yankee Stadium in 2006, when Teixeira crunched Jorge Posada in a collision at the plate. There was the grand slam for the Los Angeles Angels in the Bronx last August, a hit that Cashman predicted as soon as Teixeira got ahead in the count. And there were the many diving grabs at first base, where doubles died in Teixeira's Gold Glove.
The Yankees formally introduced Teixeira on Tuesday with a news conference at the old Yankee Stadium. Teixeira had been there as a fan when he was 8 or 9 years old, and he idolized Don Mattingly while growing up in Severna Park, Md. After signing for $180 million to play Mattingly's old position for the next eight years, Teixeira knows he is a big part of the Yankees' changing face. 
''I look at myself as a leader,'' Teixeira said. ''First and foremost, I try to do things the right way on the field, and I think you can carry that over to the locker room and earn the respect of your teammates. I've always thought that a team has a few leaders that they look up to, and I've always wanted to be that guy.''
Those qualities came across to Cashman at his own introduction to Teixeira on Dec. 4 at a hotel in Washington. Cashman had taken a train there to meet Teixeira and his agent, Scott Boras, and he spent the day compiling a scouting report to supplement the raw highlights.
They talked about family, routines, influential coaches and Teixeira's assessment of the Yankees. The hours seemed to fly by, said Cashman, who marveled at the lessons Teixeira had absorbed from former teammates like Chipper Jones.
''I was fascinated by that,'' Cashman said. ''He does not seem to be the type that is just talented. He knows what works for him and what may not.''
For years, Boras has succeeded by essentially getting a top club official to fall in love with his client, applying a personal touch to well-known statistics. This case was no different.
The Angels, the Boston Red Sox and Teixeira's hometown teams, the Baltimore Orioles and the Washington Nationals, were also interested. But after the meeting, Cashman had a fuller picture of Teixeira as serious-minded without personal baggage, humble yet sure of himself and hungry for a championship.
Sometime after the meeting -- Cashman was not sure when -- the Yankees made a six- or seven-year offer for $20 million per season that Boras did not accept. The Yankees pulled the offer, and Cashman was unable to convince his boss, Hal Steinbrenner, that Teixeira was worth a longer contract than C. C. Sabathia, who signed for seven years and $161 million.
But Cashman was trying, and he let Boras know that. With the Red Sox unwilling to guarantee $180 million for eight years -- or $176 million for eight, and two options that could have brought the total to $220 million over 10 years -- the Yankees had a chance.
Teixeira said he decided on Dec. 12, in a dinner conversation with his wife, to make the Yankees his first choice if all offers were equal. Yet as late as 11 a.m. on Dec. 23, the Yankees had not made another offer. Boras wanted an answer by 1 p.m. that day, and Cashman said he expected the Red Sox to make the winning bid.
Fearful of that possibility, Steinbrenner finally authorized the magic numbers Teixeira and Boras wanted: eight years for $22.5 million per season.
''A big part of Mark Teixeira -- and I told Scott Boras this -- is we're not just investing in the present, we're investing in the future, in the long term,'' Steinbrenner said. ''It came down to the point we knew Mark needed to make a decision, and it all happened in a hurry.''
Like that, Teixeira acknowledged, the Red Sox were out. They had seemed to be leading the pursuit -- even when they failed to make a deal after a Dec. 18 meeting with Teixeira in Dallas -- but the Yankees' late move made the difference.
''When their offer wasn't with the Yankees','' Teixeira said, referring to the Red Sox, ''and it just didn't look like they were going to continue to better their offer, and the Yankees came in and did what they did, it was an easy decision.''
The Yankees expect to have a lower payroll next season than last year's $209 million, but their winter splurge has bothered other teams. Executives of the Milwaukee Brewers, the Houston Astros and the Pittsburgh Pirates have publicly endorsed a salary cap, but Steinbrenner dismissed such talk.
''This organization does a lot for this industry as a whole, between the merchandise we sell and the tickets we sell and the millions of dollars in revenue sharing we contribute,'' he said. ''If some of the owners are upset that we're trying to invest in the team -- which we do for the fans, and only for the fans -- I'm not going to lose any sleep over it.''
In Teixeira, the Yankees add a player with five consecutive seasons of at least 30 home runs and 100 runs batted in, an active streak matched by only Alex Rodriguez and Albert Pujols. Teixeira has hit .300 with a .400 on-base percentage in each of the last two seasons and has two Gold Gloves.
With the additions of Teixeira, Sabathia and A. J. Burnett, the Yankees seem poised to recover quickly from their third-place finish in the American League East last season. Cashman acknowledged that the emergence of the Tampa Bay Rays had spurred him to bolster the roster -- and, of course, there are always the Red Sox.
For all his optimism Tuesday, Cashman could easily remember a parallel: February 2004, when the Yankees snagged Rodriguez after the Red Sox lost their chance. The Yankees expected to wrest the advantage in their rivalry with that move, but the reverse happened.
''You can't get caught up in that,'' Cashman said. ''People thought that way about Alex, and they've won two championships since. Winning the winter means squat.''

HEADLINE: Drop in Private Parties Hurts Restaurants

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT

 BODY:
BY the first week of November, Joe Bastianich and his partners at Del Posto in the meatpacking district knew how disappointing 2008 would be. On Nov. 4 and 5, more than $1 million in private parties for the holiday season were canceled at the restaurant. 
 ''It started out as a very good year,'' said Mr. Bastianich, who estimated that private parties account for about 37 percent of the restaurant's revenues. But it ended with little improvement over the previous year. 
 Many diners around the city these days know that empty tables signal a restaurant in distress. But many restaurateurs, like Mr. Bastianich, worry about empty seats that few customers ever see -- the ones in private party rooms.
 In the last few opulent years, these rooms -- where career achievements or a company's lavish profits were celebrated -- have become standard at many new restaurants. (Of the 2,352 New York restaurants listed on Zagat.com, about one-third have them.) They are often more profitable than the public dining areas, and have been an increasingly important source of income for restaurants. 
 ''It's always the icing on the cake, the cushion at the end of the year,'' said Philippe Massoud, the chef and owner of Ilili, a lavish Lebanese restaurant in the Flatiron district, where parties account for about 20 percent of his business. 
 But with little to celebrate toward the end of last year, many companies canceled parties, postponed them, or shifted from elaborate dinners to just cocktails or lunch. In general, no frills has become the rule. Not only have restaurants felt the pain, but they enter what is expected to be a more difficult new year with less to soften the blows.
 At the restaurant City Hall in TriBeCa, where lower-level rooms can hold more than 200 guests, Henry Meer, the chef and owner, estimated that nearly one-third of his bottom line comes from private parties. Though this year the restaurant did better over all than last year, in December the income from private events was off by about 30 percent compared with December 2007, he said. 
 Peter Glazier, a partner in the Glazier Group, said the company lost a $47,000 Lehman Brothers party in December at Michael Jordan's the Steakhouse NYC and a $65,000 A.I.G. event planned for Bridgewaters, their catering site in the South Street Seaport. 
 ''We let some companies postpone their events because we believe that maintaining relationships is important, but we lost nine parties altogether,'' he said. 
 Harry Poulakakos, an owner of Bayard's in India House on Hanover Square in the financial district, said holiday party business there was down by about $100,000, with A.I.G., Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch canceling affairs. 
 Paul Bolles-Beaven, a partner in Union Square Hospitality Group, with the Modern, Eleven Madison Park, Gramercy Tavern and Tabla fitted with party spaces, said that besides providing revenue, parties introduce potential new customers to a restaurant.
 And rather than the 10 percent profit that many restaurateurs have come to expect from a normal dinner check, private parties, particularly at the end of the year, can bring in 20 to 30 percent, Mr. Meer said. For the holiday season, restaurants often increase their prices for private parties. City Hall has a $9,000 minimum in December for parties of any size. It drops to $2,000 to $3,500 the rest of the year. But Mr. Meer's Delmonico steak is $42 in the dining room year-round.
 Some companies, though, are trying to take advantage of the economic crisis. ''They're trying to make deals at $75 a head instead of $90 even when they are not having financial problems, so we have to be flexible or we'll lose them,'' Mr. Meer said. Across the board, party-givers are choosing cheaper wines. 
 ''I saw it coming, and rather than lose the business or negotiate, I would immediately cut a $100-per-person private dinner to $80,'' Mr. Massoud said.
 There have also been occasional clever solutions that saved the day. At Rock Center Cafe in Midtown, four companies did not cancel the parties they had booked. But instead of inviting their employees, they joined forces and invited charitable organizations to hold holiday parties for their beneficiaries. The restaurant didn't lose money and the companies benefited from a year-end tax deduction.
 Daniel Boulud, the chef and owner of Daniel on the Upper East Side, said that in January, when he expects party business to nose-dive, he plans to use the restaurant's Bellecour Room for special events like a series of beer tasting dinners. 
 Nick Valenti, the chief executive officer of Patina Restaurant Group, which owns Rock Center Cafe, among others, said that wine and beer dinners, which are often held in private rooms, are a bonus. ''They sell out as fast as you can set them up,'' he said. And customers wind up paying more than they would spend just on dinner. 
 Though many companies canceled, postponed or downsized their parties this year, social events like weddings and other celebrations that book private rooms in restaurants have been as strong as ever. And for that segment, 2009 looks no different. 
 Nonetheless, restaurant owners are doing everything they can to stay afloat in an environment where customers are selecting $60 bottles of wine instead of $100 bottles, and spending $10 to $20 less by sharing appetizers or entrees and not ordering side dishes or desserts. So if the number of diners is holding up, the check average will be down. Many restaurants, especially the hot newcomers like Scarpetta and Corton, are still busy. High-end restaurants, including Jean Georges, Le Bernardin and Daniel, seem to have held their ground. But all are heading into what are traditionally the worst months, even in a good year. 
 ''January is frightening,'' Mr. Valenti said. 
 The closest a restaurant can come to a retail door-buster to drum up business is the early-bird special, dinner before prime time. In January, at Daniel for the first time, it will be $98 including wine (compared with $105 without wine) for reservations from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m. At Cru in Greenwich Village, people who reserve for dinner by 6:30 p.m. can order from a $49 menu. But unlike stores that sell cashmeres and handbags, restaurants do not advertise 75 percent discounts to attract customers.
 One factor that has been working in restaurateurs' favor is the real estate market. Landlords are becoming more willing to negotiate. 
 ''There's been a shift of power, especially since October, and real estate has become a buyer's market,'' said Leslie Siben of JDF Realty, which specializes in restaurants. ''With tens of thousands of retail tenants going out of business, restaurants are looking better and better, and every landlord wants to bargain.''
 Rick Camac, who is a partner in several restaurants below 14th Street, including Fatty Crab, said he is working on concessions for all his places. 
 ''I have a lease with three years to go for one of them but I'm negotiating a 10-year extension now, to lock in a better rent,'' he said. ''And the landlord knows that if I don't get it, I have my choice of other locations. Right nearby. There is a ridiculous number of spaces available. There are opportunities out there.''
