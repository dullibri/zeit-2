HEADLINE: A Quest to Learn What Drives Consumer Decisions

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
AS Madison Avenue focuses more intently on trying to influence consumer behavior, one of the world's largest agencies is starting a unit that will tap into research from academics in the field as well as the work of its own employees.
 Draftfcb, owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies, is opening what it is calling the Institute of Decision Making, devoted to finding out more about the instinctual ways that consumers behave along with the rational and emotional ones. The unit will concentrate on emerging fields like behavioral economics and neuroscience. 
 The institute is getting its own leader from inside Draftfcb, which works for advertisers like Del Monte Foods, S.C. Johnson, Kmart and MillerCoors . Matthew Willcox, director for strategic planning for the Draftfcb operations in San Francisco, will also serve as the director of the unit.
 The institute has formed ties with assistant professors of marketing and psychology at Stanford and the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.
 Determining how much Draftfcb is spending to start the unit is difficult, because Mr. Willcox and the five or six other employees working there are continuing at their regular jobs. Still, executives of the agency say it represents a serious commitment to developing additional methods to help marketers understand consumers who are growing increasingly skeptical of -- and resistant to -- traditional advertising.
 ''The last two or three years, agencies have cut back'' because of the economy, said Michael Fassnacht, global chief strategic officer at Draftfcb, but ''we need to create intellectual property.''
 ''Our clients are getting involved in this,'' he added, referring to the study of instinctual behavior, ''and we need to have an expertise, a point of view.''
 The goal, Mr. Fassnacht said, laughing, is ''to make strategy sexy.''
 ''Understanding the foundation of consumers' behavior decisions has become more complex,'' he added, as they ''consume more information and make decisions faster'' than before.
 And the Internet enables consumers to be ''in shopping and decision mode at the same time, 24/7,'' Mr. Fassnacht said, which further complicates efforts to decipher their decision-making. 
 ''When we merged four years ago,'' he added, referring to the decision by Interpublic to combine Draft Worldwide with Foote Cone & Belding, ''we invested a lot in data analytics. This is the next step.''
 The institute will be particularly interested in exploring how consumers choose among competing brands or products as choices in stores and showrooms or on Web sites.
 ''Choice is becoming more complicated and can be a bad experience for people,'' Mr. Willcox said. 
 ''Maybe brands are not as powerful in driving choices as they were,'' he added, in which case agencies need to scrutinize ''the levers of decision-making,'' particularly the instinctual ones that are ''a little more about our reflexes.''
 The unit has already assisted Draftfcb in landing new business, Mr. Willcox said, in the form of a project in California to study how to better present information about energy to residents so they would be encouraged to reduce energy usage.
 Existing clients also seem interested in the plans of the institute.
 With a campaign created by Draftfcb that carries the theme ''Wear the pants,'' ''we've definitely connected with people on an emotional level,'' said Jennifer Sey, global vice president of marketing for Dockers at Levi Strauss & Company in San Francisco.
 But because ''we all respond to things and make decisions in ways we're not aware of,'' she added, whatever the institute learns about ''the instinctive responses consumers have could help us work out how we can better understand consumers and connect with them.''
 Some eyebrows may be raised by the unit's underwriting and support of research by the professors in the form of fees.
 ''Certainly, it's a continuous ethical question,'' said one of them, Sam McClure, an assistant professor in the Stanford psychology department, but ''I'm not consulting on specific advertising campaigns.''
 As for those who disdain the use of science to help out selling, Mr. McClure said: ''You can get people to do something once, but we're pretty smart animals. We know if something is satisfying our goals.''

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Tumbles More Than Expected After 3 Months of Increases

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Americans, worried about jobs and the sluggish economic recovery, are having a relapse in confidence, causing a widely watched index to tumble in June and raising concerns about consumer spending in the months ahead.
 The Conference Board, a private research group based in New York, said Tuesday that its Consumer Confidence Index dropped almost 10 points, to 52.9 from the revised 62.7 in May. 
 Economists surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected the reading to dip slightly to 62.8 points from the 63.3 points that was reported last month, before the revision. 
 June's reading was the biggest drop since February, when the index fell 10 points. The index had risen for three consecutive months since then.
 Both components of the index -- one that measures how consumers feel now about the economy and another that assesses their outlook over the next six months -- declined. The Present Situation Index decreased to 25.5 in June from 29.8 in May. The Expectations Index declined to 71.2 from 84.6.
 ''Increasing uncertainty and apprehension about the future state of the economy and labor market, no doubt a result of the recent slowdown in job growth, are the primary reasons for the sharp reversal in confidence,'' said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board Consumer Research Center, in a statement. ''Until the pace of job growth picks up, consumer confidence is not likely to pick up.''
 The index had been recovering fitfully since hitting a record low of 25.3 in February 2009. Still, the reading was far below what is considered healthy. A reading above 90 indicates the economy is on solid footing; above 100 signals strong growth.
 Economists watch the number closely because consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of the nation's economic activity.
 Economists already thought confidence would remain weak for at least another year because of stubbornly high unemployment. But economic data, including disappointing job figures in May and dismal housing numbers, are increasing worries that the road to recovery could be rockier than anticipated. Amid such concerns, the Dow Jones industrial average has fallen 9.5 percent since late April.
 ''We're concerned about the strength of the economic recovery from here,'' said Richard D. Hastings, macro and consumer strategist with Global Hunter Securities.
 A crucial housing index released Friday showed that home prices in April rose for the first time in seven months as government tax credits bolstered the housing market. But the rebound may be short-lived now that the incentives have expired. The Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller 20-city home price index released Tuesday posted an 0.8 percent gain. It had fallen in each of the last six months.
 Over all, however, housing data released last week signaled a renewed housing slump that may threaten the broader economy. The Commerce Department reported n Wednesday that sales of new homes collapsed in May, sinking 33 percent to the lowest level on record as potential buyers stopped shopping for a home as government tax credits expired. That came a day after a report showed that sales of previously owned homes fell unexpectedly in May.
 The Commerce Department announced Monday that Americans spent a little more in May but not enough to accelerate the economic recovery. Consumer spending rose 0.2 percent last month after no change in April. But personal income was up 0.4 percent, indicating that consumers are still wary and choosing to save money.
 A crucial issue is jobs. The Labor Department is expected to report on Friday that employers eliminated 110,000 jobs in June, and the jobless rate is expected to increase to 9.8 percent from 9.7 percent in May, according to economists surveyed by Thomson Reuters. A bleak report in May showed that employers added 431,000 jobs but that the vast majority were temporary Census positions.
 Retailers had a surprisingly solid start to the year as consumers felt better as their stock portfolios rose, but since April, business has slowed. Mr. Hastings believes that the sluggishness continued into June. He says sweltering heat in this last month wilted sales of summer fashions as consumers stuck to buying the basics like shorts and tank tops to keep cool. He also cited a slowdown in revenue in big-ticket items.
 The Conference Board survey is based on a random sample of 5,000 households contacted from June 1 to June 22.
 The survey showed that consumers' assessment of the labor market was less than favorable. Those claiming jobs are ''hard to get'' increased to 44.8 percent from 43.9 percent, while those saying jobs are ''plentiful'' decreased to 4.3 percent from 4.6 percent.
 Consumers polled were also much less optimistic about future job prospects.

HEADLINE: Stocks Slide as Weak Reports Pile Up

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; David Jolly contributed reporting.

 BODY:
This looks like a long, hot summer for Wall Street.
 Fears that the global economy will worsen gripped the financial markets again Tuesday. Downbeat economic news that investors might have shrugged off in calmer times sent the broad stock market tumbling to its lowest level this year. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index sank 3.1 percent. Amid the sell-off, anxious investors fled for traditional havens like United States Treasury securities. 
 But it was really just another bad day in a bad month, a bad quarter, a bad year. With 2010 now almost half over, stock investors are glumly tallying their losses -- and wondering when this pain will stop. Tuesday's swoon left the S.& P. 500 down nearly 7 percent this year. 
 Given that showing, some analysts are writing off 2010 as a lost year. The stock market is mired in a deepening correction -- a sort of mini-bear market typically characterized by a 10 percent decline over a short period. The question on everyone's mind is whether this correction will grow into a full-blown bear market. Since late April, when the market reached its high for the year, the S.& P. 500 has lost 14.5 percent. A 20 percent decline would signal a bear market is here. 
 The immediate catalyst for Tuesday's slide was running concern that the hot Chinese economy might go cold. Glum news about American consumers added to the unease. 
 But investors have plenty of other things to worry about, too, perhaps none more pressing than the fragile state of the economy in the United States and the simmering financial crisis in Europe. This year has already been full of surprises. The economic collapse in Greece, the battles over financial regulation in Washington, the harrowing ''flash crash,'' the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico -- all of this has frayed the nerves of Wall Street professionals and workaday investors alike. 
 The exuberance of 2009 -- when a remarkable 23 percent rally seemed to bind up some of the wounds from the financial crisis -- has long since faded. It has been replaced by a sense of economic uncertainty that many cannot quite seem to shake. In this atmosphere, just about the only thing the experts agree on is that this roller-coaster ride isn't over yet. 
 ''We have come through one of the worst downturns in most peoples' investment lifetimes,'' said Stephen F. Auth, chief investment officer at Federated Investors. ''The market and the economy both pretty much crashed, and that was a searing experience for most people. So I think investor sentiment and psychology is very fragile.''
 There have been few places to hide in the markets lately. Stocks, bonds and commodities are making big moves. A decline in Asia, as happened on Tuesday, quickly spills over to Europe and then the United States. 
 Peter Cardillo, the chief market economist for Avalon Partners, said the storm clouds that began to gather in the first quarter built into a thunderhead in the last few months. ''Sovereign debt was present before the second quarter but the climax of it, the depth of it, actually exploded in the second quarter,'' he said. ''We did have a very dramatic market during the second quarter.''
 According to Howard Silverblatt, the senior index analyst for Standard & Poor's, as the broad stock market has declined, six S.& P. stock indexes that track particular sectors of the market have fallen 15 to 19 percent -- nearly bear market territory. ''So the question is: if new money doesn't come in for bargains, should we set a place for the Bear at the Fourth of July barbecue?'' Mr. Silverblatt wrote in a statement.
 On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average ended down 268.22 points, or 2.65 percent, at 9,870.30. The S.& P. 500 fell 33.33 points, or 3.10 percent, to 1,041.24, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 85.47 points, or 3.85 percent, to 2, 135.18.
 Earlier Tuesday, the Conference Board reported that its consumer confidence index this month fell to 52.9, a decline of nearly 10 points. And the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller index of home prices posted just a slight rise in April, providing no signs of a sustained housing recovery. 
 All 30 of the stocks in the Dow industrials were lower. Boeing fell $4.26, or 6 percent, to $63.04 a share. Caterpillar was down $3.55, also 6 percent, at $60.85. Microsoft fell 99 cents, or 4 percent, to $23.32. 
 BP, whose shares have fallen more than 50 percent since the April 20 explosion of its Deepwater Horizon rig, actually bucked the trend. Its stock rose 2 percent.
 With stocks in distress, investors rushed to the relative safety of bonds. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.95 percent, from 3.02 percent late Monday. It was the first time since April 2009 that yields had fallen below 3 percent. The price rose 19/32, to 104 22/32.
 ''I think it all goes back to this deflation trend that seems to be taking place,'' said Tom di Galoma, the United States head of fixed-income rates trading at Guggenheim Partners. ''The economic slowdown has created this deflationary environment and they don't see how to get out of it,'' he said, referring to investors.
 The economic uncertainty pushed oil lower. The spot price for crude oil dropped $2.31, to $75.94 a barrel. Gold rose, with spot prices gaining $1.70, to $1,240.65.
 Some analysts pinned their hopes for improvement on the coming corporate earnings season, or at least some prospect for economic growth in the second half of the year. 
 Sam Stovall, the chief investment strategist for Standard & Poor's Equity Research, said investors were worried by financial reform and the environmental impact of the gulf spill, among other troubles. Hanging over all of this is the risk, however remote, that the American economy will stall again in a double-dip recession. 
 ''What people are now worried about is whether this correction will morph into a bear market,'' Mr. Stovall said. ''If history is any guide it doesn't look all that great.''

HEADLINE: The Real Palestinian Revolution

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Pssssst. I've got a stock tip. Ready? The Al-Quds Index.
 What's that? It's the P.S.E., or Palestine Securities Exchange. Based in Nablus, in the West Bank, the Al-Quds Index has actually been having a solid year -- and therein lies a tale.
 ''It has outperformed the stock exchanges of most Arab countries,'' said Samir Hulileh, the C.E.O. of Palestine Development and Investment, which owns the exchange. The P.S.E. was established in 1996 with 19 companies and now has 41 -- and 8 more will join this year. The companies listed there include the Commercial Bank of Palestine, Nablus Surgical Center, Palestine Electric Company and Arab Palestinian Shopping Centers. ''Most are underpriced because of the political risk component,'' said Hulileh. So if you don't mind a little volatility, there is a lot of potential upside here. Indeed, there will soon be an E.T.F. -- an exchange-traded fund -- that tracks the Al-Quds Index so you can sit in America and go long or short peace in Palestine. 
 The expansion of the Al-Quds Index is part of a broader set of changes initiated in the West Bank in the last few years under the leadership of Prime Minister Salam Fayyad, the former World Bank economist who has unleashed a real Palestinian ''revolution.'' It is a revolution based on building Palestinian capacity and institutions not just resisting Israeli occupation, on the theory that if the Palestinians can build a real economy, a professional security force and an effective, transparent government bureaucracy it will eventually become impossible for Israel to deny the Palestinians a state in the West Bank and Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem.
 ''I have to admit, we, the private sector, have changed,'' said Hulileh. ''The mood used to be all the time to complain and say there is nothing we can do. And then the politicians were trying to create this atmosphere of resistance -- resistance meant no development under occupation.''
 Fayyad and his boss, President Mahmoud Abbas, changed that. Now the mood, said Hulileh, is that improving the Palestinian economy ''is what will enable you to resist and be steadfast. Fayyad said to us: 'You, the business community, are not responsible for ending occupation. You are responsible for employing people and getting ready for the state. And that means you have to be part of the global world, to export and import, so when the state will come you will not have a garbage yard. You will be ready.' ''
 Meeting in his Ramallah office two weeks ago, I found Fayyad upbeat. The economist-turned-politician seems more comfortable mixing with his constituents in the West Bank, where he has quietly built his popularity by delivering water wells, new schools -- so there are no more double shifts -- and a waste-water treatment facility. The most senior Israeli military people told me the new security force that Fayyad has built is the real deal -- real enough that Israel has taken down most of the checkpoints inside the West Bank. So internal commerce and investment are starting to flow, and even some Gazans are moving there. ''We may not be too far from a point of inflection,'' Fayyad said to me.
 The Abbas-Fayyad state-building effort is still fragile, and it rests on a small team of technocrats, Palestinian business elites and a new professional security force. The stronger this team grows, the more it challenges and will be challenged by some of the old-line Fatah Palestinian cadres in the West Bank, not to mention Hamas in Gaza. It is the only hope left, though, for a two-state solution, so it needs to be quietly supported.
 The most important thing President Obama can do when he meets Israel's prime minister, Bibi Netanyahu, on July 6 is to nudge him to begin gradually ceding control of major West Bank Palestinian cities to the Palestinian Authority so that Fayyad can show his people, as he puts it, that what he is building is an independent state ''not an exercise in adapting to the permanence of occupation'' -- and so that Israel can test if the new Palestinian security forces really can keep the peace without Israel making nighttime raids. Nothing would strengthen Fayyadism more than that.
 I am struck, though, at how much Fayyadism makes some Arabs and Israelis uncomfortable. For those Arabs who have fallen in love with the idea of Palestinians as permanent victims, forever engaged in a heroic ''armed struggle'' to recover Palestine and Arab dignity, Fayyad's methodical state-building is inauthentic. Some Arabs -- shamefully -- dump on it, and only the United Arab Emirates has offered real financial help. 
 And for Israelis on the right, particularly West Bank settlers, who love the notion that there are no responsible Palestinians to talk to so the status quo will never change, Fayyadism is a real threat. Akiva Eldar, a columnist for the Israeli daily Haaretz, described this group perfectly the other day when he wrote how they ''won't relinquish the Arabs' 'no's. Or, as the poet Constantine Cavafy wrote in 'Waiting for the Barbarians' ... : 'And now, what's going to happen to us without barbarians? / They were, those people, a kind of solution.' ''

HEADLINE: $1.4 Billion Development at Sugar Refinery in Brooklyn Wins Key Council Support

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The $1.4 billion plan to transform the former Domino Sugar refinery into a residential development on the Brooklyn waterfront won critical support in the City Council on Tuesday, after the developer agreed to cut the size of the project's two tallest towers and provide a shuttle bus to the nearest subway.
 The New Domino project, on the East River in Williamsburg, had divided a once-working-class neighborhood in desperate need of housing for longtime residents but overwhelmed by a wave of new luxury towers during the recent real estate boom. 
 The developer, the Community Preservation Corporation, has promised that 660 of the 2,200 apartments at the 11-acre Domino site will be for poor and working-class New Yorkers. The corporation is also preserving Domino's refinery building and its 40-foot tall sign, while providing a public esplanade, shops and office and community space.
 ''This is a way of turning a dead industrial site into a vibrant, mixed-use and mixed-income community that can be a model for redevelopment,'' said Michael Lappin, president of the Community Preservation Corporation, which owns the site.
 During last-minute negotiations, the developer agreed to reduce two planned 40-story towers to 34 floors. The lost space from those floors will be added to other buildings on the site. The corporation also agreed that construction, building service and eventual supermarket workers at the New Domino would be paid prevailing wages.
 As a result, the Council's land use committee and a subcommittee on zoning voted unanimously to approve the project. The vote is regarded as the last political hurdle for New Domino project, although the project must still go back to the City Planning Commission and the full Council for final approval next month.
 Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, labored behind the scenes to work out a compromise with the developer and the project's chief critics, who include Councilman Stephen Levin of Brooklyn and his mentor, Vito J. Lopez, the Brooklyn assemblyman who often plays a pivotal role in city and state housing developments. Mr. Lopez had demanded that the developer reduce both the height of the buildings and the total number of apartments, while increasing the number of subsidized units.
 But Diana Reyna, a Brooklyn councilwoman who worked with the Community Preservation Corporation and is a political adversary of Mr. Lopez, feared that reducing the number of units would undermine the financial health of the project, in a neighborhood where 51 residential buildings under construction are already at a standstill because of the recession. Already, she said, the corporation had promised that 30 percent of the units would be affordable when most other rental housing developers were including only 20 percent.
 In the end, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg urged Mr. Lopez to come around.
 Mr. Levin issued his own press release on Tuesday taking credit for the deal. He said he was pleased with the outcome and looked forward to working with the developer ''to ensure that all the community's needs are addressed as the project is built and inhabited.''
 Separately, Ms. Reyna said the New Domino was ''a true reflection of a collaborative process with the community.''
 Rob Solano, executive director of Churches United for Fair Housing, added: ''The true winners of this campaign are the families who will be receiving affordable housing.''

CORRECTION-DATE: July 1, 2010

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday about the transformation of the former Domino Sugar refinery in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, into a residential development misstated the number of the 2,200 apartments that will be for the poor and working class. It is 660, not 600. The article also misstated a detail of a last-minute deal with the developer. It agreed to reduce the two planned 40-story towers to 34 floors, not 36. (Two other towers in the project will be 30 stories each.)

HEADLINE: When Is a Free Meal Just Part of the Job?

BYLINE: By JULIA MOSKIN

 BODY:
BY all accounts, the wedding of the food writer Josh Ozersky and Danit Lidor on May 23 in Manhattan was an eater's idyll. 
 There were clouds above the Empire Hotel's rooftop bar, and breezes ruffled the water in the swimming pool. More than 100 guests used bread from Jim Lahey's Sullivan Street Bakery to scoop up dips made by the Turkish chef Orhan Yegen; the noted seafood chef Ed Brown sauteed fresh scallops himself; the lasagna was produced by Michael White, the chef of Marea, Alto and Convivio.
 The best man was Mark Pastore, chief operating officer of the Pat LaFrieda meat company, which supplied dry-aged strip loins from Creekstone Farms. Jeffrey Chodorow, part owner of the bar and of high-gloss restaurants in New York and elsewhere, offered a traditional Hebrew blessing. 
 Mr. Ozersky was so pleased with the event that he devoted his June 15 column on Time magazine's Web site to it, recommending that other couples turn to restaurant chefs for their own weddings. (''Most caterers aren't really good cooks,'' he wrote.)
 What Mr. Ozersky did not say was that he had not paid for the food or the venue, a question first raised by the restaurant critic Robert Sietsema on the Village Voice Web site last Wednesday.
 ''One of the assumptions the reader might make,'' Mr. Sietsema wrote in an open letter to Mr. Ozersky, ''is that you'd promised these chefs, many of whom do high-end catering and expect big bucks for it, to mention them in your magazine column.'' 
 When called last week, Mr. Ozersky described the lasagna, the five-tier wedding cake created by Mr. White's pastry chef and the use of the Empire Hotel bar as wedding presents from close friends, saying that he requested food rather than crystal or china when chefs asked about gifts to the couple.
 ''Bob makes it sound like a sinister plot to extort lasagna,'' he said of Mr. Sietsema. 
 Event planners familiar with the space estimated that a wedding there would cost anywhere from $200 to $800 a person, depending on food and drink choices that did not even include well-known chefs.
 But even if the wedding involved no quid pro quo, as Mr. Ozersky said, it started a debate among chefs, publicists and writers about the widespread and longstanding practice in some circles of trading ''comps'' -- free meals -- in return for coverage. Restaurant owners say requests -- and even demands -- for free meals from writers of food blogs, magazine Web sites and online restaurant guides are proliferating. 
 Mr. Sietsema, in an interview, said this is a ''nebulous area of quasi-journalism'' that is produced under no particular rules. 
 The New York Times generally prohibits writers from taking meals from anyone likely to be covered by the newspaper. Other media organizations have similar policies.
 Jennifer Baum, a publicist who represents Mr. White, Mr. Chodorow and other prominent New York restaurateurs, said the number of requests she gets for free meals has soared in the last few years. 
 ''I really hope this starts an open conversation,'' Ms. Baum said of the debate over the wedding.
 Joey Campanaro, the chef and owner of the popular Little Owl in Greenwich Village, said he receives many demands for tables from people saying their Web site will be ''the new Zagat or the new Michelin guide.'' 
 ''I'm not going to take that route, which is bribery,'' he said.
 Friendly relationships among chefs, editors, publicists and food writers are hardly newsworthy in the restaurant industry, but some say those relationships can get strained.
 ''We need writers and they need us,'' said Sam Firer of the Hall Company, a public relations firm. Many publications and writers would not be able to afford the expensive meals they write about, he said. ''You have to hope that people don't abuse the privilege,'' he added. ''But every publicist in this town keeps a do-not-invite list, because some people are just freeloaders.'' 
 The issue of trading food for coverage has recently become more pressing, chefs say, because their profit margins are thinner than ever. 
 ''No one can afford to give food away in this economy,'' said Scott Conant, the chef and an owner of the Scarpetta restaurants in the meatpacking district and in Miami. ''I have 300 employees I have to think about first.''
 Even Mr. Ozersky seems to have seen some danger in taking comps. In 2006, Adam Roberts wrote on his Amateur Gourmet blog that he had accepted a free white-truffle dinner at the now-defunct Alain Ducasse New York, disclosing its $320 value. Mr. Ozersky, then an editor at Grub Street, New York magazine's food blog, called him a ''world-class mooch'' and warned, ''The gravy train will roll right over you if you keep this up.'' Mr. Roberts said the experience taught him to stop taking free restaurant meals.
 Mr. Ozersky, who has written for The New York Times, has become an influential voice in food journalism over the last decade. He has written articlesfor Time magazine and has a weekly column on Time.com. 
 In a statement issued by its press office last week, Time said that the article should have disclosed that the food and use of the venue were gifts, and should have made his personal ties to the chefs explicit. ''Josh understands that such disclosures are to be made in the future,'' the statement said.
 Time did not respond to further questions about its policies on contributors' taking gifts from sources.
 Mr. Ozersky has since appended a clarification to the column, writing that ''it was dumb of me not to be more explicit.'' He defended his relationships with chefs, saying that his job is to ''comment and enlarge on trends in gastronomy,'' not to act as an anonymous critic. 
 ''I don't think anyone is under the impression I'm a hard-charging muckraker,'' Mr. Ozersky said, referring to his enthusiastic coverage of the restaurant business, in the course of which he often writes of his personal relationships with chefs.
 In e-mail messages, Mr. White and Mr. Chodorow confirmed that their contributions were gifts, and said that they did not know the event would become the subject of a column. 
 ''Josh Ozersky happens to be one of my closest friends in New York,'' wrote Mr. White, whose daughter was a flower girl at the wedding.

HEADLINE: Europe Agrees to Limits on Bonuses Paid to Bankers

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
BRUSSELS (Reuters) -- Bankers in Europe will not be allowed to take home more than a third of their bonuses in cash from the start of next year under planned new rules, a British lawmaker said Tuesday. 
 The new program, which goes further than American rules agreed on last week, would be the first cap on how bankers are paid. It would also be a victory for European Union lawmakers who have otherwise become bogged down in efforts to regulate banking.
 ''The bankers have shown that despite the crisis, they are not able to show self-restraint. This law will do it for them,'' said Arlene McCarthy, a lawmaker for the Labour Party of Britain, who helped negotiate the new rules.
 ''This will transform the bonus culture,'' she said after concluding nine hours of talks to reach a compromise. ''It is the first cap on how bankers are paid worldwide.''
 A spokeswoman for Spain, which holds the rotating European Union presidency, said: ''We have an agreement with the European Parliament. We are now consulting with member states tonight and hope to announce a deal shortly.''
 Under the negotiated agreement, cash could only constitute 30 percent of a regular bonus and one-fifth a large bonus. A new watchdog for European banks will define what constitutes a large bonus. There will also be an opportunity for a ''clawback'' of bonuses if deals made to reach profit targets later fell apart.
 In addition, banks that have received government bailouts will have to limit bonuses paid to their managers, while directors will not be eligible to receive any bonus unless it is justified to supervisors. Banks must also set limits on bonuses in relation to salaries to avoid any windfall payouts.
 The European Parliament has agreed with countries that the rules should be introduced by the beginning of next year, to cover bonuses which are paid in January.
 ''The public are rightly angry that taxpayer money has been paid in bonuses,'' Ms. McCarthy said. 
 It was unclear whether the concerns of some of the European Union's 27 countries over caps on banker pay could stall the deal at the last minute.
 Some countries have expressed concerns that the bonus curbs would put bankers in London and Frankfurt at a disadvantage to their rivals in New York.
 If the agreement prevails, it would represent a small step forward for the European Union, which many believe has been slow to regulate an industry blamed for tipping the global economy into recession.

HEADLINE: Foursquare Raises $20 Million For Growth

BYLINE: By JENNA WORTHAM

 BODY:
Foursquare, the social networking service that allows users to broadcast their location to friends from a mobile phone, announced on Tuesday that it had raised $20 million from venture capitalists. 
 Since it was introduced last March, Foursquare has amassed more than 1.8 million users and says it is adding new ones at the rate of roughly 10,000 a day.
 Dennis Crowley, who founded the company with a fellow entrepreneur, Naveen Selvadurai, said the fresh cash would largely be used to develop its technology infrastructure, expand its staff of nearly 30 employees and relocate to office space in New York, where the company is based. 
 ''The capital goes to building out our team and bringing on people we need to meet engineering needs,'' Mr. Crowley said. 
 Foursquare previously raised $1.35 million in cash from a well-known list of financiers, including O'Reilly AlphaTech Ventures and Union Square Ventures, which has financed Web companies like Twitter, Tumblr and Etsy. The new investment places the company's valuation at $95 million. 
 The most recent round of fund-raising involved earlier investors and added a new partner, Andreessen Horowitz, the venture capital firm led by the Internet pioneer Marc Andreessen, who co-founded Netscape, and his business partner, Ben Horowitz. Mr. Horowitz said that his firm zeroed in on Foursquare because of the vast market potential for mobile services and applications.
 ''There are already over 200 million smartphones out there and growing fast,'' he said. ''We'd like to see them build out the company to capture that opportunity.''
 Earlier this year, the Web was ablaze with speculation that Foursquare was involved in serious acquisition talks with Facebook and Yahoo. 
 But Mr. Crowley said the company decided it was too soon to sell. ''We've got this robust and ambitious road map,'' he said. ''I really feel that we haven't gotten far enough through it and we're still scratching the surface for opportunities.''
 A big part of Foursquare's appeal is that it turns location-sharing into a game that lets users compete for points, badges and ''mayor'' status at bars and restaurants. Mr. Crowley said the rewards players received could be a valuable marketing tool for local businesses and advertisers. 
 ''We're really after connecting local merchants with their best customers,'' Mr. Crowley said. ''The opportunity here is much larger than we originally thought.''
 Since its introduction last year, Foursquare has established partnerships with more than 10,000 businesses, including Starbucks, Bravo TV, Zagat's and The New York Times Company.
 The interest in Foursquare goes beyond the simple appeal of allowing users to figure out where their friends are migrating for happy hour, said Charles S. Golvin, an analyst with Forrester Research.
 The goal is more targeted advertising. ''The big audiences already out there on the Web are fairly well addressed,'' said Mr. Golvin. ''Hyperlocal is where the next big wave of mobile advertising opportunity is, because it ties into that belief that location is going to be a big enabler for marketers to more deeply engage with their customers.''
 But Foursquare is not the only mobile company hoping to make money from advertisers eager to understand more about the habits and behavior of consumers, said Jeanine Sterling, a senior industry analyst at Frost & Sullivan. In addition to rivals start-ups like Loopt, MyTown, Gowalla and BrightKite, Google has been aggressively promoting its mobile social network, Google Latitude, and Facebook is expected to introduce location features at some point as well.
 ''It's a very real threat,'' Ms. Sterling said. ''But Facebook and Google have their own vulnerabilities, too. Foursquare can position itself as offering capabilities and features that Facebook can't provide, such as privacy.''

HEADLINE: Banks Edge Cautiously Back Into Commercial Mortgage-Backed Bonds

BYLINE: By JOTHAM SEDERSTROM

 BODY:
Once dominant, and then dormant, commercial real estate loans are beginning to show signs of life on the trading floor after a two-year slump.
 Attracted by more conservative underwriting and the perceived bottoming-out of property values, banks like J. P. Morgan Chase and the Royal Bank of Scotland are returning to the commercial mortgage-backed securities market, albeit cautiously. 
 ''Compared to a year or two ago we've come a long, long way,'' said Ross Moore, an executive vice president of the real estate services firm Colliers International. ''The fact there's even discussions taking place -- that's a big step forward. Are we making progress toward restarting the C.M.B.S. market? Yes, I think absolutely.'' 
 Before the bubble burst, nearly half of all commercial real estate deals were financed by loans related to mortgage-backed securities. As a lending instrument, they allow banks to remove loans from their balance sheets by bundling them into a diversified pool, which is then issued as a bond. The payments collected from the sales are put toward future real estate loans.
 At the peak in 2007, more than $230 billion in commercial mortgage-backed securities were originated in the United States, according to data provided by Colliers International. But with eroding property values and an inactive real estate market, new issues plunged to $12 billion the following year and to just $3 billion in 2009.
 Since the beginning of June, there have been eight issues of commercial mortgage-backed securities, amounting to an estimated $5 billion in loans, real estate analysts said. As much as $10 billion in commercial mortgage-backed deals are expected to be completed by the end of the year, said Marielle Jan de Beur, a managing director for structured products research at Wells Fargo Securities.
 While the majority of the deals so far have been single-borrower issuances, a $716 million origination by J.P. Morgan Chase earlier this month was backed by 36 loans on 96 assets.
 The Royal Bank of Scotland, meanwhile, issued a $309.7 million offering in April. Comprising six loans on a total of 81 properties, it was the first multiple borrower bond of its kind since 2008, experts said.
 ''A lot of this is being driven by the financing that is coming back into the commercial real estate market,'' said Brian Lancaster, a market expert at the Royal Bank of Scotland. ''That said, the market is still what I would call very bifurcated.''
 Well-tenanted properties in large cities like New York are receiving financing at low rates while some Class B buildings in smaller cities are losing value and struggling to secure loans, Mr. Lancaster and other analysts said. As a result, lenders with an eye toward future commercial securities are chasing a small pool of quality properties. 
 ''It really is a tale of two markets,'' said Spencer Levy, a senior managing director at CB Richard Ellis. ''There are those assets that have strong cash flow and there are those that don't. Those that do will find a home in today's market and have a robust relationship with lenders, insurance companies and conduits. And those that don't, it's almost as if you're seeing them fall off a cliff.'' 
 The response by investors has been positive, with demand for most of the commercial mortgage-backed issues exceeding supply, analysts said. Lenders attribute the success to conservative underwriting standards that did not exist in 2007, when loans were aggressively made based on projected income streams rather than a property's current cash flow.
 Some lenders also praised the government's Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility program, or TALF, which helped propel the securities markets by providing equity and debt capital to lenders. That program ended earlier this month.
 ''That helped the balance sheets of both lenders and investors in terms of their loans and so it's been really positive,'' said Lisa A. Pendergast, president of the CRE Finance Council, a real estate finance trade association. ''I think now you're finally at a point where you can kind of be comfortable with your balance sheet and your portfolio.''
 The success of the J. P. Morgan and Royal Bank of Scotland deals has already prompted competitors like Wells Fargo Securities, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley to cultivate commercial real estate loans for coming C.M.B.S. offerings, said John D. Lyons, president of the United States division of Savills, the real estate company based in London. 
 Like J. P. Morgan Chase and the Royal Bank of Scotland, both of which had smaller investment groups as partners, many lenders are combining their portfolios with those of other institutions in an effort to move commercial mortgage-backed deals out into the market. 
 ''These lenders are beginning to make and warehouse loans because they believe that securitization has become viable again, although tentative, and will certainly be a preferred outlet for them to raise additional capital,'' Mr. Lyons said. He added that his firm was raising about $1.5 billion in financing on behalf of his domestic and foreign clients.
 Marcus Giancaterino, a managing director at Citigroup, indicated that the big banking company was also poised to re-enter the commercial mortgage-backed market.
 ''It's fairly certain that all of the banks that were historically in this business will go back into this business if they haven't already,'' Mr. Giancaterino said. ''And I think you'll see more activity similar to what we've seen in the past few months.''

HEADLINE: Pulling Back, Amid Echoes Of the 1930s

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The world's rich countries are now conducting a dangerous experiment. They are repeating an economic policy out of the 1930s -- starting to cut spending and raise taxes before a recovery is assured -- and hoping today's situation is different enough to assure a different outcome.
 In effect, policy makers are betting that the private sector can make up for the withdrawal of stimulus over the next couple of years. If they're right, they will have made a head start on closing their enormous budget deficits. If they're wrong, they may set off a vicious new cycle, in which public spending cuts weaken the world economy and beget new private spending cuts.
 On Tuesday and Wednesday, pessimism seemed the better bet. Stocks fell around the world, with more steep drops in Asia Wednesday morning over worries about economic growth. 
 Longer term, though, it's still impossible to know which prediction will turn out to be right. You can find good evidence to support either one.
 The private sector in many rich countries has continued to grow at a fairly good clip in recent months. In the United States, wages, total hours worked, industrial production and corporate profits have all risen significantly. And unlike in the 1930s, developing countries are now big enough that their growth can lift other countries' economies.
 On the other hand, the most recent economic numbers have offered some reason for worry, and the coming fiscal tightening in this country won't be much smaller than the 1930s version. From 1936 to 1938, when the Roosevelt administration believed that the Great Depression was largely over, tax increases and spending declines combined to equal 5 percent of gross domestic product.
 Back then, however, European governments were raising their spending in the run-up to World War II. This time, almost the entire world will be withdrawing its stimulus at once. From 2009 to 2011, the tightening in the United States will equal 4.6 percent of G.D.P., according to the International Monetary Fund. In Britain, even before taking into account the recently announced budget cuts, it was set to equal 2.5 percent. Worldwide, it will equal a little more than 2 percent of total output.
 Today, no wealthy country is an obvious candidate to be the world's growth engine, and the simultaneous moves have the potential to unnerve consumers, businesses and investors, says Adam Posen, an American expert on financial crises now working for the Bank of England. ''The world may be making a mistake, and it may turn out to make things worse rather than better,'' Mr. Posen said.
 But he added -- after mentioning China, India and the relative health of the financial system, today versus the 1930s -- that, ''The chances we're going to come out of this O.K. are still larger than the chances that we aren't.''
 The policy mistakes of the 1930s stemmed mostly from ignorance. John Maynard Keynes was still a practicing economist in those days, and his central insight about depressions -- that governments need to spend when the private sector isn't -- was not widely understood. In the 1932 presidential campaign, Franklin D. Roosevelt vowed to outdo Herbert Hoover by balancing the budget. Much of Europe was also tightening at the time.
 If anything, the initial stages of our own recent crisis were more severe than the Great Depression. Global trade, industrial production and stocks all dropped more in 2008-9 than in 1929-30, as a study by Barry Eichengreen and Kevin H. O'Rourke found.
 In 2008, though, policy makers in most countries knew to act aggressively. The Federal Reserve and other central banks flooded the world with cheap money. The United States, China, Japan and, to a lesser extent, Europe, increased spending and cut taxes.
 It worked. By early last year, within six months of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, economies were starting to recover.
 The recovery has continued this year, and it has the potential to create a virtuous cycle. Higher profits and incomes can lead to more spending -- and yet higher profits and incomes. Government stimulus, in that case, would no longer be necessary.
 An internal memo from White House economists to other senior aides last week noted that policy makers ''necessarily tend to focus on the impediments to recovery.'' But, the memo argued, the economy's strengths, like exports and manufacturing, ''more than make up for continued areas of weakness, like housing and commercial real estate.''
 That optimistic take, however, is more debatable today than it would have been a month or two month ago.
 As is often the case after a financial crisis, this recovery is turning out to be a choppy one. Companies kept increasing pay and hours last month, for example, but did little new hiring. On Tuesday, the Conference Board reported that consumer confidence fell sharply this month.
 And just as households and businesses are becoming skittish, governments are getting ready to let stimulus programs expire, the equivalent of cutting spending and raising taxes. The Senate has so far refused to pass a bill that would extend unemployment insurance or send aid to ailing state governments. Goldman Sachs economists this week described the Senate's inaction as ''an increasingly important risk to growth.''
 The parallels to 1937 are not reassuring. From 1933 to 1937, the United States economy expanded more than 40 percent, even surpassing its 1929 high. But the recovery was still not durable enough to survive Roosevelt's spending cuts and new Social Security tax. In 1938, the economy shrank 3.4 percent, and unemployment spiked.
 Given this history, why would policy makers want to put on another fiscal hair shirt today?
 The reasons vary by country. Greece has no choice. It is out of money, and the markets will not lend to it at a reasonable rate. Several other countries are worried -- not ludicrously -- that financial markets may turn on them, too, if they delay deficit reduction. Spain falls into this category, and even Britain may.
 Then there are the countries that still have the cash or borrowing ability to push for more growth, like the United States, Germany and China, which happen to be three of the world's biggest economies. Yet they are also reluctant.
 China, until recently at least, has been worried about its housing market overheating. Germany has long been afraid of stimulus, because of inflation's role in the Nazis' political rise. In responding to the recent financial crisis, Europe, led by Germany, was much more timid than the United States, which is one reason the European economy is in worse shape today.
 The reasons for the new American austerity are subtler, but not shocking. Our economy remains in rough shape, by any measure. So it's easy to confuse its condition (bad) with its direction (better) and to lose sight of how much worse it could be. The unyielding criticism from those who opposed stimulus from the get-go -- laissez-faire economists, Congressional Republicans, German leaders -- plays a role, too. They're able to shout louder than the data.
 Finally, the idea that the world's rich countries need to cut spending and raise taxes has a lot of truth to it. The United States, Europe and Japan have all made promises they cannot afford. Eventually, something needs to change.
 In an ideal world, countries would pair more short-term spending and tax cuts with long-term spending cuts and tax increases. But not a single big country has figured out, politically, how to do that.
 Instead, we are left to hope that we have absorbed just enough of the 1930s lesson.

HEADLINE: 'Illegals' Network Famed In Lore of Russian Spying

BYLINE: By ELLEN BARRY; Anna Tikhomirova contributed reporting.

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- In the lore of Soviet spycraft, few figures command as much respect as the ''illegals,'' steel-jawed agents with the intelligence of a chess grandmaster and the fortitude of a cosmonaut.
 Painstakingly trained in the K.G.B.'s Directorate S, the illegals spent years assuming a fake biography, known in Russian as a ''legend,'' then awaited orders undercover for years or even decades. Unlike their ''legal'' counterparts, they worked without a diplomatic cover, which would offer them immunity from prosecution. They were rewarded with the kind of adulation Americans reserve for movie stars. 
 This week's jaw-dropping arrest of 11 people seems to offer a glimpse into a recent form of the program. Russia has made little comment on the specific accusations, though it called the arrests ''baseless'' and ''unseemly.'' 
 But if prosecutors are correct, two things seem clear: First, that Russia's network of illegals has survived, and perhaps even grown, since the Soviet Union's collapse. And second, that the agents' assignment -- collecting information about politics and getting to know policy makers -- can now be achieved through more straightforward means. 
 ''It strikes me as a very well-organized, very well-thought-out and very out-of date approach,'' said Olga Oliker, a senior policy analyst for the RAND Corporation. ''I would lay money on bureaucratic inertia. It's a terribly ineffective approach, but it's something that might have made sense in a previous period. '' 
 After the 1917 October Revolution, the Soviets had good reason to develop a specialty in undercover intelligence-gathering. Few countries formally recognized the Soviet Union, so no diplomatic cover was available. 
 It was a simple matter to fabricate a foreign identity -- the agency mined records of foreign babies who had died, wrote Galina Fedorova in a 1994 memoir about life as an illegal. What followed was grueling training, psychological screening for a life of isolation and stress. The ideal candidate was single; while some agents enjoyed the comfort of deploying as a couple, any offspring they produced were immediately sent back to the Soviet Union, Ms. Fedorova wrote.
 Maj. Gen. Yuri I. Drozdov, 85, who ran the illegals program for more than a decade while he was in the K.G.B, called his recruits ''wunderkinds,'' people who often spoke three or four languages with native fluency. He would say little about the training process, except to call it ''very long.''
 ''We have our process of raising them,'' General Drozdov said. ''You have your Dr. Spock method; we have our own ways.'' 
 Throughout the Soviet era, such agents were rewarded with adulation. Illegals like Rudolf Abel and Konon Molody became such national heroes that the External Intelligence Service, or S.V.R., still posts their biographies on its Web site. A beloved television serial chronicled the fictional life of one undercover agent, Max Otto von Stirlitz, as he penetrated Hitler's inner circle. Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin, who served as a K.G.B. officer in East Germany in the 1980s, has said the Stirlitz character helped shape an entire generation of Soviet youth.
 Recent arrests have come as a reminder that the tactic is still in use. In 2006, Canadian officials deported a Russian citizen suspected of spying under an assumed Canadian identity, Paul William Hampel. In 2008, Estonian intelligence services said they had unmasked an S.V.R. handler named Sergei Yakovlev, who was recruiting agents under the assumed identity of Antonio de Jesus Amurett Graf, a Portuguese businessman living in Madrid. 
 Then came this week's arrests of 11 people accused of gathering information on American policy and politics.
 Their assignment, as reported by prosecutors, raises a simple question: Now that United States policy makers routinely visit Russia and engage with foreign lobbyists, much of this information is easily accessible. Why bother with an expensive, high-risk undercover operation?
 Experts on Tuesday pointed to institutional politics. Russia's intelligence services were thrown into chaos during the early 1990s, when agents left in huge numbers and vast overseas assets went missing. But within a decade they rebounded, rebuilding their networks to the proportions they had at the end of the Soviet era, said Leonid M. Melchin, the author of five books about cold war intelligence services.
 Nikolai Zlobin, an analyst at the Washington-based Center for Defense Information, said the network of illegals received support from people intent on ''returning to the old system that they were familiar with.''
 ''It was glorified. It's a romantic business for several Soviet generations, including Putin's generation,'' he said. ''People who work in the central structure, they did everything to rebuild the system. I know some of them, and many of them believe they did the right thing for Russia.'' 
 But he, like other experts interviewed on Tuesday, was scratching his head at the details of the alleged spy ring. To Russians, the term ''illegals'' suggests discipline and a painstaking effort to hide one's nationality; traditionally, they worked strictly in isolation, lest they endanger their carefully developed cover. Among the people arrested this week were several who used Russian names, openly spoke Russian or retained Russian accents.
 Amy W. Knight, who has written on Soviet intelligence, said the illegals were famous for their ability to remain under deep cover for years and return to Russia without being caught.
 ''They had an extensive program and they used illegals a lot,'' Ms. Knight said. ''This new scandal suggests either the S.V.R is not as professional as its predecessors, or it's just easier for the F.B.I. to track them down because of the sophisticated technology that they have.''

HEADLINE: Nurturing New York's Oysters

BYLINE: By DAVID KAMP

 BODY:
BENEATH a floating dock off Governors Island, tucked behind the squat octagonal white ventilation tower for the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, there are oysters growing in New York Harbor. 
 And not just any oysters. These little bivalves, 500,000 strong, make up the largest concentrated oyster population that the harbor has seen in perhaps a century.
 On a recent spring day, Pete Malinowski, who tends to these oysters, removed one of the metal grates that have been fitted into the dock's surface, revealing a series of silos, as he calls the 60-gallon plastic tubs in which his charges live. He plunged his hand into a silo and pulled up a few specimens for examination. They were small, maybe an inch and a quarter long, but they looked like normal oysters: ridged, craggy and tightly shut -- not the grotesque mutant mollusks that the words ''cultivated in New York City waters'' might suggest.
 ''I was skeptical about their rate of survival because they all came in at two millimeters, when they're pretty vulnerable,'' Mr. Malinowski said. ''But look at this, the papery-thin part.'' He pointed to the outer rim of a shell, thin and translucent like the tip of a fingernail. ''That's new growth, which is awesome.'' 
 Mr. Malinowski, 27, is a second-generation oysterman whose parents, Sarah and Steve, run the Fishers Island Oyster Farm in Block Island Sound. If you've ordered oysters in a New York City restaurant, chances are you've eaten ones from Fishers Island, whose longtime champions include the chefs David Bouley, Michael Lomonaco and Alfred Portale.
 But Mr. Malinowski is not farming oysters for commercial purposes, and the person to whom he reported this growth data was not some leathery old sea dog in a woolen cap but a fresh-faced 17-year-old from Canarsie, Brooklyn, named Jeptha Sullivan.
 Mr. Malinowski is an aquaculture teacher at the Urban Assembly New York Harbor School, a part of the city's public school system. Mr. Sullivan just completed his senior year there with the distinction of having been named the school's most experienced diver. 
 To see these young men working together is to witness the confluence of two extraordinary narratives: that of the Harbor School, 85 percent of whose students come from families living below the poverty line; and that of the New York Harbor oyster, the briny, bountiful staple that gave the city much of its flavor, literally and figuratively, until it was done in by overharvesting and pollution.
 Last Friday was graduation day for Mr. Sullivan and his 60 or so classmates. Their commencement ceremony was the first official event held at the Harbor School's striking new campus on Governors Island. Until now, the school, which opened in 2003, had been in the landlocked neighborhood of Bushwick, Brooklyn.
 The school's new home, where classes will begin in September, is in a location that befits its name: on the harbor in a large, handsome brick building on the west side of the island that used to be a Coast Guard hospital. There are views of the Statue of Liberty across the Upper Bay.
 The building, with a 432-student capacity, has been retrofitted with state-of-the-art facilities, including a fin-fish and shellfish production lab, a large room dominated by a Wonka-esque network of tubing and tanks in which scallops, mussels, clams, horseshoe crabs and blackfish, among other indigenous harbor species, will be cultivated. 
 There is also a marine-tech wood shop where students will build 21-foot sloops, and there will soon be an organic garden and an aquaponic freshwater system for farming tilapia; that is, for raising the fish symbiotically with plants.
 In keeping with the school's overall green ethos, students and faculty members will eat together in the expansive dining hall using washable, reusable plates and trays and metal cutlery. The school secured an industrial dishwasher, a rarity in the city school system. Harbor School students do not pay for their meals, in accordance with federal policy, since 70 percent or more of the student body qualifies for free lunch. 
 If the aquaponic system works to Mr. Malinowski's expectations, the students will dine on tilapia and tomatoes they will have raised themselves. (The lab's saltwater species will be raised strictly for educational and habitat-restoration purposes.)
 But the oyster is the Harbor School's calling card, the symbol of its goals. Every incoming freshman, as if pledging a fraternity, must swallow one -- though it must be noted that these initiation oysters come from Mr. Malinowski's parents' place 100 miles away. Eating a New York Harbor oyster is forbidden and potentially illness-inducing. Which is both sad and the whole point.
 On Governors Island last month, a group of seniors was helping Mr. Malinowski install a series of tanks and pumps at the end of Lima Pier, which juts off the island's southern tip. This is one of two off-campus sites -- the other being the eco-dock, as the floating dock is called -- where oysters (their seed also donated by the Malinowskis) are being raised in harbor water. 
 ''Here I am, talking about salinity, turbidity and nitrates,'' said Janique Moore, 18, who lives in the Starrett City apartment complex (now known as Spring Creek Towers) in East New York, Brooklyn, and is contemplating becoming an environmental lawyer or a marine biologist. ''But I'll admit that when I was little, I didn't think there were animals living in these waters. I didn't even think of New York as a harbor-y kind of city.''
 Three hundred years ago, the lower Hudson River estuary was home to 350 square miles of thriving oyster beds, their harvest enjoyed by Native Americans and European settlers alike. Right up until the end of the 19th century, lower Manhattan was rife with inexpensive oyster cellars where a nickel or two bought you dozens of oysters, raw, stewed or fried.
 But greed and carelessness proved to be the urban oyster's undoing. Dredging and raw sewage in the 19th century and industrial pollution in the 20th destroyed its natural habitat. The few wild oysters that survive in New York Harbor are inedible.
 Enter Murray Fisher, 35, the program director of the Harbor School. Raised on an organic cattle farm outside Richmond, Va., Mr. Fisher spent much of his childhood outdoors, a preservationist ethic ingrained into his being at an early age. 
 In 1998, fresh out of Vanderbilt University, he went to work for Riverkeeper, the environmental organization devoted to protecting the Hudson. It was there that he had the idea for a city school devoted, as he put it in an interview, ''to a curriculum that's restoration-based and makes kids feel that they're valuable contributing members of society.''
 ''At the very least,'' Mr. Fisher said, ''it would give them a relationship with a marine environment, which hardly anyone has in New York City.''
 Oysters would be central to this curriculum, and not just for historical reasons. In a healthy marine ecosystem, oysters are a keystone species. As they spawn and multiply, they form beds that expand into reefs, and these reefs in turn become hospitable habitats for all manner of marine life: crabs, fish, ribbony eelgrass. 
 What's more, each oyster is a natural water-filtration system, pumping between 20 and 50 gallons of seawater through its gills each day and extracting algae and phytoplankton for its food.
 Despite his inexperience, Mr. Fisher, through innate political savvy and sheer bullheadedness, willed the Harbor School into existence. Crucially, he forged an alliance with the Urban Assembly, a nonprofit organization that has created 22 small, theme-based public schools in low-income areas that are otherwise served by large, underperforming city schools. 
 Mr. Fisher said he hoped that the Governors Island oysters would ultimately be the Adams and Eves of a marine-life renaissance in the harbor. If multiple oyster reefs are successfully established throughout the Hudson River estuary -- a long-range goal the Harbor School is trying to realize in partnership with NY/NJ Baykeeper, a partner organization of Riverkeeper -- the environmental impact could be significant. 
 Already, an experiment very much like this is under way, conducted by Bart Chezar, 63, a former engineer for the New York Power Authority who has spent his retirement establishing his own oyster colony (with the city's and state's permission) in the Bay Ridge Flats, a large area of shallow water off the coast of Red Hook, Brooklyn.
 In May, several Harbor School students joined Mr. Chezar at the site, helping lay down 500 oyster shells with live oyster spat attached. (Spat are immature oysters that have ended their free-swimming larval phase and have attached permanently to something.) The shells were fastened with plastic loops to two-foot-square grids that had been fashioned from PVC pipes filled with sand to weigh them down. These grids were then placed on a bed of empty Fishers Island oyster shells.
 Several weeks later, Mr. Sullivan dove into the murky waters of the Bay Ridge Flats and emerged holding up one of the grids for examination. The progress was promising: the spat, which in May looked like mere dots, had already grown into recognizable oysters: tiny, but with little hinged shells.
 Back on the shore, he considered his own progress.
 ''I never even knew how to swim until a few years ago,'' he said. ''I had a near-drowning incident when I was around 10. But since my sophomore year I've been a certified Open Water Diver, which my mother likes to tell everybody,'' he said, smiling sheepishly.
 Mr. Sullivan lives with his mother, who makes ends meet as a baby sitter; his father is currently unemployed. This fall, he will attend Hobart College in Geneva, N.Y., where he plans to major in environmental studies.
 ''What's great about this experience is that it gives a kid so many clear career pathways that he might otherwise not be exposed to,'' Mr. Fisher said. ''The oyster thing alone, it's not just about oysters. It's about policy, technology, permits, aquaculture. We need people to become scuba divers, boat drivers, photographers, scientists, lawyers, lawmakers, marine-policy experts.''
 The Harbor School program, like the seafaring life, is physically demanding. Merely commuting to the school from eastern Brooklyn -- first by subway to the South Ferry station in lower Manhattan, and then by ferry, followed by a brisk cross-island walk to the campus --will be a taxing task in the dark, wind-whipped mornings of winter.
 ''We tell the students there's no bad weather, only bad clothing,'' said Jennifer Ostrow, the school's assistant principal.
 With the water warming up, the mature oysters in the eco-dock will soon be spawning. Still, the persistent presence of heavy metals and PCB's in the harbor will probably preclude the school's students from eating city-bred oysters within their lifetimes.
 But it's not inconceivable that one day, a child of Jeptha Sullivan will be able to sit down at the counter of the Grand Central Oyster Bar and order a half-dozen Bay Ridges, a half-dozen Staten Islands and maybe a couple of TriBeCas.

HEADLINE: Last Year's Auto Dealership May Be This Year's Grocery

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

 BODY:
WHITEHALL, Mich. -- The Ford dealership in this town of 2,800 closed nearly two years ago, one more victim of the recession in a state that was among the hardest hit in the economic downturn. Yet the 30-acre site is once again filled with cars and trucks, as the home of a Save-A-Lot discount grocery store that opened in March. 
 Since early 2009, said Norm Miller, vice president of analytics for the CoStar Group, some 2,300 auto dealerships have closed around the country, as new car sales plunged more than 40 percent and the government, after taking ownership stakes in General Motors and Chrysler, forced them to end longstanding franchise contracts. The closings put 70 million square feet of buildings and land on the market, according to CoStar, a commercial real estate research company based in Bethesda, Md.
 But in the last five quarters, Mr. Miller said, 649 of those shuttered dealerships found new owners and were put to new uses, including the sale of Whitehall Ford here for $1.1 million. In the first quarter of this year, 152 dealerships were sold for a combined total of $300 million, he said. Prices ranged from $500,000 to $9 million, Mr. Miller said, though most sales were for $1 million to $3 million. 
 The numbers, Mr. Miller said, represent only the first wave of real estate investment in a market segment that was blasted by the recession.
 ''The good news is that there are steady sales. And there are some noticeable trends,'' he said. ''Schools are buying dealerships and converting them. Lumberyards are buying dealerships. Some are being turned into retail centers. 
 A number of the best properties are being purchased and redeveloped by other auto dealerships. Closed dealerships are selling at the rate of $200 million to $300 million per quarter.''
 The steady pace of sales has not surprised real estate analysts or developers. The transactions represent a pent-up interest in redeveloping the best locations, what Len Bierbrier, president of Bierbrier Development in Lexington, Mass., called ''A and B-type'' real estate. He said the closed dealerships that were in demand typically offered what Whitehall Ford had here in Michigan: a midsize building and an ample, well-lighted paved parking area along a well-trafficked boulevard. 
 The Whitehall project, built by LCL Development Company of Belding, Mich., includes a $700,000, 9,000-square-foot addition with space for a Mexican restaurant and three other tenants, and parking for 80 vehicles. Constructing the supermarket cost $1.1 million after the old dealership was demolished.
 ''There is movement in the market,'' said Mr. Bierbrier, who develops small retail centers in the Boston region. ''There is competition for the best locations. But it isn't as easy as you'd think to redevelop these properties.''
 In many cases, auto dealerships are covered under zoning laws that restrict uses other than auto-related activities. ''Changing uses, particularly here in New England, can take a long time,'' he said. 
 Typically sellers or buyers also are compelled by lenders, as well as state and local regulators, to conduct environmental assessments and clean up chemical compounds and contaminants that seeped from repair shops and parking lots, driving up costs. 
 In other instances, closed dealerships in good locations span just a few acres, and either are priced too high or do not have enough land for the 25,000- to 50,000-square-foot developments that Mr. Bierbrier builds. He said that over the last year or so he had investigated several closed dealerships in towns along Route 128 outside Boston, and decided not to make an offer. 
 New uses for closed dealerships are as numerous as the properties. The shuttered 19.3-acre Sheehy Ford dealership along Route 60 in Powhatan, Va., is in the process of being developed under a lease-purchase contract by Weightpack Inc. for use as an office, showroom and light manufacturing and assembly site for its bottling machines. 
 Chain drug stores are snapping up dealerships because of their locations and ample parking space. In Arlington, Mass., CVS Caremark built a new store on the site of a Buick-Pontiac-GMC truck dealership.
 So are schools. The Tulsa Technology Center, a technical school in Oklahoma, spent $3.51 million in March to convert a 31,557-square-foot building and 6.6-acre dealership site to new classroom space. Another school, the Steppingstone School for Gifted Education, paid $1 million to buy 6.5 acres and the 37,500-square-foot showroom and service building from a closed Chevrolet dealership in the Detroit area. 
 In some cases, automotive-related businesses are supplanting the dealerships. Driven Brands of Charlotte, N.C., the parent company of Maaco Paint and Body, Meineke Car Care Centers and Econo Lube N' Tune & Brake, is recruiting disenfranchised auto dealers to open new franchises on their properties under one of its three auto service brands. 
 Under the company's ''Jump Start'' program, dealers can buy a Driven Brands franchise for half the normal fee and the company will refund 75 percent of the franchise royalties the first year, 50 percent in the second and 25 percent in the third. A spokesman said 22 dealers in 10 states had accepted the offer, and that Driven Brands believed it could recruit 60 more in the next two years.
 It is unclear how many of the closed auto dealerships will find new uses, real estate experts said. As recently as 2006, there were more than 22,000 new car and truck dealers in the country; today there are just over 18,000, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association. The shrinking numbers are consistent with the grim plunge in new-vehicle sales in the United States, which last year sank to 9.87 million, down from 17 million cars and trucks sold in 2005, according to manufacturers. 
 This year, auto analysts forecast, sales could recover to just under 12 million vehicles sold. Ford, where sales gained 22 percent in May, is recording profits. Chrysler and General Motors are paying back parts of the billions of dollars lent to them by the United States and Canada. 
 For more than a year, the old Ford dealership's empty showroom and parking lot in Whitehall, on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan, were a daily reminder of the depths of the recession. Roughly 30 jobs at the dealer, many paying an average of about $40,000, were lost, as were the sales tax receipts that were higher than any other retail business in this community. 
 But more than 200 Whitehall residents stood in line at the March 29 opening of the Save-A-Lot, as much to take advantage of the promotional free products and prize drawings as to express some relief that a new business was starting. 
 John Leppink, the manager of LCL Development Company, said he negotiated the property sale at a 26 percent discount from the asking price, figuring that it would cost just $100,000 more to construct a new building than to remodel the old showroom and service center.
 ''Our market research showed that a new store would work well in that area,'' Mr. Leppink said. ''The car dealership is a good site. They fit the size of our buildings and the traffic to the store.''

HEADLINE: A Harlem Arts Group Exhales

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
Artistic success has never been Harlem Stage's problem. Even before its Gatehouse theater became the first new performing arts space in Harlem in 20 years when it opened, in 2006, it had presented emerging artists, and seemingly everyone from Tito Puente to Abbey Lincoln. Its programs for school children were lauded as well. 
 But financially, the group, incorporated as a nonprofit in 1983, sometimes struggled. By the end of the 2009 season, its accumulated deficit stood at $737,000.
 Earlier, some experts had advised closing its doors at 135th Street and Convent Avenue, if only to provide a temporary break for this multidisciplinary performing arts center, which has a mission to provide opportunities for minority artists and to introduce children to the arts. 
 ''It made my stomach churn,'' Patricia Cruz, the group's executive director, said of the very idea of closing. ''Instead of turning off the lights I decided to make them brighter.'' 
 She slashed to $2 million the $2.7 million budget, counting paper clips but managing to avoid layoffs; created new programming, like the clublike Uptown Nights series to bring in a younger crowd; and paired up with groups like Jazzmobile, Black Documentary Collective, the Columbia Harlem Jazz Project and Classical Theater of Harlem to share costs and income. The board (now with 15 members) cultivated a number of new financial backers, like the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.
 The results: as the fiscal year draws to a close on Wednesday, a fund-raising campaign started in January has pulled in more than $700,000. It eliminates the accumulated operating deficit of $197,000 and makes the organization eligible for a $250,000 grant from the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, a nonprofit economic development group that operates with public money. The fund-raising campaign drew money from individual donors (who gave from $1 to $50,000) as well as from corporations and foundations. 
 ''We have raised the passion as well as the money,'' said Ms. Cruz, a vivacious, well-connected arts cheerleader. ''It will eliminate the accumulated operating deficit and support Harlem Stage programs moving forward.'' She expects the budget to grow up to $3 million in the next fiscal year. 
 ''We told people that Harlem Stage was a success story and we wanted to keep this institution for artists and for the community alive,'' Ms. Cruz said of how she presented the fund-raising efforts. ''So many of our institutions are precarious, even in the best of times.'' 
 Tamara Tunie, an actress and director who sits on the Harlem Stage board, described Ms. Cruz as ''one of the most formidable, passionate leaders of an arts institution.'' 
 She added, ''Her spirit is so bright and uplifting that she rallies the troops; she had made the Gatehouse integral to the continuing development and continuing creativity of the community.'' 
 Harlem Stage was formerly known as Aaron Davis Hall Inc. and used an auditorium in a building owned by City College. Its mission was to provide high-quality programming for Harlem at accessible prices. Aaron Davis Hall became an independent nonprofit in 1983, and the auditorium is still used by Harlem Stage.
 Ms. Cruz took over as executive director of Aaron Davis Hall in 1998 after serving as deputy director at the Studio Museum in Harlem. That year she began laying plans for the $21 million renovation of the Gatehouse, an 1890 building that was once part of the city's water system. Now ''rebranded'' as Harlem Stage, the Gatehouse is the primary home and flagship theater. 
 But the building project, construction delays and an ambitious program of multiple premieres and commissioned work that followed -- including Roger Guenveur Smith's performance piece ''Who Killed Bob Marley?'' and choreography by Bill T. Jones -- meant ''living beyond our means,'' Ms. Cruz said, even before the recent recession.
 Arts organizations in Harlem are very much tied to the fortunes of the city's economy and do not get the bulk of their financial support from the surrounding community, said Kenneth J. Knuckles, president and chief executive of the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone. Some studies have shown that many black potential patrons give money first to their churches and schools, without considering the arts. 
 While Harlem certainly has its thriving headline institutions -- the Apollo Theater, the Studio Museum, the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture -- many others struggle.
 ''It's an ongoing struggle, and its always been more difficult for arts organizations up here,'' Mr. Knuckles said. 
 The Empowerment Zone gave Harlem Stage $750,000 over the last two years and is now poised to grant the group an additional $250,000 ''incentive grant'' (pending an audit) based on the successful fund-raising campaign.
 Ronald K. Brown, the founder of Evidence Dance Company, said his troupe had performed at Harlem Stage maybe 10 times, including earlier this month. He has also done community workshops there, most recently one on movement for men and boys on Father's Day.
 ''It's great when you can find partners in the community that can support artists at every level,'' said Mr. Brown, whose company does not have its own performance space. ''They understand the need.'' 
 Mr. Brown said he had gone to other performance spaces in neighborhoods where some black people told him they did not feel welcome.
 ''I've been at other places on tour, and people say, 'We don't go to those places,' because it's not seen as being about them,'' Mr. Brown said.
 But Ms. Cruz has always had her ear to the neighborhood. When she began hearing from some young people that Brooklyn had cheaper and hipper entertainment than Manhattan, she instituted Uptown Nights, for which one ticket (usually $15) offered entry to a night of performance in a clublike setting, and a free drink. The series has featured artists like Van Hunt and Wunmi; a tribute to Nina Simone by the Black Rock Coalition; and the Habana/Harlem series, featuring the music of Cuba and Harlem. 
 Harlem Stage is seen as a jewel that represents the possibilities in Harlem, where many places are ''having a difficult time,'' said Michael K. Unthank, executive director of the Harlem Arts Alliance, an arts service organization that supports artists and arts groups.
 ''Harlem Stage has had an outstanding track record in developing new work, increasing the diversity of their audiences and in increasing the visibility of artists who might have not been seen,'' Mr. Unthank added. ''We need more venues and more art spaces here in Harlem because Harlem has been underfunded for years, and many of its jewels are under-recognized.''
 A. C. Hudgins, a private investor and Harlem Stage board member, said the successful fund-raising campaign demonstrated the increasing willingness and ability of members of minority groups to support the arts. 
 ''If you don't put your money on the line, you have no control over how you are represented,'' Mr. Hudgins said those arts patrons have learned. ''You can't complain about what's out there.''

HEADLINE: In Campaigns, That Gulf Spill Covers Nation

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

 BODY:
 MIAMI -- Candidates from coast to coast -- and many states in between -- are redirecting their campaigns in an emotional, frantic effort to turn the oil spill to political advantage.
 Democrats and Republicans fighting for Senate seats in the Midwest are portraying oil company contributions as a stain as ugly as the rusty sludge on Southern beaches. Candidates for governor from Massachusetts to Florida now stump for novel ideas to plug the hole (why not air bags?) and to clean up the mess (hair, hay, bacteria?), while in Washington, each party insists that the spill will help it in November.
 In the minds of politicians and strategists, the oil has practically become a giant ink blot, a Rorschach test in which each of the opposing sides sees proof of ''the larger narrative.''
 Republicans say the spill is a lesson in incompetence: the Obama administration has fumbled, they argue, highlighting government's failure not just with the oil, but also with the economy, the deficit, health care and war. 
 Democrats in turn see the spill as a consequence of Republican ties to Big Oil and deregulation. ''This is emblematic of the Republican philosophy,'' said Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, who leads the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. 
 Each side seems determined to channel public outrage over the Gulf of Mexico spill into local issues and larger ideologies. Already, the spill has become a potent subject in at least a dozen states, including some far removed from the disaster's immediate effects.
 In Michigan's First Congressional District, for example, Gary McDowell, a Democrat, is campaigning for a permanent state ban on drilling in the Great Lakes. Though federal and state law already prohibits such drilling (Canada has 513 natural gas wells in Lake Erie), Mr. McDowell has argued that without greater protection, ''Michigan's waters could become the next victim of a tragic oil spill disaster like the one caused by BP.''
 Farther south, in the Kentucky Senate contest, Rand Paul, the Republican nominee and Tea Party favorite, has run into trouble for the opposite extreme: Democrats and some Republicans have scolded him for calling President Obama's criticism of BP ''un-American.''
 Meanwhile, oil company ties -- however thin -- have become pressure points for both parties. In Illinois, the Democratic Senate candidate, Alexi Giannoulias, has come under fire because an unpaid adviser once lobbied in Chicago for the arm of BP that builds gas stations.
 In the Pennsylvania Senate race, Representative Joe Sestak, the Democrat, is accusing his Republican opponent, Pat Toomey, of putting ''Big Oil ahead of the American people'' after receiving $96,050 from the oil and gas industry since 1989. (Or roughly one-sixth of what Mr. Toomey has received from retirees.)
 And, surprisingly, some of the most forceful television advertisements about the spill are appearing not in Louisiana but in Missouri. Secretary of State Robin Carnahan, a Democrat in a close race for the United States Senate, has combined horror-movie sound effects, oil spill video and a few comments from her Republican opponent, Representative Roy Blunt, in an advertisement that accuses him of supporting a ''Big Oil bailout.''
 Factcheck.orgfound the claim to be false, but the argument against Big Oil is now standard; the story line is also playing out in California, Pennsylvania, Texas and wherever else energy industry influence can be found. 
 Still, the spill is most clearly transforming races in and around the Gulf of Mexico. In Florida and other states that regularly deal with hurricanes, voters put a premium on disaster response. Emotion matters almost as much as policy, and candidates are scrambling to stand out. 
 Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida has gained more than most with a high-profile platform at a perfect time, soon after he abandoned the Republican Party to run as an independent for the United States Senate. 
 Mr. Crist has shown up repeatedly at Pensacola Beach, in short sleeves, with and without Mr. Obama, often with his hands on his hips and outrage in his voice. 
 Marco Rubio, now the lone Republican candidate, is still a strong opponent for Mr. Crist, along with the eventual Democratic nominee, either Kendrick B. Meek, a South Florida congressman, or Jeff Greene, a self-financed real estate mogul. Both Democrats have demanded billions from BP for cleanup. 
 But the spill has put Mr. Rubio on defense. He has repeatedly had to explain his support for drilling off the coast of Florida -- a position now at odds with most Floridians, according to a recent Quinnipiac poll that showed a significant rise in opposition to drilling.
 The spill may also realign Florida's governor race. A month ago, Attorney General Bill McCollum seemed nearly nonexistent in his run for the Republican nomination. His self-financed primary opponent, Rick Scott, a former hospital chain executive, had been hammering him from the right, on immigration and other issues. Mr. Scott has outspent Mr. McCollum 16 to 1 on television advertisements, and become the front-runner. 
 Since the spill, however, Mr. McCollum's campaign has been more energized. The attorney general has used his position as attorney general to dispatch a handful of officials to help Florida businesses with their legal claims against BP. 
 Mr. McCollum has also appeared several times in the Panhandle. At one point, at a news conference with a local Republican congressman, he held up a glass jar of brown, slimy tar.
 ''I'm frustrated,'' Mr. McCollum said in an interview, asking why the Obama administration had not hired a Florida company offering oil-eating microbes, or why every available boat was not being used for cleanup.
 ''The overall impact is going to continue for a long time,'' Mr. McCollum said.
 Mr. Scott, the only candidate for governor who supports drilling for oil off Florida's coast, declined requests for interviews. 
 He seems to be betting that Floridians will hand him a victory on the basis of his outsider status and his demand for stricter enforcement of immigration laws. 
 The spill and the response to it have also been a central focus for Alex Sink, the Democratic candidate for the Florida governorship. Ms. Sink, currently the state's chief financial officer, has used the toxic mess to channel her inner, angry populist. When a BP executive appeared before her and other members of the Florida cabinet on June 8, she told him that the claims process was moving far too slowly. 
 ''I don't think speed is in your vocabulary,'' Ms. Sink said. 
 All of these candidates have nearly bumped into one another on Florida's soiled beaches. One local columnist, Howard Troxler of The St. Petersburg Times, even fashioned a satirical shoving match among politicians competing for attention along the oil-soiled coast. 
 Many politicians have expressed outrage over the spill, but a Senate candidate, Representative Charlie Melancon, Democrat of Louisiana, has also shed tears, when lamenting in a Congressional subcommittee hearing that ''everything I know and love is at risk.'' (A YouTube clip has been viewed more than 53,000 times.) 
 Mr. Melancon's Republican opponent, Senator David Vitter, who is seeking a second term, has responded by claiming, incorrectly, that Mr. Melancon supports the moratorium on drilling that has cost Louisiana thousands of jobs. 
 More of this dramatic back and forth is likely to emerge. 
 ''This is going to be used as the driving issue that defines the difference between Republicans and Democrats,'' Senator Menendez said. 
 Thomas M. Davis III, a former congressman from Virginia who led the National Republican Congressional Committee from 1998 to 2002, put it more simply: ''Politicians love to jump in front of a parade.''

HEADLINE: Reid Introduces New Benefits Bill

BYLINE: By DAVID HERSZHENHORN

 BODY:
Senate Democrats on Tuesday unveiled yet another effort to extend unemployment benefits as part of a pared package that includes an extension of the deadline for homeowners to claim a tax credit. 
 After Republicans blocked a similar effort to extend unemployment benefits last week, the majority leader, Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, said he would move on to other legislative business. And, for a day and a half, he did.
 On Tuesday evening, Mr. Reid introduced the revised legislation and initiated the steps required to hold a vote later this week. A spokesman for the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said there was little chance of the bill's passage.
 The new bill would reinstate extended federal unemployment benefits retroactive to the end of May and provide extended benefits for those who qualify through November. 
 The bill also extends the deadline for homebuyers to close on a deal and still claim a tax credit of up to $8,000. The deadline would be pushed to Sept. 30 from July 1. To qualify, homebuyers must have signed a contract by April 30. 
 The extension of jobless benefits and related provisions to aid the unemployed are projected to cost $33.9 billion over 10 years. Republican leaders have criticized the Democrats for not finding a way to cover the cost of the jobless benefits and said they would not support a bill that adds to the deficit.
 Earlier on Tuesday, an effort by House Democrats to pass a similar extension of jobless benefits failed to win the needed votes under an expedited process. House leaders said they would try again on Wednesday using the regular procedure that would require only a simple majority to pass the measure.
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Spying Suspects Blended In, But Seemed Short on Secrets

BYLINE: By SCOTT SHANE and BENJAMIN WEISER; Scott Shane reported from Washington, and Benjamin Weiser from New York. Clifford J. Levy contributed reporting from Moscow, and Mark Mazzetti and Peter Baker from Washington.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The suspected Russian spy ring rolled up by the F.B.I. this week had everything it needed for world-class espionage: excellent training, cutting-edge gadgetry, deep knowledge of American culture and meticulously constructed cover stories.
 The only things missing in more than a decade of operation were actual secrets to send home to Moscow. 
 The assignments, described in secret instructions intercepted by the F.B.I., were to collect routine political gossip and policy talk that might have been more efficiently gathered by surfing the Web. And none of the 11 people accused in the case face charges of espionage, because in all those years they were never caught sending classified information back to Moscow, American officials said.
 ''What in the world do they think they were going to get out of this, in this day and age?'' said Richard F. Stolz, a former head of C.I.A. spy operations and onetime Moscow station chief. ''The effort is out of proportion to the alleged benefits. I just don't understand what they expected.'' 
 As cold war veterans puzzled over the rationale for Russia's extraordinary effort to place agents in American society, both Russian and American officials signaled that the arrests would not affect the warming of relations between the countries.
 At a meeting with former President Bill Clinton on Tuesday, Vladimir V. Putin, the prime minister and a former spy himself, said, ''Your police have gotten carried away, putting people in jail.'' But he played down the episode: ''I really expect that the positive achievements that have been made in our intergovernmental relations lately will not be damaged by the latest events.''
 The White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, struck a similar note. ''I do not believe that this will affect the reset of our relationship with Russia,'' he said. ''We have made great progress in the past year and a half working on issues of mutual concern.'' Asked if the White House found it offensive for its partner to be spying on the United States, he said the case was ''important,'' but a law enforcement matter.
 Meanwhile on Tuesday, the police in Cyprus arrested the man known as Christopher R. Metsos, the last of the spying suspects to be detained, and American officials disclosed that they had moved to make arrests over the weekend because one of the people suspected of being Russian agents, who called himself Richard Murphy, was planning to fly out of the United States on Sunday night, possibly for good.
 After years of painstaking surveillance, the F.B.I. did not want any of its targets to escape, and ''you can't take down one without taking down all of them,'' one law enforcement official said.
 The F.B.I. on Sunday arrested 10 people in Yonkers, Manhattan, New Jersey, Boston and Virginia and charged them with conspiracy to act as an unregistered agent of a foreign government. Most were also charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering. 
 American officials said they believed that most of the accused spies had been born in Russia and had been given sophisticated training before resettling in the United States, posing as married couples. They connected with various Americans of influence or knowledge, including a ''prominent New York-based financier'' described as a political fund-raiser with personal ties to a cabinet official, a former high-ranking national security official, and a nuclear weapons expert. 
 But they were instructed not to seek government jobs, because spy bosses in Moscow thought their cover stories would not stand up under a serious background investigation. So they were assigned to feed to Moscow what amounted to briefing papers on economics issues, American government players and diplomatic and military affairs.
 One, the agent known as Cynthia Murphy, talked to New York contacts and reported on ''prospects for the global gold market'' that her bosses (whose spelling in English-language messages was imperfect) told her were ''v. usefull'' and passed to the Russian Ministry of Finance.
 Before a visit to Moscow by President Obama last year, Ms. Murphy and her ostensible husband, Mr. Murphy, were instructed to size up American intentions from their home in Montclair, N.J. ''Try to outline their views and most important Obama's goals which he expects to achieve during summit in July and how does his team plan to do it (arguments, provisions, means of persuasion to 'lure' [Russia] into cooperation in US interests),'' the spy bosses in Moscow asked, according to the charging papers.
 Another time, Moscow offered vague instructions that might have been directed to journalists: ''Try to single out tidbits unknown publicly but revealed in private by sources close to State department, Government, major think tanks.''
 But why would Russian intelligence ask for such information from people settled in New Jersey rather than, say, Russian Embassy experts or specialists in Moscow or Washington?
 ''It's a Hail Mary pass,'' said Milton A. Bearden, who served for three decades in the C.I.A.'s clandestine service and ran its Soviet and East European division as the Soviet Union fell.
 ''Maybe I end up next to a guy that is the minority staff director on some committee and we do barbecues, or I coach his kid in Little League,'' Mr. Bearden said. ''How can you lose?''
 For the Russian government, he said, supporting the so-called illegals operation was probably relatively inexpensive, particularly because some suspected agents were self-supporting, as court papers show.
 One, Ms. Murphy, reported an annual income of $135,000 as a financial planner, her affidavit says. And another, Anna Chapman, owned her own real estate firm in Manhattan, which her lawyer said in court was valued by his client at $2 million.
 If anything, the challenge for Moscow in an operation of such duration was to make sure its agents remained loyal amid the comforts of daily suburban American life. After the collapse of Communism, Mr. Bearden said, several Czech ''sleeper agents'' in the United States refused to go home, saying they felt they had become Americans.
 ''What's their life like, and particularly if it goes on for years?'' said Burton Gerber, a former chief of the C.I.A.'s Soviet division, of the suspected Russian agents. For couples with children, for example, they may be ''very guilty spies,'' Mr. Gerber said, and yet influenced by P.T.A. and after-school sports.
 ''At some stage, do you begin to think of yourself more as American than Russian?'' he said. ''Without feeling a sense of betraying Russia, they may just want to lead quiet lives.''

HEADLINE: China Returns U.S. Criticism Over Sinking of Korean Ship

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS and DAVID E. SANGER; Andrew Jacobs reported from Beijing, and David E. Sanger from Aspen, Colo.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Three days after President Obama emerged from a tense meeting with President Hu Jintao of China, and accused Beijing of ''willful blindness'' toward North Korea's military provocations, the Chinese government on Tuesday continued the argument about how to handle its testy neighbor.
 In a regularly scheduled news conference, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry dismissed American calls for a tough line against North Korea, most recently for the sinking of a South Korean naval ship. 
 The spokesman, Qin Gang, suggested that Mr. Obama had overreached when he accused Beijing of ''turning a blind eye'' to what an international investigation concluded was a North Korean torpedo attack in March on the ship.
 The sinking of the Cheonan, which killed 46 South Korean sailors, has intensified already strained relations between the North and the South and thrown into stark relief China's long-standing role as a patron of Kim Jong-il, the North Korean leader.
 Mr. Qin contended that China had even more reason than the United States to view the sinking with gravity. ''China is a neighbor of the Korean Peninsula, and on this issue our feelings differ from a country that lies 8,000 kilometers distant,'' he said. ''We feel even more direct and serious concerns.''
 United States officials indicated that Mr. Obama was likely to continue trying to step up pressure on China and North Korea, including authorizing new military exercises with South Korea that would take place not far from Chinese waters.
 Mr. Obama's strategy appears intended to demonstrate to China that it would pay a price for failing to rein in the North Koreans, who depend on China for food and fuel. On Saturday, Mr. Obama announced that the United States would extend by three years, until 2015, an agreement under which American commanders would take control of South Korean forces in the event of a military clash with the North.
 When United States officials first briefed reporters on the meeting between Mr. Obama and Mr. Hu on Saturday during the Group of 20 summit meeting in Toronto, they described a largely friendly session that covered economic and security issues. But in recent days, American officials have acknowledged that the conversation took a decidedly tougher turn when it came to North Korea, and that Mr. Obama emerged from the meeting frustrated at Mr. Hu's unwillingness to acknowledge the North's actions, much less put additional pressure on the country.
 The dispute is playing out now in the United Nations. A watered-down ''president's statement'' is under debate in the Security Council that would acknowledge the findings of a South Korean-led investigation, which included experts from four other countries, that concluded that a North Korean submarine sank the ship.
 China has led the opposition to the statement and to the idea that the North would have to pay any price for the act of aggression, which some American officials say was essentially an act of war.
 An American official familiar with the conversation between Mr. Obama and Mr. Hu said that the discussion of the sinking was ''the toughest part of a generally positive'' talk.
 Mr. Hu spoke only in generalities to Mr. Obama about the need for ''peace and stability'' on the Korean Peninsula, the official said. Those are traditional code words for doing nothing that could result in the collapse of the North Korean government, which could result in a flood of refugees into China and might eliminate China's buffer with American forces in the South.
 Mr. Obama responded that the North Koreans should not be ''indulged'' for acts of aggression, the official said, and he said that if China were truly interested in preventing the outbreak of hostilities in its region, it would take a much tougher line. It was at a news conference a short time later that Mr. Obama said ''willful blindness'' would not solve the problem.
 North Korea has denied the accusations that it sank the Cheonan and has warned that any attempt to punish it would lead to armed conflict.
 The director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Leon E. Panetta, said Sunday that he believed that the sinking of the Cheonan was part of a succession struggle in North Korea, as President Kim's youngest son, Kim Jong-un, 27, is being positioned as his successor.

HEADLINE: White House Energy Session Changes No Minds

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The senators who emerged from a White House meeting with President Obama on energy policy on Tuesday made no effort to paper over the large differences that remain between them.
 Democrats continued to insist on putting some sort of price on greenhouse gas emissions; Republicans continued to insist that to do so would be to impose a tax that would smother the economy.
 ''We have to take a national energy tax off the table,'' said Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee. 
 ''There is no energy tax,'' said Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, sponsor of a bill that would significantly raise the cost of greenhouse gas pollution. 
 This battle has divided the Senate for a year and must be somehow resolved in the coming weeks if the Senate is to produce a comprehensive energy bill that also addresses the gases contributing to climate change.
 It does not appear that Tuesday's meeting moved either side, although Mr. Kerry said Tuesday that he was willing to scale back the bill he and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, proposed this spring to cut energy use and reduce global warming pollution. Mr. Kerry suggested starting with electric utilities only, a plan tentatively embraced Tuesday by Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine.
 Mr. Obama summoned the 23 senators, of both parties, to the White House to try to find some way out of the impasse. He repeated his call for putting a price on climate-altering pollution through a cap-and-trade system or some other sort of emissions tax, but acknowledged the adamant opposition to the idea from most Republicans as well as some Democrats.
 ''Not all of the senators agreed with this approach,'' noted an account of the meeting provided by the White House, ''and the president welcomed other approaches and ideas that would take real steps to reduce our dependence on oil, create jobs, strengthen our national security and reduce the pollution in our atmosphere.'' 
 Among the ideas circulating in Washington are a so-called energy-only bill that would encourage conservation and greater efficiency in buildings and vehicles; more government incentives for alternative fuels; a plan to cap greenhouse gas emissions from electric power plants while delaying regulation of other major sources of pollution for years; and a measure to rapidly build nuclear power plants and electrify the American vehicle fleet. 
 Mr. Obama neither offered specific ideas of his own nor endorsed any of these proposals, but said all parties shared an urgency about enacting some form of energy legislation this year, the White House account said.
 Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said Mr. Obama was attentive but noncommittal. 
 ''He's not saying, 'Here's what I want you to do,' '' Mr. Brown said. ''He probably needs to say that and push one approach. He hasn't done that yet.''
 Mr. Brown said no one offered support for expanded offshore drilling as a way to reduce dependence on imported oil. Mr. Obama proposed just such a plan three weeks before the BP Deepwater Horizon rig exploded in April, killing 11 workers and sending an uncapped geyser of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. 
 As Mr. Obama tried to nudge the Senate forward on a comprehensive energy package, both chambers were moving swiftly on measures to address the oil leak in the gulf and the industry and regulatory practices that contributed to it.
 House and Senate committees will begin debate on Wednesday on bills that will change the way offshore drillers operate and the government oversees them.
 There are several proposals to lift the current $75 million limit on liability for drilling accidents; the strongest, by Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, would eliminate the cap entirely.
 There are bills before both chambers to revamp the Interior Department agency that regulates drilling on public lands and waters. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar has already proposed splitting the agency formerly known as the Minerals Management Service into three separate offices and renaming the minerals service the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement. Two Congressional panels are studying alternative overhaul plans.
 The House Energy and Commerce Committee will take up a bill called the Blowout Prevention Act that will require oil companies digging high-risk wells in deep water to use more sophisticated emergency equipment with backup systems to ensure they work in the case of a blowout. The bill also sets strict new rules for how wells are designed, cemented and encased and requires that a relief well be started within 15 days of an accident.
 There is broad support in both parties for new regulations on offshore operations, for measures to aid the Gulf Coast and for some form of energy legislation that tries to reduce dependence on imported oil. But consensus ends there.
 Mr. Lieberman said he believed that he and other proponents of a strong energy bill could win some Republican support, though he said he had not yet found the formula for gaining those votes.
 ''I'm not naive about the difficulty of doing this in an election year,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The Wrong Way and the Right Way

 BODY:
The turmoil in Albany over New York State's $136 billion budget stands in stark contrast to the way New York City has quietly outlined its own $63 billion in planned spending. Like the state, the city's revenues have not fully recovered, forcing tough decisions about painful spending cuts. Yet Mayor Michael Bloomberg and City Council leaders have managed to agree on a four-year budget outline. 
 Due on Wednesday, the city's budget was ready ahead of time. The state budget was due on April 1, and they are still haggling in Albany.
 The city budget tackles the hard issues directly, facing a $5 billion gap by cutting most services. It will eliminate 2,000 jobs, about half through attrition. Teachers' raises are on hold, a better choice than the mayor's other option: forcing out 4,400 teachers.
 After negotiations that were considerably milder than in Albany, City Council members managed to restore a few public services. Most important on that list was the children's services agency, which will save caseworkers who help prevent child abuse, among other things. Fire companies, swimming pools and libraries will be kept going. As the mayor put it, ''pain, yes, serious damage, no.''
 In part, the city budget process runs more smoothly because the state imposed fiscal discipline more than 25 years ago in dire times. Now the city tries to maintain a surplus. This year, Mayor Bloomberg managed a respectable $3.6 billion extra to start the fiscal year. In today's economic climate, that was quite a feat. 
 The city system is not perfect, of course. City officials still hand out pork, known as member items, money that needs to be watched carefully. These city leaders got the Legislature to grant an exception to city budgeting rules to borrow about $150 million for removing environmental hazards. Borrowing for operating expenses is what got the city in trouble in the first place.
 Still, it was the height of fiscal responsibility compared with Albany, where budgeting should long ago have mirrored the city's process. That would have averted the need for this year's patchwork budget, which will almost certainly need redoing in a few months.

HEADLINE: California: Governor Says Time Isn't Right for a Water Bond

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger wants to pull an $11 billion water bond off the November ballot, after spending much of last year fighting to put it before voters. The governor, a Republican, had called improving the water storage and delivery system a priority, but on Tuesday, he said putting the measure on the ballot this year, when the state faces a $19 billion deficit and record unemployment, would jeopardize its passage. The Legislature will need to agree for the measure to come off the ballot.

HEADLINE: Day 70: The Latest on the Oil Spill

 BODY:
Court to Hear Appeal on Drilling Ban
 A federal appeals court in New Orleans will hear the government's appeal of a ruling overturning the deepwater drilling ban in the Gulf of Mexico on July 8. The Obama administration ordered a six-month moratorium in late May after the disaster on the Deepwater Horizon rig. A group of offshore petroleum service companies sued, saying the government had not justified the ban. They also said the moratorium would inflict long-term economic damage. Judge Martin L. C. Feldman of Federal District Court in New Orleans agreed with the companies. 
 Storm Halts Cleanup Efforts
 Strong winds from a tropical storm raised wave heights to seven feet or more, forcing the suspension of skimming operations and controlled burns on Tuesday. Rough seas make it impossible to contain oil so skimmers can pick it up or ignite it. Forecasters expected the storm, named Alex, to reach hurricane strength before making landfall Wednesday in northern Mexico or South Texas. 
 Aid for BP-Branded Gasoline Stations
 BP says it will give cash and other help to the owners, operators and suppliers of BP-branded gas stations around the United States. The stations have been struggling because of boycotts prompted by the oil spill. John Kleine of the BP Amoco Marketers Association told The Associated Press on Tuesday that outlets would get cash based on volume, with the rates being higher for those in the Gulf States. They will also have lower credit card fees and get help with national advertising. Some stations have reported sales declines of 10 percent to 40 percent since the April 20 rig explosion.
 Biden Visits Gulf Coast
 Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. visited officials and residents on the Gulf Coast on Tuesday. In New Orleans, Mr. Biden said federal and state officials would use a single uniform safety standard for gulf seafood. The goal is to quickly reopen closed fishing areas.
 International Aid Accepted
 The State Department said the United States was accepting help from 12 countries and international organizations in dealing with the spill. Most of have offered skimmers, boom or dispersant chemicals. Among those whose offers have been accepted are Canada, Mexico, Croatia, Holland, Norway and Japan, as well as the International Maritime Organization and the Monitoring and Information Center.

HEADLINE: Ethnic Distinctions, No Longer So Distinctive

BYLINE: By MATT BAI

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- If anyone still doubted, after President Obama's election, that candidates are no longer prisoners of their race or ethnicity, then South Carolina's Nikki Haley offers further proof. Ms. Haley, 38, was born Nimrata Nikki Randhawa, the daughter of Indian Sikh immigrants. Now she is the Christian, Republican nominee for governor in a state with a brutal history of racial oppression.
 What's notable about Ms. Haley's campaign, like that of Mr. Obama and other candidates, is not just that she has breached a racial and cultural barrier, but that she doesn't feel the need -- or the desire -- to talk much about it. ''I love that people think it's a good story, but I don't understand how it's different,'' she recently told The New York Times. ''I feel like I'm just an accountant and businessperson who wants to be a part of state government.''
 Such reticence probably reflects the complicated set of expectations imposed on candidates like Ms. Haley. (Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, who is Indian-American, and Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts, who is black, also come to mind.) We are attracted to the idea that they have transcended ethnic boundaries and reaffirmed the American ideal. 
 At the same time, we do not expect them to dwell on their stories in the way that ethnic candidates of a previous generation routinely did. And so we create a more diverse politics that is in some ways more cautious and anodyne, too, increasingly populated by candidates who are easy to support but harder, perhaps, to really know.
 To understand what has changed, think back 40 years or so, when a generation of ethnic, white candidates -- Democrats, for the most part -- were rising up through urban political machines. Politics then was delineated primarily by economics; if you were the working-class child of, say, Irish immigrants, chances are you had a lot in common, politically, with struggling Italian and Jewish voters in your district, too.
 There was an advantage, then, in drawing attention to your journey, through anecdotes and jokes that served to underscore the universality of the immigrant experience. Take, for instance, Michael S. Dukakis, the Democratic nominee for president in 1988, whose story of Greek immigration so defined his political career that the comedian Jon Lovitz immortalized it in a line from one of the more enduring impersonations on ''Saturday Night Live'': ''My parents were little people. Little, swarthy people.''
 Political gain wasn't the only motive for stressing ethnicity. There was also the notion that one could advance his people even as he advanced himself. ''I hated the negatives that we were subjected to -- the 'greaseball' and the 'guinea' and the 'wop,' '' recalled Mario M. Cuomo, the former New York governor and a hero to Italian-Americans. An expert storyteller, Mr. Cuomo humanized the immigrant's life, drawing voters into a world as vivid in its depictions as a Henry Roth novel, from his birth in the back of a grocery store to his job turning on lights for Jews on the Sabbath.
 Ethnic politics haven't vanished, by any means. In parts of the country with high concentrations of Spanish-speaking immigrants, Latino candidates continue to put their personal journeys front and center. But for others in the new generation of immigrants' children, the political calculus can be different. Minority candidates who now contemplate winning statewide or in mostly white districts are more apt to emphasize their cultural commonality than they are to recount origins that might seem alien or divisive.
 So while Mr. Obama wrote a book about his racial identity before entering politics, he spoke expansively about it only once during his campaign. And even then, his speech in Philadelphia, in response to incendiary remarks made by his pastor, was more an exploration of racial attitudes than it was a personal revelation.
 As president, were he to make light of African-American stereotypes or discourse on the black experience, it would probably be so jarring as to inspire a week's worth of cable-TV clamor and dissection. (The one time he ventured even close to this territory, criticizing the police for arresting the scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr., it overtook his health care agenda for days.)
 This shift away from discussing race and ethnicity is not only strategic but also generational, the natural outgrowth of what younger Americans know as political correctness. Lou Cannon, a biographer of Ronald Reagan, recalls that as a candidate, Reagan repeatedly told audiences a joke which -- let it suffice to say -- involved an Italian organ-grinder and a monkey which would most likely destroy a promising candidacy today.
 It's not a coincidence that while Mr. Obama, who is 48, almost never refers to his own jumbled heritage, his 67-year-old vice president, Joseph R. Biden Jr., happily quips about his Irish forebears. Nor is it surprising that Mr. Cuomo's son Andrew, who is himself now running for governor of New York, rarely uses the ethnically tinged rhetoric that was his father's hallmark.
 This blurring of racial and ethnic lines is, for the most part, deeply inspiring, the manifestation of hard-won progress. Race has not exactly been a nonfactor in Ms. Haley's campaign (one Republican called her and Mr. Obama ''ragheads''), but she has spent a lot more of her energy refuting accusations about her sex life -- an intimation of scandal that is thoroughly egalitarian.
 The peril for candidates aspiring to a kind of post-racial identity, however, is that they defy our inclination to cast politicians as protagonists. ''If you're going to tell people who you are, then you've got to tell them your story,'' Mr. Dukakis says now. Minus the continual telling and retelling of the story, voters may like what you signify as a politician, but they may find it harder, when times get rough, to assume your authenticity.
 And so, over the course of the last several weeks, commentators have taken to portraying Mr. Obama as clinical and insufficiently emotive, which is really just another way of saying the president is not really knowable. It is a caricature his opponents can exploit in part because a lot of voters remain murky on his cultural identity.
 ''Obama is detached from the American experience,'' Rick Santorum, the former Republican senator from Pennsylvania, told a blog called the Iowa Republican on Monday. ''He just doesn't identify with the average American because of his own background -- Indonesia and Hawaii.''
 It was a dubious remark, heavy with racial implications. But it also illustrated the dilemma faced by modern politicians, like Ms. Haley, who look to move beyond their ethnic distinctions. If you spend too much time detailing your differences, you risk alienation. And yet, if you don't remind voters of where you came from and what it means, then your adversaries almost certainly will.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 3, 2010

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Political Times column on Wednesday, about the role of ethnic identity in politics, misstated the subject of an ethnic joke that the biographer Lou Cannon said Ronald Reagan frequently regaled crowds with while campaigning. The joke, which most likely would destroy a promising candidacy today, centered on a monkey and an organ grinder -- not Polish and Italian participants at a cockfight.

HEADLINE: Inside the U.S. Bailout of A.I.G.: Extra Forgiveness for Big Banks

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY and GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
At the end of the American International Group's annual meeting last month, a shareholder approached the microphone with a question for Robert Benmosche, the insurer's chief executive.
 ''I'd like to know, what does A.I.G. plan to do with Goldman Sachs?'' he asked. ''Are you going to get -- recoup -- some of our money that was given to them?''
 Mr. Benmosche, steward of an insurer brought to its knees two years ago after making too many risky, outsize financial bets and paying billions of dollars in claims to Goldman and other banks, said he would continue evaluating his legal options. But, in reality, A.I.G. has precious few.
 When the government began rescuing it from collapse in the fall of 2008 with what has become a $182 billion lifeline, A.I.G. was required to forfeit its right to sue several banks -- including Goldman, Societe Generale, Deutsche Bank and Merrill Lynch -- over any irregularities with most of the mortgage securities it insured in the precrisis years. 
 But after the Securities and Exchange Commission's civil fraud suit filed in April against Goldman for possibly misrepresenting a mortgage deal to investors, A.I.G. executives and shareholders are asking whether A.I.G. may have been misled by Goldman into insuring mortgage deals that the bank and others may have known were flawed.
 This month, an Australian hedge fund sued Goldman on similar grounds. Goldman is contesting the suit and denies any wrongdoing. A spokesman for A.I.G. declined to comment about any plans to sue Goldman or any other banks with which it worked. A Goldman spokesman said that his firm believed that ''all aspects of our relationship with A.I.G. were appropriate.''
 A Legal Waiver
 Unknown outside of a few Wall Street legal departments, the A.I.G. waiver was released last month by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform amid 250,000 pages of largely undisclosed documents. The documents, reviewed by The New York Times, provide the most comprehensive public record of how the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Treasury Department orchestrated one of the biggest corporate bailouts in history.
 The documents also indicate that regulators ignored recommendations from their own advisers to force the banks to accept losses on their A.I.G. deals and instead paid the banks in full for the contracts. That decision, say critics of the A.I.G. bailout, has cost taxpayers billions of extra dollars in payments to the banks. It also contrasts with the hard line the White House took in 2009 when it forced Chrysler's lenders to take losses when the government bailed out the auto giant.
 As a Congressional commission convenes hearings Wednesday exploring the A.I.G. bailout and Goldman's relationship with the insurer, analysts say that the documents suggest that regulators were overly punitive toward A.I.G. and overly forgiving of banks during the bailout -- signified, they say, by the fact that the legal waiver undermined A.I.G. and its shareholders' ability to recover damages.
 ''Even if it turns out that it would be a hard suit to win, just the gesture of requiring A.I.G. to scrap its ability to sue is outrageous,'' said David Skeel, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. ''The defense may be that the banking system was in trouble, and we couldn't afford to destabilize it anymore, but that just strikes me as really going overboard.''
 ''This really suggests they had myopia and they were looking at it entirely through the perspective of the banks,'' Mr. Skeel said.
 Regulators at the New York Fed declined to comment on the legal waiver but disagreed with that viewpoint.
 ''This was not about the banks,'' said Sarah J. Dahlgren, a senior vice president for the New York Fed who oversees A.I.G. ''This was about stabilizing the system by preventing the disorderly collapse of A.I.G. and the potentially devastating consequences of that event for the U.S. and global economies.''
 This month, the Congressional Oversight Panel, a body charged with reviewing the state of financial markets and the regulators that monitor them, published a 337-page report on the A.I.G. bailout. It concluded that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York did not give enough consideration to alternatives before sinking more and more taxpayer money into A.I.G. ''It is hard to escape the conclusion that F.R.B.N.Y. was just 'going through the motions,' '' the report said.
 About $46 billion of the taxpayer money in the A.I.G. bailout was used to pay to mortgage trading partners like Goldman and Societe Generale, a French bank, to make good on their claims. The banks are not expected to return any of that money, leading the Congressional Research Service to say in March that much of the taxpayer money ultimately bailed out the banks, not A.I.G.
 A Goldman spokesman said that he did not agree with that report's assertion, noting that his firm considered itself to be insulated from possible losses on its A.I.G. deals.
 Even with the financial reform legislation that Congress introduced last week, David A. Moss, a Harvard Business School professor, said he was concerned that the government had not developed a blueprint for stabilizing markets when huge companies like A.I.G. run aground and, for that reason, regulators' actions during the financial crisis need continued scrutiny. ''We have to vet these things now because otherwise, if we face a similar crisis again, federal officials are likely to follow precedents set this time around,'' he said.
 Under the new legislation, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation will have the power to untangle the financial affairs of troubled entities, but bailed-out companies will pay most of their trading partners 100 cents on the dollar for outstanding contracts. (In some cases, the government will be able to recoup some of those payments later on, which the Treasury Department says will protect taxpayers' interest. )
 Sheila C. Bair, the chairwoman of the F.D.I.C., has said that trading partners should be forced to accept discounts in the middle of a bailout.
 Regardless of the financial parameters of bailouts, analysts also say that real financial reform should require regulators to demonstrate much more independence from the firms they monitor.
 In that regard, the newly released Congressional documents show New York Fed officials deferring to bank executives at a time when the government was pumping hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars into the financial system to rescue bankers from their own mistakes. While Wall Street deal-making is famously hard-nosed with participants fighting for every penny, during the A.I.G. bailout regulators negotiated with the banks in an almost conciliatory fashion.
 On Nov. 6, 2008, for instance, after a New York Fed official spoke with Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman's chief executive, about the Fed's A.I.G. plans, the official noted in an e-mail message to Mr. Blankfein that he appreciated the Wall Street titan's patience. ''Thanks for understanding,'' the regulator said.
 From the moment the government agreed to lend A.I.G. $85 billion on Sept. 16, 2008, the New York Fed, led at the time by Timothy F. Geithner, and its outside advisers all acknowledged that a rescue had to achieve two goals: stop the bleeding at A.I.G. and protect the taxpayer money the government poured into the insurer.
 One of the regulators' most controversial decisions was awarding the banks that were A.I.G.'s trading partners 100 cents on the dollar to unwind debt insurance they had bought from the firm. Critics have questioned why the government did not try to wring more concessions from the banks, which would have saved taxpayers billions of dollars.
 Mr. Geithner, who is now the Treasury secretary, has repeatedly said that as steward of the New York Fed, he had no choice but to pay A.I.G.'s trading partners in full.
 But two entirely different solutions to A.I.G.'s problems were presented to Fed officials by three of its outside advisers, according to the documents. Under those plans, the banks would have had to accept what the advisers described as ''deep concessions'' of as much as about 10 percent on their contracts or they might have had to return about $30 billion that A.I.G. had paid them before the bailout.
 Had either of these plans been implemented, A.I.G. may have been left in a far better financial position than it is today, with taxpayers at less risk and banks forced to swallow bigger losses.
 A spokesman for Mr. Geithner, Andrew Williams, said it was easy to speculate about how the A.I.G. bailout might have been handled differently, but the government had limited tools. ''At that perilous moment, actions were chosen that would have the greatest likelihood of protecting American families and businesses from a catastrophic failure of another financial firm and an accelerating panic,'' Mr. Williams said.
 For its part, the Treasury appeared to be opposed to any options that did not involve making the banks whole on their A.I.G. contracts. At Treasury, a former Goldman executive, Dan H. Jester, was the agency's point man on the A.I.G. bailout. Mr. Jester had worked at Goldman with Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary during the A.I.G. bailout. Mr. Paulson previously served as Goldman's chief executive before joining the government.
 A Close Association
 Mr. Jester, according to several people with knowledge of his financial holdings, still owned Goldman stock while overseeing Treasury's response to the A.I.G. crisis. According to the documents, Mr. Jester opposed bailout structures that required the banks to return cash to A.I.G. Nothing in the documents indicates that Mr. Jester advocated forcing Goldman and the other banks to accept a discount on the deals.
 Although the value of Goldman's shares could have been affected by the terms of the A.I.G. bailout, Mr. Jester was not required to publicly disclose his stock holdings because he was hired as an outside contractor, a job title at Treasury that allowed him to forgo disclosure rules applying to appointed officials. In late October 2008, he stopped overseeing A.I.G. after others were given that responsibility, according to Michele Davis, a spokeswoman for Mr. Jester.
 Ms. Davis said that Mr. Jester fought hard to protect taxpayer money and followed an ethics plan to avoid conflict with all of his stock holdings. Ms. Davis is also a spokeswoman for Mr. Paulson, and said that he declined to comment for this article.
 The alternative bailout plans that regulators considered came from three advisory firms that the New York Fed hired: Morgan Stanley, Black Rock, and Ernst & Young.
 One plan envisioned the government guaranteeing A.I.G.'s obligations in various ways, in much the same way the F.D.I.C. backs personal savings accounts at banks facing runs by customers. On Oct. 15, Ms. Dahlgren wrote to Mr. Geithner that the Federal Reserve board in Washington had said the New York Fed should try to get Treasury to do a guarantee. ''We think this is something we need to have in our back pockets,'' she wrote.
 Treasury had the authority to issue a guarantee but was unwilling to do so because that would use up bailout funds. Once the guarantee was off the table, Fed officials focused on possibly buying the distressed securities insured by A.I.G. From the start, the Fed and its advisers prepared for the banks to accept discounts. A BlackRock presentation outlined five reasons why the banks should agree to such concessions, all of which revolved around the many financial benefits they would receive. BlackRock and Morgan Stanley presented a number of options, including what BlackRock called a ''deep concession'' in which banks would return $6.4 billion A.I.G. paid them before the bailout.
 The three banks with the most to lose under these options were Societe Generale, Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs. Societe Generale would have had to give up $322 million to $2.1 billion depending on which alternative was used; Deutsche Bank would have had to forgo $40 million to $1.1 billion, while Goldman would have had to give up $271 million to $892 million, according to the documents.
 Societe Generale and Deutsche Bank both declined to comment.
 Ultimately, the New York Fed never forced the banks to make concessions. Thomas C. Baxter Jr., general counsel at the New York Fed, explained that a looming downgrade of A.I.G. by the credit rating agencies on Nov. 10 forced the regulator to move quickly to avoid a default, which would have unleashed ''catastrophic systemic consequences for our economy.''
 ''We avoided that horrible result, got the job done in the time available, and the Fed will eventually get out of this rescue whole,'' he said in an interview.
 And yet two Fed governors in Washington were concerned that making the banks whole on the A.I.G. contracts would be ''a gift,'' according to the documents.
 Gift or not, the banks got 100 cents on the dollar. And on Nov. 11, 2008, a New York Fed staff member recommended that documents for explaining the bailout to the public not mention bank concessions. The Fed should not reveal that it didn't secure concessions ''unless absolutely necessary,'' the staff member advised. In the end, the Fed successfully kept most of the details about its negotiations with banks confidential for more than a year, despite opposition from the media and Congress.
 During the A.I.G. bailout, New York Fed officials prepared a script for its employees to use in negotiations with the banks and it was anything but tough; it advised Fed negotiators to solicit suggestions from bankers about what financial and institutional support they wanted from the Fed. The script also reminded government negotiators that bank participation was ''entirely voluntary.''
 The New York Fed appointed Terrence J. Checki as its point man with the banks. In e-mail messages that November, he was deferential to bankers, including the e-mail message in which he thanked Mr. Blankfein for his patience.
 Many Thank-Yous
 After UBS, a Swiss bank, received details about the Fed's 100-cents-on-the-dollar proposal, Mr. Checki thanked Robert Wolf, a UBS executive, for his patience as well. ''Thank you for your responsiveness and cooperation,'' he said in an e-mail message. ''Hope the benign outcome helped offset any aggravation. Thank you again.''
 The Congressional Oversight Panel, which interviewed A.I.G.'s trading partners about how tough the government was during the negotiations, concluded that many of the governments efforts were merely ''desultory attempts.''
 All of this was quite different from the tack the government took in the Chrysler bailout. In that matter, the government told banks they could take losses on their loans or simply own a bankrupt company; the banks took the losses.
 During the A.I.G. bailout, the Fed seemed more focused on extracting concessions from A.I.G. than from the banks. Mr. Baxter, in an interview, conceded that the way that the New York Fed handled the negotiations meant that any resulting deal ''took most of the upside potential away from A.I.G.''
 The legal waiver barring A.I.G. from suing the banks was not in the original document that regulators circulated on Nov. 6, 2008 to dissolve the insurer's contracts with the banks. A day later a waiver was added but the Congressional documents show no e-mail traffic explaining why that occurred or who was responsible for inserting it. The New York Fed declined to comment.
 Policy experts say it is not unusual for parties to waive legal rights when public money is involved. Mr. Moss, the Harvard professor, said the government might have been concerned that the insurer would use taxpayer money to sue banks. ''The question is: was this legitimate?'' he asked. ''The answer depends on the motivation. If the reason was to avoid a slew of lawsuits that could have further destabilized the financial system in the short term, this may have been reasonable.''
 But two people with direct knowledge of the negotiations between A.I.G. and the banks, who requested anonymity because the talks were confidential, said the legal waiver was not a routine matter -- and that federal regulators forced the insurer to accept it.
 Even if the waiver was warranted, experts say it unfairly handcuffed A.I.G. and has undermined the financial interests of taxpayers. If, for example, the banks misled A.I.G. about the mortgage securities A.I.G. insured, taxpayer money could be recouped from the banks through lawsuits.
 Unless A.I.G. can prove it signed the legal waiver under duress, it cannot sue to recover claims it paid on $62 billion of about $76 billion of mortgage securities that it insured. (A.I.G. retains the right to sue on about $14 billion of the mortgage securities that it insured.)
 If A.I.G. had the right to sue, and if banks were found to have misrepresented the deals or used improper valuations on securities A.I.G. insured to extract heftier payouts from the firm, the insurer's claims could yield tens of billions of dollars in damages because of its shareholders' lost market value, according to Mr. Skeel.
 A.I.G. still has the right to sue in connection with exotic securities it insured called ''synthetic collateralized debt obligations,'' which are known as C.D.O.'s. Such instruments do not contain actual bonds, which is why they were not accepted as collateral by the Fed.
 A.I.G. had insured $14 billion of synthetic C.D.O.'s,, including seven Goldman deals known as Abacus. One of the Abacus deals is the subject of the S.E.C.'s suit against Goldman. A.I.G. did not insure that security, but A.I.G.'s deals with Goldman are similar to the one in the S.E.C. case.
 Throughout the A.I.G. bailout, as Congressional leaders and the media pressed for greater disclosure, regulators fought fiercely for confidentiality.
 Even after the New York Fed released a list of the banks made whole in the bailout, it continued to resist disclosing information about the actual bonds in the deals, including codes known as ''cusips'' that label securities. ''We need to fight hard to keep the cusips confidential,'' one New York Fed official wroteon March 12, 2009.
 Regulators said they wanted confidentiality because they did not want investors trading against the government's portfolio. Others dispute that, saying that Wall Street insiders already knew what bonds were in the portfolio. Only the public was left in the dark.
 ''The New York Fed recognizes the public's interest in transparency and has over time made more information available about the A.I.G. transactions,'' a Fed spokesman said about the matter.
 It was not until a Congressional committee issued a subpoena in January that the New York Fed finally turned over more comprehensive records. The bulk remained private until May, when some committee staff members put them online, saying they lacked the resources to review them all.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday about the leniency shown to big banks during the bailout of the American International Group misstated the year that the federal government bailed out the automaker Chrysler. It was 2009, not 2008.
