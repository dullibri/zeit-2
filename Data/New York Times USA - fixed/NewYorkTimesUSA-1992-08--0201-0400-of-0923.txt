HEADLINE: Watch Out for a War To Aid Bush's Ratings

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Plan Now for the Next Iraqi Test" (editorial, July 28) and "Saddam and Gore," A. M.Rosenthal's column the same day, discuss the temporary resolution in Iraqi compliance with the United Nations resolutions that ended the fighting in the Persian Gulf. But both fail to alert the American people to the potential of election-year "dirty tricks" by President Bush. White House strategists, down in the polls almost 30 percentage points, have again resorted to deployment of American forces to the gulf area both to wave the flag and divert the electorate from the country's economic problems in the global economy. 
 The team that brought us the ill-conceived, unnecessary invasions of Grenada and Panama, and for 10 years aided and abetted the growth of Saddam Hussein's military power (now the subject of Congressional investigation), also failed to criticize or counteract Saddam Hussein's use of chemical weapons against Kurds and Shiites in Iraq.
In August 1990, President Bush deployed more than 200,000 members of the United States armed forces with the deceptive words of "for defensive action only." My greatest fear now is that in an election-year diversion, he might again authorize the use of American forces without Congressional authorization or endorsement, as well as independent of Security Council sanction and approval. Why has there been no movement by the United States at the Security Council in the last few weeks? Why meet with United States "national security advisers" at Camp David? Where does Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali stand on these matters?
While Congress investigates the Republican campaign team's possible theft of the 1980 election, let's be sure no new dirty tricks steal the 1992 election.

HEADLINE: OUR TOWNS;
Town Says No Thanks To Curbside Mail Drops

BYLINE: By Charles Strum

DATELINE: WESTFIELD, N.J.

 BODY:
HERE in ZIP code 07090, where nearly every variety of tree has a street named for it and nearly every street seems to have been an ancient breeding ground for gracious colonial architecture, mail carriers make their way down sidewalks and up front stoops, just as they have for generations.
And this is how it will remain, despite what some citizens construed as momentary insanity on the part of the United States Postal Service, whose eagerness to speed delivery and cut costs resulted in a plan that raised eyebrows here the way scantily clad Bikini Weenie hot dog vendors widened eyes in Yonkers. 
 On one side was the economy-minded postmaster, James Rosa Jr., who reasoned that no one could object to speedier delivery and, through resulting savings, the potential to help maintain the cost of first-class postage at 29 cents. His plan: gradually wean the town from doorstep delivery and toward a system of sidewalk service that mimics mailbox drop-offs on country roads.
On the other side was the Westfield Board of Realtors, which quickly made allies on the Town Council. And if there is a moral in all this it surely must be that the only thing worse than waking a sleeping baby is getting on the wrong side of a suburban real-estate agent.
"Somebody came up with a zany idea that was designed to save a little money," said Pinky Luerssen, president of the realty board and an agent for Burgdorff Realty. "This is an executive town, and they're making it look like a rural town."
From the start, the plan seemed simple, merely a variation on 1978 Postal Service guidelines to promote more efficient service. In June, the postmaster decreed that any house for sale here or in neighboring Mountainside would lose at-the-door delivery once it was sold. In its place the new homeowner would be given a breadbox-style mailbox and a wrought iron post to mount it on. The boxes would be installed at the end of the front walk or driveway.
Newly built houses or condominium developments would get cluster mailboxes, devices known in the Postal Service as N.D.C.B.U.'s, or neighborhood delivery collection box units. Typically, these are 12 locked post office boxes mounted together on a pole in the courtyard of an apartment complex.
Martin Roberts, a spokesman for the Postal Service in Washington, said there was ample fiscal evidence to support sidewalk delivery and cluster boxes. Each delivery to the door costs the postal service $177, he said. But sidewalk drop-off saves steps and is only $125, he said, and cluster boxes bring the cost down to $106.
The cluster system has worked well, according to reports from postal officials in Westchester County, Long Island, Connecticut and New Jersey. Customarily, postal officials approach developers before new housing goes up and work out a cluster or sidewalk delivery plan ahead of time.
But postmasters in the region said they could not recall any effort to retrofit a mature community that has had mail delivered to its front doors for decades. Though similar programs have been reported elsewhere in the country, in Westfield, a Union County community where large old homes with opulent landscaping bring prices of $450,000 and up, real-estate agents take curb appeal seriously. Ranks of mailboxes do not fit the proper profile.
The battle began shortly after Mrs. Luerssen received a letter from the Postal Service announcing the change and seeking addresses of all vacant properties.
"We sent a copy of the letter to the councilmen and to our Senators to try to get it halted," Mrs. Luerssen said. "We thought the boxes were ugly and totally inappropriate. In Westfield, a 70- by 150-foot lot is standard. We don't have acre zoning."
"My big thing is safety," she said. "If you're putting mailboxes outside of vacant houses, you're sending a signal and inviting trouble."
But until the issue hit the weekly paper, The Westfield Leader, last week, most people in Westfield and Mountainside did not know much about it, Mrs. Luerssen said.
In a letter to The Leader that accompanied a front-page article, Councilman Norman N. Greco threatened to take the fight all the way to the Postal Service Board of Governors.
Referring to the mailboxes as tin cans on a post, Mr. Greco said they offered invitations to thieves and vandals. "Gee, won't Mischief Night be that much more fun," he wrote.
Even mail carriers grumbled, wondering how many jobs would be lost if, as envisioned, 10 minutes a day could be cut from delivery time on each of Westfield's 46 mail routes.
And so, the march of progress became a shuffle and finally a retreat. Although the Board of Realtors said it was still awaiting a formal announcement from the Postal Service that the plan had been scrapped, local postal officials have conceded defeat.
Only 11 new mailboxes were installed, said Mike French, the collection delivery supervisor in Westfield. And if anyone complains, he said, the post office will remove the offending mailbox and resume front-door service.
"We're here to serve the public," he said.

HEADLINE: The File of a Refugee: One Haitian's Account

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG

 BODY:
In a Manhattan law office, Angelot Cyriac rifled through an accordion folder, the only possession he carried aboard a leaky sailboat for his journey last April from Haiti to the United States. From its folds, he brought forth laminated identification cards, membership certificates, diplomas and photographs -- a paper trail of the political ties that landed him in a Coney Island apartment, on the lam from the Haitian military.
By the standards of refugees seeking political asylum, this folder was gold. Many Haitian refugees tell United States immigration authorities of relatives slain by soldiers, of their own torture in prison, of their ardent support for the deposed President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide. And the authorities say: Where is the body? Where is the scar? Where is the proof of persecution? 
 "What this man has is some evidence," said James DeBrosse, a lawyer who represents many Haitians looking for asylum here.
 
A Man, Not Numbers
 What this man has is the vivid account of an immigrant's odyssey, the kind of account that usually gets lost in the public debate over the fate of Haitian refugees. Federal judges, politicians and lawyers rarely speak of the individuals who have left Haiti since the military coup that deposed President Aristide last fall. Instead, they talk in numbers: the 38,000 intercepted at sea, the 27,000 repatriated, the 11,o00 admitted to the United States to apply for asylum.
But behind those statistics lies a thicket of human drama.
And behind the closed doors of hundreds of New York apartments, the newest Haitian refugees, like Mr. Cyriac, struggle with a future that is by no means assured. They have only been provisionally allowed into the United States, where they are concentrated in South Florida, the New York area, Boston and Los Angeles. They have to fight for the right to stay, and history would suggest the odds are against them. Between 1983 and 1991, only about 2 percent of Haitian applicants were granted political asylum.
In a Coney Island apartment, Mr. Cyriac, who arrived a month ago, spends his days watching the television in his sister's apartment. He watches anything and everything, listlessly, not understanding the English. The life of Angelot Cyriac (pronounced ahn-je-LOW see-ree-AK) is not here, on the seventh floor of a Neptune Avenue apartment building. His life, for the moment, still lies in the accordion folder whose contents tell his tale.
Mr. Cyriac rifled through the papers.
Here was a photo of Mr. Cyriac in uniform, a baby-faced soldier, before he got in trouble with the men who protected the former President for Life, Jean-Claude Duvalier. Here was a membership card in the anti-Duvalier association of former military men. Here was Mr. Cyriac at work in what he says are the archives of the National Palace, before President Aristide was overthrown last fall.
And here was a family portrait, Mr. Cyriac and the wife and children he left behind -- his wife doe-eyed and serious, his little girl in ruffles and bows, his little boy in a starched white shirt.
"We have had virtually no love life or home life for years," said Mr. Cyriac, who is 28 years old. "I never stay in one place for long enough."
The Bush Administration maintains that the majority of Haitians fleeing by boat are economic migrants, not political refugees. Advocates for Haitians, however, claim there are many more Haitians fleeing political persecution than the Government acknowledges.
 
Sergeant Cyriac
 While Mr. Cyriac's story is by no means generic, it is not unique. Like many passionately political Haitian men, Mr. Cyriac boarded a boat, he said, to save his life. He has no desire to settle in the United States, he said. He is only seeking temporary haven.
"I didn't fight for Haiti all these years to live abroad," he said. "I fought to live at home."
Raised in Maissade, a town in the Artibonite Valley where his mother cultivated rice and cotton, Mr. Cyriac enjoyed local fame as a high-scoring soccer forward. His prowess caught the eye of an army lieutenant who recruited him at age 16 to beef up an army team. Mr. Cyriac said he thought, naively, that he could learn woodworking in the Haitian Army.
By the time that Jean-Claude Duvalier held a referendum in 1985 to endorse himself as President for Life, Mr. Cyriac, then Sergeant Cyriac, knew that things were rotten in Haiti. When President Duvalier visited Mr. Cyriac's army post and gave him a wad of cash to insure that the voting went smoothly, Mr. Cyriac took the money -- and voted against Mr. Duvalier, he said. He told the peasants who asked him how to vote to "vote their conscience, like I was doing," he said.
By Duvalier's count, 99.9 percent of Haitians approved his presidency for life. But in Sergeant Cyriac's district, the vote was heavily negative. That was the beginning of his troubles. He was seized by military men, blindfolded and flown to Port-au-Prince, where he was imprisoned and tortured, he said.
"I felt I was going to be a martyr, like Dessalines," he said, referring to Jean-Jacques Dessalines, the hero of Haiti's independence struggle.
But his torturer also opposed Duvalier, so he survived, Mr. Cyriac said. And after two and a half months, Dr. Roger Lafontant, then the Minister of the Interior, freed 275 soldiers in prison, handing them $25 each and attempting to secure himself a loyal cadre, Mr. Cyriac said.
 
Dangerous Activism
 The former soldiers banded together in an anti-Duvalier association, which provoked a showdown with the Tontons Macoute, Duvalier's agents. Mr. Cyriac's house was burned to the ground, and he and his neighbors, in turn, surrounded 10 Tontons Macoute, placed tires around their necks and set the tires on fire, he said.
Then began a life of political activism on the run, of imprisonment and escape, of attacks and retaliation. In the 1987 elections, he said, he was working at the Ecole Argentine de Bellegarde polling place where 34 people were shot and hacked to death. Before the violence began, he was arrested, stuffed in the trunk of a car and taken to prison, from which he escaped.
"Every time I was beaten, I would wash my wounds in the ocean and then rub them down with limes, and I was good as new," he said.
In 1990, he worked as a security guard for the electoral council executives organizing the elections that brought Father Aristide to power, he said. Even though he was "apolitical" as an election official, he was a "marked man" again, he said. Once Father Aristide was elected, however, he was given a job in the election archives in the basement of the National Palace, Mr. Cyriac said.
"It was like taking a bath and starting life again, clean," he said.
After the coup d'etat, Mr. Cyriac was imprisoned by his former enemies and released after a few months by an old army buddy, who also told him to keep on the move, he said. He traveled northward, gathering the photos and documents for his folder with the help of friends and relatives. When he got to La Gonave, the island that most boats left from, the sailboat Victoria was departing. And, just like that, he said, he jumped on and headed to America. It was April 21.
 
'Where Else Could I Go?'
 "I prayed to God and to all the saints and spirits to save me, because where else could I go?" he said. "If we died, well, we would be dust returning to dust."
The seas were pitching, the sky black and blue and some 250 Haitians were crushed against each other in the leaky sailboat. One man decided that evil spirits were chasing him, endangering the others on his boat. So, Mr. Cyriac said, the man jumped overboard to his death.
And then, Mr. Cyriac said, the seas calmed. And, within two weeks, Victoria sailed into Guantanamo Bay, where the United States Coast Guard met them and transported them to the tent city for Haitian refugees at the United States Naval Base in Cuba.
Most of the other passengers on Mr. Cyriac's boat were eventually returned, against their will, to Haiti.
"Alas," he said. "I think of them and imagine some are already dead."
The government agents believed that Mr. Cyriac had a credible fear of persecution, so he was flown through Miami to New York, where his sister works as a nurse's aide.
 
Two Granted Asylum
 In this country, like thousands of others arriving from Guantanamo, he will tell his story to immigration authorities, who are overwhelmed by a backlog of political-asylum applications.
Of 2,000 applications filed so far by the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, the Immigration and Naturalization Service has granted asylum to 2 Haitians and sent letters of intent to deny asylum to about 30 others. All other cases are pending. (The Catholic immigration clinic is representing and resettling about 60 percent of the Haitians.)
And the wait makes the Haitians nervous, said the Rev. Thomas Wenski of the Haitian-Catholic Center in Miami -- particularly as the Supreme Court prepares to rule on whether the Bush Administration is within its rights to halt Haitians at sea and forcibly return them to their homeland.
"The back and forth of the courts makes their position, their future feel more precarious," Father Wenski said.
And while their cases are on hold, the Haitians live in a state of limbo, torn between their troubled homeland and their troubles here.
"They're pretty down," said Marie Cerat, who runs English and literacy classes for the refugees at the St. Francis of Assisi-St. Blaise Church on Maple Street in Flatbush, Brooklyn. "I don't think they knew what they'd be facing. All they knew was that they wanted out."
All the Haitian refugees received a one-time grant of $600 from the Federal Government, along with the authorization to work. But Mr. Cyriac, like many others, has had no luck finding a job. In fact, the Haitian political activist, who, by his account, has withstood seven years of threats against his life, rarely leaves his sister's Brooklyn apartment.
"I'm afraid of getting lost," he said.

HEADLINE: Iran Said to Commit $7 Billion to Secret Arms Plan

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 7

 BODY:
Iran has committed more than $7 billion to acquire fighter jets, missiles, tanks and nuclear technology from China, North Korea and Russia, according to Arab, French and other officials who monitor the country's efforts.
The secretive program, which began in 1988, has been so costly that a Western European embassy in Teheran told its Government this week that the Iranian economy was so overstretched that it doubted it could honor its debts. 
 The Western European country, whose officials insisted on anonymity, strongly recommended that letters of credit no longer be opened for Iranian businesses.
The Iranian effort has been largely eclipsed by other world events including the preoccupation over the last two years with the confrontation between the West and neighboring Iraq and lately the Yugoslav crisis.
 
Aided by Rising Oil Revenues
 But Saudi and French intelligence officials have signaled over the last few months that the Iranian plan to rebuild the country's armed forces, which began after the end of the eight-year war with Iraq in 1988, has been aided by rising oil revenues and a determination to achieve military superiority in the Persian Gulf region.
In November the American Department of Defense said that Iran's plans included the purchase of conventional weapons as well as a continuing effort to acquire nuclear technology, an assertion Teheran vehemently denied.
But Saudi and French officials say they are sure Iran is working on plans to build atomic weapons as well as increasing its conventional arsenal, despite an assertion by the United Nations International Agency for Atomic Energy, based in Vienna, that an inspection team found "nothing suspicious" on a February inspection tour.
 
Gathering of Intelligence
 Western officials have yet to find credible evidence of an Iranian attempt to acquire nuclear weapons, but there is little doubt that the purchase of conventional weapons is soaring.
The Arab and French intelligence officials have gathered evidence backed by independent groups like the International Institute for Strategic Studies, based in London, which asserts that the Iranian Air Force, nearly nonexistent at the end of the war with Iraq, is now much stronger and equipped offensively and defensively.
The Saudi and French officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Iran spent or committed $3.2 billion on arms in 1988 and 1989, primarily to the former Soviet Union for MIG fighters and tanks.
In 1990 and 1991, these officials say, Iran spent or pledged $4 billion more to buy tanks, missiles and fighter jets from China, North Korea, Russia and some Eastern European countries.
These weapons most of which have been acquired, include 24 MIG-31's, 24 MIG 27's, 68 MIG-29's, 12 Tupolev-22 M bombers and several radar-detecting Ilyushin 76's, largely bought from the former Soviet Union and from Russia.
The yearly Strategic Survey of the International Institute of Strategic Studies added in May that Iran had also ordered 72 F-fighter airplanes from China and 200 T-72 tanks.
In addition, Iran has acquired at least 100 Iraqi fighter jets, mostly Russian MIG's, and military transport aircraft, which sought refuge in various Iranian cities in the last days of the allied bombing campaign in the gulf war. The Iranians have said they would keep those planes as part of the compensation they are demanding from Iraq for the 1980-88 war.
Altogether these purchases have substantially raised the offensive ability of the Iranian Air Force.
In March 1992, a North Korean vessel that carried an unknown number of advanced Scud-C missiles was tracked by United States satellites as it docked in Bandar Abbas, an Iranian port.
At the moment, officials say, Iran is negotiating the acquisition from Russia and other Eastern European countries of SAM-5, SAM-11 and SAM-13 antiaircraft missiles.

HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS;
Bush Says Any U.S. Action Must Come Through U.N.

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 7

 BODY:
President Bush vowed today that he would not rest until Serbian-run prison camps were opened to outside inspection, but he stopped short of threatening to bomb Serbian positions and targets to gain access.
On the question of military action to keep relief supplies flowing, which the United States is pressing the United Nations to authorize, Mr. Bush insisted that any American involvement must be part of a United Nations effort. But the British and the French are both resisting a United Nations authorization vote. 
 "We are -- everyone has been -- reluctant for very understandable reasons to use force," the President told reporters in the White House briefing room, as calls for action mounted at home and abroad. "There's a lot of voices out there in the United States today that say use force, but they don't have the responsibility for sending somebody else's son or somebody else's daughter into harm's way, and I do."
 
Not in 'Political Arena'
 That sounded like a jab at Gov. Bill Clinton, the Democratic Presidential nominee, who has been advocating air strikes. But Mr. Bush insisted, "I am not going to get engaged in the political arena" on the subject of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav republic that has been under Serbian attack.
Still, the President's discussion with the reporters was full of political spin. He implied strongly that only he, and not Mr. Clinton, was qualified to weigh the alternatives in the Balkans, and he said he would continue to "speak with measured confidence" in his dealings with Iraq -- a pair of comments in keeping with his campaign theme of "trust and experience."
He interpreted a slight fall in the nation's unemployment rate, which most private economists called rather insignificant, as evidence that the country was "poised for recovery."
Later, at a ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of the start of the battle of Guadalcanal in the South Pacific, the electioneering tone continued.
 
Praised by Cheney
 Introducing the President, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney noted that Mr. Bush had fought in World War II, then praised him as a wartime leader: "When this nation faced the challenge to freedom in the Persian Gulf, he stood up for America's principles. He refused to reward aggression. That's because he understands, just as the veterans of Guadalcanal understand, the precious value of freedom."
Mr. Clinton has been criticized in some quarters for having managed to avoid combat service in Vietnam. Mr. Cheney did not serve there, either.
In his discussion of the ethnic strife in the Balkans, Mr. Bush emphasized that he had made no decision yet about military action against Serbian troops bombarding the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, or against targets on Serbian territory.
Referring to the Vietnam war, the President added: "We are thinking it out very carefully. I do not want to see the United States bogged down in any way into some guerrilla warfare. We've lived through that once already."
 
Stung by Thatcher Article
 Senior White House officials said that Mr. Bush had been stung by an article in The New York Times on Thursday, written by his old ally, former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain. It bore the headline, "Stop the Excuses. Help Bosnia Now." But the President was said to be haunted by the prospect of Vietnam-style escalation, in which failure of a bombing campaign would be followed by calls for the commitment of substantial allied ground forces.
"The world cannot shed its horror at the prospect of concentration camps," Mr. Bush said in his second such statement in two days."The shocking brutality of genocide in World War II, in those concentration camps, are burning memories for all of us, and that can't happen again. And we will not rest until the international community has gained access to any and all detention camps."
Refugees from northern Bosnia have told interviewers of rapes, killings and starvation diets in Serbian-run prison camps, and television footage has shown gaunt figures with ribs protruding in scenes reminiscent of Nazi concentration camps.
In Iraq, a new United Nations weapons inspection team has arrived and repeated its demand to inspect any site it chooses under the terms of the cease-fire in the Persian Gulf War. But President Saddam Hussein says they will be barred from entering any Government ministry because that would compromise Iraqi sovereignty.
With deadlock looming once again, Mr. Bush said he could not tell yet "how much of this is bluster" and "how much on their part is determination to provoke confrontation." But he insisted that Mr. Hussein "is going to comply" with all of the relevant United Nations resolutions.
Asked if the problems overseas might make it more difficult to bring Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d into the White House to oversee his re-election campaign, as expected, the President replied, "When I have something to say about what Secretary Baker might or might not do, I'll let everybody here know about it, but I have great confidence in him and in the department on the diplomatic side."
Aides said Mr. Baker's changeover might be delayed until late this month, but was still planned.
Speaking to reporters in LaCrosse, Wis., this morning, Mr. Clinton offered careful, limited praise of the President's statements on the Balkan situation.
"I think it's a step in the right direction," he said. "I think it's time they contemplated air support."
Asked if he believed that the United States should push for broadening the air support mission to include the bombing of artillery positions that have been shelling civilian areas, Mr. Clinton said: "I think they need to look at their military options, whether they can actually do that in Bosnia without taking a lot of civilian casualties, too. I think we ought to wait until we get some sense of what is posssible, but I think that is where they ought to be thinking."
Mr. Bush said he had no problem with Mr. Clinton's "offering advice on these matters," but said he was "not going to get engaged in the political arena when we are trying to do something that really has a tremendous humanitarian aspect." Foreign policy, he said, was too serious for politics.

HEADLINE: Francisco Fernandez-Ordonez, Former Spanish Official, 62, Dies

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MADRID, Aug. 7

 BODY:
Francisco Fernandez-Ordonez, who helped remold Spain's image in the post-Franco era and served as Foreign Minister from 1985 until June, died today at his home in Madrid. He was 62 years old.
He died of cancer of the colon and liver, according to his doctor, Carlos Sanz. His body lay in state this afternoon at the Foreign Ministry in Madrid. 
 Mr. Fernandez-Ordonez, who used the nickname Paco, helped reorient Spain's business and political goals during the transition to democracy after the death of the dictator Franco in 1975. He oversaw Spain's integration into the European Community and NATO in the mid-1980's.
Born on June 22, 1930, in Madrid, Mr. Fernandez-Ordonez studied at Harvard in the United States and earned a law degree at the University of Madrid. He began his career as a tax inspector and moved to the Finance Ministry in 1969.
He held civil service posts in the Franco dictatorship, heading the Government-run National Institute of Industry, but soon joined the growing democratic opposition to Franco's rule and took part in talks aimed at restoring democracy after Franco'sdeath.
As Finance Minister from 1977 to 1979 in the centrist Government of Prime Minister Adolfo Suarez, Mr. Fernandez-Ordonez was responsible for passage of controversial income-tax reforms, introducing graduated taxation. The number of taxpayers rose from 1.5 million people in 1977 to more than 12 million over the years.
In 1979 he was appointed Justice Minister in the centrist Government of Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo, where he drew bitter criticism from conservative politicians for the legalization of divorce in 1981. The divorce law was the harbinger of separation of church and state in Spain.
He was named chairman of Spain's state-controlled export-financing bank, Banco Exterior, in 1983 and was appointed Foreign Minister in 1985, two years after Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and the Socialists came to power.
Considered more pro-American than his predecessor, Fernando Moran, Mr. Fernandez-Ordonez campaigned for NATO membership, a step that Spanish voters approved in a referendum. He guided the country to membership in the European Community in 1986 and continued to campaign for greater European integration, championing the Maastricht treaty on political and economic union, which is now awaiting ratification by the 12 community nations.
Attending his first meeting of European Community foreign ministers in the mid-1980's, Mr. Fernandez-Ordonez was reported to have said, "Just call me Paco," a phrase that became his trademark introduction on policy missions throughout the world.
Mr. Fernandez-Ordonez was widely credited in his country for having placed Spain on the map of modern international politics. He helped pave the way for restoration of diplomatic ties with Israel in 1986 and gave the Palestine Liberation Organization mission in Madrid what is described by some envoys as de facto diplomatic status.
He was perhaps most proud of Spain's role as host in the first round of Middle East peace talks in Madrid last October.
He said he had circled the world 150 times as a diplomat, although his illness, which he never publicly acknowledged, began to take its toll this year. After a final trip in May to Chile and Argentina, Mr. Fernandez-Ordonez canceled all appointments, citing exhaustion. Mr. Gonzalez accepted his resignation on June 22, Mr. Fernandez-Ordonez's 62d birthday.
King Juan Carlos described Mr. Fernandez-Ordonez today as "an exemplary minister" and one of Spain's "finest statesmen."
Mr. Fernandez-Ordonez is survived by his wife, Mari Paz Garcia Mayo.

HEADLINE: Weary Firefighting Army Holds Line in the Northwest

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEDFORD, Ore., Aug. 7

 BODY:
Ponderosa pines ignited and popped like matchsticks today in a fire that is consuming a forest about 80 miles northeast of here, while helicopters dumped 3,000-gallon buckets of fluid and bulldozers scraped dirt boundaries to halt the flames of burning forests throughout the Northwest.
The fires, covering nearly 30,000 acres, are among thousands that have roared across more than a million acres in the parched Northwest so far this year. Nearly 100,000 acres are still in flames today as 13,000 firefighters battle fires in six states. But the fires have caused less destruction than expected. 
 No deaths or serious injuries have been reported, and animals appear to have escaped the fires. The authorities put the number of homes destroyed at seven, far fewer than the number burned in previous years, and people who had been evacuated in Oregon were allowed to return home today.
But for the unluckiest, the numbers provide little comfort. Fred Klotz, a 42-year-old woodworker who lived in a log cabin in the hills 80 miles northeast of this city in southwest Oregon, pointed Thursday to twisted metal and piles of ashes. "That's where I lived," he said ruefully.
As the fire raced up the hill toward his small cabin late Tuesday, Fred and Kathryn Klotz loaded some tools, books and clothes into the back of a pickup truck and fled.
"It's all gone," said Mr. Klotz, a bearded man in suspenders and jeans. "You can't cry about it."
Kathryn Klotz interjected: "Oh, I don't know about that. I did some crying."
 
Dry Forests Burn Easily
 Nationwide, firefighters are battling 11 major fires today in Washington, California, Idaho, Montana and Nevada as well as Oregon, but they expect to contain seven of them by Sunday. The vast majority of the fires during this fire season, which began in the spring and will end in late summer, have been attributed to lightning. But the forests are so dry that even the spark from a burning cigarette can cause a serious fire.
About 75 homes were evacuated Thursday near a blaze that has been named the Skookum Fire in south-central Washington. In the last several days it has consumed 3,000 acres and brought 1,345 firefighters to the scene to battle it. And in the rugged terrain of the Los Padres National Forest, 40 miles south of Monterey, Calif., firefighters are plagued by a lack of roads and by erratic winds that whip flames in every direction. The fire there has burned about 600 acres.
After the warmest winter on record and one of the driest springs in a century, fire experts say they have been braced for a season of devastating fires. The region has endured drought for seven years.
Under the Palmer Drought Index, which the Government uses to measure the degree of dryness, the eastern side of the Pacific Northwest is drier than at any time in 50 years. A reading of minus-4 on the index would mean that a region had suffered an extreme drought; plus-4 would be described as wet. Parts of Oregon are assigned an index of nearly minus-9.
Arnold Hartigan, a spokesman for the Boise Interagency Fire Center in Idaho, which coordinates firefighting throughout the West, credited quick, smart work by firefighters, as well as cooler temperatures later in the week, for the lack of widespread destruction.
"We've been very lucky," Mr. Hartigan said. But he added, "Having said that, the fire season is nowhere near being over."
About 65,000 fires in the Northwest have burned 1.1 million acres this season. About 800 million acres of forest in the area are under state and Federal control, but many of the fires this year have burned on private land. At this time last year, 54,000 fires had consumed more than 1.9 million acres.
Experts say fires are part of the natural cycle in the West. In fact, some trees, like lodgepole pines, need severe heat to germinate.
Melanie Miller, a fire ecologist at the Boise Center, described fire as "nature's cleansing agent."
Land managers have historically been too willing to fight fires, she said, and that has led to dangerous conditions. Smaller fires were often snuffed out before they were able to clear out some of the undergrowth, she said. As a result, fires tend to be harder to control because they are fed by so much undergrowth.
Firefighting efforts in recent years have been complicated by the building of houses in remote areas. "Everybody wants to have a nice rustic home with a wood-shingled roof, right up under the trees in these nice narrow bushy canyons," Mr. Hartigan said.
Ina Rist, a 53-year-old motel worker, lives in a mobile home in such a wooded, hidden region, 20 miles northeast of Chilloquin, Ore. She stepped out of her front door on Wednesday and saw flames marching toward her home.
"It was coming across the flat -- red all over," she said. Ms. Rist's home was untouched by flames, but just a few miles away, singed trees and blackened ground marked the path of the fire. Julie DeYoung, a Forest Service worker, sprayed the hot ground with retardant foam, a white flaky substance that left this section of the forest with a Christmas-like look.
For the army of firefighters, the work is dirty and tiring. But for people like Dave Marina, a veteran of the Persian Gulf war who has been unemployed since his discharge last September, it has meant a paycheck.
"I'd rather be home with my 8-year-old daughter," said Mr. Marina, who spread out a bedroll on the ground in the fire camp on Thursday, trying to recoup after a night shift in the forest. "But they're paying $6.75 an hour. I couldn't pass that up."

Medals Are Not The Point

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN

DATELINE: BARCELONA, Spain

 BODY:
IN THE wake of a run of bad luck by United States athletes this week, there was a brief, mad scramble to determine what had gone wrong with Team U.S.A.: Michael Johnson, the sprinter, failed to qualify in the 200-meter dash; Dave Johnson, the decathlete, nearly wrecked a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign; the Dreamettes, as the United States women's basketball team used to be called, were stunned by the Unified Team in a semifinal; American boxers and baseball players were mercilessly pummeled by Cubans.
With two days remaining before the end of competition, however, the medal count reflects the world order more than an impending athletic disaster for the United States: The Unified Team, made up mostly of what used to be the Soviet Union, has won 42 gold medals and 100 medals over all, compared with 31 gold and 96 total for the United States. 
 A look through the glitter of medals, however, presents a clearer sense of the challenge that faces the United States at a time when fresh flows of freedom are making the world's track-and-field teams more competitive than ever.
Fifty-three of the United States medals -- more than half -- are divided between swimming and track and field. The Unified Team's medals are more evenly distributed, with two or more golds sprinkled over seven sports.
But a look beyond the superpowers reveals the tremendous strides that have been made with a rigorous focus on development. African athletes, for example, are not only tightening their dominance in distance running, but also beginning to move down to shorter races, with Kenyans winning gold and silver in the men's 800 meters.
American athletes have maintained a certain high level, but what has become apparent in the first non-boycotted Olympics since 1972, is that the world has gotten better.
Indeed, the United States, for all the talent at its disposal, has faltered in the crucial area of development, the process of identifying and training young talent.
Cuba, with its 10 million people, has become a model of resourcefulness, utilizing an extensive provincial sports school system to insure that the island's best athletes are identified first then placed into sports. By the time they reach Olympic competition, Cuban athletes have endured a grueling regimen of competitions since age 12.
But for all of Cuba's success, 1992 may represent its high-water mark. With a deepening economic crisis, Cuba may be at or near its ceiling.
Then there is Africa, which is just be beginning to explore a seemingly limitless potential. The gold- and silver-medal performances of Ethiopa's Derartu Tulu and South Africa's Elana Meyer in the 10,000 meters last night, coupled with the dominance of Kenyan runners, appears to signal the awakening of a giant.
A measure of the growing sense of potential is reflected in a push by Claude Grinaker, director of the African Athletic Federation, to bring a grand-prix track event to Africa in a effort to keep African athletes on their own continent.
The irony, given South Africa's racist history and the passionate embers that still burn over race, is that South Africa may be the financial hub of an African track-and-field renaissance. The extent of the battle over who controls the distribution of funds and the organization of meets could determine whether the promise of African potential will be fulfilled.
The United States, on the other hand, must simply determine whether developing untapped potential is a priority.
Outside of track and field, basketball and boxing, the other Olympic sports remain outside the reach of too many potential athletes in the States. For all the country's wealth of human resources, the United States has failed to establish a coherent national policy pertaining to amateur sport. The ambivalence is reflected in the presence in Barcelona of an ultra professional Dream Team that wins by an average margin of 50 points while amateurs in other sports are up to their necks in competition.
After watching Cuban boxers and baseball players perform, a number of journalists have bemoaned the fact that the Cubans will never have an opportunity to fight or play for millions of dollars in the United States.
But it is precisely the lure of professional sports that has had a weakening force in the United States, especially in amateur boxing, where talented fighters are snapped up by managers like barracudas, in many cases before they are ready.
If the United States takes anything away from Barcelona, it should be a renewed commitment to development. That challenge goes beyond a count of medals.

A VIVID TALE OF PERSECUTION
In a Manhattan law office, Angelot Cyriac rifled through an accordion folder, the only possession he carried aboard a leaky sailboat for his journey last April from Haiti to the United States. From its folds, he brought forth laminated identification cards, membership certificates, diplomas and photographs -- a paper trail of the political ties that landed him in a Coney Island apartment, on the lam from the Haitian military. His story is an immigrant's odyssey, the kind of story that usually gets lost in the public debate over the fate of Haitian refugees. Page 1.

Saying that 27 children in strollers had been injured in the subways since a stroller ban was lifted two years ago, the New York City Transit Authority announced a campaign to persuade parents to carry, not push, their babies. Page 25.
 
 A DETENTION CENTER IS UNWELCOME
A group of civic and political leaders shepherding a revitalization plan for the South Bronx is mounting a campaign to get the Dinkins administration to stop the imminent construction of a juvenile detention center in a busy commercial district that is central to their plan. Page 25.
 
 DINKINS RESPONDS TO RIVAL
Mayor Dinkins traded barbs yesterday with his likely Republican rival, Rudolph W. Giuliani, after Mr. Giuliani sharply criticized Mr. Dinkins's handling of the disturbances in Washington Heights on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times. Page 25.
 
 A BET TO BLOW UP POLICE STATION
It was an intriguing bet, the suspect said. Five thousand dollars. All he had to do was fill an old car with gasoline-soaked newspapers, throw in some dynamite and figure out a way to blow it up outside the 109th Precinct station house in Queens. But the contraption didn't work and the suspect was arrested. Page 25.
 
 REGION
 
 NEW JOBS
FOR THE JOBLESS
Connecticut officials, working with a fledgling Florida corporation, unveiled three small steps they have taken toward converting the military-dependent economy of southeastern Connecticut to peacetime industry. In a garage at the Groton Department of Public Utilities, three pickup trucks were parked with their hoods up. Teams of retrained workers from Electric Boat, the nuclear-submarine maker, had removed the gasoline engines and fitted the trucks with electric motors and batteries. Page 26.
 
 VICTIM SAYS HE SAW OFFICER FIRE
The teen-age car-theft suspect who was shot in a confrontation with the police two months ago has told investigators that he saw a uniformed officer fire his weapon, his lawyer said. But the lawyer indicated that his client, Howard Caesar, was unable to make a full or positive identification of officers at the scene. Page 26.
 
 A SNAG FOR L.I. FISCAL PACKAGE
New York State's fiscal rescue package for Long Island hit a legal snag when a taxpayer group won a temporary restraining order to bar Nassau and Suffolk counties from issuing bonds to close their deficits. Officials for both counties said the order would have no immediate impact, and they expressed confidence that they would be able to have it rescinded. Page 26.

HEADLINE: County Chief O'Rourke Waits for Judge O'Rourke

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, Aug. 7

 BODY:
Andrew P. O'Rourke, the Westchester County Executive, has become the Man Who Could Not Leave.
It is not that he wants to remain as the Republican chief executive of this suburban county: for some two years he has made it clear that he would much prefer the seat on the Federal District Court in Manhattan for which President Bush formally nominated him in November. 
 But with no action yet on the nomination by the United States Senate and none expected before the Senate recesses next week, it is likely that Mr. O'Rourke will not be confirmed before his nomination expires in January, and it is far from certain whether he will be renominated after that.
While he waits, some people in government and politics here say Westchester's official life has shifted into an "on hold" position -- along with Mr. O'Rourke's career.
"Politically, it has caused organized confusion," said Sal J. Prezioso, president of Westchester 2000, a nonpartisan planning group, who is a former deputy county executive.
"Everybody's scrambling for position," Mr. Prezioso said. "There's only one top position, and that's the county executive position."
 
Some Problems Acknowledged
 In an interview this week, Mr. O'Rourke said the county government remained one of the healthiest in the state. But he acknowledged that his judicial nomination might have caused some problems in people's perception of him.
"Once people think you might leave, people start looking for who your successor is going to be," he said. "But I don't think that's hard to overcome if you say you're going to run again."
He acknowledged that it was unlikely he would be approved for the Federal Court before January. "I guess where there's life, there's hope," he said. "But in this case I don't think there's a great deal of hope."
If he were to be confirmed by Sept. 20, a near impossibility, a special election for his replacement would be scheduled. If he were approved after Sept. 20, the Republican-controlled majority on the County Board of Legislators would select a successor for the job, which pays $119,085 a year.
A result of Mr. O'Rourke's faltering judicial hopes is a near pile-up of county office seekers idling their political engines. There are increasing assertions by some that the county government is adrift. And even some Republicans have become comfortable hurling criticism at Mr. O'Rourke, a onetime candidate for Governor who has been county executive since 1983.
"He could do more, and that's being kind," said Angelo Martinelli, a former Mayor of Yonkers who is considered a front-runner for the Republican nomination for County Executive if Mr. O'Rourke moves on.
 
Commitment Questioned
 Mr. Martinelli, like other politicians, said Mr. O'Rourke had appeared less than fully committed to his job here. "If this was his only thing -- being County Executive -- it would be better for the county," he said.
Paul J. Feiner, a Democrat who is Supervisor of Greenburgh, the largest town in the county, said Mr. O'Rourke had become aloof as his tenure stretched on. Mr. Feiner said he had difficulty obtaining an appointment this spring to discuss a housing issue.
"There's a sense," Mr. Feiner said, "that, 'We don't need you. We don't care.' "
Some in county politics said Mr. O'Rourke's appointments to important executive positions had been less than first-rate, reflecting the difficulties of any chief executive in drawing talented people at the end of an administration.
 
Power Can Be Elusive
 But some said the difficulties in governing the county go deeper. "He's in a very difficult position right now because he can't get the authority he needs as County Executive," said Alfred B. DelBello, a Democrat who preceded Mr. O'Rourke as County Executive and who this week resigned as Mr. O'Rourke's "economic growth czar."
"You can order people around," Mr. DelBello said, "but in the position he's in, he really can't initiate major programs."
Mr. O'Rourke said that he was running the county "better than Al DelBello ever did" and pointed to 10 years of budget surpluses.
Mr. O'Rourke, 58, said that in a new term President Bush could renominate him to the bench. If not, he said, he will decide sometime after the Presidential election whether to run for re-election in November 1993.
He said his nomination had foundered, like many others, simply because of Washington politics.
But some who had been tracking the nomination said it had been kept on the slow track because Mr. O'Rourke lacked the credentials of some other candidates.
 
Primarily A Politician
 Although Mr. O'Rourke has practiced law, he has been primarily a politician for years. On a Judiciary Committee questionnaire that asked for a description of 10 significant cases handled by the applicant for the bench, Mr. O'Rourke listed only three.
The American Bar Association found him qualified.
But one lobbying group of public-interest organizations, the Alliance for Justice, placed him on its list of the "worst of the worst" judicial nominees. The group cited, among other things, his votes while a Yonkers City Councilman to prohibit low-income housing in predominantly white areas of the city.
George Kassouf, the director of the Judicial Selection Project for the Washington-based Alliance, said nominees with questionable qualifications had been processed more slowly than others, and Mr. O'Rourke was one of them.
Mr. O'Rourke defended his qualifications, saying he had written legal articles and taught in law school. When he said that, he sounded less like a candidate for re-election and more like a judicial nominee.
"I'm still playing it," he said, "as though I might get it."

HEADLINE: Brown Resignation Highlights High Turnover Among Chiefs

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

 BODY:
Lee P. Brown's departure after two and a half years as New York City's top police official is -- in one sense, at least -- typical of an emerging pattern across the nation: with increasing frequency police chiefs are lasting only a short time in the job.
In the last five years, the heads of the police departments in 41 of the 50 largest cities in the country have resigned or been dismissed, according to an analysis by the Police Executive Research Forum in Washington. Thirteen cities have replaced their chiefs twice in that time, and Chicago, San Francisco and Dallas have each had three different police executives. 
 "They're burning out, dropping out, getting fired or having health problems," said Robert Trojanowicz, a professor of criminal justice at Michigan State University and a co-author of the forthcoming book, "Police Management for the 21st Century."
Part of the reason for this, criminal-justice experts say -- and perhaps a consideration in Mr. Brown's desire to spend more time with his wife, who is seriously ill -- is that the job has grown far more demanding. Running a big-city police department is no longer simply a matter of commanding troops and catching criminals. Trying to get at the root of crime, cope with shrinking budgets and respond to conflicting demands, the police chief must be a blend of diplomat, coach, drill sergeant and community organizer, on the streets at dawn, commending a precinct commander at noon, speaking at a church at night.
Reviewing his tenure in New York with a reporter the other day, Mr. Brown acknowledged that he had jousted with budget officials in City Hall and with the press and noted, without a hint of regret, that he had often worked 16-hour days. Still, his relish at serving at what he portrayed as the pinnacle of policing in the United States came through vividly, and he made it clear that he was not leaving because he had been unhappy in the job. "The time I can spend with my wife is the issue," he said.
Criminal-justice experts also say that a subtler issue may be at work, one that has also dogged school superintendents: Police chiefs are being asked to work within a society struggling with problems, like homelessness and high unemployment, that are far beyond their control.
"People look to the police chief for the answers to all the problems of society," said C. Roland Vaughn, the Chief of Police in an affluent suburb of Atlanta and the president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, which represents 8,000 police executives in the United States.
 
'The Court of Last Resort'
 "We're sort of like the court of last resort for a lot of people who need help," said Patrick S. Fitzsimons, the Chief of Police in Seattle. "We're being asked to intercede and find shelter, to take people out of squatters' situations. We're in the middle on something created by the economy. You have to take a humane approach."
The high turnover in police chiefs has led many criminal-justice experts to call for the creation of formal contracts that would give the chiefs some insulation from the whims of a mayor, an angry public or electoral change. Mr. Trojanowicz has suggested, for example, that a chief be guaranteed that he or she would serve at least two years into the mayoral term following his or her appointment.
Many modern police leaders, like Mr. Brown, have come to resemble chief executive officers of major corporations, more likely to be seen in dark suits and ties than star-studded uniforms, more likely to be armed with law degrees and Ph.D.'s than guns.
Mr. Brown has a Ph.D. in criminology from the University of California at Berkeley and his chief deputy, Raymond W. Kelly, who has been named acting head of the department, has a law degree from St. John's University, a master's in law from New York University and a master's in public administration from Harvard.
"The chief has to be a person with vision, a manager, a leader and an interpreter of political policy," said Joseph D. McNamara, the retired Chief of Police in San Jose, Calif., who has a Ph.D. from Harvard and is a research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.
 
Higher Salaries
 With better education and greater responsibilities, criminal-justice experts say, the pay of police chiefs has been gradually rising. Mr. Brown, for example, was paid $110,000 a year. The job pays $85,000 in Philadelphia and more than $150,000 in Los Angeles, said Darrel Stephens, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum.
After the mayor's job, said Gerald W. Lynch, the president of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan, "nothing in the city demands more time and energy and total commitment."
Not many chiefs can stand the heat for long. "A good 40 percent of them either resign or are fired under pressure," said Mr. Stephens, who made the analysis for the police forum. "A lot of the other people, after they've been in the job two or three or four years or so, start feeling the conflicting pressures, and they just retire, drop out. Very few grow old in the job."
Though there are no comparable statistics on the length of service of police chiefs in the top 50 cities prior to the Police Executive Research Forum analysis, both Mr. Stephens and Mr. Trojanowicz said they believed the turnover had greatly increased.
Reuben Greenberg, the Police Chief in Charleston, S.C., agreed. "The job has so many pressures," he said. "In some cases a civilian group or the mayor is trying to run the department. You have very little leverage."
 
Changing of the Guard
 For years, Mr. Trojanowicz said, police chiefs came up through the ranks. They knew the politics of their community, and they tended to be less aggressive and innovative than the new breed of police chief. New chiefs tend to be better educated and often take the top spot in a department after having served for 10 years or so in another city, in a kind of apprenticeship.
"Years ago," Mr. Trojanowicz said, "there wasn't so much boat-rocking."
There was no sign of dissatisfaction with Mr. Brown from City Hall and, by all accounts, he was enthusiastically pressing ahead with a transformation of the department, putting thousands of officers on foot patrol in what he calls community policing. But his wife, Yvonne, had become seriously ill and, an aide said, he felt there could be no compromising in his "totally consuming job."
Like many police executives who step down these days, Mr. Brown is returning to the campus. He will teach at Texas Southern University. Many others take jobs as directors of security for private companies, and some become consultants.
Mr. Stephens said he knew of only two chiefs who had been given leaves of absence in recent years -- one to recover from a heart attack, the other for a year of study at Harvard -- and Mr. Brown apparently did not consider asking for one. "It's the nature of the job," Mr. Stephens said. "There's an expectation that whoever is in charge is going to be able to be there and do the job."
Mr. Vaughn said the high visibility of the police chief takes a toll on his family. "He has to be accessible all the time and has to be accountable all the time," Mr. Vaughn said. "Like the preacher's kids, the chief's children are expected to adhere to a higher standard. It's difficult for a wife to share her views for fear people will think they're the chief's views, too. It becomes somewhat of a guarded life."
Mr. Brown said that after serving in New York, he considered his police career finished. "I think 17 years of being a c.e.o. of law enforcement is enough," he said. "When you leave as the Police Commissioner of New York, where else do you go?"

HEADLINE: Bronx Group Opposes Site Of New Juvenile Center

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
A group of civic and political leaders in the South Bronx is mounting a last-minute campaign to stop the Dinkins administration from building a juvenile detention center in a busy commercial district that is a focus of a revitalization plan.
The Bronx Borough President, Fernando Ferrer, said the 124-bed secure detention center, for which contracts have been awarded and construction is expected to begin within months, would work against the borough's Bronx Center Plan. The plan is a blueprint for commercial, residential and institutional development in a 300-square-block area that includes the Hub, the Bronx's second-largest business district. 
 The detention center is planned for a lot at Westchester and Brook Avenues, on the eastern fringe of the Hub and near neighborhoods slowly bouncing back with new housing. It is one of two intended to replace the outdated Spofford Juvenile Center in Hunts Point, in the Bronx; the other will be in East New York, Brooklyn.
Members of the group, the Bronx Center Steering Committee, said they were not opposed to a new center in the Bronx. But they said there were other sites where such a center would have a less harmful effect.
 
'We Have No Vision'
 "You are taking prime, income-producing land and turning it into nothing," said Mr. Ferrer, who is one of two chairmen of the steering committee. "Besides sending a message to the community that any old place will do, you're also sending a message to the business community that we have no vision, and are throwing away potential sources of revenue for the future."
The group, which says it wants to meet with Mr. Dinkins, made its concerns known in a letter they sent to him yesterday.
Yesterday afternoon, a spokesman for the Mayor said his office had not yet received the letter. "Obviously, we're always concerned and interested in hearing the voices of local elected officials," John Beckman, the spokesman, said. "It is also a serious concern of ours to make sure that facilities such as this, which are designed and planned to give kids a second chance, are constructed and operating in a timely fashion."
Spofford, built in 1957, is the city's only detention center for offenders under 15 years of age. Officials at the city's Department of Juvenile Justice said that Spofford's design made it difficult to provide rehabilitative programs and proper supervision, and that its location, a long walk from the No. 6 subway line, made it hard to reach.
The Hub, with bustling stores lining the crossroads of East 149th Street and Third Avenue, is served by many subway and bus lines.
Mr. Ferrer said that he and the Brooklyn Borough President, Howard Golden, opposed the project when it came before the city's Board of Estimate in August 1989. He said that he had proposed other sites, including the former Wedtech factory on Gerard Avenue, south of Yankee Stadium.
But the assistant commissioner for planning and program development at the Department of Juvenile Justice, Ann B. Siegel, said the other sites were too small and that the Wedtech site was privately owned and would cost $8 million. She said the city guidelines called for the center to be built on city-owned land.
She noted that the project had been approved by the appropriate city agencies.
But the issue resurfaced on Wednesday when the Bronx Center Plan Steering Committee reviewed private and public projects being developed for the area.
Richard Kahan, the steering committee's other chairman, does not dispute the need for new investment in criminal justice institutions.
"It's not a question of it not being in the Bronx," he said. "It's a question of why public policies have to contradict one another."
The borough's plan was intended to tap into the increased buying power fueled by a slight jump in population.
Bernd Zimmerman, the director of planning and development at the Bronx Borough President's Office, said that major retailers, including a supermarket chain and a home-furnishings store, had expressed interest in the site where the juvenile center is planned because its size would accommodate sprawling parking lots.
Another concern is that the detention center would make it more difficult to market the new town houses that have been slowly, with the help of city subsidies, reclaiming blocks in formerly desolate neighborhoods.
"Even with the sea of housing, the city shot itself in the foot," said William Bollinger, the director of commercial revitalization for Sobro, a private economic development organization. "They spend millions on new housing in this community, but private developers have to market that housing. It's tough enough when you make a life-savings investment when two blocks away there is a juvenile detention center."

HEADLINE: Teen-Ager Shot in Quarrel Says He'll Continue to Oppose Drugs

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, Aug. 7

 BODY:
A little more than a year ago, a gang of drug dealers down the block invited two of Patsy and Winfred Rembert's sons to join their thriving trade.
The boys, Edgar, now 14 years old, and Winfred Jr., 16, said no. Well-schooled on the topic by their parents, they said no to the girls they were told their new wealth would attract, no to the prospect of expensive sneakers and fashionable running suits, and no to the gold jewelry and fancy cars they were promised if they would only agree to sell illegal drugs. That was when the trouble started. 
 It culminated last Sunday when Winfred Jr. was shot trying to defend Edgar, who had gotten into a fight with the gang after they had roughed him up and damaged his bicycle. A single bullet tore through Winfred's abdomen, damaging his pancreas, spleen and a kidney before bursting through his back.
Today, at a news conference at the Hospital of St. Raphael, the youth, whose family calls him Junior, said he would continue to stand up to the gang. "I was doing something I believe in, so I shouldn't be afraid," he said.
 
'Just Leave Us Alone'
 In a city that has recorded 21 homicides so far this year, many of them drug-related, the story of the Rembert family is stark evidence of the draining, uphill battle parents wage in trying to shield their children from drugs. While firmly believing that they could teach them to reject that enormous temptation that pervades urban -- as well as suburban -- life, the Remberts have found themselves persecuted for their approach. Drugs, it seems, will not leave them alone.
"What hurts most of all," said Mrs. Rembert in an interview earlier this week, the tears spilling from her eyes, "is that we try to stay to ourselves. We're not bothering them. Just leave us alone, that's all I asked. But now my kids can't even play outside in front. When other children come over, we have to screen them before they come into the yard. We have to ask, 'you got a gun?' Because we don't know what these people will try to do."
At the news conference today, Junior said few children in the neighborhood could resist the gang.
"They'll walk up to you, $100 up front, and they'll show you $100," he said. "Usually, if you say 'No,' they'll put down $200 and they'll just keep pressing."
He said he refused to join because "I want a better life."
On Tuesday, the police arrested a 15-year-old boy and charged him with the shooting; because of his age, his name was not made public. The Rembert family says the suspect was involved in selling drugs along with the rest of the gang in the neighborhood.
The Remberts moved to Beers Street, on one of the nicer blocks of this city's dilapidated Dwight-Kensington section, five years ago, fleeing the chaos of a Bridgeport housing project. Their white frame house was quiet and spacious, all they had hoped for.
There they are raising seven children (the youngest is 5) and caring for Mrs. Rembert's 80-year-old mother. Mr. Rembert, a former longshoreman, works as a heavy-equipment operator on construction sites. Lately, though, work has been scarce, and he struggles to make ends meet by repairing cars and vans. His unemployment benefits just ended.
"When we moved here, there wasn't a drug dealer around," Mr. Rembert said. "We had the option of another place, but we chose this one for that reason."
Along the paved front walk, marigolds are struggling up from the earth. Down the block, where Beers crosses Edgewood, young men affiliated with the Kensington Street International gang surround cars to peddle drugs.
It is the derailing of their son's dreams -- he wanted to be a basketball star and planned to try out for his high school football team -- that has devastated the Remberts, even more than the sight of him lying in a hospital bed with tubes and needles piercing his once-athletic body.
 
Fears and Tears
 The shooting has received considerable attention here, prompting offers of help to the family. A private New Haven college, Albertus Magnus, has promised Junior a four-year scholarship for showing the courage "to do the right thing." He said today that he would probably accept the offer.
The Remberts say that the last year has been hell on their nerves and that their children have been persecuted by drug dealers who have snatched basketballs, hats and bicycles from them.
"We escort them now wherever they go," said Mrs. Rembert. "We go to three different schools every day to pick them up. Sometimes Junior says to me, 'Mom, this is so embarrassing. You can just let me walk.' But I'm so scared. When they go alone to a movie, or downtown to the jazz festival, I'm just worried the whole time."
Mrs. Rembert said she had not campaigned to get drug dealers off her street or antagonized them in other ways. "We're just saying, we want to live this way," she said. "I'm trying to be good. It's hard to get them to do what we say -- I'm always learning. There's so much out there they want and we can't afford to give them right now."
The older children share the same anxieties about what might happen to them. "I think about it when I go to school, or after school," Edgar said, his face cradled in his hands. "I worry about my family. And sometimes, I cry."
 
The Price of Opportunity
 Mr. Rembert, an energetic barrel of a man in his mid-40's, sounds like anybody's proud father as he discusses other aspects of his life. He talks happily of his children's ambitions -- Lillian, now 15, won admission to a competitive enrichment program at Yale and wants to be a lawyer; Edgar thinks of going into teaching if his first choice, professional basketball, does not work out. "Junior," their father says, "is a real good mover to the basket, sort of a Clyde Drexler-type player."
He embraces his little ones and says he would go back to Albany, Ga., where he and his wife met and married 20 years ago, if it were not for the New Haven schools. He believes there is a better opportunity for his children here, if the violence on their street will spare them.
In general, the police support the Remberts' story, although they could not confirm that the problems with the gang began because the Rembert children refused to sell drugs.
"As far as we know, the boys were not involved in drugs," said Lieut. Melvin H. Wearing, the chief of detectives. He added, "I can't remember this type of case coming across my desk before, where the family got directly involved and things happened as a result."
Lieutenant Wearing said that the drug trade where the Remberts live was "mostly powdered cocaine, a little marijuana."
"That area is sort of a hot spot, where a lot of people congregate," he said. "We have officers stationed on those corners."
Most of the clientele come from out of town, he added. "It's a lot of suburbanites," he said. "That street is a main artery to come through. You can make a purchase and be on your way out of there."
Mr. Rembert said the police had been extremely helpful since his son was shot, but he does not expect them to be able to solve the problem. Instead, he said, he plans to remain on guard for what he fears will be a drive-by, nighttime attack on his house. "Either that, or they'll decide to just leave us alone," he said.
The family thinks the trouble is not over.
"Once you move out of the projects, you think you won't have to encounter any of this," Mrs. Rembert said. "It seems that we've got no place to go."

HEADLINE: Welfare Experts Skeptical of Cuomo Plan

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 7

 BODY:
As New York State prepares to create thousands of temporary, low-skill jobs for welfare recipients, many welfare experts say the program will do little to reduce the welfare rolls without a larger investment in job-training and placement programs.
Starting next month, the new state program will require single adults and childless couples to work part time for state agencies or lose their Home Relief welfare grants. The Cuomo administration says the program will help break welfare dependency by giving the people job training and experience. 
But a broad range of welfare experts question the value of such workfare programs, saying that without proper training and supervision, the programs are simply punitive measures that often do little to prepare welfare recipients for the real-world job market.
"What these programs usually do is fill up people's time," said Kathryn H. Porter, research director for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington-based group that studies welfare issues. "There is no research I know of that shows they actually increase people's job skills."
William Grinker, a former head of the New York City Human Resources Administration, who supports work-for-welfare programs, said such programs work only when they are coupled with extensive job-placement programs that help move the welfare recipients into permanent jobs.
 
'Need the Combination'
 State officials said they have no plans to expand existing job-placement programs. Consequently, the burden of providing such programs will remain with municipalities and counties, which, Mr. Grinker and other welfare experts said, are struggling with limited budgets and cannot provide adequate programs now.
"You need the combination of services, training and job placement to build on work experience," Mr. Grinker said. "There's some of that out there, but not enough, especially for Home Relief recipients."
About 370,000 New York State residents, most of them single adults who live in New York City, receive Home Relief, which averages about $350 a month per person. The state estimates that about 190,000 of them are employable.
Without extensive educational components, workfare programs can still have some benefits, the experts said. For instance, the programs can discourage a small amount of welfare cheating. They can also help the long-term unemployed become accustomed to the workplace.
"There are clients who say, 'I'm afraid of the job market; I need to get my feet back on the ground,' " said Gordon Berlin, senior vice president of the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, which has studied welfare-reform issues. "For them, this program can make sense. The question is, what happens after the first three months?"
 
Earlier Program
 The new state program, called Working Toward Independence, is in many ways an expansion of an existing New York City workfare program. That program requires Home Relief recipients to work and receive training in city agencies, mostly in clerical or maintenance jobs.
Mary R. Nakashian, a deputy commissioner in New York City's Human Resources Administration, said the 10,000 Home Relief recipients in the program at any one time learn work skills, such as word processing, as well as job-hunting skills. At the end of the six-month program, many participants enter "job clubs," which help them look for permanent positions.
But data on the program's effectiveness remain sparse and open to conflicting interpretations. Last year, 1,152 Home Relief recipients reported getting permanent jobs after leaving the H.R.A. program. While some experts said the figure was low, city officials said it demonstrated that the program had been effective in getting a large number of people off welfare.

HEADLINE: Refitting Groton's Military-Based Economy for Peacetime

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GROTON, Conn., Aug. 7

 BODY:
Officials from the state, local utilities and a fledgling Florida corporation today unveiled three small steps they have taken toward converting the military-dependent economy of New London County to peacetime industry.
In a garage at the Groton Department of Public Utilities, three pickup trucks were parked with their hoods up, showing off the work of people laid off from Electric Boat, the nuclear-submarine maker. Teams of the retrained workers had removed the gasoline engines and fitted the trucks with electric motors and batteries. 
 Municipal utilities in Groton, Norwich and Wallingford will use the electric trucks and monitor their performance. But for the officials gathered here, the trucks represented much more than a road test. They were southeastern Connecticut's toehold in an industry that may yet prove enormous: electric vehicles.
The demonstration project, officials said, had not only shown how adaptable the skilled work forces of Electric Boat and other military contractors are, but had also given Connecticut a start in establishing a technical-school curriculum and university research to support the electric-vehicle industry.
 
Plans for Production Plant
 It also appeared to have cemented a relationship between Connecticut and the Solar Car Corporation of Melbourne, Fla., a small maker of electric cars and conversion kits that is working with state officials on plans to open a production plant here.
"These are very, very basic vehicles," said Douglas Dobb, the president of Solar Car, which provided conversion kits and technical assistance for the three trucks. "There are many more generations of more highly evolved vehicles to come."
Giant military contractors like General Dynamics, the parent of Electric Boat; Hughes Aircraft and Lockheed are searching for peacetime uses for their sophisticated technology. In several areas of the country, particularly southern California, local and state governments are encouraging electric-vehicle research and production as one solution.
California and several other states with high air-pollution levels are creating a market for the cars by requiring certain percentages of new vehicles to be emissions-free -- in practice, electric -- and more are expected to follow.
 
Military-Dependent Economy
 In southeastern Connecticut, Electric Boat has laid off more than 2,000 employees this year because of cutbacks in the Seawolf nuclear-submarine program, and 17,000 more jobs at its shipyard are at risk. Thanks to Electric Boat, its subcontractors and related businesses, New London has the most military-dependent economy in the nation.
The interest in Solar Car shows the lengths to which state and local officials are willing to go to get in on the ground floor of an industry, even if it creates few jobs initially.
The demonstration project with the pickup trucks was started by the Connecticut Municipal Electric Energy Cooperative, the wholesaler for six municipal utilities in the state, with a $30,000 grant from the American Public Power Association.
The region's Private Industry Council, an arm of the Federal Department of Labor, contributed $27,720 to train workers for the conversion project, and 30 workers, ranging from an electrical engineer to a grinder, were drawn from Electric Boat's Career Transition Center for laid-off employees.
 
Technical Curriculum
 A curriculum was developed and training supervised by instructors at the Waterbury State Technical-Mattatuck Community College, Central Connecticut State University and the Oliver Wolcott Regional Vocational Technical School. And data on the trucks' performance will be analyzed by a center for alternative technologies at the Avery Point campus of the University of Connecticut.
All of these efforts, officials said today, will result in a technical curriculum for Connecticut to train new workers for the electric-vehicle industry and to conduct research to support its growth. For the 30 Electric Boat workers the project is over, but they are expected to be offered Solar Car's first jobs in Connecticut.
"We expect that the first applications and interviews will come from you people," Mr. Dobb told the trainees today.
Still, the courtship of Solar Car shows how interested state economic development officials are in potential: the four-year-old company has only a dozen employees, subcontracting much of its work so far.
Robert Adams, its vice president, said a Connecticut plant would start with about a dozen employees, though the company is talking about a factory that could produce as many as 1,000 electric vehicles a year.

HEADLINE: Yield on 30-Year Bonds Falls to 7.39%

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The yield on the 30-year bond fell to its lowest level of the year as Treasury securities rallied yesterday after July employment data confirmed that the economy continued to grow only sluggishly.
In late trading in the secondary market for Treasury securities, the yield on the 8 percent bond of 2021 was 7.39 percent, matching the closing low of early January this year. The bond was offered at 1077/32, up almost seven-eighths of a point on the day. The yield was down from Thursday's 7.45. 
 If the yield moves much below this level it will be in rarefied territory. The yield on a 30-year bond has not been below 7 percent since the early 1970's.
On the surface, the unemployment data looked good enough for President Bush to say at a White House news conference: "We are poised for a strong recovery. And we have been growing, albeit anemically." And, in fact, the increase of 198,000 in non-farm payroll jobs was the largest monthly jump in two years.
But underneath, in the webb of detail that makes up the jobs report, the outlook was not upbeat, which is good news for a bond market that likes slow growth and little inflation.
So, in yesterday's trading there seemed to be reason to resume the rally that began in early July when June employment data were reported.
But the rally, which stalled at the end of July, will be tested again next week as the Treasury auctions off $36 billion in 3-year and 10-year notes, and 30-year bonds.
 
Few Signs of Strength
 "It is hard to find any strength in this report," Donald H. Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, said of the unemployment data. Taking the last two months together, he said, the private sector has increased jobs by only 28,000. In an average recovery that would be closer to 400,000, he added.
In other trading, the three-year note was offered at 10311/32, up 11/32 to yield 4.57 percent, compared with 4.69 percent on Thursday. In the pre-auction, or when-issued, market, the new three-year note to be auctioned Tuesday was trading at a yield of 4.71 percent.
The five-year note, with a coupon of 5.5 percent, was offered at 9925/32, up 15/32 to yield 5.50 percent, compared with 5.66 percent on Thursday. This was a big recovery for this note, which was auctioned at a record low average yield of 5.56 percent at the end of July, only to see the price fall so sharply that the yield jumped to 5.82 percent a week ago.
The 10-year note closed up 21/32 at 10625/32 to yield 6.54 percent, compared with 6.63 percent the day before. In the pre-auction market, the new 10-year note to be auctioned Wednesday was trading at a yield of 6.54 percent. The new 30-year bond to be auctioned Thursday was offered in the pre-auction market at a yield of 7.36 percent.

HEADLINE: JOBLESS RATE DIPS A NOTCH TO 7.7% IN MIXED SHOWING

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
The nation's jobless rate improved marginally last month, edging down to 7.7 percent from 7.8 percent in June, the Government reported yesterday, thanks in part to a Federal summer jobs program for teen-agers. But the improvement was not enough to signal a stronger economic recovery or to help President Bush as he heads into the Republican National Convention.
Indeed, in some areas the employment situation was deteriorating. Unemployment in New Jersey jumped to 9.8 percent in July from 9.2 percent in June, and in New York State the jobless rate grew to 9.4 percent, from 9.2 percent in June. 
 Nationally, nonfarm payrolls climbed by 198,000 jobs in July, including about 75,000 summer positions for teen-agers financed by Federal funds voted after the Los Angeles riots. Even with the gain in payrolls, an unemployment rate of 7.7 percent represents 9.8 million Americans out of work.
 
President Welcomes News
 President Bush, commenting yesterday on the jobs report at a White House news conference devoted mostly to the situation in Bosnia, said that he was pleased. "We are poised for a strong recovery," he said. "And we have been growing, albeit anemically,"
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, Mr. Bush's Democratic rival, contended on a campaign bus tour that the economic recovery would not gain momentum as long as Mr. Bush was President.
"I think it's very interesting that just last week the White House refused to take responsibility, and now when there is some economic news they say, 'Here we come, " he told a crowd in La Crosse, Wis. "What we must turn around is the declining economic earnings of the American people. That can't be turned around without a new economic strategy."
The July gain in jobs was a decided improvement over June, when payrolls declined by 63,000, a number revised upward yesterday from the decline of 117,000 originally reported. The June jobless rate, at 7.8 percent, was the highest in eight years.
Yesterday's report gave no suggestion that the economic recovery was breaking out of its painfully slow pace or, more important, that job growth was picking up enough to push the unemployment rate down signficantly before the election in November.
"There couldn't be worse political news for George Bush," said Peter Hart, a pollster for Democratic candidates. "He wants the American people to believe prosperity is around the corner, but these numbers show it is way over the horizon."
Republicans were not particularly cheered by the numbers, either. "I'm glad I'm not running for President this year," said Representative Richard Armey, Republican of Texas, who has a Ph.D. in economics. He said, however, that he was cautiously optimistic that consumers would soon become a bit more confident.
 
Stagnant Period Seen
 Most forecasters, looking at the remainder of the year, see more of the same: an economy that is just muddling along. And few think unemployment is likely to drop below 7.5 percent by November.
"June was a bad month," said David Wyss, an economist at DRI/McGraw Hill. "July was a mediocre month."
Ted Van Dyk, a longtime Democratic policy adviser, said, "The Democrats can't cry depression; on the other hand, President Bush has no valid claim that the economy is strengthening."
Other political analysts agreed that the dip in unemployment in July would not help the President appreciably.
"The fact that the unemployment numbers varied slightly isn't going to change Americans' basic concerns about a stagnating economy and jobs," said Kevin Phillips, a Republican political analyst who has often been at odds with the Reagan and Bush Administrations.
 
Needing a Push
 The trouble, from the President's vantage point, is that few economists see the kind of rebound in spending and hiring that could push unemployment down fast enough to restore consumer confidence to feel-good levels.
"The job growth in July is good news, but the economy needs stronger jobs growth closer to historic norms for recoveries," said the President's chief economic adviser, Michael J. Boskin.
The typical recovery in the years since World War II has pushed the number of private-sector jobs up nearly 5 percent in its first 15 months; in today's economy, that would be four million new jobs. Assuming, as many economists still do, that the recession ended in the spring of 1991, this recovery has produced fewer than 200,000 nongovernment jobs so far.
"The shortfall in jobs is really staggering," said Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. "That's why most Americans still feel like there's a recession."
 
A Seasonal Factor
 Of the 198,000 new nonfarm payroll jobs -- the number that economists watch to gauge whether the economy is expanding or contracting -- 75,000 were temporary summer jobs that will disappear after Labor Day. "There could be some backsliding in the numbers then," Representative Armey said.
Economists focused on the remaining 123,000 new jobs, noting that the economy would have to churn out about that many new jobs each month to prevent another uptick in unemployment. The economy has been generating an average of 75,000 jobs a month since the beginning of the year, and the average pace for the last two months is even lower, 60,000.
As many industries are still losing jobs as are expanding payrolls. Virtually all the job growth has come in the sprawling service sector, which employs four out of five American workers these days. Business services, including temporary-help companies, health care and restaurants, did most of the hiring.
But jobs in construction and manufacturing -- the industries that typically lead job rebounds -- continued to shrink, with military contractors and computer makers announcing layoffs in recent weeks.
"That's normally the driving edge of the economy, and it's not driving," Mr. Wyss said.
 
Some Setbacks Noted
 But the biggest disappointment was that the total number of hours worked by all employees in the private sector was flat. The hours put in by manufacturing workers actually slipped a bit as overtime declined, a sign that industrial production may have remained weak in July.
"The second quarter ended on a very weak note, and the third quarter didn't start on a much stronger one," said Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch.
Wages, the Labor Department reported, did not rise either. Average hourly earnings remained at their June level of $10.58, just 2.3 percent above their level a year ago.
While that is good news for inflation prospects, the data suggest that personal income continues to stagnate. Since consumers have already been squeezing their savings in order to spend a little more, weak job growth and flat wages do not bode well for future spending.
"If George Bush had a magic wand, and he could make one wish, it would be to get unemployment below 6 percent," Mr. Hart, the pollster, said. "The news he has gotten today is one more indication that his wish is not going to be granted."

HEADLINE: New York - Washington $5 Is Cheaper Fare Since 1952

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
Move over Delta, United and American. Another savage fare war is under way, driving down the price of a bus ride between Manhattan and Washington to $5.
Five dollars. 
 That is the lowest price on the route since 1952, when Truman was President and Greyhound charged $5.05 -- a sale price then, too. And it is less than the trip cost in 1939, when LaGuardia was Mayor and the bus ride down to Washington cost $5.50.
In a money-losing battle, the country's two-largest bus companies, Greyhound and Peter Pan Trailways, have knocked the price down three times in the last three weeks from its $25 starting point.
 
Doesn't Cover the Costs
 The bus industry's rule of thumb is that operating costs average $2 a mile, or roughly $478 for the trip from New York to Washington. At the current fares, a full bus with 47 passengers does not cover even half the expenses.
Travel on the route has quadrupled during the fare war, the bus companies say. Among the travelers was Dorothy Melvin of Jersey City, who left yesterday on a weekend trip to the nation's capital, her first bus ride in more than 50 years.
"I never even thought of going any place," she said, "least of all Washington, where I'm angry with everybody there, anyways." But she could not resist the bargain, she said as she waited at the end of a long Greyhound boarding line at the Port Authority Bus Terminal in midtown Manhattan.
Yesterday, hundreds of Greyhound and Peter Pan passengers of all ages and races created snaking lines through the terminal.
One was Thomas Knierim of Manhattan, who said his trip to Washington this weekend would be the first time he had traveled by bus since Ronald Reagan's first term. "But with a fare this cheap . . ." he said with a shrug.
The price war has created such a wave of demand that Peter Pan said last night that it had started limiting the $5 fare to the first 20 passengers on each trip, charging the remaining passengers $25.
Peter Pan, the country's largest privately owned bus company, said it was responding to Greyhound's curtailment of service. But Greyhound executives denied they had reduced their service and said the $5 fare remained available for all seats on the route.
Both companies have said the $5 fare will run only through Aug. 16.
"Someday we want to break even and make some money," said Robert J. Schwarz, executive vice president of Peter Pan.
For now, what the companies are losing in revenue, they hope to gain in publicity and customer loyalty. That is especially important to Peter Pan, which is trying to establish its fledgling operation between New York and Washington.
 
How It All Began
 The seeds of the fare war lay in the decision earlier this year by American Coach Lines of Maryland to quit the Washington-New York route. It suffered from low ridership despite its $25 one-way fare.
On June 1, American sold its Washington terminal to Peter Pan, which had been trying to find a way to expand beyond New England, where it has operated quietly and profitably for decades.
Peter Pan kept the $25 fare but soon realized it needed to turn some heads. So on July 24, it introduced a $9.95 one-way special.
Greyhound responded by lowering its fare to $7 from $25, and Peter Pan answered with $6.95. Last Friday Greyhound went to $5, which Peter Pan immediately matched.
"Our message was simple," Mr. Schwarz said of Peter Pan, which is based in Springfield, Mass. "We're in the market to stay, and they're not going to send us home."
The underdog, Peter Pan is trying to secure an edge over its much better-known competitor. Most of its buses on the New York-Washington route show movies, and the company promises it will roll out extra buses -- even for a single passenger. It also promises to give customers advice on how to get to Broadway theaters and the F.A.O. Schwarz toy store -- the New York attractions its riders most frequently inquire about.
But executives of Greyhound say their customer surveys suggest movies are not an important amenity. And the company says it needs at least half a busload before it will send an extra coach down the road. It acknowledges that operators at its telephone information centers in Charlotte, N.C., and Omaha know little about New York geography and theater schedules.
Greyhound, however, likes to point out that it has 11 departures at the discount fare each day, in each direction, while Peter Pan has only 6 each way. On top of the current cut-rate fares, Greyhound is also offering half-price fares for most children, which Peter Pan is not.
 
Clinton's Peter Pan Tour
 Last month, Peter Pan had another opportunity for publicity. The Democratic Party chartered five of the company's buses, including its V.I.P. coach, for the bus tour from New York to St. Louis by Bill Clinton, the Presidential candidate, and his running mate, Al Gore, that followed the party's convention in Madison Square Garden.
"They did not receive any consideration that another customer would not receive for a multiday charter," Mr. Schwarz said.
The buses were part of the backdrop in the candidates' frequent stops on the trip. "We were all over the place," Mr. Schwarz said. "We got the greatest publicity in America."
 
An Industry in Decline
 If nothing else, the fare war has added some excitement to an industry that has been in decline for nearly two decades.
With roughly 70 percent of the market for scheduled bus service, Greyhound, a publicly traded company that operates in 48 states, has felt that decline particularly hard. Through the first six months of the year, its ridership was off more than 10 percent from the comparable period in 1991.
Greyhound, based in Dallas, reported earnings of $300,000 for the second quarter on revenues of $165.3 million, a lackluster report for which the company blamed the recession and the airline fare wars. Greyhound emerged in October after more than a year of operating under bankruptcy protection from its creditors, a status it sought after a violent strike.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Credit-Card Late Payment Fees Backed

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
A Federal appeals court has blocked the attempt by Massachusetts to prevent out-of-state banks from collecting late payment fees on credit-card bills sent to state residents. The Federal Court of Appeals in Boston issued the ruling late Thursday.
The case, which involved the Greenwood Trust Company, a Delaware-based subsidiary of Sears, Roebuck & Company that issues the Discover credit card, was closely watched by bankers. It could have set a precedent allowing other states to enforce local limits on late payment fees and other charges by out-of-state banks. 
 Massachusetts law does not allow late payment fees to be charged on loans. But Greenwood was charging a $10 monthly late-payment fee. Large banks that dominate the credit-card industry have ignored such state limits and contended that they were exempted under Federal law.
 
Fees Generate $1.1 Billion
 Limits on credit-card fees would be a severe blow to one of the banking industry's most profitable lines of business. Last year, annual fees plus other fees for late payments, bounced checks or exceeding credit limits produced revenues of $1.13 billion. That was nearly a third of the $3.5 billion of profit that banks earned from credit cards, according to the Nilson Report, a Santa Monica, Calif., newsletter that monitors the credit card industry.
The opinion by Judge Bruce Selya for the appeals court reversed a decision by a lower court last October. It had ruled that a 1980 Federal law allowing credit-card issuers to charge higher rates than would be allowed under state law did not encompass late fees. In the case of fees, the district court said, state limits would apply. Greenwood Trust, which has 100,000 customers in Massachusetts, quickly appealed that decision.
Judge Selya said that when Congress passed the 1980 law the meaning of the word "interest" was broader than just the numerical interest rate charged on the credit card. He noted other cases where it was found that "interest" also encompassed various kinds of fees charged by lenders.
Because 15 states prohibit late-payment fees, and more than half the states have some sort of limit on various fees charged on credit cards, lawyers considered the district court ruling an opportunity to file class-action lawsuits against other banks. By last February, more than a dozen lawsuits had been filed in four states against Greenwood and other banks that were charging late payment fees in states that did not allow the fees.
Beth Metzler, a spokeswoman for Greenwood, said the most recent Federal court decision "sets a strong precedent in our favor" that should apply to the other lawsuits. She said other lawsuits were pending, but declined to say how many or where.
Thomas Samoluk, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Attorney General, Scott Harshbarger, said state officials had not decided whether to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.

HEADLINE: Consumers Reduce Debt

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 7

 BODY:
Consumers reduced their outstanding debt for the fifth consecutive month in June, improving their balance sheets by $1.02 billion, the Federal Reserve reported today.
The decline translated into a 1.7 percent reduction at a seasonally adjusted annual rate and came entirely from a drop in auto loans, which fell by $2.8 billion in June. 
 The June decrease followed declines in debt of $893 million in May and a huge $3.58 billion drop in April. The April decrease, which translated into an annual rate of decline of 5.9 percent, was the biggest drop in a decade.
Both consumers and businesses have been reducing huge debt burdens built up during the bustling years of the 1980's. Consumer debt has declined 11 times in the last 14 months.
While this process is laying the groundwork for healthier economic expansion in the future, it has had a depressing effect on the economy over the last year because consumers busy paying off old debts have not been in the mood to increase spending.
 
Auto Loans Fall 12.9%
 Many economists believe that the debt restructuring may last for at least another year.
In June, outstanding automobile loans fell at a 12.9 percent annual rate after a 2.5 percent drop in May.
Revolving credit, which includes credit cards, rose by $850 million, or 4.2 percent at an annual rate, following a 1.5 percent May increase.
All other consumer loans not secured by real estate rose by $925 million, or 5.1 percent at an annual rate, following a decline of $667 million in May.
The various changes left total consumer debt not secured by real estate at $721.9 billion in June, the lowest total since April 1990.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls on Jobless Data Despite Intervention by Fed

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell yesterday despite repeated intervention in the market by the Federal Reserve, as traders grew concerned that the Government's July employment data meant lower interest rates were on the way.
Gold prices rose. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $350.30 an ounce, up $1.30 from late Thursday. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for gold of $351 an ounce, up $1.65. 
 The Labor Department said the unemployment rate fell slightly in July, to 7.7 percent from 7.8 percent in June. Though the report showed strong job growth last month, economists and currency traders said the figures were artificially enhanced by a temporary Federal jobs program.
Over all, they said, the report gave little hope that the economy was significantly improving. That gave rise to concern that the Fed would once again lower interest rates to stimulate the economy. Lower rates make the dollar less valuable compared with other currencies.
The central bank intervened at least three times in the market yesterday, buying dollars in an attempt to bolster the sagging currency. The first time, the intervention had its intended effect, but the Fed's later moves did not stop the dollar's slide, traders said.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 127.95 Japanese yen, from 127.53 at Thursday's close. In London, it fell to 127.70 yen. In New York, one dollar bought 127.45 yen, down from 127.65 yen late Thursday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.9290, from $1.9080 late Thursday. In New York, one pound cost $1.9295, up from $1.9150 the day before.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.4680 German marks, down from 1.4775; 1.3150 Swiss francs, down from 1.3265; 4.9630 French francs, down from 4.9915; 1,111 Italian lire, down from 1,117.25, and 1.18375 Canadian dollars, down from 1.8505.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday, included: 1.4660 German marks, down from 1.4815; 1.3145 Swiss francs, down from 1.3305; 4.9490 French francs, down from 5.0060; 1.6515 Dutch guilders, down from 1.6705; 1,108.75 Italian lire, down from 1,120.25, and 1.1825 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1858.
London gold prices increased to a late bid of $351.15 an ounce, up from $348.85 late Thursday. In Zurich, gold rose to $351.10, up from $348.30 bid on Thursday. In Hong Kong, gold was up 97 cents to close at $349.97.

HEADLINE: Immigration Still Makes America What It Is

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Bar the Door" (Op-Ed, July 25) Daniel James tries to make a case for the closing of our borders to legal as well as undocumented immigration. The article represents a naive and uninformed approach to this complex situation. I am an immigration lawyer, and my insights and experience contradict Mr. James's conclusions.
Legal immigration is not the problem he suggests. In every generation there was a minority who felt the current wave of immigration would somehow ruin our country. In post-revolutionary America there was a wave of German immigration. The ethnic English Americans thought the Germans would destroy their society. Later the ethnic English and Germans thought the Irish immigrants would ruin the country. The nativists have always been wrong. 
 Between the Revolutionary War and the Civil War the population of the United States grew 10 times, primarily through immigration, and still we maintained our national character while growing economically, geographically and culturally.
Subsequent generations had their own minority opinion that the immigration of Italians, Jews, Chinese and many others would somehow hurt the United States. We took in these immigrants, and America prospered and grew in ways unimagined at the time. The grandchildren of these immigrants continue to make the United States the most vital society the world has known. These same people are bringing ideas of democracy, freedom, individual equality and fair play to their ethnic cousins all over the world, further increasing our country's security.
Mr. James's call to prevent legal immigration is ill advised and unworkable. Restrictions on legal immigration would only bar those most likely to comply with our laws. Now we are burdened with a complex body of immigration laws and regulations that accomplish little and discourage compliance. Economic realities create a magnet for poor undocumented workers. Mexicans and others who are lucky to earn $5 a day at home will come to a country where they can earn more than that per hour.
An enlightened United States Government policy would understand the realities of the situation and work to harness, legalize and tax these workers. This requires workable procedures. When it becomes more profitable to comply with the law than to flout it, employers and alien workers will comply.

HEADLINE: Immigration Still Makes America What It Is;
Invisibility Counts

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Bar the Door" (Op-Ed, July 25), Daniel James argues that illegal aliens "provided the tinder for rioting in Los Angeles and the Washington Heights section of New York City."
He continues: "About 45 percent of South-Central Los Angeles is Hispanic, the Census Bureau says, and many of the newcomers participated in the riots." 
 The day Mr. James's article appeared, the broadcast media identified street gangs as the main participants in the Los Angeles riots. It makes no sense that an illegal alien would engage in activities that could potentially bring him to the attention of the authorities -- any authority.
If asked, an illegal alien would agree that invisibility is an intrinsic part of his existence. Visibility via another illegal act could bring the unwanted attention of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Border Patrol, the National Guard, the Army or other real and imagined adversaries an illegal alien fears.
Mr. James's xenophobia provides a simplistic explanation of the Los Angeles riots. Illegal aliens are helpless scapegoats. Though subject to every kind of harassment, they are legally unable to claim discrimination, physical abuse, victimization by misguided legislation, unemployment or any of the other substantive causes that led to the events in Los Angeles. Mr. James should have the courage to examine the legal population of his own country.

 BODY:
Executives at Pratt & Whitney and Hamilton Standard face pay cuts as the parent company, the United Technologies Corporation, looks to trim costs, company officials said yesterday. Pratt executives will earn 5 percent less through the end of next year, James G. O'Connor, the engine maker's president, said in a letter to employees. 
 "The continued recession in the commercial airline and general aviation industry and even deeper cuts in the defense budget are now pushing production levels even lower than we anticipated," Mr. O'Connor wrote.
Executives at Hamilton Standard, based in Windsor Locks, Conn., will forfeit a week's pay, Robert M. Kuhn, the president, said in a separate statement.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Republicans;
Quayle Says Clinton's Proposals For Economy Will Destroy Jobs

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANSFIELD, Ohio, Aug. 7

 BODY:
Laying the groundwork for a crucial debate on fiscal policy, Vice President Dan Quayle sought to raise fears today that Gov. Bill Clinton's economic and environmental proposals would cost the country almost two million jobs a year.
In doing so, Mr. Quayle became the first member of the Bush Administration to quantify the Republican argument that Democratic proposals for new taxes and stricter Government regulation would break the back of an already fragile economy. But Mr. Quayle's speech to an economic research group in Columbus, Ohio, this morning also signified a grudging recognition within the Bush-Quayle campaign that the 1992 election would be played on what many strategists said was decidedly Democratic turf. 
After recent efforts to focus their campaign on President Bush's foreign policy achievements and Vice President Quayle's family values initiative, both men have now started to critique Mr. Clinton's economic policies with increasing specificity.
 
Making Jobs an Issue
 The tactic is perilous because of the Bush Administration's own lackluster economic record. Mr. Bush has presided over the slowest rate of job creation of any President since World War II.
 But aides to Mr. Quayle said they had accepted the notion that the election would be won or lost on economic issues, and that the Republicans must carry out a two-pronged strategy of blaming the recession on an obstructionist Democratic Congress while feeding fears about Mr. Clinton's policies.
 "Despite the Democrats' new rhetoric, the American people know the substance," Mr. Quayle said in an address to the meeting of Citizens for a Sound Economy, a Washington group that favors market-based solutions to economic problems. "They remember it well from that golden era known as the Carter-Mondale years, that time of double-digit inflation, double-digit unemployment and interest rates approaching 20 percent."
 George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's communications director, said Mr. Quayle's attempt to portray the Arkansas Governor as the ideological successor to President Jimmy Carter was predictable but ultimately would not succeed.
 
Democrats Welcome Issue
 Mr. Stephanopoulos also said the Clinton campaign welcomed any focus on economic issues. "If they want to debate about jobs, let's go," he said.
 Government figures show that the number of jobs in the country grew by seven-tenths of one percent during the three and a half years of the Bush Administration, through May. Job growth was 9.8 percent during President Ronald Reagan's second term, 6.3 percent during Mr. Reagan's first term, and 11.2 percent during Mr. Carter's Presidency.
 Mr. Quayle focused his speech on Mr. Clinton's calls for military cuts, a job training tax, a family leave policy and a health care plan. Citing an analysis conducted by the Republican staff of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, Mr. Quayle said those initiatives would result "in a loss of almost two million jobs in a year." His aides said later that the actual figure was 1.7 million jobs.
 Mr. Stephanopoulos accused Mr. Quayle of numerous distortions and omissions in calculating his job-loss estimate. Among other complaints, he said Mr. Quayle did not credit Mr. Clinton for the job growth that he said would result from a middle-class tax cut and an investment tax credit.
 He also said Mr. Quayle included in his estimate the effects of environmental proposals endorsed by Mr. Gore in his book, "Earth in the Balance: Ecology and the Human Spirit," some of which Mr. Clinton has not embraced.
 In Washington today, William K. Reilly, directory of the Environmental Protection Agency, broke ranks with the White House and said Mr. Gore was not an "environmental extremist."
 The Reuters news agency reported that Mr. Reilly said in a videotaped interview for "John McLaughlin's One on One" that he respected Mr. Gore's book and thought the Tennessee Senator would help Democrats win votes in California.
 The program is scheduled to be broadcast this weekend.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Democrats;
Clinton, on Bus Tour, Puts New Emphasis on Courage

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS, Aug. 7

 BODY:
Up to now in his campaign for President, Gov. Bill Clinton has used the public's yearning for change as a way of scoring political points. Now, aware that the desire for change can sometimes be outweighed by the fear of it, Mr. Clinton is begun stressing a new theme: courage.
 As his eight-bus motorcade has wound its way along the Mississippi River from Missouri to Minnesota, Mr. Clinton has exhorted crowds to have the fortitude to accept changes and to resist Republican attempts to portray him and his running mate, Senator Al Gore of Tennessee, as "two young guys with strange ideas." 
This country has been around for 200 years because at every pivotal point in our history, we have had the courage to change," Mr. Clinton said at a rally in downtown Minneapolis that ended his three-day bus tour in the upper Middle West.
 The comment was typical of the theme the Democratic nominee struck throughout his five-state tour. It is a message that has cropped up in speeches in good-sized Iowa cities like Bettendorf and Cedar Rapids, and at smaller towns like Elkader, where the candidates spoke to evening visitors to the Clayton County Fair, with a corn field rising on a hill behind them as a backdrop.
 But in making the case for accepting the risk of change, Mr. Clinton seldom tells his crowds what those risks might be, and what, if any, sacrifices they might entail.
 
Gain, but No Pain
 Indeed, except for his appearance at a high school in East St. Louis, Ill., where he told an all-black audience that the poor would have to shoulder a measure of responsibility for alleviating their own plight, Mr. Clinton did little but promise a golden future achieved without pain.
 The shift in Mr. Clinton's basic appeal seems to be an attempt to counter the Republican barrage that is painting the Democratic ticket as at best untried and at worst as disguising a traditional Democratic "tax and spend" program behind the oratory of change.
 "Our opponents in this race, you know what they're going to say," Mr. Clinton said at a morning rally on the banks of the Black River, a tributary of the Mississippi in La Crosse. "They're going to say Clinton and Gore are rookies; they're just two young fellows with a lot of strange ideas and they can make things worse."
 President Bush, in campaign commercials that began this week and in public appearances in New York, Colorado Springs and at a press conference in Washington today, has mounted an offensive against the notion of change for its own sake. In his commercial, the President stares intently into the camera and says he agrees that change is necessary but adds, "Change must be guided by principles."
 Today, Mr. Bush said that after the Republican National Convention "you're going to see hard-hitting attacks that are going to fairly define his positions."
 Aides to Mr. Clinton say his recent comments are not new, but they acknowledge that he is emphasizing the message more forcefully on his bus tour.
 "Change requires some risk and therefore it is somewhat harder to vote for Bill Clinton than it is to vote for George Bush," Dee Dee Myers, the Clinton campaign's press secretary said Thursday outside a metal works factory in Davenport, Iowa.
 Ms. Myers added: "George Bush is trying to make the campaign one that's about who do you trust. If he wants to talk about change he's not very credible and Bill Clinton is trying to redefine trust."
 Yet, as he talks of change and of the fortitude needed to take risks, Mr. Clinton seems to be proffering dual messages: one for largely black audiences and the other for predominantly white ones.
 "If Al Gore and Bill Clinton go to Washington to the White House, our job is to create opportunity," Mr. Clinton said at East St. Louis High School. "Your job is to come up with the responsibility to seize that opportunity and make it work and to find out exactly how to win in this global economy."
 As Mr. Clinton moved up the Mississippi Valley, visiting small towns with overwhelmingly white populations, he gave no hint of any of the kinds of sacrifices or shifts in attitudes that would be asked of those voters.
 He has told crowds in this primarily agricultural region that he does not support cutting farm subsidies, unless the nation's major trading partners also reduce theirs. After listing a number of costly programs that would help middle-class families, including the establishment of a plan to provide basic health insurance, Mr. Clinton said he would pay for them by reining in the nation's health-care costs, increasing taxes on the very rich, shifting money from the military budget and reducing the Federal work force by 100,000 people through attrition.
 When asked what changes a Clinton Presidency might ask voters to accept, Ms. Myers mentioned welfare reform. When asked what else, she mentioned corporations' being asked to pay top executives less money, parents' being asked to become more involved in their children's education and teachers' beingasked to take competency examinations, though she quickly added that Mr. Clinton was not advocating that as Governmental policy.
 Indeed, save for welfare reform, none of the items she listed involved Government policy.

Turning Back to the Classics
Robertson Davies urges us to turn, and turn again, to the great books we first encountered in our youth, in this excerpt from a talk included in "The Tanner Lectures on Human Values: Volume 13, 1992," edited by Grethe B. Peterson (University of Utah). 
 The great sin . . . is to assume that something that has been read once has been read forever. As a very simple example I mention Thackeray's "Vanity Fair." People are expected to read it during their university years. But you are mistaken if you think you read Thackeray's book then; you read a lesser book of your own. It should be read again when you are 36, which is the age of Thackeray when he wrote it. It should be read for a third time when you are 56, 66, 76, in order to see how Thackeray's irony stands up to your own experience of life. Perhaps you will not read every page in these later years, but you really should take another look at a great book, in order to find out how great it is, or how great it has remained, to you. You see, Thackeray was an artist, and artists deserve this kind of careful observation. We must not gobble their work, like chocolates, or olives, or anchovies, and think we know it forever. Nobody ever reads the same book twice.
 
The Uses of Silence
Many Indian tribes were as eloquent in their use of silence as in their oratory, according to Joel Sherzer in an essay in "America in 1492: The World of the Indian Peoples Before the Arrival of Columbus," edited by Alvin M. Josephy Jr. (Knopf).
 
While speaking well and often for long periods of time was a much-noted feature of Native American life, it contrasted strikingly with another frequent use of language, especially in North America: the selective absence of speech -- silence and laconic pithiness. Apaches and other groups living in the present-day U.S. Southwest observed silence in certain moments -- when meeting strangers, during the initial stages of courtship, between relatives and friends after a long period of separation, in response to shouted insults and criticism, in the company of someone whose spouse or kinsman had just died and during the performance of a curing ritual. In addition, many North American Indians, including the Apaches, were celebrated for their pithy, laconic humor. . . . The stereotype of the silent Indian is clearly incorrect and is no doubt based in part on a misunderstanding of Native American rules of verbal and nonverbal etiquette.
 
Writing to Rediscover the World
 Writers, Andrei Bitov suggests, often discover what they know about the world only by writing it down. This is from his memoir "A Captive of the Caucasus" (Farrar, Straus & Giroux).
 
Living prose breaks through your personal time and anticipates your experience in many ways. Not only is the new book your life while you're writing it, not only is it the previous life experience that's included in it, but it's also your fate, your future. If you were merely narrating for the reader, it would be sheer boredom, and when you're bored, what can you write? The fact is that if a man writes, he himself comes to know things he didn't know before. Writing is his method of cognition. Geniuses, perhaps, come to know things that no one knew before them. Others rediscover: for themselves, for people like them, for their time. Strictly speaking, a man gives the world nothing new. When he suddenly discovers that there are things in this world he didn't know before, he believes they're new . . . but if he has found them, they already existed. He just didn't know it. New and old do not exist in the world, because everything in it is now.
 
The Velvet No
 The art of the rejection slip, used to return unwanted manuscripts to writers, may have reached its apex with one cited by the British scholar Glyn Daniel in a collection of his columns, "Writing for Antiquity: An Anthology of Editorials From Antiquity" (Thames and Hudson).
 
We have never had a formal rejection slip or letter to send out week after week to the many contributors who kindly send in notes or articles for consideration, and for whose work we sadly cannot or gladly do not want to find space, but we are encouraged to draft one, inspired by that used by the editors of a Chinese economics journal, and referred to in The Times Diary, 9 July 1982:
"We have read your manuscript with boundless delight. If we were to publish your paper it would be impossible for us to publish any work of a lower standard. As it is unthinkable that, in the next thousand years, we shall see its equal, we are, to our regret, compelled to return your divine composition, and to beg you a thousand times to overlook our short sight and timidity."
 
Why We Need Angry Gourmets
 Without short-tempered connoisseurs of cuisine, Waverley Root argues, we'd be perpetually at the mercy of the second-rate. This is from "The Food of France" (Vintage, paper).
 
The Frenchman is an individualist. On its reverse side (every virtue is accompanied by its inseparable vices) this may make him selfish and an egotist. He is thus enabled to be unforgiving if he is badly served. His favorite restaurant may have produced for him a thousand superb meals one after the other, but let the thousand and first be unsatisfactory and he rises in wrath to denounce incompetence. I would rather he did not so when I am present, but I am glad that France is full of his kind to keep French cooks up to snuff. We all know what happens to the perfect little restaurant that is discovered by tourists not educated by a lifetime of exposure to French food to the detection of minor imperfections. When it discovers that it can fill its tables quite as readily without taking nearly as many pains in the kitchen . . . it proceeds, naturally enough, to take less pains in the kitchen. We need the angry gourmet to keep standards up.

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE VIEW;
A Design That Taps Into the 'Informational City'

BYLINE: By Herbert Muschamp

 BODY:
The financial trading firm of D. E. Shaw & Company cannot be accused of asserting too high an urban profile. Lodged on the top two floors of a skyscraper on West 45th Street in midtown Manhattan, the company's new offices are invisible from the street. Inside, it is the city that fades from sight. Though most of the windows command stunning skyline views, this vista is highly selective. It offers no sign of the social disarray that the phrase "urban America" has conjured up in recent months. Yet Steven Holl, who earlier this year received an award from the American Institute of Architects for his design of the Shaw offices, has something important to say about the links between offices and cities. He shows that even an office interior can enlarge our picture of the social and economic forces at work in the city today.
Firms like D. E. Shaw are only partly located in New York. They conduct their business in what Manuel Castells, a professor of planning at the University of California at Berkeley, calls the "informational city" -- the international network of electronic communications that keeps the global economy humming. The "streets" of this city have no potholes. They are paved not with asphalt but with telephone lines and radio waves that stretch between cities and leap across national borders. Plugged into this grid by faxes and modems, executives may have stronger economic and social ties to offices halfway around the world than to crumbling communities on their doorsteps. 
 D. E. Shaw operates almost around the clock, though for much of that time the firm's windowless, hexagonal trading room is unattended by human hands. Machines hold down the fort. Silently, with lights flickering, batteries of computers go about their programmed business, responding to worldwide fluctuations in market values. These machines are the traffic lights of the informational city. Their codes manage the flow of symbols that can be translated by other programs into investments, profits, castles in Spain and skyscrapers in mid-Manhattan.
Steven Holl has translated that flow into design: a work place that evokes the floating, abstract realm in which his client operates. Right at the entrance, Mr. Holl lets us know that we are leaving familiar ground. His reception area offers no ficus trees, no sectional sofas, no corporate art on the walls, no plunging skyline views. Instead, we are ushered into a luminous void: a cube of space, two stories tall, suffused with unearthly light.
The source of the light is hidden. A pale yellow-green accented with blushes of blue and red, it radiates from rectangular notches and recesses cut into the cube's white walls. Like stained glass windows, but without the glass, these luminous panels decompose the walls' solid boundaries. They create the effect of a room pitched halfway between the planes of energy and matter.
Mr. Holl achieves this ethereal effect with remarkable economy of means. He and his project architect, Thomas Jenkinson, have applied bright fluorescent light to the back and bottom surfaces of the rectangular openings, where it is hidden from the eye. A mix of natural and fluorescent light bounces the color onto neutral white walls. Black vinyl floor tiles pick up the reflections, deepening the illusion of dissolving space. The reception area doubles as a central atrium for the two-floor office complex. Corridors lead off to the trading room, a conference room and private offices. Mr. Holl has furnished these rooms handsomely with custom-designed furniture, but, working within a restricted budget, he has concentrated his resources on that grand opening gesture. He has even given it a name -- Spatial Color Reflection -- as though it were a formalist sculpture.
Yet like the work of James Turrell, which they closely resemble, Mr. Holl's panels of light offer more than visually appealing forms. They produce richly evocative content. Poised between the solid and the immaterial, they function metaphorically as windows into the electronic realm where wealth is transformed into abstract blips on a computer screen. The symbolism is not literal here. Mr. Holl's design is not meant to remind us of video terminals. Rather, it offers a poetic interpretation of what Manuel Castells calls "the space of flows" -- the global communications channels through which money sloshes around the world, from New York to Tokyo, Singapore to London.
Of course, for those who are not plugged into the flow, there's no comfort in the idea that wealth is an abstraction. Nor is there anything abstract about the economic barriers that insulate enclaves of plenty from the ravages of inner-city life. Notwithstanding a low budget, Mr. Holl has made a work of art from, and about, the cash flow of the haves. Is this something to applaud at a time when the national conscience is rewakening to the plight of the have-nots?
Yes, if we value art that gives us a clearer picture of the way the world works. And if we've had it up to the skyline with designs that only blur that picture, or paint a false one: nostalgic buildings and retro interiors that blind us to the conditions in which cities find themselves. The "informational city" has produced a crisis for cities like New York. It has drained away economic vitality and helped to widen the gap between rich and poor. Obviously, design cannot solve this crisis. It can't take the place of public policies that might more effectively integrate the global economy with local needs and resources. But design can help to prevent us from slipping into escapism. It can set a creative example.
Mr. Holl's design takes the Shaw offices to a place as novel as the information technology that paid to build them. When we walk in the door of D. E. Shaw, we know we're not in 1960's Manhattan or Colonial New England. For that matter, we've left even much of present-day New York far below on the ground. Standing inside the Holl atrium, we've got our head in the clouds and our feet firmly planted on solid air.

HEADLINE: WHY PARIS WORKS

 BODY:
According to your article, Paris "works" because it receives lavish subsidies from the French Government and because it excludes the poor, who are let into the city only to sweep its streets (by hand!) and to collect its garbage. So what else is new? Have you been to Beverly Hills, Palm Beach or similar affluent enclaves lately? Have you noticed their immaculate streets, beautiful landscaping and low crime rate? Even in our much maligned Manhattan, Park Avenue and Sutton Place compare favorably with any Parisian boulevard.
The article made passing reference to ordinary French workers and immigrants who live in the stark high-rise squalor of the suburbs. Their growing problems of drugs, crime and unemployment sound a lot like those of our American cities. The only difference is that the French have ghettoized their suburbs instead of their cities. 
 I would prefer to read an article about how to make cities work for everyone, rich and poor, native and immigrant, black and white.

HEADLINE: Can Wal-Mart Keep Growing at Breakneck Speed?

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

 BODY:
Investors have long wondered when some air would start to leak from the amazingly buoyant shares of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., one of the great growth stocks of the last decade.
The market value of the giant discount retailer doubled in 1991 as the stock climbed to an all-time high of $59.875 a share by Jan. 2 this year, from $1.33 a share 10 years earlier. 
 Yet the stock then slumped to below $51 in a period when investors were unloading growth stocks of many varieties. The illness of Wal-Mart's founder, Sam Walton, who died April 5 at age 74, added more uncertainty.
After rising from the backwoods of Arkansas to become the nation's biggest retailer in less than 30 years, has Wal-Mart's bloom begun to fade?
Many retailing analysts and consultants are saying no emphatically. They see growth prospects so strong that Wal-Mart has a shot at dethroning the century-old oil giant, Exxon, within a year as the company with the highest stock-market value in the nation, probably at more than $80 billion. Exxon stands at $79 billion, Philip Morris at $74 billion and Wal-Mart, which closed at $57.375 on Friday, at $66 billion.
"We're a believer that Wal-Mart will reach $200 billion in sales by the end of this decade," said Jeffrey M. Feiner, senior retailing analyst at Salomon Brothers. Mr. Feiner projects sales this year at $55 billion, and $68 billion in 1993.
Wal-Mart appears to be running on all cylinders. Sales in stores open for at least a year rose 12 percent in the six months ended July 31, matching the highest yearly rate since 1986. Operating expenses, including wages and advertising, fell to 15.3 percent of sales last year, the lowest ever for Wal-Mart and far below comparable efficiency readings at rivals K Mart and Sears, Roebuck; the latter has a higher mix of big-ticket goods that require more employee time. Wal-Mart's net income and sales per employee have also risen strongly.
Return on investment was a staggering 30 percent in the last fiscal year, which ended Jan. 31, a slight decline but still remarkable for a company of Wal-Mart's size and more than double the average returns for the Standard & Poor's 500. In spite of a weak economy, Wal-Mart's sales soared by 26 percent in the six months ended in July, compared with a gain of 8.5 percent for K Mart and a decline of 0.6 percent at Sears.
How can Wal-Mart keep growing at this pace through the decade? One answer is that its nimble distribution system has started to penetrate high-population areas in California and the Northeast, as well as Mexico.
Another reason is Wal-Mart's entry into the $300 billion supermarket business through its 12 new Wal-Mart Supercenters, whose wares include soda, dog food and other grocery staples under a private label, Sam's American Choice. A large food distribution center is under construction in Arkansas to support as many as 90 Supercenters. Analysts expect 400 Supercenters by 1996.
The other big growth engine for Wal-Mart is Sam's Wholesale Clubs. Sales in the division, begun in 1983, rose 43 percent last year, to more than $9 billion. The stores, copied by Sam Walton from the Price Company, stock 3,500 items, including computers and birthday cakes. Wal-Mart has 233 of the stores, up from 184 a year ago, and dominates that segment of retailing. Sales rose 31 percent in the six months ended in July, to $5.6 billion.
"We've got more opportunity ahead of us than anything we've ever experienced," said David D. Glass, Wal-Mart's president and chief executive, in a recent interview. "All we've got to do is be smart enough and capable enough to capitalize on it."
For all its prospects, Wal-Mart faces threats from rivals that have copied its discount formula in retailing niches, such as Home Depot in building supplies. And K Mart, Sam Walton's model for the original Wal-Marts, has reaped gains from a $3 billion renovation campaign begun three years ago and a broader move into specialty stores in sporting goods and building supplies, warehouse clubs, and discount stores for drugs, books and office supplies. K Mart's head of investor relations, Orren Knauer, said the Michigan-based retailer's biggest sales gains this year have come in the South, where it battles Wal-Mart more than in any other region.
Yet Wal-Mart retains many advantages, analysts said. Its everyday-low-price strategy has convinced many customers that Wal-Mart does have low prices. The strategy also eliminates periodic sales, which lowers advertising and labor costs.
The $500 million Wal-Mart added to employee profit-sharing accounts since 1986, or 9 percent of net income, has given thousands of hourly paid workers with more than 10 years at the company accounts valued at more than $100,000. Eighty percent of the money was invested in Wal-Mart stock. K Mart is experimenting with a similar plan. Sears has put more than $400 million into an employee profit-sharing plan since 1986.
Wal-Mart's shares, up 9 percent since the low point in April, should add 20 percent more in the next year, said Daniel D. Barry, retailing analyst at Merrill Lynch. Mr. Barry upgraded his Wal-Mart rating to a "buy" last Wednesday, the day before the company announced a sales surge of 28 percent in July from a year earlier.
Wal-Mart shares are pricey, at 38 times earnings and twice the level of the S.& P. 500 index. But sales should rise at a faster rate for the rest of the year, Mr. Barry said, and investors generally will favor growth stocks again in a sluggish economy.

HEADLINE: At Work;
While the Men Wait at Home

BYLINE: By BARBARA PRESLEY NOBLE

 BODY:
Layoffs are mounting at such a relentless pace this summer that the once securely employed may wonder who put the work force abacus in the hands of the devil. Nervous employees who really want to stare fear in the face should watch the documentary "Fast Food Women" tomorrow night (check local listings) on the public television series "P.O.V." Anne Lewis Johnson's film on women forced by chance and necessity into low-paying, no-benefits jobs in the fast-food industry is a cautionary tale in downward mobility.
It may be going too far to say that Eastern Kentucky, one of the most chronically impoverished regions of the country, could be a bellwether for the American economy in general. But on the topic of jobs, the area is much like many elsewhere in the nation, devastated by the decline of an industry -- coal -- and the consequent reverberations throughout communities and families. 
 In Whitesburg, the small town where Ms. Johnson lives and works, and, in 1989, did most of the filming of "Fast Food Women," the waning of the coal industry has led to 40 to 50 percent unemployment. The jobs paid coal miners, almost always men, salaries of $12 to $17 an hour, depending on whether they worked in union or nonunion mines, as well as medical, vacation and retirement benefits.
The men, naturally enough, want, and wait for, work that allows them to support their families at the level they had come to enjoy. The wives have picked up the pieces.
"We had everything," Sereda Collier, a fast-food cook whose husband was laid off after 17 years in the mines, tells the off-camera interviewer. "Well, we didn't have everything," she laughs. Her uniform includes a trompe l'oeil-hamburger hat. "But he had a good job." Jobs are in the local service economy, which in Appalachia, as in many post-industrial regions, is not dominated by high- or even medium-paid consulting or other "knowledge work" but by fast food.
"Ninety-five percent of the applications I take in are female," says Marion Clark, co-owner and manager of the local branch of the Druthers restaurant chain. Indeed, few men, are in evidence in Mr. Clark's restaurant, or in the McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken or Pizza Hut outlets where Ms. Johnson took her videocamera.
As any woman knows, the absence of men in a workplace is one of the danger signs of low wages, and, indeed, the women's pay ranged at the time of filming from the waiter's minimum wage of $2.05 an hour plus tips to 10 or 15 cents over the standard minimum wage of $3.35. The current range, after an increase in 1990, is $2.13 an hour plus tips to $4.25 an hour.
Like most fast-food industry jobs, these pay no benefits. One company spokesman explains that the teen-agers who generally work behind a fast-food counter aren't looking for a pension and other frills. "Susie is 16 years old. Her father works in the coal mine," says Mike Super, the human resources manager at Druthers' corporate office in Louisville, referring to an archetypal teen-ager. "Susie doesn't need benefits."
Nor, apparently, are teen-agers looking for excitement, at least at work. Industry efficiency experts have reduced the tasks of making fast-food into irreducible elements. The work is hard, repetitive and, true to its name, fast. It presents employees with few challenges and little hope for advancement, financially or otherwise. "We are not looking for creativity as much..." one Druthers executive acknowledges, looking over at a colleague who finishes his thought: "...as looking for somebody that would be more content with following procedures and practices and getting their sense of achievement from an area other than being creative about it."
It is a strength of the film that Ms. Johnson doesn't turn the company representatives into villains or the women into superheroes. But it is impossible to watch the women's tired testimony without wondering about the social costs of a cheap burger.
Not one of the film's fast-food women is making more than 25 cents over the current minimum wage. Nellie Kincer had to leave her long-time cooking job at Kentucky Fried Chicken to have an operation she paid for. She earns about $4.50 an hour and puzzles on camera about how she will manage in old age with only her Social Security "benefits." Her children are on their own but she is helping support her elderly parents. After nine years at Druthers, Sereda Collier is supporting her family on roughly $4.40 an hour. The moment her husband gets a job, she says, she's gone.
 
 
A FILM MAKER FROM COAL COUNTRY
 Anne Lewis Johnson didn't have to look far for the topic of her documentary film "Fast Food Women." One of the fast-food restaurants she filmed was across the street from her office at Appalshop, a filmmaker's collective in Whitesburg, Ky. "We began noticing that the people working at fast-food restaurants were not kids," she said in an interview last week.
She was given access to restaurants for filming, she thinks, because they are owned by local franchisees and because she and Appalshop -- the name is condensed from Appalachian Workshop -- are fixtures in Whitesburg. "I wasn't an outsider looking in," she said. "They had seen our work."
Ms. Lewis has been a film- and video-maker for almost 20 years, much of it "in the coal fields." She was an associate director on "Harlan County U.S.A.," the acclaimed film of a miner's strike, and has won awards for her own work, which includes "On Our Own Land," about strip mining, and, with Mimi Pickering, "Chemical Valley," about a toxic waste spill near Charleston, W.Va.
She allows the women in the film to speak for themselves, without narration. That, to some degree, obscures her own voice, which, if quiet, is nevertheless firm. She has been asked how companies can pay their workers more without having to charge more for a burger. She points out that the burgers have hidden costs because most of the women can't make it without government benefits. "I help pay for food stamps and health care," she said. "They are charging me more."

E.D.S. Reaches for Japan

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
The Electronic Data Systems Corporation is the world's biggest provider of computer services, with $7 billion in sales last year, and by the year 2000 it wants to be a truly global company, leading in all major markets.
By that measure, E.D.S. has to move quickly in Europe and Asia. Eighty percent of its sales last year were in North America, with half of that coming from its parent, General Motors. By contrast, the worldwide market now produces 40 percent of sales in North America and 30 percent each in Europe and Asia. 
 Dallas-based E.D.S. closed in on the European front-runners -- Cap Gemini Sogeti of France, International Business Machines and Andersen Consulting -- with its acquisition last year of SD-Scicon of Geneva.
But Asia, particularly Japan, has been hard to penetrate. Big computer and telecommunications hardware companies like NTT, Hitachi, Fujitsu and I.B.M.-Japan dominate.
"I.B.M. has been successful in Japan, but it took them almost 40 years," said Gary J. Fernandes, 48, senior vice president and head of E.D.S.'s global acquisitions. "Our challenge is to make the same penetration as I.B.M. in Japan, but in one-tenth of the time."
E.D.S. acquired a 19.9 percent stake in Japan System K.K. last February for about $30 million, giving it a bridge to the company's 700 software programmers and systems engineers. Japan System was reeling from falling orders and, after losing more than $40 million on revenues of $80 million, was desperate for cash.
That is usually the case when a Japanese computer company consents to partial American ownership, said Dan Schwartz, publisher of the Japan M&A Reporter and managing director of Ulmer Brothers Inc., a New York investment firm.
He and others expect E.D.S. eventually to increase its stake in Japan System above 50 percent. E.D.S. has rarely been a passive investor. Mr. Fernandes declined to comment, but said that E.D.S. wants more deals in Japan. Thanks to the slumping Japanese economy, E.D.S. may become a welcome suitor.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
There's Growth, But Not Nearly Enough of It

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
Anemia is defined in the dictionary as "lack of vigor or vitality; lifelessness."
That is not a bad definition of the current economic picture. And so it was admirably honest when George Bush told a news conference Friday that the economy "has been anemically growing." 
 To Mr. Bush, of course, the important word in that sentence was "growing." As he said earlier in the week: "The American people think we're in recession and we're not. We've had four quarters of positive growth. Now how did they get that impression?" Mr. Bush's answer was that we in the press keep harping on the bad news.
Or as Donald Kendall, the former Pepsico chairman and now a Republican Party official, said after meeting with Mr. Bush, "Our economy is not in a disaster." Mr. Bush's popularity would improve, he said, "if you in the media start telling the truth."
It is fun to beat up on the press, but if Mr. Bush wants to search out somebody putting out all those bad reports he might start in his own Administration, among the economists who count such things. He might look at the Commerce Department's index of coincident indicators.
He is lucky that index doesn't get the publicity of its cousin, the index of leading indicators, which is supposed to be an economic crystal ball. The coincident one is designed only to describe the present, and seems boring to most reporters. So there was little attention when it was reported that the index of coincident indicators fell in June to its lowest level since July 1987. By that measure of economic activity, there has been no recovery at all.
Now, let's tell the truth, as Mr. Kendall requests. There are reasons not to like those numbers. For reasons that make sense to some but not all statisticians, the Government every month applies a "trend adjustment" factor to the index, automatically lowering it. So if all of the coincident indicators were unchanged in a month, the index would nonetheless drop. Without the trend adjustments, the index bottomed in March 1991, and has done almost nothing since then.
That probably is a fairer picture of the economy, and is one reason trend adjustments have become very controversial within the Commerce Department, and may be dropped next year.
Arguments over statistics are not fascinating stuff, but it is such statistics that must be relied upon in describing the economy. To Mr. Bush, the July employment report was "fairly good news," but it did not show a vibrant private economy. The increase in employment was largely due to hiring by local governments for federally funded summer job programs.
In other words, fiscal policy is helping the economy, while lower interest rates have yet to produce the expected growth. Unfortunately, the huge budget deficits make additional fiscal stimulus difficult. And that is an important reason why Mr. Bush is right when he argues that the economy is growing, but without much vigor or vitality.

HEADLINE: Patching Up L.A. -- A Corporate Blueprint

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
The headquarters of Rebuild Los Angeles, the nonprofit group established after last spring's riots to bring jobs and hope to the city's poorest neighborhoods, is a one-story brick building set between the gleaming corporate towers of downtown and the slums just a few blocks to the south. Casting wary glances in both directions from his office there, Peter V. Ueberroth is issuing perhaps the most direct challenge yet to the business world to tackle the problems of the inner city.
The strategy he is pursuing as the group's chairman is as risky as it is ambitious. Mr. Ueberroth, the former baseball commissioner, said he is counting on considerable help from residents of the community and from the state and Federal governments. But his thrust is clearly to prove that companies, motivated not solely by civic duty but also by cold profit-and-loss calculations, can revive urban America in a way that governments by themselves have failed to do. 
 He sees companies changing the nature of this city's neglected neighborhoods quickly and permanently by opening stores in areas they have shunned, by helping to make bank financing and insurance available, by funding job training and education programs. But perhaps most important, he aims to motivate hundreds of companies to establish small operations in the inner city instead of persuading just a few corporations to set up large plants.
These steps, he said, are critical to achieving his primary goal: the creation of 57,000 permanent new jobs over the next five years in the poorest areas, enough to reduce unemployment to the teens from levels now as high as 60 percent in some of the riot-torn and other neighborhoods.
If he can persuade corporations to heed his call, then their efforts, Mr. Ueberroth insists, can become a blueprint for urban renewal nationwide. Although there have been previous efforts around the country to bring together government, the community and businesses to tackle social problems, none has had the scale or stature of R.L.A. or relied so heavily on the business side. "Frankly, America doesn't solve problems unless it's done by the private sector," said Mr. Ueberroth.
 
Some Who've Joined
 A number of influential companies -- including Hughes Aircraft, the Vons Companies, Mattel and Pioneer Electronics -- have signed on with various degrees of commitment. And Mr. Ueberroth speaks daily with some of the scores of other companies around the country that he says are intrigued by the argument that it is simply good business to operate and create jobs in neglected urban areas.
"I don't think there's a smart, well-managed business that operates in California that hasn't figured out that continued decay in the inner city is real bad for business," Mr. Ueberroth said.
Mr. Ueberroth's initial efforts have been greeted with skepticism and occasional hostility from some community groups and politicians. But as he has scored some successes and repeated endlessly his belief that improvement will involve hundreds of small victories rather than a few headline-grabbing deals, he is gaining a grudging respect even from his critics. And if, as he promises, there are dozens more companies lining up to take part in the effort, he could bring real change to at least some of the city's poorest districts.
"This is a multifaceted program over a long period of time being orchestrated by very creative leadership," said C. Michael Armstrong, chairman of Hughes Aircraft. And the signal effort to persuade companies nationwide to each set up a small inner-city operation, he remarked, "is do-able from the corporate and business world perspective, and it can be successful from the city's point of view."
The group's work has involved considerable effort from Mayor Tom Bradley's administration, as well as community leaders and business executives. But there is no question that Mr. Ueberroth -- who developed an almost mythical reputation here for getting things done when he organized the 1984 Summer Olympics -- is the point man.
He is in many ways an unlikely savior for the inner city. A white Republican from suburban Laguna Beach, the 55-year-old Mr. Ueberroth made a fortune building and then selling a travel business.
He has most recently been a partner in an investment group that has made one major deal, the purchase of HAL Inc., the troubled parent of Hawaiian Airlines. When he was asked by Mayor Bradley and Gov. Pete Wilson to found and lead R.L.A. in early May, he had just finished a report at Governor Wilson's request documenting California's declining economic competitiveness.
 
A Need for Initiative
 To his many critics in Los Angeles political and civic circles, Mr. Ueberroth's approach to running R.L.A. is simply a rehashing of the longstanding -- and in their view, discredited -- conservative formula allowing free-market forces to work their miracles.
"In principle, I have difficulty with the idea of the private sector solving the problems of South Central Los Angeles," said James Johnson, director of the Center for the Study of Urban Poverty at the University of California at Los Angeles. "What is needed in South Central is a WPA-type of initiative where job training is tied to the rebuilding of the community's infrastucture, and only the public sector can do that."
But Mr. Ueberroth -- who serves without pay, has put all his business activities on hold and routinely puts in 14-hour days for R.L.A. -- remains stubbornly optimistic as he criss-crosses the city listening to any community leader with an idea or a request. "It's 80 percent of the time banging your head against the wall," he said, "but there are some signs the wall is beginning to crumble."
Still, the success of R.L.A. is far from assured. Congress and the Bush Administration have moved slowly on their promises to provide significant aid to Los Angeles. And the state government has been so consumed with its fiscal woes that it has barely addressed the needs of Los Angeles.
With the California economy mired in recession and corporations nationwide cutting back, it also remains unclear how many companies will be willing to take part in the kinds of initiatives Mr. Ueberroth is seeking.
The history of corporate involvement in solving urban America's problems is checkered. Some companies, like the Xerox Corporation, have won high marks for their longstanding efforts to be important contributors to the communities in which they do business. Scores of companies nationwide give manpower and money to troubled urban school systems. In Miami, businesses and civic leaders have banded together to create the influential Miami Coalition for a Drug-Free Community.
Mr. Ueberroth argues that even companies that ignore poor and minority customers as a market cannot ignore the social upheaval, and accompanying economic dislocation, that occurs when long-simmering grievances boil over, as they did in Los Angeles in late April.
But many companies have never taken any steps other than routine charitable donations. Among those that have made an effort, there has often been a lack of community and government support or a decline in the company's internal interest, leading to projects that wither or fail. There have also been few efforts to combat discriminatory business practices like insurance redlining. Making insurance available to small businesses that need it is among Mr. Ueberroth's top priorities.
Mr. Ueberroth said he is determined to involve the community in R.L.A., and his program has won reluctant praise from some black, Hispanic and Asian-American leaders who applaud its focus on jobs. There have been concrete, if preliminary, signs that businesses around the country are thinking the same way.
"Companies now feel that they have to become involved in community and societal problems because they have to solve some of them in order to achieve their business goals," said Edmund Burke, the director of the Center for Corporate-Community Relations at Boston College. "If Peter Ueberroth stays away from the social responsibility part of the argument -- because that doesn't help -- he'll find companies more receptive to looking at this as an issue of survival for them."
One such company is Vons, the largest supermarket chain in Southern California. Vons announced in late July that, after decades of largely avoiding doing business in inner-city Los Angeles, it would embark on an accelerated plan to open as many as 12 stores in poor neighborhoods in the next few years. The new stores will create at least 2,000 permanent new jobs, which Vons pledged would be filled largely by local residents.
Vons's chairman, Roger E. Stangeland, said the plan had its roots in a company analysis done late last year in which the chain concluded that by avoiding the inner city it had been passing up an opportunity to serve more than 2 million consumers who had long complained about the lack of local supermarkets. Immediately after the riots, Mr. Stangeland said he met with Mr. Ueberroth seeking guidance from R.L.A. on how Vons could help, and he subsequently "turned up the burners" on the idea of expanding into the poor neighborhoods.
"We had, over many years, just found it easy to drift out of the neglected areas," said Mr. Stangeland. "Shame on us. But we're in the process of acknowledging that we missed an opportunity and we're going about fixing it."
The company's primary motivation, Mr. Stangeland said, was to increase its profits at a time when competition among supermarkets in the region is intense and there are few areas that do not already have more stores than they need.
"First and foremost, it had to be good business strategy, but we saw this as an opportunity to be part of the community process as well as to have a good business transaction," Mr. Stangeland said. "If there had been no riots and no Rebuild L.A., we probably would have gone about it in a fairly leisurely manner. But the civil disobedience placed a kind of magnifying glass over the whole issue and made it apparent to us that we ought to go at this as a fully articulated and fast-paced program."
 
Hughes and Nissan
 Hughes Aircraft and its parent, the General Motors Corporation, agreed in late July to increase by $15 million over the next five years the value of subcontracts it will award to minority-owned businesses in and around the communities hit hardest by the rioting, a step that should support hundreds of new jobs. Despite having announced recently that it would lay off 9,000 workers in the next 18 months because of Pentagon cutbacks, Hughes also agreed to invest $1 million to create new minority-owned businesses and to deposit $1 million in community banks to allow them to increase local business loans.
The Nissan Motor Corporation U.S.A., the American arm of the Japanese auto maker, is setting up a $5 million endowment with the proceeds to go to community-based programs that create or support jobs in South Central Los Angeles and surrounding neighborhoods. Nissan developed its plan without consulting Mr. Ueberroth, but used much the same approach he is advocating and is now working with the some of the same community groups as R.L.A.
"What we'd like to see happen is the money going to producing a human being capable of getting a job and staying in the community or creating a job that will keep the money in the community," said Thomas D. Mignanelli, the chief executive of Nissan Motor U.S.A., which is based in Gardena, Calif., just south of the areas hit hardest by the rioting.
"We know that $5 million doesn't solve anybody's problems," Mr. Mignanelli said. "But if each company that was a neighbor or a resident here could do something to create jobs, that would be the best way to help."
His comments echo Mr. Ueberroth's belief that persuading a large number of small operations to participate is the most practical approach. After all, companies can act much more quickly to create an operation with up to 90 jobs, the size Mr. Ueberroth said he has in mind, than to build a 1,000-worker factory. Moreover, he says, the community is better off not being overly dependent on jobs at a handful of large employers.
As part of its commitment to R.L.A., Hughes said it would relocate one of its small operations, with around 60 employees, to a poor neighborhood. Mr. Ueberroth said 10 others, which he declined to name, are making similar commitments.
"These are the basic, stable jobs that will spur the economy," Mr. Ueberroth said. "They will allow people to own their own homes. They will allow minority-owned businesses in the area to thrive, because without those paychecks they won't have any customers. And there's not a company in America that can't participate in that way."
 
 
A SECOND-IN-COMMAND TO BALANCE THE TICKET
 Almost every move made by Peter V. Ueberroth as head of Rebuild Los Angeles has been criticized by one constituency or another, but his choice of Bernard W. Kinsey as the organization's chief operating officer and his second-in-command has won almost unanimous praise.
Mr. Kinsey is a 48-year-old former executive at the Xerox Corporation who was recommended to Mr. Ueberroth by, among others, David Kearns, the former chief executive of Xerox who is now Deputy Secretary of Education in the Bush Administration.
As a black Democrat, Mr. Kinsey provides an important counterpoint to Mr. Ueberroth within R.L.A., community leaders said. And by virtue of his long experience in the corporate world -- he left Xerox after two decades last year to found his own consulting firm -- he provides a crucial bridge between the business world and the inner-city communities.
"Corporations need first to look inward to see if what they are doing inside reflects the same exclusions that are plaguing our cities," said Mr. Kinsey, who served in a series of sales and marketing jobs at Xerox, rising eventually to vice president of advanced marketing strategies. "If their boards and their senior managements up and down the line are white male, they are contributing to the same problems people here are crying about."
At Xerox, Mr. Kinsey pushed top management to open its ranks to black executives and other minorities and helped spur the company's financial support of black educational institutions. Mr. Kinsey said he gives credit to the companies that have approached R.L.A. eager to help. But he said many companies with a stake in inner-city Los Angeles have yet to be heard from. And he said corporate attitudes in too many cases are still driven by stereotypes and fear.
"When I hear someone say they're not investing in a business or a person or an idea because it's in the inner city or because it involves a person of color, I say you're not assessing your risk the right way or in the way you do in other situations," Mr. Kinsey said. "Bankers always say it's a high- risk area, but these are the people who lent to Latin America and bought junk bonds and financed every half-empty high-rise tower in the country."
 
CALIFORNIA, THE JOB KILLER
 "The state of California," said Peter V. Ueberroth, "has developed the most highly tuned, finely honed job-killing machine that this country has ever seen."
That was Mr. Ueberroth's conclusion after leading a commission appointed in December by Gov. Pete Wilson to study California's declining economic competitiveness. The commission's report, issued just before the late-April riots in Los Angeles, found that the state had created "a nightmarish obstacle course for business, job and revenue growth," including over-regulation, a balky bureaucracy and a workers compensation system that was driving companies out of the state or out of business.
Mr. Ueberroth said the report's conclusions are particularly relevant to the efforts of Rebuild Los Angeles to bring economic growth to the inner city. It is minority-owned and small businesses, he said, that are hit the hardest by rapidly escalating workers compensation costs and expensive and time-consuming regulatory requirements relating to air quality, construction and the like.
"If we can't change the business climate in the state, we can't really impact the inner city," he said.
Democratic state legislators, who have long viewed Mr. Ueberroth as a potential Republican gubernatorial candidate, say his approach to improving the business climate would endanger California's hard-won progress in cleaning up its air, among other things. But Mr. Ueberroth said he is not advocating deregulation, simply speeding and streamlining the bureaucracy and regulatory system and recognizing the legitimate needs of business.

Holding the Line on Brazil's Economy

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO

 BODY:
With the political future of President Fernando Collor de Mello of Brazil increasingly in doubt, a showdown is nearing that could determine the future of the country's economy as well.
In the middle of the battle over the economy, Latin America's largest, is a mild-mannered banker who once wrote a book on Machiavelli and Brazilian politics: Marcilio Marques Moreira, the country's 60-year-old economy minister. 
 Hoping to nudge Brazil down a path trod by Latin America's other success stories -- Argentina, Chile and Mexico -- Mr. Moreira advocates privatizing state companies, improving tax collection, maintaining fiscal austerity and making peace with foreign creditors.
But heavy pressure for a populist change in course is coming from Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, the flamboyant Governor of Brazil's impoverished northeastern state of Bahia. Last week, the Governor all but demanded Mr. Moreira's ouster and a return to the free-spending fiscal policies that long gave Brazil the highest inflation rate in the Americas.
In different days, Mr. Magalhaes's demands would be ignored. But these days, the Governor holds the keys to the political survival of President Collor, around whom accusations of influence-peddling and corruption have been swirling for months. As head of the Liberal Party, only Mr. Magalhaes can muster the votes needed to save President Collor from an impeachment trial; a vote seems certain later this month.
The President has responded by urging new spending programs. That prompted the education minister, Jose Goldemberg, to quit early last week and sent the country's markets on a roller-coaster ride.
So far, at least, Mr. Moreira is resisting the call to spend more, offering instead to redirect already approved allocations.
A former ambassador to the United States and a longtime senior executive at Unibanco, Brazil's third-largest private bank, Mr. Moreira has quietly woven a web of alliances that now includes the Government's economic team and several key Cabinet ministers.
Bolstering Mr. Moreira's position last week, the team made a formal one-for-all and all-for-one pact. They will all stay together, they say, and, if necessary, they will all quit together.
But with Liberal Party deputies continuing to demand billions of dollars for pet projects in exchange for party loyalty, Mr. Moreira's knowledge of Machiavelli is still being put to the test.

HEADLINE: All About/Composting;
Two Towns Experiment With the Alchemy of Trash

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
Earlier this year, about 400 households in Greenwich and Fairfield, Conn., took a big step forward in their longstanding trash-recycling program. For a month, they set up "wet bags" to collect table scraps, soiled paper and yard clippings. While such garbage is unsuitable for the usual recycling sorting bins, it can be composted.
The results, measured in the further reduction of trash that would otherwise clog landfills and incinerators, make conventional recycling of cans, bottles and paper seem like only a half measure. But the time and space needed for large-scale composting make the chances slim that any but the most dedicated of communities will even experiment with the process. 
 The point of the exercise, which was organized in March by an unusual alliance of the National Audubon Society and the Procter & Gamble Company, was to see how much more household trash could be diverted from landfills and incinerators by adding composting to the usual recycling methods. In the two towns, recycling alone had diverted about 40 percent of household garbage by weight. That still left most for incineration.
The experiment's results exceeded the sponsors' expectations, said Jan Beyea, chief scientist for the Audubon Society.
Using a paper bag lined with cellophane (which resists seepage like plastic, but is derived from plants) for the organic materials allowed families to keep an additional 30 percent of their garbage out of the trash can. That lifted the total recycling rate to 70 percent.
"Everybody seemed to love it," Mr. Beyea said. "We were not prepared for such a positive reaction."
Despite such enthusiasm by sponsors and residents, the experiment is not likely to be repeated or expanded. That is because large amounts of household trash would overwhelm the small municipal composting plant in Fairfield, which is kept busy producing compost from sewage sludge and yard waste like leaves and grass clippings.
Still, Mr. Beyea and other experts on solid-waste disposal say the experiment shows the value of composting garbage and points the way for larger projects in other areas.
 
New in Recycling
Making Compost From Wet Garbage
 The idea in composting is to encourage the naturally occurring bacteria present in carbon-based materials to break complex chunks down into a relatively fine dirt-like substance. In the process the lined paper bag goes the way of its contents.
Biological combustion has the welcome effect of reducing both the mass and volume of material, without dirtying the air the way incinerators do. Compost contains nutrients that are released slowly to plants, making it a useful addition to soils in landscaping, agriculture and nurseries.
Since it retains water well, compost is useful in areas that have sandy, quick-draining soils, as in much of Florida, or where water for irrigation is in short supply, as in some areas of California.
The compost produced in the Connecticut experiment is being tested to determine its purity and effectiveness compared with composts prepared by other methods. Some other methods have resulted in compost too contaminated with bits of plastic or pieces of bone to be used in agriculture. A final report is expected by yearend and it could spark more interest.
Although composting is well known to gardeners, it is only gradually gaining adherence as a method of disposing household trash. Those who like the idea say it should be seen as a form of recycling because it removes material from garbage cans, processes it and creates a product with value.
"We are saying that organics have a value as well as the glass, metal and paper that is now collected for recycling," said Charles Cannon, executive vice president of the Solid Waste Composting Council. The council is a trade group formed by Procter & Gamble, DuPont, Kraft General Foods and other corporations that generate, directly or indirectly, large amounts of waste to promote composting.
 
An Unusual Alliance
Environmentalists And Corporations
 If widely adopted, composting could have a big impact on trash disposal. According to reports prepared for the Environmental Protection Agency, leaves and other yard waste, food scraps and paper that are not likely to be recycled make up about 50 percent of municipal waste nationally. Since all are composed of carbon compounds, they are adaptable to the composting process.
"Conventional recycling is only going to get 15 to 20 percent of solid waste," said Bruce Jones, who is a composting specialist at Procter & Gamble. "But when you look at the organic fraction, it's 50 percent. That could have a big impact on waste management."
He said he and Mr. Beyea had a common interest in the subject and decided on the joint project, thereby forging an alliance between one of the nation's leading environmental groups and one of the largest consumer products companies.
"Jan and I had been talking and we said let's do something to show how effective recycling and composting can be," Mr. Jones said. "We decided to get our hands dirty and show how it could work."
One of the things they did was recruit the Greenwich chapter of the Audubon Society to help coordinate the project and set up a toll-free number for people who had questions or needed more bags. Of the 225 calls logged, only 7 were from people complaining that the extra separation was too much effort.
Although the two organizations collaborated on the project, they do not see eye to eye on everything. To keep compost from becoming contaminated by undesirable materials, like pesticides, that households discard, Mr. Beyea favors separating the organic materials for the compost in the home, as was done in Connecticut. Mr. Jones and P.&G. say that to better assure the purity of the compost, and to save on collection costs, the organic materials can be pulled out of the mix of trash.
"We agreed to disagree," Mr. Beyea said.
 
Dirt that Pays
Balancing the Costs Against the Gains
 Processing trash by composting is still rare among cities, with only 19 having such operations, according to the composting council. But there are more than 2,000 facilities for composting leaves and yard waste across the country, and several hundred communities are planning to include composting in their future waste-disposal plans, association officials said.
Most of the technology used in trash composting programs in this country originated in Europe. There, more densely populated countries ran out of landfill space before it became a problem the United States paid much attention to.
As with most recycling programs, the economics of composting are driven more by the costs of getting rid of trash than by the value of the recovered material.
"The cost of building a facility is $4.5 million to $8 million per hundred tons per day," depending on the technology involved, Mr. Jones said. A publicly owned plant would have to charge a dumping fee of about $50 a ton to operate satisfactorily, while a tax-paying, profit-making private enterprise would probably need to charge nearly $80 a ton.
Once a site has developed a reputation for producing high-quality compost that is low in contaminants and free of visible debris like plastic shards and stones, it could sell the product for $5 to $20 a ton, Mr. Jones said.
Composting is considered a step below recycling in the environmental hierarchy because it converts some materials, like paper, into a lower-value material. So the organizers of the Greenwich-Fairfield program were careful to stress that residents should recycle paper wherever possible, rather than tossing it into the composting bag.
 
 
 
A CLEANER WORLD BUT, OH, THE SMELL
 Despite the admirable service composting plants perform in gobbling up trash and keeping the environment a little cleaner, no one wants one built next door.
At least two major projects, one in Florida and another in Oregon, had to be shut down after nearby residents complained about foul odors coming from the plants.
"Once the neighbors get a whiff from a plant, they do not forget about it," said Charles Cannon of the Solid Waste Composting Council.
For that reason, even those favoring composting as a means of treating household trash, say that composting operations should be located as far away from people as possible. As long as the trash is not left sitting around too long, the process is not inherently particularly smelly. But the compounds produced when biological action takes place in the absence of oxygen tend to be smellier than those formed in an oxygen-rich environment.
In heavily populated areas, the preferred solution is to enclose the process and maintain a slightly negative air pressure inside the building. That way, any random air flow comes from the outside in, not the other way.
Of course, just as with the human lungs, air that is pulled in will eventually have to be exhausted. But by controlling airflow, plant operators can treat it to remove odors before it is released.
The treatment of the air can be done chemically or biologically. In the latter, some composting plants in the United States filter their exhaust air through a thick layer of finished compost, peat moss and leaves.

THE ECONOMY
 
A Trade Treaty With Mexico or a 'Transfer of Wealth'? 

For months, President Bush has been doggedly trying to move negotiations forward with Mexico and Canada to create a continent-wide free-trade agreement. But as those negotiations near completion, controversy remains. Canada and the United States have nearly equivalent wage scales, but Mexican workers get only a fraction of what their northern neighbors earn. That discrepancy worries labor groups. "We continue to have factories close down and shops close up and move to Mexico," said Jeff Faux, president of the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. "This treaty is essentially a transfer of wealth from working people in America to infrastructure in Mexico," he said. But a study by the Institute for International Economics in Washington says the accord would create tens of thousands of new American jobs and a $10 billion improvement in the American trade balance with Mexico.
 
Temporary Help
 
At first glance the numbers looked good. Unemployment fell to 7.7 percent in July, from 7.8 percent the month before. That means no new recession, economists said. But on closer examination, 60,000 of the 198,000 jobs added to the nation's payroll last month were attributed to a temporary Federal jobs program passed by Congress in June in the aftermath of the Los Angeles riots. "Come September, these temporary workers will all go back to school or to wherever they were before," said Samuel D. Kahan, chief economist at Fuji Securities in Chicago. "That will push up September's unemployment number when it comes out in October." Since that will be the last unemployment figure before the election, "it's the one that will be in people's minds when they go into the polling booth," he said.
 
Detecting Just a Whisper
 
The nation's purchasing managers are the economy's windsock: their orders indicate whether the winds of economic growth are blowing. Last month, the National Association of Purchasing Management said its index of economic activity had detected a little breeze; it rose to 54.2 percent from 52.8 percent the month before. A reading below 50 indicates recession, while above 50 indicates growth. "It's mildly expansionary," said Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns & Company in New York.

Election-Day Forecast
 
If President Bush is counting on a sudden flurry of economic activity around election time to enhance his chances at the polls, he'd better count again. The Commerce Department's Index of Leading Economic Indicators, which forecasts economic activity six to nine months hence, took a tumble last month. It fell 0.2 percent in June, signaling slow growth through the end of the year.

The Backyard Gas Guzzlers
 
Unbeknownst to most Americans, the nation's lawn mower jockeys are a major source of air pollution (not to mention noise pollution to their hammock-lounging neighbors). Mow the crab grass for an hour and your mower spews as much pollution as a car driven 50 miles. Before it muzzles mower fumes, the Environmental Protection Agency will exchange 1,000 gas mowers now in use for electric models. It will study the old polluting mowers and then write regulations to clean them up. "We certainly could do better," said Dennis C. Dix of the Lawn Mower Institute.

Passing the Buck -- to the Fed
 
With the election looming, the White House is finger-pointing once again. Last month it was Richard Darman, the White House budget director. He blamed Congress, and nearly every other institution inside the beltway, for the economy's woes. Last week it was Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. But Mr. Brady was more specific than Mr. Darman. He told the Senate Banking Committee that blame should fall on the Federal Reserve for waiting too long to lower interest rates. Though the Fed was set up to be independent rather than political, and though it's main job is to keep prices stable not to prod growth, Mr. Brady suggested it was time for Congress to formally review the way the Fed sets policy. He said this despite the fact that the Fed lowered interest rates 23 times in the last three years. "To me, this is an act of desperation and very surprising," said David Jones, chief economist with Aubrey G. Lanston & Company in New York.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Japan's New Explanation
 
When it was first pointed out during recent trade negotiations that Japanese companies were buying too few American-made microprocessors, Tokyo said industry was growing so swiftly that companies had trouble shifting to new suppliers. Last week, when the United States trade representative pointed out again that Japan was importing too few chips -- 14 percent of what it uses, well under its negotiated goal of 20 percent -- the reason was different. Japanese companies are in a slump, Tokyo's negotiators said, and are reluctant to change suppliers because they don't want to risk weakening their business associates further.

Yeltsin the Fund-Raiser
 
President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia is one of the world's greatest fund-raisers. He addressed Congress earlier this summer, and last week the House passed a foreign aid package worth $1.2 billion for Russia and the other former Soviet republics, and authorized $12 billion in commitments to increase the capital of the International Monetary Fund. While the I.M.F. money is not earmarked, much of it is expected to go to Russia. Of the direct aid, $790 million will go toward dismantling Russia's nuclear weapons. But while Mr. Yeltsin rakes it in, some lawmakers complained that the funds could be better used at home. "Our citizens are hurting," said Representative Barbara-Rose Collins, Democrat of Michigan.

Fujitsu's First Loss
 
Rather than end by the fall, as Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa promised, Japan's economic slump is worsening. Last week, Fujitsu Ltd., Japan's largest computer company, announced its first loss ever: $80 million for the first half of the year. Fujitsu, like its rivals elsewhere, is facing intense pricing pressure on its microprocessors -- it announced it would close its San Diego semiconductor plant last week -- and has seen demand for its mainframe computer slip.

 
 
COMPANIES

 
Will Icahn Turn In His Wings?
 
Carl C. Icahn, takeover artist extraordinaire, may love a bargain, but when he bought Trans World Airlines, he got more than he bargained for. The money-losing airline circled for months before landing in Chapter 11 of the Federal bankruptcy code. It is still losing money -- as much as $1 million a day, analysts said. Last week Mr. Icahn came up with a plan that would turn over 45 percent of the company's stock to its employees in exchange for a 15 percent wage cut and work-rule concessions. T.W.A.'s creditors would forgive about $1 billion of the airline's $1.5 billion in debt in exchange for the remaining 55 percent of Mr. Icahn's stock. As part of the deal, Mr. Icahn would step down as T.W.A.'s chairman, a job he may wish he never had. Analysts estimate Mr. Icahn's losses at about $100 million from his four-year foray into flying.

Giants Follow the Rays
 
Thirty-five years ago New York's teary-eyed baseball fans waved goodbye to the Giants as they left for San Francisco. Now, as those fans retire and move to Florida, they will get a chance to welcome their team back. Giants owner Robert Lurie said he will sell the team to a group of Tampa investors for about $110 million. The team will play in St. Petersburg, Fla. Mr. Lurie had been trying to move the Giants out of frigid Candlestick Park for four years but could not persuade voters to build a new stadium. While yet another set of Giant's fans is teary-eyed, "everybody in Tampa Bay should feel like they're running the bases on air," said Rick Dodge, St. Petersburg's assistant city manager.

Making Factories Work
 
Poke around any factory floor and you will find industrial controls that turn machines on and off, open and close valves and measure temperatures and speeds. The market for these sometimes high-tech, sometimes mundane devices is rich: $18 billion worldwide. Last week, when the Emerson Electric Company agreed to buy Fisher Controls International Inc. for $1.28 billion from the Monsanto Company, it announced a combination that will be the world's largest producer of control devices.

Bell Labs' Data Crunch
 
Storing data on what engineers call "media" -- magnetic tape, disks and optical disks -- is a $40 billion business. The more that can fit on a disk, the more valuable it is. Last week, engineers at the American Telephone & Telegraph Company's Bell Laboratories announced a breakthrough. By sending laser light through microscopic-fiber-optic filaments, the scientists said they could squeeze 100 times more data on a compact disk. At that density, Bell scientists said they could store 17 hours of recorded TV programming on a palm-sized optical disk. But scientists don't know yet if the process lends itself to easy manufacture or accurate information retrieval. "There are are still big ifs," said James Porter, president of Disk/Trend Inc., an industry research firm.
 
Milken's Reward
 
When Judge Kimba M. Wood reduced Michael R. Milken's 10-year sentence, making the imprisoned former head of Drexel Burnham Lambert's junk-bond operations eligible for release after serving only two years, she wrote that it was because he had cooperated with the prosecution. "This assistance was substantial and warrants a reduction in sentence," she wrote. She also cited his help in reaching a $1.3 billion global settlement of claims against him and against his former colleagues at Drexel and substantial work tutoring other inmates in jail. Not everyone was satisfied with Judge Wood's decision. "You can rob a billion and get a reduction, but if you rob a 7-Eleven you can get up to a decade in jail," said Representative Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, Democrat of Massachusetts.

A Drag on G.M. Profits
 
When the General Motors Corporation bought Hughes Aircraft, which does a lot of business with the Pentagon, it was to offset the ups and downs of its car business. But with the cold war over, Hughes has had its share of downs. Early this year it trimmed its work force by 9,000 workers, which resulted in a charge of $749.4 million in the second quarter. That wiped away G.M.'s profit of $392 million from increased automobile sales and gave it a loss of $357.1 million in the second quarter.

HEADLINE: Talking: Leaseholds;
Buying Land Under A Co-op

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
SHAREHOLDERS in leasehold co-ops -- which sit on leased land rather than on lots owned by the co-ops -- have always faced special issues.
Selling an apartment can be difficult, because potential buyers tend to be wary. The lease may have a clause allowing sharp increases in the ground rent, which can play havoc with maintenance charges, and a smaller part of the maintenance charges may be deductible from taxable income because the portion going to pay ground rent does not qualify. 
 Whenever feasible, a leasehold co-op should try to buy the land, and "I can't think of a better moment," said David Clurman, a lawyer in Manhattan who counsels leasehold co-ops.
Some sponsors who held onto the land when they converted rental buildings into co-ops are facing a cash-flow crises. Thus, said Ernest L. Bial, a New York lawyer recently involved in such a deal at 315 East 70th Street, they may be more willing to sell.
Moreover, land values are sufficiently depressed that the land's cost should be substantially lower than in the high-flying 80's. In addition, interest rates are so favorable that a co-op that is otherwise in good shape should be able to finance the deal at a lower cost than at any time in recent memory.
Even so, boards are not being aggressive in pursuing the opportunity, said Mr. Clurman. The reluctance, he maintained, comes not from a detailed analysis of the benefits of making a move now, but from an aversion to making a heavy investment at a time of depreciating values.
Lewis Taishoff, a lawyer in Manhattan who also has represented leasehold co-ops, insists that the sort of landowner most eager to make a deal will probably be an individual sponsor rather than an institution or foundation, which is rarely under the same pressures.
But there could be exceptions. Consider the ground lease at the 54-unit co-op at 139 East 63d Street. The owners, the Beekman Estate Inc., had been shifting towards a policy of owning and operating its own buildings rather than simply owning land leases, said Wright Palmer, Beekman's president. So the timing for a purchase was right when the rent came up for review three years ago.
But a way still has to be found to pay for the land. And even though the co-op may initially shy away because the cost appears prohibitive -- or financing seems unavailable -- there could be more flexibility than many shareholders realize.
At 139 East 63d Street, for example, the two sides had agreed on a value of $8 million for the land after each got its own appraisal. But instead of being paid entirely in cash, Beekman sought -- and got -- title to the five stores and the professional suite in the building, its prime objective in making the deal, leaving only $3.9 million still due from the co-op's coffers.
The swap was achieved by restructuring the co-op into a "condop" comprising three condominium units: the five stores, the professional suite and the residential co-op.
The net result was a maintenance increase to $46 a share, from $30. Even so, shareholders should be better off because they also benefit from higher tax deductions, said William R. Miller, a member of the board.
The co-op had no trouble financing the $3.9 million, although Mr. Miller conceded that the deal was arranged just before lenders became wary of real estate loans.
Board members who think financing will be a problem might look at the deal worked out at 125-unit co-op at 315 East 70th Street. In the late 1980's, Alex DiLorenzo, the president of the company that owned the site, wanted $10 million for it -- far more than the co- op could afford, said lawyers associated with the deal. Even so, they watched and waited for an opening.
THEN, about a year ago, the Di Lorenzo company defaulted on a $1.2 million loan on the parcel. And since land values had also fallen, it reluctantly agreed to sell the site to the co-op for $3.4 million.
Moreover, it was in the interest of Lincoln Savings Bank, holders of the land loan, to exchange its nonperforming loan for a $3.4 million loan to the co-op to help buy the land, said William Lippman, a lawyer in Manhattan who was involved. It also helped that there was no mortgage on the building.
The difference between the monthly cost of the ground rent and the debt service on the new loan has increased maintenance charges by 7.5 percent, said Mr. Lippman. The average went from $227 a room to $249. But shareholders are still better off, he said, because 60 percent of maintenance is now tax-deductible compared to 16 percent before the co-op bought the land. This is because the new totals encompass mortgage interest costs for the land loan and its real estate taxes.
Although there was no default, the 160-unit co-op at 201 East 79th Street also recently bought its site from Mr. Di Lorenzo, said Donald Cohen, a board member. In this case, a total refinancing package of $19 million that folded in the existing underlying mortage on the building was used to pay the $16.5 million purchase price.
"We had no trouble getting the money," said Mr. Cohen.
Maintenance went up 12.7 percent, 67 percent of which became tax deductible compared to 20 percent. And sales have picked up sharply, Mr. Cohen said.
Another way out of any financing problem, said Mr. Taishoff, might be to offer to pay the landowner only part of the money in cash and have him finance the rest.
But Mr. Taishoff warned that funds from a co-op's statutory reserves may not be used for the purchase or a modification of lease terms as they are strictly limited to capital improvements. Only the reserves from an auxiliary capital fund -- which many have been set up to provide greater flexibility -- can be tapped.
Mr. Clurman said that even if some landowners are unwilling to part with their land they may be persuaded to re-negotiate the terms of the lease in exchange for a lump-sum payment to bolster their cash levels.
For example, he said, lengthening the term to 50 years or more with tight caps on any rental increase could go a long way towards making the co-op more financially stable and appealing. Another compromise, he said, might be to pay a lump sum in exchange for an option on the land.
Mr. Miller, who is also president of William B. May Management Corporation, said a board must present its numbers clearly when going before the residents for approval. Shareholders in a few co-ops, he warned, have actually turned down good land deals simply because "they couldn't understand what was going on."

HEADLINE: Streetscapes: 125-139 West 93d Street;
Housing Authority Gets A+ for Effort

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY

 BODY:
THE architectural pilgrim will find unlikely exhilaration in a trip up to a New York City Housing Authority project, the nine 1897 rowhouses at 125-139 West 93d Street.
The agency has a track record for modest housing of the most utilitarian finish and intent -- institutional green paint, fortified steel doors and scratched plexiglass windows, all constituent elements of bare brick boxes. But it has turned what could have been a ruthless modernization into a sensitive near-restoration, as the red brick rowhouses are carefully cleaned and their slate mansards and damaged brownstone are repaired. 
 The authority's initial project was First Houses, completed in 1935 at Avenue A and Third Street. The work was unabashedly modern, gutting and stripping inside and out to produce 123 units. The modernist esthetic continued, but the scale quickly changed to new construction with projects like Brooklyn's 3,501-unit Fort Greene Houses of 1941.
By 1954, the agency had built or started 93,983 units, typically in plain high-rise boxes. Many of the projects were funded by the Federal Title I program, which bulldozed large areas in the name of slum clearance.
Both the methods and the results of Title I received growing criticisms and the 1954 National Housing Act introduced a new term, "urban renewal." This new label reflected a desire to halt urban decay "without the wholesale use of the bulldozer" as the Housing Authority's annual report put it the following year. Indeed, one new approach was not new construction at all, but rehabilitation of existing structures, partly through the influence of James Rouse, a Baltimore mortgage banker active in downtown Baltimore redevelopment.
Two years after the National Housing Act, the area along Columbus Avenue from 87th to 97th Streets was designated for urban renewal. In 1950, the area had been 94 percent white with a population of 33,000; in 1956, it had a population of 40,000, of which 58 percent was white. There had been a tremendous in-migration of newly arrived Puerto Ricans; of the 665 rowhouses in the area, 428 had been converted into densely occupied rooming houses.
MOST of the tenements and small apartments in the area were razed to make way for high-rises, but several dozen brownstones were slated for rehabilitation.
Among these were the nine houses at 125-139 West 93d Street. Built in 1887 and designed by William J. Merritt, this row has rock-faced brownstone basements and deep red-brick facades with a varying oriels, terra cotta trim, cornices and roof lines.
The interiors were gutted of oak trim, tile fireplaces and other Victorian elements, but the exteriors were left largely alone, except for the removal of the stoops. The authority's architect for the work was Gustave Iser, who had studied with Clarence Stein, a housing theorist and designer of Fort Greene Houses. Where the stoops were removed, Iser installed a swath of stucco and an airport-modern multi-colored panel of glazed tiles. This was a note of color in a stretch of buildings that were left visibly decayed, with older, soiled paint jobs covering some of the facades and deteriorating windows and roofs.
If the facades were not carefully restored they were at least not disturbed; John Young, a West Side architect, calls it "generic landmark preservation" and indeed it was a giant change for the Housing Authority.
Over time the decay of the row has become pronounced. The bulkhead entry lighting, vandal-proof doors and institutional signs have made the row unmistakably a "project" and the exteriors have become more and more ragged.
Now Neil Cohen, an administrative architect with the Housing Authority, is supervising a comprehensive rehabilitation, inside and out, that for the first time treats the exteriors as something that really counts. Working with the consulting architects, Vincek & Petrocci, and the contractor, Cole Restoration, he has cleaned the row of paint and soil, revealing the rich red brick and brownstone, and agonized over a color for the cornices and the replacement of the missing slate for the small mansards.
"We're treating them like landmarks, even though they're not" he said.
The Housing Authority still favors the mass-produced, so the new doors, window guards, signage and lights are all going to be identical, although improved. But the pragmatic preservationist must give the Housing Authority an A-plus, at least for improvement.

HEADLINE: Environmental Fight in Prime Time

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
SENATOR AL GORE, the Democratic nominee for Vice President, visited a motor oil recycling plant in California last week and extolled tough environmental regulations as the key to increasing the efficiency of business, spurring technological innovation and generating millions of new jobs.
Three days later, Vice President Dan Quayle flew to Columbus, Ohio, and delivered a broadside against environmental regulations, declaring that many are unnecessary and that they slow the economy and cost jobs. 
 The appearances marked the start of a long-percolating debate about the ties between the environment and the economy by two politicians who are polar opposites. Never has the dispute been so fully engaged in a Presidential campaign, in part because the ideological foundations have never been defined more clearly by the candidates.
The Administration's Position Mr. Quayle and other conservatives argue that only by lowering environmental regulatory costs and more fully opening the country's natural resources can industry be expected to thrive in an ever-more-competitive world market.
In the last 12 months Mr. Quayle pushed aside the moderates in the White House and seized control of the Administration's environmental policies. With the young staff of his Council on Competitiveness, Mr. Quayle expanded the President's authority to halt new environmental regulations and weaken others by rewriting them without public hearings, and has expressly supported the Administration's actions to remove public interference in Government decisions to open Federal lands for coal mining, oil exploration, timber harvests and grazing.
Underlying the Vice President's attack, say Mr. Quayle's aides, is a convergence of scientific, economic and political trends the Administration hopes to ride to victory in November.
First, a growing number of prominent scientists nationwide have signed a declaration that says the environmental movement is an "irrational ideology" that has exaggerated environmental problems and threatens the ability of scientists and business executives to advance technology.
Second, conservative economists argue that the cost of complying with environmental regulations -- $130 billion to $140 billion annually -- is too high, and fewer, less costly regulations would produce the same theoretical benefits to society.
Such a view is being championed not only by factory owners, but also by some cities. Last year, the health department in Columbus, Ohio, conducted a study and found that complying with rules for providing safe drinking water, disposing of trash and operating sewage treatment plants will triple the average family's payment for such services from $400 annually to more than $1,300.
Third, a coalition of timber industry employees, miners, farmers and property owners -- many of them traditional Republican voters -- has caught the Administration's attention by arguing that they are the ones being hurt the most by all the rules.
In a speech in Columbus on Friday, Mr. Quayle said, "I'm sure that during their bus trip through the area, our opponents never mention their idea to put new taxes on everything from gas and coal to paper and packaging. Well, what about all the jobs and money these plans will cost? What about the Ohio steelworker, the West Virginia coal miner, or the Michigan auto worker thrown out of work?"
The Clinton-Gore Position -- On the opposite side of the spectrum is Mr. Gore, who contends that trading off environmental protection for job growth is an outdated idea that threatens the economy in the 21st century. Mr. Gore says the enactment of the world's most stringent laws for safeguarding air, water, land and public health made manufacturing plants more efficient and gave rise to the environmental cleanup industry, one of the economy's most dynamic sectors. The Department of Commerce says that 65,000 to 70,000 companies in the environmental industry employ almost one million workers and had sales last year of $130 billion.
Mr. Gore also argues that strict environmental regulations have amounted to an undeclared national industrial policy. The chief executive officers of Monsanto, Dow Chemical, Du Pont, 3M, Procter & Gamble and other leading companies are installing manufacturing practices that use energy and natural resources more sparingly, lowering costs for production and for disposing of wastes.
Concern for the environment is a factor, say such executives, but more important are profits and corporate survival. Japanese manufacturers have already moved to make their factories more efficient and now use half as much energy as American manufacturers to produce cars and other appliances.
"The Bush Administration is costing the United States millions of jobs by adopting a strategy that protects the old polluting, inefficient ways of the past," said Mr. Gore in a telephone interview from California. "If their theory is correct that the way to create jobs is to trash the environment, you would think Eastern Europe would be economic leaders of world. You would also think that Japan and Germany would be struggling third world nations."
For supporters of both sides, the stakes could not be higher.
Over the last 11 years, Republican Administrations have influenced how the courts and Congress view the link between the economy and the environment. Having laid that groundwork, President Bush, if re-elected, could rightly claim that he's won a mandate to tear apart the thick web of environmental regulations, which conservative members of the Administration say they are poised to do.
The Federal courts are dominated by Reagan and Bush appointees who are sympathetic to arguments that environmental regulations are based on inaccurate and meager scientific evidence and their cost to business is too high. In the last year, Federal district and appellate courts have thrown out environmental regulations including those that restricted hazardous wastes, banned the use of asbestos and directed the Government to set higher automobile mileage standards.
The Supreme Court also has decided to limit the ability of environmental groups to sue the Government on the basis that the groups have failed to show they suffered direct harm from Federal actions. Thus, the Administration's program of attacking regulations is likely to be sustained by the courts.
Even in the Democratically controlled Congress, the Administration and the coalition of resource-based landowners, employees and executives it has encouraged stirred a backlash against environmentalism that halted efforts this year to strengthen the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water Act and the nation's hazardous waste law.
Prominent Democrats are helping the Administration to open land and resources to development. Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, has proposed legislation that would allow four million acres of wilderness in Montana to be logged and mined.
Mr. Gore said in the interview that he and Bill Clinton hope that if they are elected, they will be able to change the mood of the Congress and the courts. Some environmentalists have been skeptical. Mr. Clinton, after all, acknowledged in an Earth Day speech that during his 11 years as Governor of Arkansas he allowed higher levels of contamination in order to attract industry and jobs to one of the country's poorest states.
In that speech Mr. Clinton also said, though, that he has learned that trading off the environment for jobs was a "false choice" that he vowed not to repeat.
The question that cannot be answered yet, of course, is which candidate has the correct political strategy: the Democrats, who are appealing to suburban voters, or the Republicans, who are courting rural voters. Whatever the outcome, a lesson of the 1992 campaign is that the environment's relationship to the economy is now firmly fixed alongside health care and abortion as an issue that can help decide an election.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Europe Looks at Iraq and Shrugs

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
EVEN THOUGH Saddam Hussein appeared once again last week to be planting new obstacles in the path of United Nations inspections of his weapon capacity, and President Bush was reiterating his vow that Iraq would submit, much of the saber-rattling was barely noticed in Western Europe.
In fact, it has been that way all during this summer of threats and bluffs and compromises. Even during the tensest moments last month, when American aircraft carriers were heading for the Persian Gulf while Mr. Hussein was still resisting any inspection of his Agriculture Ministry by a United Nations team looking for documents on weapons, the same European countries whose armies and navies fought in the war only two years ago largely yawned. 
 Instead, commentators expressed skepticism about the need for another military conflagration. And there were murmurs that George Bush's actions were being dictated more by the rigors of Presidential electioneering than by an objective assessment of the situation.
The European attitude is that Iraq is George Bush's problem, that Saddam Hussein is no longer the threat he used to be and, above all else, that Europe as a whole now faces a far more pressing problem in the Balkans, a problem that requires all of the Continent's energies.
"I think we've had our Iraqi overdose last year," said Christian Testot, an expert at the Center of Middle East Analysis unit at the French Foreign Ministry.
"The feeling among Europeans today is that the issue of Iraq and what might happen there has become far more complex than the relatively clear goal of liberating Kuwait of Iraqi troops last year," Mr. Testot said, adding that "among other things, it is evident that much of the Arab world is rallying to the view that Iraq has been punished enough."
Listening to what the Arab world says has always been considered of greater importance in Europe than in the United States, and the Europeans have always tried to sidestep problems that could put them in conflict with large segments of the region's populations. After all, nearly 5 million North African Arabs live on the Continent and France, Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain are mindful of their vast economic interests in the region, which includes non-Arab Iran and Turkey, as well as the Arab countries across and beyond the Mediterranean.
On the question of acting against Iraq, European officials noted that the Arabs themselves are clearly divided, with only some of the oil-rich Gulf Arabs, most notably the Kuwaitis, favoring more punishment. European analysts also note that Turkey, which enthusiastically supported the gulf war, is now wary of the West's support for Iraq's Kurds. Under the protection of the United States, Britain and France, these Kurds are being allowed pretty much to create an autonomous entity that can only be envied by Turkey's own Kurds -- whose rebellion Turkey is vigorously trying to suppress.
 
An Eye on Arabs and Turks
 "The Europeans cannot be more royalist than the King," said Francois Heisbourg, director of the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, in an interview. "If the Arabs are not in favor of military actions against Iraq and the Turks not in favor of promoting Kurdish independence, Europe has no interest in getting itself in trouble or being beastly to the Turks."
Most importantly the tragedy unfolding in the Balkans has mesmerized Europeans in a way that Iraq no longer does. This is partly because of their helplessness to do something about their own neighborhood even as images of massacres flicker over television screens every night from Nice to Stockholm. At the same time, the huge inflow of refugees, perhaps as many as 2 million Yugoslavs, has not even begun to be addressed.
As it stands, if Europeans are contemplating military action anywhere, it is in the direction of the Adriatic Sea, not the Persian Gulf. "There is no need for new military action on the scale of the gulf war anymore," said Patrick Reas, a spokesman for the London-based Western European Union, in a telephone interview. "We are sending our ships and our troops to Yugoslavia instead."
In an editorial published on July 27 as last month's confrontation with Iraq appeared to have been defused, The Financial Times portrayed European views this way: "The sighs of relief in Western capitals last night, after Iraq had climbed down in the crisis with the United Nations over weapons inspections, were almost audible."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
In Russia, a Familiar Chill in the Political Air

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
IN this sped-up, fast-forward century, it's already necessary to ask whether Russia's latest lurch toward the West and all its pretty promises is beginning to come to an end.
Amid increasing disillusion with the West, the $1.2 billion in bilateral aid finally approved by the American Congress last week with such self-satisfaction seems to many here a paltry response, and it comes very late. 
 After the euphoria of the collapse of the Communist Party and -- crucially -- the equally profound humiliation of the loss of the Russian empire without the firing of shot or shell, it was inevitable that strong and unreconstructed political, social and economic forces should re-emerge amid the chaos.
President Boris N. Yeltsin, duly elected, won his fantastic grudge match with the unelected Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and used last August's anti-Gorbachev coup to pull the state out from underneath him.
The new ideology of democratic legitimacy and a free market was crucial to Mr. Yeltsin's successful coup, but this is a country that never had much experience with either. Russia never had the Enlightenment, and its only memorable periods of reform have been at the command of autocratic power. Mr. Yeltsin himself, while inveighing against the "anti-democratic" nature of Parliament (elected in 1990 when the old system held sway), acts, or tries to act, almost purely through decree.
He has supported the radical economic reform designed by Acting Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar and his Western-oriented team of economists. But with long-promised Western aid only now beginning to be delivered, and then doled out in tiny chunks, the whole idea of these reforms is being discredited by inflation, tight credit, cash shortages, enterprise debt, a crash in industrial and energy production and a grain harvest forecast of only 89 million tons.
Mr. Yeltsin, ever the politician, is paying more attention these days to Arkady I. Volsky, a powerful lobbyist for state enterprise managers, and those around him, who like to speak of the International Monetary Fund, with its strict demands for fiscal and monetary discipline, as a misguided agent of the Western desire to bring Russia to its knees and then buy its wealth on the cheap. And Mr. Gaidar and his team seem to be losing credibility these days where it counts most: with Mr. Yeltsin, though he, as usual, is keeping his own counsel, trying to stay above the fray. "Mr. Gaidar is becoming only a Potemkin Village for the West," an industrial manager in St. Petersburg said. "The day he costs Yeltsin too much, Gaidar is gone."
Periods when Russia has hungered after the West have been followed by periods of retrenchment and defensiveness, when the wounds of Russia's backwardness and passivity have been nursed into a religion of "uniqueness" and "soul" that drives all the claims to transcendence.
Sometimes historians speak of this as the Asian part of the Russian character, rooted in the nation's subservience to and merger with the Tatar "hordes." But more precisely, these days, this tendency is best seen in the industrial managers, bureaucrats and self-styled "patriots" grouped around Mr. Volsky, who describe the Western economic model as a "liberal dream" unsuitable to suffering Russia.
Trying to save their enterprises, however inefficient they may be in Western terms, these conservatives want to stop radical economic reform and thorough privatization and use the state to manage change. Conjuring visions of rioting masses of unemployed amid a charred landscape of bankrupt factories and farms, they have wrung out of Mr. Yeltsin high-level political positions in the Government and costly credits. They have a powerful say in the new and still shadowy Security Council appointed by Mr. Yeltsin, and they now have their candidate, Viktor Gerashchenko, running the Central Bank, which is controlled by Parliament.
In a particularly unattractive display of disunity last week, a press conference to show Government solidarity turned into open argument. Mr. Gaidar's men disagreed about the need for sizable new credits with their new colleagues, drawn from the industrial establishment and closer to Mr. Volsky.
While the Gaidar men seem to have caused Mr. Gerashchenko to pull back from issuing another trillion rubles of credit, they are spending more time fending off challenges and making painful compromises than carrying out a coherent reform.
"The policy of the reform government is about to collapse," Mr. Volsky said last week, while in another of his Cassandra-like interviews, Mr. Gorbachev said that the Government "is at a loss about how to proceed."
And it is only now that the West has just begun to deliver on its many exaggerated promises -- not in the hour of need for Russia's Westernizing reformers, which passed many weeks ago, but in the hour of their despair, when the dream of real market reform is crumbling.
Last week the I.M.F. finally released $1 billion of credits to Russia, supposedly the first tranche of $4 billion, and the World Bank announced a $600 million loan. But Moscow seems unlikely to meet its promises to the Fund of a budget deficit no higher than 5 percent of gross national product, and a limit of 9 percent on monthly inflation by the end of the year, which means that further Fund aid is not likely.
 
Important, but Very Late
 Last week, too, the House of Representatives finally passed the grandly named Freedom Support Act for Russia. But it might better be named "The Paying the I.M.F. What We Owe Them Act," since it essentially provides the Fund new capital to meet its lending obligations to Russia and the other states of the former union.
Though symbolically important, these decisions come very late, feeding Russian criticism that the West's aid is more hortatory than real, and that the West's basic interest is to keep Russia on its knees.
It is a criticism also voiced by one Western diplomat in the former union. There is a lot of scouring of the cities and the countryside by Western diplomats, experts, scholars and businessmen, both legitimate and fly-by-night, he said. But from Washington, he said, "nothing of any real substance, no aid of any real measure, has been provided so far."
There have been telegenic flights of medicine and leftover Meals Ready to Eat, in which the cost of the planes and fuel dwarfed the value of the contents delivered; there has been European Community meat that undercut the price any Russian producer could match; there have been brave efforts by towns and hospitals in America and the West to help needy Russian or Commonwealth institutions.
But for all the talk of more directed assistance, of fancy new portable grain elevators and mini-tractors, of refrigeration trucks and canning factories, very little has actually materialized.
Many Russians are already asking whether the gain is worth the pain: A billion-dollar loan here or there is barely a drop in the desert of Russian need. And while no one expected Russia to turn into the United States, Westerners have a few questions to ask, too. Russia was never there to be "lost," but it is heading in a direction the West may one day soon, in this fast-forward century, come to regret.

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
In a World of Instant Copies, Who Pays for Original Work?

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
THERE are yawning potholes on the road to the information age.
Computer executives, publishers, artists and authors are trying to reconcile 21st-century computer technology with 19th-century laws protecting intellectual property. 
 On the horizon is the promise of even more powerful personal digital technologies, ranging from ultrafast computer networks marrying images, sound and data and delivering vast quantities of information, to a new generation of wireless computers and communicators connecting mobile professionals to their business world. These technologies could make it possible to view virtually any movie or television program on demand and could provide a cornucopia of information services ranging from books and maps to restaurant guides, all in hand-held computers.
But some industry executives fear that many of these services will remain high-tech dreams because traditional publishers, broadcasters and movie companies, fearing their products will be copied easily and copyrights infringed, will refuse to sell digital versions.
"Our current intellectual property laws are in danger of breaking down completely in the face of this digital revolution," said Mitchell D. Kapor, founder and former chairman of Lotus Development Corporation, which publishes software. "Big publishers are hesitant to move forward without more of a feeling of comfort that they have copyright protection in the new digital world."
In the past, new industries like the music business have faced similar problems and have managed to devise workable solutions for protecting intellectual property. But the advent of an all-digital technology has led to a more vexing situation because, unlike traditional books, music and images, information in digital form can be copied perfectly at virtually no cost. Indeed, the impending emergence of global computer networks potentially turns every personal computer into a powerful desktop information factory.
 
Distinctions Blurred
 "The problem is simply that information wants to be free," said Robert Stein, an executive at the Voyager Company, a digital media company in Santa Monica, Calif., that publishes laser disks and electronic books.
High-speed computer networks present problems that are fundamentally different from any that society has previously faced in establishing legal barriers prohibiting photo-copying books and information or taping music and video.
"In the information age a valuable book comes across a network, a person reads it and, by pushing a button, sends a copy to his friend," said Alan Weis, president of Advanced Networks & Services, a computer network company based in Elmsford, N. Y. "He's broken the copyright, and he hasn't thought twice about it."
Easily accessible computer networks will soon blur the distinction between software and information stored in different places -- a frightening development for the nation's largest publishers. This year, for example, when Pacific Bell began deploying high-speed digital telephone lines to business customers, company executives were surprised to find that one of the first experimental uses was for making perfect copies of CD audio disks to digital audio tape, or DAT, players.
Similarly, Apple Computer's Newton, a hand-held personal information system scheduled to be introduced next year, has made wary even publishers who are tempted by the potential market. Each Newton will come with a communications link enabling it to transfer information to another system or to a computer with a push of a button.
"We have been having serious discussions with Apple about ways to make sure that we're likely to be paid for the sharing of information," said Michael Mellin, publisher of Random House's electronic publishing division. "It's unlikely that we'll find a panacea, but we're going to have to figure out some level of copying that we can live with."
Indeed, Apple has already found itself struggling with copyright questions since it introduced Macintosh Quicktime software last year. Quicktime's design makes it easy for personal computer users to add small snippets of digital video to their programs.
"It's really a tough problem to solve," said Doug Camplejohn, Apple's manager of multimedia system software. "Any digital media is going to present copyright questions, especially in a computer where editing is in the hands of the user."
Trying to allay fears of rampant copyright violations, Apple is working on a new version of Quicktime that will automatically embed copyright markings in each digital frame and will enable companies to encrypt their Quicktime digital video material easily, frustrating copiers.
Part of the problem is that most traditional publishers and movie companies have not solved the problem of how to charge for digital versions of their wares. New digital markets are potentially huge, but so too are the risks from illegal copying. As a result some of the largest publishers and movie houses have simply banned electronic publishing or charged exorbitant fees.
Industry executives are divided on whether the push toward new digital media will require a redefinition of modern copyright law. Some argue that the only feasible solution is to educate users to behave ethically. Besides having law enforcement agencies crack down on corporations, schools and software pirates, the Software Publishers Association has begun a campaign in schools that includes a rap music video entitled "Don't Copy That Floppy."
Some people involved with the problem hope that technology will eventually supply methods to prevent illegal copying without interfering with the convenience of using software and digital information. One company, Cryptologics International Inc., a New York City company, has developed a method enabling users to pay only for the information they use in large digital libraries.
But if they are to be successful, such systems must first overcome criticism from industry executives who are skeptical about copy-protection schemes that until now have been universally rejected by personal computer users.
"It's a dilemma," said Denise Caruso, editor of Digital Media, a San Francisco-based multimedia newsletter. "No matter what anyone does there is going to be somebody who finds a way around it. But a way has to be found to protect data if this revolution is going to be real."

HEADLINE: Black Cemetery Yields Wealth of History

BYLINE: By E. R. SHIPP

 BODY:
When a few human bones were uncovered during work on a Federal construction site last summer, they were hardly more than a minor curiosity. But in recent months, as hundreds of skeletons were unearthed, experts have come to conclude that the site in lower Manhattan may be one of the nation's most important archeological finds of this century.
The site, a Colonial-era burial ground mostly for enslaved Africans, was the focus of a political dispute in recent weeks as Mayor David N. Dinkins and others fought successfully to halt a Federal construction project. Efforts are being made to designate the cemetery a Federal historic site. 
 Surprisingly preserved more than 20 feet below New York City streets, the Negros Burial Ground, as it was known, is believed to contain the remains of as many as 20,000 people. It once covered roughly five city blocks on the outskirts of 18th-century New York, land one observer described as "unattractive and desolate."
Historians, archeologists and anthropologists are still trying to assess the find, which they say is the oldest municipal and only pre-Revolutionary African cemetery known to exist in the United States.
But they believe the burial ground will yield a wealth of information on what Laurie Beckelman, chairwoman of the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission, describes as "the daily lives of enslaved Africans for whom there are no other written records."
 
18th-Century Revelations
 Anthropologists like Prof. Michael Blakey of Howard University, using the most modern tools, hope to be able to determine what part of Africa the people came from, what their diets were there and in the New World, what their status was in New York City and how they died.
"We can, in a sense, go back to the actual ancestors themselves and glean from what they have left us in their material representation as much of their experience as we can find," Professor Blakey said.
Preliminary studies of the 415 skeletons removed from the site have already revealed much about life in the 18th century. From the number of skeletons of children for instance, experts have estimated that 50 percent of the black population died at birth or in the first few years of life.
The remains are also raising questions about burial customs and whether they were transported from Africa or borrowed from Europeans.
"There are no mass burials here," said Daniel N. Pagano, the city's urban archeologist. "We know from historic records there were epidemics. There's yellow fever and cholera. But each individual is carefully placed in the ground and with great respect."
Some individuals were buried with coins in their hands or over their eyes. One was buried with a shell next to the head. "That ties into one of the traditional sayings, 'By the sea we came, by the sea we shall go' and was perhaps symbolic of spiritual freedom," Mr. Pagano said.
One man was buried in a British marine officer's uniform. The uniform has decomposed but the buttons remain to offer insight. "This was a person, an African-American, of high status," he said. "It's very clear."
 
'Wealth of Information'
 From the site of the burial ground and from a nearby construction site, more than 1.5 million artifacts of life of New York's common folk have been recovered. North of the burial ground was Five Points, which was a bustling melting pot in the 19th century and a center of black life.
Among the artifacts are pieces of pottery and glassware, tools, children's toys and remnants of food.
"There's just an incredible wealth of information on daily life on individuals not written about in the history books," Mr. Pagano said. "We're not going to find it anywhere else."
Until nearly two weeks ago, however, it seemed there might be nothing of historic value left at the site, as the Federal General Services Administration made it clear that it would continue to remove the human remains to make way for a new Federal office building. The $276 million project would include a 34-story tower and a four-story pavilion housing an auditorium, a day-care center and a pedestrian galleria.
 
Abrupt Change in Course
 But after protests from Representative Gus Savage, an Illinois Democrat whose House subcommittee oversees G.S.A. projects, the agency abruptly changed course. Its head, Richard G. Austin, adopted much of what Mayor Dinkins and others had been seeking for months: an end to construction on the pavilion site and a commitment to honor the memory of the dead through some type of monument or even a museum.
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato later persuaded the Senate Appropriations Committee to set aside $3 million "to modify the pavilion foundation, to prevent further deterioration of the burial ground and to appropriately memorialize the site." The full Senate is expected to act later this week.
G.S.A. officials have been criticized for inadequately surveying the construction site before beginning excavation and for assuming that more than a century of building had long ago destroyed the burial ground. What they had not counted on was that 20 feet of landfill covered the cemetery and previous building foundations had not reached that deeply.
Mr. Austin, at a recent news conference in Manhattan, tried to explain the error. They first assumed there was nothing left of the cemetery, he said. Then after work began last summer, a preliminary review suggested there might be 15 skeletons on the site. "The project outgrew us," he said. "What was originally envisioned as no remains, then 15, 20, 25, has now mushroomed to where it now looks like there is something in the neighborhood of 600 remains in that area." Some experts have estimated that as many as 1,000 might be there.
 
Slaves and Free Blacks
 The black contribution to the development of New York City began with the arrival of Dutch explorers. There were slaves and, for a time, a thriving class of free blacks. In 1644, the Dutch gave partial freedom to 11 blacks and granted them plots of land for farming that extended from present-day Canal Street to 34th Street. From this land they supplied the struggling colony with fresh produce. But by 1716 the British adopted laws barring blacks from owning land. The established churches refused to have blacks buried in their cemeteries, making a separate burial ground for blacks necessary.
The 1865 edition of Valentines Manual noted: "So little seems to have been thought of the race that not even a dedication of their burial place was made by the church authorities or any others who might reasonably be supposed to have an interest in the matter. The lands were unappropriated, and though within convenient distance from the city, the locality was unattractive and desolate, so by permission the slave population were allowed to inter their dead there."
Though the earliest burials in the area may have taken place in the late 17th century, the Negros Burial Ground as such is believed to have been in use from about 1710 to 1790. For a time burials also took place in the old Commons, now the land surrounding City Hall.
"There are probably a great number of burials underneath Elk Street, underneath Reade Street, underneath Chambers Street and in City Hall Park," Mr. Pagano said.
 
Proposed Historic District
 The entire area is now part of a proposed city-designated Negros Burial Ground/Common Ground Historic District. The city Landmarks Preservation Commission is scheduled to hold a hearing on Sept. 1.
Professor Blakey, an associate professor of anthropology and curator of Howard University's W. Montague Cobb Collection has submitted a research proposal to the G.S.A. and to Mr. Dinkins's advisory committee suggesting several ways in which the human remains can help the experts "fit some missing pieces into the historical chronicle."
Through studying health factors, he said, "they can determine what the social and economic positions were for these ancestors." But perhaps more exciting, he said, is the possibility of "getting a better handle on exactly where folks came from."
It is presumed that most Africans in New York City were from West Africa. They were taken into captivity then brought across the Atlantic first to Brazil or the Caribbean islands then on to New York City. Professor Blakey said scientists would look for "chemical signatures of environmental exposure" to determine where they were born and where they lived before coming to New York.
 
Education vs. Respect
 "Through one's diet one incorporates particular elements into the bone and into the teeth, also through drinking water," he said. "Some of these elements may be more specific in certain parts of West Africa, South America and the Caribbean. The teeth develop in childhood so that even in these adults we may have a signature of the region that they were from and the diet they had in childhood and then compare that with their adult experience."
Still many people, especially blacks, have mixed emotions about what is essentially raiding a cemetery to learn about the past and illuminate issues of race and class that resonate today. Howard Dodson, for one, said that when he saw the skeletons lying exposed at the construction site, the "scientist-historian" side of him marveled at what could be learned from studying the remains.
"But the 'roots' side of me said, 'You're not supposed to mess with the dead,' " said Mr. Dodson, the chief of the Schomburg Center for Research for Black Culture in Harlem.
Many have protested that a people who received no justice in life were receiving no peace in death.
"So many people were willing to forgo challenging the system in the present life just simply to have a decent afterlife," said Alton H. Maddox Jr., a lawyer and community leader. "So many of our people, because they've been so mistreated in life, really want to rest in peace."
 
Pilgrimages to Site
 But Professor Blakey and others insist that "to learn from archeological sites constitutes another form of respect for our ancestors."
"It has special importance because so much of African-American history has been lost," he said.
A commission to be appointed jointly by Mr. Austin of the G.S.A. and Mr. Dinkins will ultimately determine the future of the site. Suggestions range from leaving the cemetery intact to building a museum on the site and re-interring the 415 human skeletons there.
In the meantime the construction site has become a place of pilgrimage for students, for politicians, even for actors who starred in the television miniseries that is credited with renewing interest in African-American history, "Roots."
"I cried," Noel Pointer, the jazz musician and singer, said of his first visit to the site. Mr. Pointer, who plans to take part in a 26-hour remembrance vigil at the site, beginning at noon today, added: "You hear all about these archeological and scientific terms and you say to yourself, 'This is very interesting.' But until you get down there and you see what the bodies look like -- you see the skeletons of the children laying in the earth -- then you realize that these are people."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Candidates' Records;
Bush and Congress: Rising Feud Produced a Legislative Deadlock

SERIES: The Bush Record/Last of 10 articles.

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 8

 BODY:
At almost every campaign stop these days, President Bush blames Congress for the nation's problems: the weak economy, the poor state of public schools, crime and violence and urban decay.
On Capitol Hill, meantime, the President is attacked daily from all directions. Liberal Democrats accuse him of pandering to the wealthy. Conservative Republicans say he has no principles. And moderates in both parties maintain that he has failed to offer the programs or to provide the leadership that the times require. 
 These are the political signs pointing to a reality of the Bush Presidency. Rarely in modern American history, say scholars and politicians in both parties, has the relationship between the President and Congress been as sour and the legislative product as meager.
"Is there one member of Congress who would stand up for him in a pinch? I doubt it," said Terry Eastland, a policy strategist in the Reagan Administration who has just completed a book about Presidents and the Presidency.
Mr. Bush's budget director, Richard G. Darman, speaks of a "ritual of confrontation" that has frozen the legislative process. Republicans and Democrats argue over who is to blame, but this extraordinary deadlock has sparked a national debate over the merits of "divided government" in which different parties control the Congress and the White House.
Mr. Bush has had some legislative successes, particularly in foreign policy but also occasionally in the domestic area. On balance, however, whether through his own fault or Congress's, he has had a harder time getting his way on legislation than any other President elected since World War II.
With little money to spend because of the large Federal deficit, he has put forward a wide range of domestic policy proposals dealing with Government spending, health, crime, energy, education, banking and many other topics. But they have been offered without passion, without a connecting theme, without any ranking of priorities, and Mr. Bush has hardly lifted a finger to build public support for most of them or to get them enacted.
When Mr. Bush has spoken out, he has emphasized narrow, symbolic steps like tax breaks for wealthy investors, tuition subsidies for students in private schools and an expansion in the number of Federal crimes punishable by death -- measures he knows the Democratic Congress will reject. And when Congress has tried to take matters into its own hands, in areas like parental leave, civil rights, minimum wage and campaign finance, he has been quick to veto.
"I wasn't elected to do it the way liberal Democrats that control Congress want, so I've had to stand up to them," Mr. Bush said in an interview in June with The New York Times.
Congress has responded in kind. In some cases, it has ducked responsibility, as in its refusal to approve essential new money for the savings-and-loan bailout, an ostrich-like position that avoids politically unpopular votes but is costing taxpayers as much as $6 million a day.
In other instances, Congress has sought simply to embarrass Mr. Bush politically, as in its insistence on a surtax on annual incomes of more than $1 million. This proposal is not intended to raise revenue so much as to taunt the President.
Politically, the deadlock has damaged both sides. The latest New York Times/CBS News Polls show that only 30 percent of adult Americans approve of the way President Bush is handling his job, and only 20 percent like the way Congress is performing.
The roots seem to be deeper than the simple fact of divided Government, of a Republican President and a Democratic Congress, a lineup that has become the rule rather than the exception in the last 40 years.
"In other periods when there was partisan conflict," said Mr. Darman, who has served in every Republican Administration since Richard M. Nixon's, the President and Congress went through the motions of confrontation, but then "there was a kind of ritual of compromise that got something done."
But now, Mr. Darman said, "We've fallen into a ritual of confrontation that doesn't get things done."
 
A Promising Beginning
Offering a Hand To the Opposition
 On the steps of the Capitol waiting for his inauguration ceremony to begin, George Bush looked down into the audience, spotted his old friend Dan Rostenkowski, the influential chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, waved conspicuously and shouted, "Hi, Danny!"
Many who witnessed the moment -- who watched Mr. Rostenkowski beam, who recognized Mr. Bush's knack for making meaningful personal gestures -- sensed a period of bipartisan cooperation in the offing. And Mr. Bush's Inaugural Address only heightened those expectations.
To those he called his friends in the loyal opposition, the new President declared: "I put out my hand. I am putting out my hand to you, Mr. Speaker. I am putting out my hand to you, Mr. Majority Leader. For this is the thing: This is the age of the offered hand."
And he went on to say: "Let us negotiate soon, and hard. But in the end, let us produce."
Mr. Bush, said a person who was on his staff then, thought that if lawmakers liked him personally, they would side with him politically. He kept a locker in the House gym. He invited countless senators and representatives, their families and even their favored constituents to the living quarters of the White House for small talk and photos. He wrote scores of friendly notes.
 
Largest Opposition Ever
 But he had misjudged the situation. Democrats had gained Congressional seats in the 1988 election, and Mr. Bush took office facing the largest opposition majority in Congress of any newly elected President in history.
In addition, the overarching problem of the large Federal deficit meant that little money was available for popular new programs. Politicians can usually find ways to cooperate when there are funds to be divvied up, but their instinct is to pass the buck when belts must be tightened.
As if those obstacles were not enough, Mr. Bush made another miscalculation. In his first weeks in office, he pulled out all the stops to get the Senate to confirm John G. Tower, a former Senator from Texas, as Secretary of Defense, making phone calls and promises and taking the steps Presidents usually take when they really want something from Congress. But the nomination was rejected anyway, and this was a serious setback to the new President. (Mr. Tower died in a plane crash in April 1991.)
"He learned a lesson from the Tower fight," a White House official said. "Never again would he go to the mat -- I mean really go all out -- unless he knew in advance he would win."
 
Sporadic Success
Wielding the Veto To Shape Policy
 Even in the face of those disadvantages, Mr. Bush has had some success in dealing with Congress, especially in his first two years in office.
He was quick to deal with the savings-and-loan debacle, an issue that had been swept under the rug during the 1988 campaign, and the plan he pushed through Congress in 1989 now shows signs of resolving the worst disaster in financial regulation since the Great Depression.
He also broke years of inertia, warded off criticism from business interests and the conservative wing of his party and struck a compromise with Congress over revisions in the Clean Air Act, achieving the most comprehensive and expensive environmental statute ever enacted. He also shaped and signed important legislation granting new rights to the disabled.
Mr. Bush won authority to negotiate a free-trade agreement with Mexico, got increased financing for Head Start and new money for farm and housing programs, and ended years of partisan dispute over United States policy in Central America. Just this week, he persuaded lawmakers to back a plan for aid to Russia and the other former Soviet republics.
 
Flurry of Vetoes
 Mr. Bush has also had extraordinary success wielding his veto power. So far, he has vetoed 31 measures and has never been overridden. Surprisingly he has never vetoed any bill on the ground that it cost too much money, a counterweight to his charge that increased Government spending is Congress's fault.
Sometimes he used the veto to get Congress to modify its position. For example, he vetoed a bill to raise the minimum wage to $4.55 an hour from $3.35, and then signed one that put the floor at $4.25.
Other times Congress refused to back down, and Mr. Bush ended up signing bills similar to ones he had vetoed. That was the case with civil rights legislation. And in the face of Congressional pressure and the recession, the President finally agreed to a measure extending unemployment benefits.
Several vetoes were cast on ideological grounds, like those on bills to lift the ban on Federal money for fetal tissue research or to relax restrictions on abortions. Other measures were vetoed for partisan political advantage, like those that would have made voter registration easier and permitted Federal workers to engage in partisan political activities, both of which were thought to benefit Democrats more than Republicans.
But mindful of his experience with the Tower nomination, the President only once vetoed a bill without knowing in advance that he had the votes to prevent Congress from overriding him, a senior staff assistant said.
The one exception was legislation put forth after the massacre in Tiananmen Square in 1989 that would have allowed Chinese students to remain in the United States after their visas expired. Mr. Bush felt it was an intrusion into his ability to conduct foreign policy. The House voted to override by a large margin, but the Senate fell four votes short of the necessary two-thirds' majority.
 
The Budget War
Capital Gains Bill Destroyed a Truce
 Lawmakers say they can count on one hand the issues on which Mr. Bush went all out and took political risks to win his way in Congress. The Tower nomination and the veto override on the Chinese students are two. The resolution permitting him to go to war against Iraq is a third case, and the Clarence Thomas nomination to the Supreme Court is a fourth.
The fifth example is the budget.
A month after taking office, Mr. Bush sent Congress a list of changes he wanted in the budget prepared by the Reagan Administration. He spelled out spending increases in popular programs like education and space exploration and promised to offset the additional costs with spending cuts. But he never specified the cuts, leaving it to Congress to make the politically difficult choices.
This strategy, apparently devised by Mr. Darman, is one that Mr. Bush has embraced throughout his Presidency, not just on budget matters but in health care and many other areas: take sole credit for popular proposals, but force Congress to bear or at least share the blame for painful steps.
It is a strategy that infuriates lawmakers.
"When there's good news to report," said Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic leader, "the President would like everybody in America to think he has the power of a king. When there's bad news, he would like everybody in America to believe he has no power at all. It's the complete absence of any willingness to assert leadership and assume responsibility."
 
Last Vestige of Cooperation
 But in 1989, Congressional leaders did not want to fight a serious budget battle any more than the President did. They agreed with Mr. Bush that spring to a just-get-me-through-the-night budget that met the legal targets with gimmicks rather than real belt-tightening and that put off hard choices until the next year.
The truce did not last. As part of his deal with Congressional leaders, Mr. Bush had promised to forsake for the rest of 1989 his favorite tax proposal, a cut in the capital gains tax. But when the House of Representatives unexpectedly passed such a plan, Mr. Bush began fighting for it in the Senate.
There were clearly enough votes in the Senate to pass the bill; there usually are for any tax cut. But Senator Mitchell, a die-hard opponent of a capital gains tax reduction, used every parliamentary maneuver available to him as majority leader to prevent a vote, and the measure died.
Democrats were furious because they thought Mr. Bush had broken his word. The President was outraged because he could not get a vote when he had a clear majority on the domestic issue most important to him. The last vestige of cooperation had faded away.
"Things were never the same again," said a top Presidential adviser. "They thought the President was too popular, and they had to bring him down a notch."
By 1990, the deficit could no longer be ignored. For months, Administration officials and lawmakers negotiated to no avail. Mr. Bush stayed as far removed as possible. Congressional leaders say that Mr. Bush presided over every meeting they attended at the White House about the war against Iraq but that except for the opening session, he never attended a meeting on the budget.
Then, to get the talks off square one, Mr. Bush acceded in June to the Democrats' demand that tax increases be part of any budget deal.
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, one of the President's closest friends, said Mr. Bush knew that reneging on his no-new-taxes pledge would cost him dearly in the public opinion polls. But Mr. Bush may not have understood how much it would cost him politically within his own party. Dozens of Republican lawmakers had taken the pledge themselves, and party loyalty be damned, they were not about to break it.
The President's relationship with the conservative wing of his party, always strained, was now broken. Faced with a large Democratic majority in the House and Senate, he could no longer count on the votes of lawmakers from his own party.
 
The Leadership Issue
Impulse to Avoid Fighting Congress
 In President Bush's view, the failings of his Administration are due mainly to Congressional inaction and political meddling.
If Congress had cut the capital gains tax and had approved the rest of his economic program, the economy would not have performed worse in his term than in any other President's tenure since World War II.
If Congress had not initiated a political witch hunt, the public would pay no mind to charges that Mr. Bush tried for years to curry favor with Saddam Hussein.
If Congress would pay more attention to jobs and the economy, he would not have had to drag his feet in issuing environmental rules.
If Congress would stop harping on the notion that the best way to improve schools is to spend more money, his own ideas for education, like bolstering private schools, would be taken seriously.
If Congress had not forced him to raise taxes, his political standing would be much higher.
But others believe that the President was simply not interested in leading.
"This President doesn't like the idea of doing battle with Congress," said Representative Vin Weber, a Republican from Minnesota. "And he doesn't like the idea of mobilizing the country to get Congress to change."
Thomas E. Mann, director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution, who has written widely about the relationship between Presidents and Congress, put the case this way: "What Presidents are supposed to do is provide political cover, to help take the heat for difficult decisions that have to be made. They have the bully pulpit. They can shape public opinion. They can help members of Congress do the right thing.
"Bush never got involved in that aspect of the job."

HEADLINE: After the Los Angeles Riots: Searching for a Killer and Searching for a Son

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
The name "MAE II" is everywhere on the graffiti-covered walls of Eric Fleming's neighborhood in South-Central Los Angeles. It was not until after the riots that Mr. Fleming learned that MAE II had been the "tag" for his oldest son.
"He kept that from me," Mr. Fleming said. "He probably assumed I wouldn't understand. I looked upon it as trashing buildings. We'd walk down the street, and I'd say, 'Oh, look at that,' like it was wrong. Now I see the art in it, but he's gone." 
 The county coroner's office says 47 homicides occurred in the riots that swept through Los Angeles at the end of April, and the first was Mr. Fleming's 18-year-old son, Louis Watson Fleming. He was shot in the temple, just a block from his house, at 6:25 P.M. on April 29, a little more than three hours after the announcement of the verdict acquitting four white Los Angeles police officers in the videotaped beating of Rodney G. King, who is black.
Since then, Mr. Fleming has been searching the streets, not only for his son's killer but also for the son he had not fully known.
"I learned what my son was up against to be a teen-ager on the streets of Los Angeles," said the father, 39, who has sold cars and Christmas trees and raced cars for a living, but is now unemployed. "I didn't know how bad it was."
Mr. Fleming said he had interviewed dozens of people, some of them friends of his son, who were in a crowd of looters and onlookers at the scene of his son's death: a swap meet, an indoor market filled with stalls where vendors sold everything from baby clothes to electronics. "I was out there getting answers that first night," he said. "I saw the firemen putting out fires. I knew the evidence was going to be lost."
 
Clues Lost in the Chaos
 The fires and the chaos of those days have severely hampered the investigations of the riot-related homicides. The two detectives assigned to the triple homicide in which Louis Fleming died said they had relied on his father from the start.
"Our crime scenes were all burned up," said one of the detectives, Oscar Lamarque, so Mr. Fleming helped in the investigation. "Eric was out there flushing everything to us. He pointed us in the direction of witnesses. He gave us names and addresses."
Mr. Lamarque and his partner, Richard Marks, have not made any arrests, but, based on interviews with witnesses, they said they believed that the killer was a member of a Hispanic gang and that he had randomly shot Louis Fleming first, then two others in the crowd that evening: 15-year-old Greg Davis and 42-year-old Dwight Taylor.
Mr. Lamarque, whose parents came here from Mexico, said he felt a bond with Eric Fleming. Mr. Lamarque also has a son, Alonso, who turned 18 on July 17.
Mr. Lamarque said his son was lucky: He has had a suburban childhood, in the San Fernando Valley. The detective himself grew up in South-Central Los Angeles, not far from where Louis Fleming lived.
For a teen-ager in South-Central Los Angeles, Mr. Lamarque said, "You're in the midst of all those gangs. Murder is something you live with."
Louis Fleming was killed 12 days before his 19th birthday. He would not have graduated from high school this year, but he was looking forward to spending this summer in Utah in a Job Corps program.
Mr. Lamarque said Louis Fleming had already accomplished something remarkable: Not only had he stayed alive for 18 years in South-Central Los Angeles, but he had not joined a gang or acquired a rap sheet.
"He was a good kid," Mr. La marque said. "A lot of the other kids put him on a pedestal for standing up to the gangs. He was very well liked."
 
Shunning the Gangs
 Eric Fleming said he had been astonished to find out how popular his son was. More than 600 people -- friends and neighbors, and even the driver of the bus he rode to school -- attended his funeral at the Figueroa Church of Christ in South Los Angeles.
Mr. Fleming, technically Louis Fleming's stepfather, functioned as the boy's father from an early age. He is divorced from his son's mother, Sherry Watson Fleming, who drives a city bus and attends college at night in the hope of becoming a pharmacist or optometrist. The couple share custody of their children, and Mr. Fleming spent a lot of time with Louis and his other three sons, Byron Scott, 4; Renaldo, 14, and Spencer, 8.
"I always told Louis: 'We don't need gangs. We're not followers. We're leaders,' " Mr. Fleming said.
But the pressure to join never let up. "It was always, 'What set you from?' " Mr. Fleming said. "He went from high school to high school, trying to get away from the gangs. He was holding his own. I was proud of him."
His mother said: "If you don't want to be pushed around and shot at, you can't wear certain colors. My son got to the point he would just wear black and gray. Just black and gray."
On the walls, next to "MAE II," Louis had written "W.D.C." for "We Don't Care." That was the name of his group of fellow graffiti artists, and it signified defiance. The translation, according to Mr. Lamarque: "We don't care about gang bangers."
"Whenever a homicide goes down, we cruise by and read the walls," Mr. Lamarque said. "The walls will tell you the story. The shooters love to boast." But Mr. Lamarque said Louis Fleming's killer had not left any graffiti clues.
Six weeks after he was killed, his father and Mr. Lamarque took a walk around the neighborhood.
Pointing out one wall and then another, Mr. Fleming showed the detective the neighborhood's memorial for his son. Next to "MAE II," the graffiti artists had added "R.I.P.": Rest In Peace.

HEADLINE: New Districts and Loyalties Fueling Black Political Surge in Mississippi

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JACKSON, Miss., Aug. 7

 BODY:
For many years Ollie Mohammed prospered, presiding over Mohammed's Department Store in the Mississippi Delta city of Belzoni and, after election to the State Senate in 1979, serving in increasingly important posts.
But Mr. Mohammed, who has been president pro tem of the Senate, lost in the Democratic primary this week, the victim of redistricting and changing voting patterns by blacks. Mr. Mohammed, a native Mississippian of Lebanese ancestry, was defeated by a black woman, Barbara Blackmon, who was one of more than a dozen blacks who won in legislative primary races around the state on Tuesday. 
 If Mrs. Blackmon, a 36-year-old tax lawyer, and the other black candidates who are expected to win in November do so, the Mississippi Legislature will be nearly 23 percent black. That would be the largest percentage of blacks in any state legislature in the nation. The Georgia Legislature now has the largest percentage, 18 percent.
 
Behind Louisiana and Alabama
 Since 33 percent of Mississippi's voters are black, the state will still lag behind two of its neighbors, Louisiana and Alabama, in approaching legislative representation that reflects its black population.
The gains by Mississippi's blacks are in a state that had the worst record of minority registration and voting before the Voting Rights Act of 1965. As recently as 1970, it had only one black legislator.
"This is a turning point in state politics, especially in the Delta, where we have traditionally had whites representing blacks," Mrs. Blackmon said. "Redistricting had a lot to do with it, but it was also a coming of age of black voters."
Political leaders and researchers said the expected increases in the numbers of black lawmakers were, in part, a result of court decisions and amendments to the Voting Rights Act, which has given state legislatures more leeway since 1982 in drawing districts to increase minority representation. In addition, they said, the black candidates in the Mississippi races -- among them lawyers, college professors and administrators -- represented an unusual flowering of black talent. And they pointed to higher turnouts by black voters.
Mary Coleman, a political scientist at Jackson State University, said black voting patterns had changed. Over the years, she said, the paternalism and plantation economy of the largely black Mississippi Delta had spawned scores of white leaders, like Mr. Mohammed, who were secure and seemingly untouchable. But now black voters are showing a new willingness to break free of that tradition.
David Bositis, a senior researcher with the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a research organization based in Washington, described the political change this way: "Mississippi has historically been the most resistant to change among the states in the region. But now we are seeing a whole generational change in places like Mississippi because of redistricting and the changes in the Voting Rights Act. They didn't do this voluntarily. It was forced on the state."
Before redistricting, blacks held 21 of the 122 seats in the Mississippi House of Representatives and 4 of the 52 seats in the State Senate. Based on the primary results, the House is likely to have 9 new black members, for a total of 30, and the Senate may have 5 new ones, for a total of 9.
Those projections, said Leslie McLemore, a political scientist at Jackson State University, reflect the races in which successful black candidates in the past week's Democratic primaries face no opposition or token Republican or independent opposition in November; the state is overwhelmingly Democratic in local politics. In addition, he said, blacks will face white opponents on Aug. 25 runoffs in three State Senate races and three House races. If those black candidates win, he said, they would also seem assured of victory in November.
Before the latest round of legislative redistricting around the country, a study by the Joint Center for Political Studies found that the nation had 460 black state legislators, 6 percent of the total. Mr. Bositis predicted that the South alone would have as many as 120 additional black state lawmakers after the elections this year, largely because of redistricting.
 
New Generation of Leaders
 Mr. Bositis pointed out that all but 4 of the nation's 460 black legislators were Democrats and that Democrats controlled two-thirds of the nation's legislatures. Consequently, the increase in the number of black legislators will mean an increase in influence for blacks within the Democratic majorities that control state legislatures.
"Plus this is a new generation of black leaders who have not had to accommodate themselves to the same difficult conditions as their predecessors did," Mr. Bositis said. "In many cases they are better trained and more educated, and there are all sorts of long-term implications in that, including the development of more people to run for higher offices and to assume very senior positions down the road."
One new leader who attributed his victory in large part to redistricting is Willie Simmons, a 45-year-old former Mississippi deputy corrections commissioner. He defeated a 21-year veteran legislator, State Senator Robert Crook, who is white. Mr. Crook had taken on the state's largest prison, Parchman, in his home county, as his special cause. But Mr. Simmons, with his background as a corrections official, had the data and insights needed to raise questions about some of Mr. Crook's decisions.
"We are talking about a new Mississippi," Mr. Simmons said of the increases in black representation. "You will see a new focus on change."
 
Low Turnout Among Whites
 Mr. Mohammed attributed his loss to Mrs. Blackmon in part to a heavy turnout by black voters and a low turnout by whites. Mrs. Blackmon won with 53 percent of the vote in a district in which 61 percent of the voting-age population is black.
Mr. Mohammed pointed out that the heaviest concentration of white voters was in Yazoo County, the home of the Republican candidate, Cecil A. Cartwright. "White voters there just stayed away from the polls on Tuesday, and they're waiting to vote for their guy in November," he said. Mr. Mohammed said that he would also support the Republican candidate, contending that Mrs. Blackmon is not a legitimate resident of the district.
Mrs. Blackmon and her husband, Ed Blackmon, a member of the House, maintain a home and law offices in Jackson but legally claim as their official residence a second home and law office in Canton, which is just inside the boundaries of her new State Senate district and his House district.
 
Changing Voting Habits
 Mrs. Blackmon said the redistricting had played a part in her victory, but she said she had also won because she had persuaded blacks to break with old voting habits. She said that many poor blacks to whom Mr. Mohammed had extended credit at his department store had felt compelled to vote for him over the years out of gratitude.
"I told them to keep on taking his credit but to stop voting for his politics," she said. "I told them that they had already made him rich."
Ms. Coleman, the political scientist at Jackson State, said that the main challenge facing the new black legislators was to stand together on issues and then unite with some white legislators to enact laws helpful to the black population. In the past, she said, the smaller number of blacks, along with a number of "progressive white" legislators, had together been able to block bills considered harmful to blacks but had rarely been able to enact programs that addressed their needs, like landlord-tenant laws.
But Ms. Coleman is optimistic that with the right coalitions, skillfully brought together, blacks can persuade the Legislature to tackle these needs. "Coalitions will just form, collapse and reform over different issues," she said.

HEADLINE: A Showdown on Workers' Compensation in Maine

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

 BODY:
What if the law required everybody to buy insurance, but no one wanted to sell it?
That may soon happen in Maine, where after 77 years the workers' compensation insurance system appears to be dissolving. Its failure would be the first collapse of this basic form of social insurance since workers' compensation systems were established early this century. 
 The collapse could be devastating to local employers, many of which say they would have to close without the protection that workers' compensation provides them when employees are injured. And Maine's situation provides a nightmare vision to insurance regulators nationwide, as workers' compensation systems in more than a dozen other states watch costs spin out of control and insurers incur record losses.
Besides Maine, states with highly troubled workers' compensation systems include California, Kansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Texas. Most states require employers to buy workers' compensation coverage for their work forces.
 
How Rates Are Set
 The insurers insist that the central question raised by Maine's crisis is whether regulators should set premiums not on the basis of what it costs insurers to provide coverage -- as used to be the practice -- but on what they believe customers can afford. The insurers say state regulators, in their efforts to protect the public from high rates, have put off dealing with the rising underlying costs of insurance, much as Congress has delayed confronting the Federal budget deficit.
Many people in the insurance industry consider Maine to be the most egregious offender. Insurance company after insurance company has left the state, refusing to provide workers' compensation coverage because they say the state, for a decade, has refused to allow them to raise premiums enough to cover skyrocketing health claims and legal costs.
Recently, two of the three primary companies still doing business in Maine formally announced that they would leave at the end of the year. The third company says it, too, will give up by the end of the year unless the Governor and the Legislature do something to reform the system.
For small manufacturers like J. R. Maines in Naples, Me., prospects for the future appear frightening.
 
A Business at Risk
 The tiny maker of wood parts already pays $12 for every $100 of its 30 employees' salaries for workers' compensation. It is in an industry that pays particularly high premiums because of the high risk involved in the work. The company's owner, Richard Dyke, says he cannot afford to pay higher premiums. He also says he would close his doors the moment his coverage disappeared.
"I wouldn't expose myself to that kind of personal liability," Mr. Dyke said, "nor would I expose my workers to the risk."
Regulators say keeping a tight limit on premiums is necessary to protect the public from insurers' bloated rate requests. But as states from New Jersey to California debate how much to hold down prices in workers' compensation and automobile insurance, insurers are increasingly likely to invoke Maine as the extreme example of what happens when premiums do not cover costs.
Orin Kramer, an economist in Princeton, N.J., who specializes in insurance, argued in a recent paper published by an industry trade group that regulation of workers' compensation and private automobile insurance underwent a profound shift in the 1980's. It was then, Mr. Kramer said, that in response to sharp increases in the cost of providing insurance state regulators began to consider rate increases on the basis of what they felt the public could afford.
 
Messengers With Bad News
 Mr. Kramer estimated that the worst losses for insurers in the nation from 1987 through 1989 were in Maine, where the companies paid out $148 in claims for every $100 in premiums.
"We are the messengers who deliver the bad news about what is going on in society, and oftentimes we get shot," said Grover Czech, a vice president of the Maryland Insurance Group, one of the two companies that announced they would abandon the Maine workers' compensation business on Jan. 1. The other company that is leaving at the year's end is Commercial Union of Boston.
Critics of the insurance industry in Maine say they doubt that insurers' losses are as bad as the companies claim. Often, the critics charge, companies squander the public's money in waste and inefficiencies, and they exaggerate their real costs when they request higher premiums. One prominent national critic, Robert Hunter of the National Insurance Consumer Organization, said: "Companies around the country say their costs are so high. In fact, the increases they are asking for often include unacceptable inefficiencies or even considerable profits."
 
Costs Are Growing
 The crises afflicting state workers' compensation systems are almost all fueled by the same destructive cost spiral: growing medical and legal costs, broadening definitions of job-related injuries, and fraud and abuse.
Job-related injuries and sickness cost employers an estimated $62 billion in workers' compensation insurance in the United States in 1991, nearly triple the amount spent in 1980. Insurance company losses for workers' compensation claims were $7.1 billion nationally -- the greatest last year of any time in history, said A. M. Best, the insurance research company.
From the 1960's to the mid-1980's, Maine repeatedly revised its workers' compensation laws, making the system more complex and costly, trying -- as other states were -- to make compensation for workers more humane, and to a series of recommendations in 1972 by a national commission appointed by President Richard M. Nixon.
At one point in Maine, the ceiling on benefits reached twice the average weekly wage in the state, and benefits for partial disabilities could extend for a lifetime with cost-of-living adjustments. If any employer was notified of a workers' injury and did not contest it in 44 days, the insurer was obligated to pay for the injury as long as it lasted.
 
A Hockey Team's Exit
 The result was a surge in litigation, medical bills and in the amount insurers were paying out in claims. For many businesses, the cost of insurance can be unbearable. "It would have been a lot easier to stay in Maine if workers' comp had not gone so high," said Ed Anderson, the chairman and chief executive of the former Maine Mariners Hockey Club, a Boston Bruins farm club that recently moved to Rhode Island. "For the same player, making $60,000, we pay $6,500. In Maine it was $11,000."
Responding to the cries of business, the state did not grant any rate increases from 1981 to 1987 for companies doing business in Maine. In 1985 the Maine Legislature actually reduced workers' compensation premiums by 8 percent.
More and more customers were dropped by private carriers from the so-called voluntary market, and had to buy coverage from a state-operated pool. Such assigned-risk pools were originally intended to provide insurance to a small minority of customers who were rejected by private carriers. But in Maine, with so many insurers fleeing the market, 90 percent have come to buy their insurance from the pool. By law, all licensed carriers in the state must share any losses the pool may incur.
Industry leaders like M. R. Greenberg, the chairman of American International Group, one of the nation's largest insurance companies, said the losses were staggering. In 1987, he said, his company took in $6 million in premiums for policies it chose to write in Maine and paid $61 million for its share of the losses in the assigned-risk pool.
 
Legislative Action
 By 1987, faced by threats from the more than two dozen companies then writing workers' compensation business to leave the state, the Legislature enacted changes that curtailed benefits in order to cut costs and promised to have employers, not insurance companies, pay for the assigned-risk pool losses in 1988. Starting in 1989, the pool's losses were to be split evenly between employers and insurers. More than a dozen insurers were enticed back into the state.
But in the following years the state again granted rate increases far below what insurers said they needed to cover costs. In 1988, when the insurance industry sought to more than double its rates, the superintendent granted an increase of only 25 percent; in 1989 he granted a 22 percent increase, after the insurers had sought 45 percent.
In hindsight, the former insurance superintendent, Joseph Edwards, now says the workers' compensation market in Maine was paying out $250 million more than it was taking in during those years. In setting rates in 1988 and 1989, he says, he overestimated the savings insurers were realizing as a result of the 1987 legislative changes.
 
Critics See Hidden Profits
 Some critics still argue that behind insurers' complex bookkeeping lie hidden profits. Patrick N. McTeague, a counsel for the Maine A.F.L.-C.I.O. who also represents workers with compensation claims, said the severity of Maine's workers' compensation crisis comes from many highly unsafe workplaces and a decision by insurers to make an example of Maine in order to threaten regulators elsewhere.
"I believe that the companies are making money," Mr. McTeague said. "I am absolutely certain they are making money."
In the last four years, as the deficit of the assigned-risk pool increased, and insurers left the burden fell more heavily on those insurance companies that remained. Last year, a dispute between Gov. John R. McKernan and the Legislature over how to reform workers' compensation shut the state government for nearly three weeks.
By this summer, more than 90 percent of workers' compensation customers were in the assigned risk pool, and the latest estimate by the accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche placed the net operating loss of the assigned risk pool for the last three years at $574 million.
A state government panel is now studying the situation and Governor McKernan is expected to call a special session of the Legislature after the panel releases its recommendations at the end of August.
But Charles Soltan, a lawyer for Hanover Insurance, the last major insurer that has not yet filed papers to leave the state, says that unless some strong actions are taken quickly, his company is likely to leave as well. One small new company, Acadia Group, based in Portland, has not yet declared its intentions.
Brian Atchinson, the state's superintendant of insurance, said he could not predict what solutions the Governor and the Legislature might reach, if any.
"Insurers want to know who is going to pay the deficit," Mr. Atchinson said. "There is a great concern about not being the last one to turn out the lights."

HEADLINE: Times Square Plan Is on Hold, but Meter Is Still Running

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
Although state and city officials are prepared to postpone indefinitely construction of the four Times Square Center office towers, interest continues to grow on the multimillion-dollar loan that the public will eventually have to repay to the developers for site acquisition costs.
Officials are seeking to stop the clock on the interest obligation to the developers, Park Tower Realty and the Prudential Insurance Company of America. Otherwise, the public might be left owing tens of millions of dollars in interest alone, in addition to at least $153 million for condemnation awards and tenant settlements. 
 "We expect to agree, in essence, that the interest on this outstanding balance should not continue to accrue in the period before the office towers are built," said Carl Weisbrod, the president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, in an interview yesterday.
Under the agreement the city and state hope to reach with the developers, interest would stop running from the date that the developers were supposed to start building, in late 1993 or early 1994, until the time that they begin. That could be five or 10 years or even longer.
 
Awaiting Market Rebound
 Mr. Weisbrod added that there was also a tentative agreement to increase the interim rent paid by the developers for their building sites, as well as the rent they are to pay in lieu of real-estate taxes when the towers are constructed.
In exchange, the developers would be released from a construction timetable that would have forced them to build at a time when commercial tenants are virtually impossible to find. Rather, the developers would be free to begin Times Square Center when the market dictated.
While the developers have been paying acquisition costs as they arise, they are ultimately liable only for $88 million. The balance amounts to a long-term, interest-bearing loan that is to be repaid with the public share of the project's proceeds. Much of the repayment would come from a 50 percent credit against the rent paid for the office tower sites.
As of last week, $172.5 million had been paid to owners and tenants on the four blocks from Broadway to Eighth Avenue, between 41st and 43d Streets, according to the state Urban Development Corporation.
 
Criticism of Costs
 When all the settlements have been reached, the total might come to $241 million. That means the public would owe the developers at least $153 million, together with interest calculated at the prime rate plus one percent. Currently, that would amount to $10.7 million annually. A year ago, it would have been $14.5 million.
Also, under a 1988 agreement, site acquisition costs are defined as including the environmental impact statement, appraisals, title reports, title insurance premiums, surveys, filing fees, transfer taxes, and certain legal fees incurred by the developers and the government.
The Urban Development Corporation would not disclose the total amount of these costs to date, other than to put it in the millions of dollars.
In the wake of the disclosure last week that Times Square Center would be put on hold indefinitely, there was renewed criticism of the financial arrangement as a needless public subsidy.
State Senator Franz S. Leichter, a Manhattan Democrat, said, "We're talking of losses here that could well amount into the hundreds of millions of dollars, without anything being done and with 10, 12 years being lost in cleaning up 42d Street."
 
Call for More Scrutiny
 The City Comptroller, Elizabeth Holtzman, said any revision of the deal would warrant scrutiny. "We have always had questions about the subsidies here," she said.
But city and state officials continue to believe that both the process and the cost will be justified.
"The reasons for cleaning up 42d Street have never been more compelling," said Rebecca Robertson, president of the 42d Street Development Project, a subsidiary of the state development agency. "Times Square is just on the verge of making a comeback and 42d Street is a cancer on that revival."
 
Increasing Costs
 As long as 42d Street was in the hands of dozens of private owners, the officials contend, there was no chance that it could be revitalized. But, they say, the public treasury could not have afforded the condemnation costs and no developer would have taken on the responsibility without some kind of limit to its liability.
"This project was conceived as a means of accomplishing a major public purpose at the same time as not having the city and public liable for a tremendous cash outlay up front," Mr. Weisbrod said.
He said it was essential to have a cap beyond which the developers could recover their costs.
At the time of the deal, he said, it was believed that $88 million would more than cover the cost of acquiring the entire site. "Because this project was delayed by some years of planning and many, many years of litigation," he said, "those land costs rose substantially."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Campaign Finances;
Spending in Congressional Races Is Up in a Topsy-Turvy Year

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 8

 BODY:
Congressional campaign spending has spurted this year, but political action committees are providing a smaller share of the cash, a Federal Election Commission report showed today.
Spending through June 30 in all House and Senate races reached $288 million, up 50 percent from $192 million two years ago. The increase appeared to be caused largely by two hotly contested Senate races in California, which had none in 1990, and by an increase in House candidates seeking to take advantage of reapportionment. There are 2,247 people in races for the 435 House seats this year, as against 1,372 in 1990. 
 Spencer Abraham, co-chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said "a very anti-incumbent sort of atmosphere" was a major cause in the increased number of candidates and the fund-raising success of many House Republican challengers.
 
Year of the Challenger
 Leslie C. Francis, executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said he thought the opportunities offered by redistricting were the main reason for the surge in both candidates and spending, but he said widespread complaints about Congress meant "this is the year to be running as a challenger."
The report, the commission's last complete look at all House and Senate contests until four days before the Nov. 3 election, shows a much more modest increase in contributions by political action committees.
Their largesse, combined by the commission with relatively small amounts from other political committees, climbed to $98 million in the first 18 months of this election cycle from $89 million between Jan. 1, 1989, and June 30, 1990.
But with overall receipts soaring by 32 percent, to $369 million this year from $279 million two years ago, PAC contributions were only 27 percent of the total, compared to 32 percent in 1990.
 
Money for Incumbents
 As usual, their contributions went heavily to incumbents, who gathered $80 million of the PAC donations.
Mr. Francis said the economy was a major factor. "They've been having a harder time raising money in this economy," he said political action committee officials told him.
Mr. Abraham said he thought the major reason was that political action committees were waiting to see how House races, more uncertain than usual this year because of redistricting, played out before making their choices among nonincumbents. "We've urged PAC's to hold back," he said. That warning has not hurt House incumbents; their average PAC receipts have increased 16 percent.
Comparisons between different two-year cycles in Senate races are less instructive than analyses of House contests, because every two years a different mix of Senate candidates in large and small states is up for election.
 
D'Amato's Bankroll
 For example, total receipts of Senate candidates went from $116 million by June 30, 1990, to $161 million this year, an increase of $46 million or 39 percent. But $37 million was raised by California candidates in two contested primaries in each party. Total Senate spending went from $74 million in 1990 to $123 million this year, an increase of $49 million or 66 percent. But the California candidates spent $42 million.
The Senate figures did show that the incumbent with the biggest bankroll was Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, who had $4.2 million on hand as of June 30. Seven other incumbents had more than $2 million.
The Republicans were Bob Packwood of Oregon, $3.0 million; Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, $2.8 million; Bob Dole of Kansas, $2.3 million, and Don Nickles of Oklahoma, $2.1 million. The Democrats were Bob Graham of Florida, $2.2 million; John B. Breaux of Louisiana, $2.1 million; and Wyche Fowler Jr. of Georgia, $2.0 million.
The figures for House races showed two different financial strategies emerging in what both parties expect to be an uncertain and swiftly changing series of contests. Republicans are making their first serious effort in a decade to compete broadly for control of the House. There are now 268 Democrats, 166 Republicans and one independent.
 
G.O.P. Focuses on Challengers
 Republicans seem more focused on challenging incumbents. In 68 districts with Democratic incumbents, Republicans have candidates who raised a credible $50,000 by June 30. In only 27 Republican districts was there a Democrat who had raised that much.
But Democrats were in stronger financial shape in "open" seats, where no sitting Representative is seeking re-election. They have candidates with $50,000 or more in 56 such seats, compared to 40 for the Republicans.
Both parties' traditional approach to House campaigns has been to concentrate on protecting their own incumbents and to focus secondly on inviting, if expensive, open seats. Serious efforts to help challengers have come third.
That meant, practically speaking, that Republicans were not seriously contesting enough seats to win control of the House. Mr. Abraham said this year's strategy required having "competitive races in 100 or more districts the Republicans didn't control."
On Friday Representative Guy Vander Jagt of Michigan, the chairman of the Republican committee, announced donations of $1,000 each to 71 Republican challengers and 36 candidates in open seats.
Mr. Vander Jagt said he would be providing other help, including his own campaigning. He acknowledged that he had more time available than he expected after his own defeat for renomination on Tuesday. But he said his loss was proof "the anti-incumbent wind is not a breeze, it's a hurricane," and one that should help Republicans simply because there are more Democratic incumbents as targets.
But despite the number of Republican challengers who had raised enough money to get them a hearing, the Federal Election Commission data showed that of the 42 House candidates with $500,000 or more in cash on hand as of June 30, all were incumbents and 31 were Democrats.
Two New Yorkers topped that list. Representatives Charles E. Schumer and Stephen J. Solarz, both of Brooklyn, had $2.1 million and $1.9 million respectively. The other Democrats over $1 million were Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, $1.6 million; Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey, $1.4 million; Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader, $1.2 million, and Michael A. Andrews of Texas, $1.1 million. The Republicans were David Dreier of California, $1.9 million, and James H. Quillen of Tennessee, $1.1 million.

To Some, Hope Is Just a Drug Too Far Away

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP

 BODY:
Many who treat schizophrenia believe clozapine is the most important medication to come along in 30 years. The press is so excited, it keeps using "Awakenings" in headlines, conjuring images of the film star Robert De Niro taking a new medicine and suddenly going from comatose to superstar.
Clozapine isn't quite De Niro, but study after study shows 30 to 60 percent of chronic schizophrenics who do not respond to other medications -- people plagued by voices, paranoia, hallucinations -- improve considerably, with 10 percent making outstanding progress. It means many on back wards of state hospitals can leave for supervised housing, like group homes. 
 At the Buffalo State hospital, 21 of 31 long-term patients treated were discharged; at Bronx State, 27 percent; at Elmira State, one-third. Dr. Sheikh Qadeer of Elmira was struck by how much clozapine reduced violent incidents. Of 785 state hospital patients treated with it, 170 were discharged.
That should be good economic news. It costs $120,000 a year to keep a person at a state hospital versus $35,000 at a group home and $9,000 at a supervised single-room-occupancy center. The savings should easily offset clozapine's cost -- $5,000 per person a year.
You'd think the state would aggressively test clozapine; half of New York's 12,000 mental patients are schizophrenic. But no. Each state hospital gets a tiny quota. A single psychiatrist in private practice in Manhattan, Dr. Robert Levine, has more clozapine patients (55) than Bronx State (25 of 379 schizophrenics) and South Beach State on Staten Island (15 of 175 schizophrenics) combined.
It takes major advocacy just to get on a state waiting list, says Vera Hassner of the Alliance for the Mentally Ill. Grace Mondo, whose son is at the Syracuse state hospital, yelled for two years and finally got him listed in January. He received clozapine in June. "He came home for his regular weekend visit last Sunday," she says, "and for the first time, instead of withdrawing, he sat with me and my sisters and had coffee and spoke. I'm not saying he's normal, but he's better already."
Ed Wilson, who has a long history of suicide attempts, has been on the South Beach State waiting list since January. His father says his most recent suicide try was two months ago. Hospital officials agree he's a good candidate but say there are more pressing cases on the list. If he's lucky, he'll still be alive when his number comes up.
Clozapine was cleared for use by the Federal Government in 1990. For budgetary reasons, New York was one of the last states to approve it for Medicaid, acting only after advocates sued and a state judge ruled clozapine was "impressive," "unique" and "medically necessary."
But state hospitals are not covered by Medicaid. The Legislature appropriated a special clozapine fund of $2 million a year for state hospitals. It is not nearly enough. State officials say 198 patients are on waiting lists and 1,000 more are likely candidates. The numbers are probably conservative. The state permits only a three-month test period to see if the drug helps, but even its own psychiatrists, like Dr. Jean-Pierre Lindenmayer of Bronx State, think that is too short. Dr. Lindenmayer ignores the rules and gives patients six-month trials.
In social services, you must spend money now to save money in the long run and if you don't, you dig yourself in deeper. In a few cases, clozapine causes a drastic loss of white blood cells that may be fatal if not detected. So users must have weekly blood tests. Dr. Lindenmayer estimates that an additional 150 Bronx patients could be tried on clozapine if there was a community-support system insuring that they returned for weekly testing.
The support system is puny because the state did not finance a single new group home last year; because the state promised to build 1,900 supervised units for the city's homeless mentally ill in two years under the "New York-New York" plan and has delivered 264.
Who's to blame? Take your pick: the state Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, for obstructionism on behalf of the suburban Not In My Back Yard crowd; the Mental Health Commissioner, Richard C. Surles, for backing down over and over; Gov. Mario M. Cuomo for making housing the mentally ill less important than building prisons; a public that gets really angry about higher taxes and unregulated cable.
Even if people do not care, they should not forget: There are thousands of New Yorkers -- hundreds of thousands of Americans -- locked away, useless, who, given clozapine, might be something better. Maybe not De Niros, but people who could live less tormented lives, in a group home or an apartment, working part time, enjoying a coffee with family. Keeping them locked away is more costly, and that is not measured only in hard currency.

HEADLINE: North American Trade Talks Focus on Car Parts

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 8

 BODY:
The free-trade talks among the United States, Canada and Mexico dragged on today, as negotiators continued to sort through and resolve the manytechnical details of a North American free-trade agreement.
During the 11th consecutive day of the talks, negotiators focused on how to count the North American components of cars and trucks. Vehicles with three-fifths of their parts produced in North America will qualify for duty-free treatment under the new agreement. 
 The officials are in the final stages of developing a highly complex system for tracing where parts are produced, not only by auto makers but by several layers of subcontractors. If a subcontractor in the United States assembles a piston, piston rod and piston seal using imported parts, for example, only the value of the assembly work is likely to count toward the North American content of the vehicle, a person with detailed information on the talks said.
Traditional practice in international trade dictates that if a product is assembled in a country, the origin of the parts does not matter.
The 1988 United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement used murky language in defining how a vehicle's component mixture should be counted. One result has been a long-running dispute over whether Honda cars assembled in Canada can enter the United States without paying duties. These cars' engines are made in Ohio, but many parts are imported from Japan.
 
Insistence of Canada
 At Canada's insistence, the new rules are being drafted so that automobiles produced at Honda's factory in Alliston, Ontario, will qualify as made in North America.
While the rules on cars are being set, the overall talks are proceeding slowly, in part because each country's lawyers are trying to put the agreement into legal text. In a clash of cultures that says as much about the United States as Mexico, the Mexican delegation has many economists but relatively few lawyers in senior positions to review the evolving document.
The differing backgrounds of the negotiators extends to the very top of each team, but with some similarities. Commerce Secretary Jaime Serra Puche of Mexico and Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, both did their graduate work at Yale University. Mr. Serra received a doctorate in economics, Mrs. Hills a law degree.
Lawyers for all three sides are also going through the agreement to check that each product is listed by the correct international tariff number. American imports from Mexico alone fall into 20,000 different categories, with many products, like glassware, falling into several dozen categories defined by such details as size or even heat-resistance.
Precision is very important in tariffs. Congress once passed legislation assessing Customs duties on imported "fruit, trees." But a clerk dropped a comma in transcribing the rule for official publication so that it only covered "fruit trees."
 
Writing Rules for Disputes
 Losses in forgone tariff revenues ran into the millions of dollars before the mistake could be fixed.
The lawyers are mostly done with writing rules for mediating commercial disputes. In cases involving environmental issues, these rules will provide for trilateral arbitration panels. These panels, which will have precedence over international panels, will issue nonbinding rulings, and will rely on public pressure in each country to insure compliance.
The panels will not have the authority to impose trade sanctions, people involved in the negotiations said. This feature may draw criticism in Congress, where Senator Max S. Baucus, the Montana Democrat who heads the Subcommittee on International Trade, has called for the panels to have such authority.

HEADLINE: Iraq Policy Still Bedevils Bush as Congress Asks: Were Crimes Committed?

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 8

 BODY:
The players in this complex tale include the man accused of masterminding what may be the biggest bank fraud in history, a bulldog Congressman who seems determined to prove that the President's top aides engaged in a vast cover-up, and a beleaguered President who cannot understand why the issue will not go away.
As President Bush's re-election campaign shifts into high gear, it continues to be haunted by the dispute over United States policy toward Iraq before it invaded Kuwait in August 1990. The invasion led to the Persian Gulf war. 
 Under the policy, billions of dollars in American aid was used to try to moderate President Saddam Hussein and turn him into a stabilizing force in the Middle East. And the President has acknowledged that this policy failed.
 
Three Vital Questions
 But in its zeal to influence Mr. Hussein, did the Bush Administration ignore evidence that some of this aid was diverted to Iraq's buildup of weapons? Did it try to delay indictments of high-level Iraqi officials accused in a United States bank fraud? And did the President's aides lie to Congress in an attempt to conceal the full scope of their failed courtship of Iraq?
Those are the questions that lie at the heart of the affair. Mr. Bush accuses Congressional Democrats of "recklessly" distorting the record for political gain and characterizes his policy as an honest error in judgment. The Administration insists that the policy was widely known and generally accepted as a sound one -- by United States allies in the Middle East and even by some of the lawmakers who are now leading the criticism.
The Democrats, however, blame the Administration for "coddling" the Iraqi leader in advance of his invasion of Kuwait, despite mounting evidence that he was building a formidable military machine even after the eight-year Iran-Iraq war ended in 1988. Had the Administration paid more heed to that evidence, they say, the gulf war might never have been necessary.
Beyond the heated public statements, this much is known: In the late 1980's, under a Presidential directive to build closer relations with Baghdad, the United States Government permitted the sale of sophisticated American technology and equipment to Iraq, some of which is believed to have been used to build weapons. At the same time, Iraq was allowed to become a major participant in the Commodity Credit Corporation, through which the United States Government cosigns bank loans for poor countries that want to buy American farm products.
 
Taxpayers May Have to Pay
 The financially strapped Iraqis financed some of the food and technology purchases with loans from the tiny Atlanta branch of an Italian bank, the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro. The Iraqis chose this branch, law enforcement officials say, because its officers were willing to take bribes in exchange for making high-risk loans.
The loans made through the agriculture program, on the other hand, were no-risk, as the United States Government would make good on any that Iraq failed to repay. Congressional critics have said the United States taxpayers will ultimately have to repay hundreds of millions of dollars on defaulted loans.
The Congressional panels that are investigating various facets of the Iraq policy have turned up evidence that they say suggests that some of those farm loans may have been channeled into military purchases.
Some lawmakers also maintain that the Government interfered with prosecutors investigating the bribery of the Atlanta bank officials and that it tried to conceal from Congress the extent of Iraq's purchases of technology.
But they have yet to come up with proof of any wrongdoing by public officials. That is why the House Judiciary Committee is eager for a positive reply from Attorney General William P. Barr about its request for the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate the charges. Mr. Barr must respond to the request by Monday. He may either approve or reject it or ask for more time for an investigation of his own before deciding.
What follows is a look at which accusations involve possible criminal violations, as opposed to misguided but legal policy issues. These accusations, involving obstruction of justice and lying to Congress, would be the focus of any independent investigation.
 
The Altered Lists
Changes Uncovered At Commerce Dept.
 The strongest indication that a crime may have been committed involves alterations made on a Commerce Department list of high-technology items approved for sale to Iraq between 1985 and 1990. The list was sent in October 1990 to Representative Doug Barnard Jr., Democrat of Georgia, whose Government Operations subcommittee was investigating exports to Iraq.
After Mr. Barnard received an anonymous tip that the Commerce Department had tampered with the list, he asked the department's Inspector General to investigate. The Inspector General concluded in a report that both the copy sent to Congress and the permanent record had been changed in 68 instances to delete references to military designations. It can be illegal to willfully falsify documents presented to Congressional investigators.
In one instance, a description of a 1989 license for frequency synthesizers for a military complex north of Baghdad that made equipment for missiles and atomic bombs was changed to delete the crucial sentence, "According to our information, the end-user is involved in military matters." The synthesizers were designed to test surveillance radar at the complex, which was a primary target of allied bombers in the gulf war.
In another instance, the Inspector General's report said that the deletion of "military" to describe the sale of $1 billion worth of trucks to Iraq was "misleading and unjustified."
Senior Commerce Department officials have testified to Congress that Dennis E. Kloske, who was then Under Secretary of Commerce, was solely to blame. But Mr. Kloske, who resigned in April 1991, told Congressional investigators that White House officials and top aides to former Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher supervised the preparation of the list, although he did not actually accuse his superiors of ordering the changes. The Justice Department says that since it is investigating the alterations, there is no need for an independent counsel.
 
The Officials' Role
Lawmakers Charge They Were Misled
 Beyond the Commerce Department list, Democratic lawmakers are also investigating whether Administration officials purposely misled Congress about Iraq policy, either in public testimony, correspondence or conversations, or by withholding documents.
One line of inquiry involves the Commodity Credit Corporation program through which Iraq made grain purchases. In the fall of 1989 the Bush Administration was locked in a heated debate about whether to go forward with $1 billion in new credits for Iraq. State Department officials argued that the credits were crucial to improving relations with Baghdad. Agriculture Department officials had reservations but wanted to promote American exports. But both the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve were concerned about Iraq's ability and willingness to pay back its debts. Bowing to White House foreign policy concerns, a compromise decision was made to extend the credits in two stages.
Some lawmakers, like Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who heads the Senate Agriculture Committee, believe they were misled when they raised questions about the wisdom of the loan guarantees.
For example, in late October 1989, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d telephoned Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter urging him to go forward with $1 billion in credits on "foreign policy grounds," according to an internal State Department memo. But Mr. Yeutter assured Mr. Leahy in a letter in February 1990 that foreign policy considerations did not contribute to the decision-making process.
Other Democratic lawmakers charge that the Administration conspired to mislead Congress by withholding crucial documents. Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, the Texas Democrat who has taken the lead in the investigations, has said there was a cover-up formulated in meetings held at the White House by lawyers from various Government agencies to coordinate answers to Congressional demands for documents. He has dubbed the group the "Rostow gang" because its chairman was C. Nicholas Rostow, the legal adviser to the National Security Council and a special assistant to Mr. Bush.
White House officials call the charge absurd, saying that such coordination is routine. But a senior State Department official said that Mr. Baker was indeed upset to learn that Mr. Rostow was trying to control the flow of documents, and ordered Edwin D. Williamson, the legal adviser who represented the State Department at the meetings, to coordinate with no one except Mr. Baker.
 
The Bank Investigation
Did Administration Delay Indictment?
 A third area of concern is whether the Bush Administration illegally interfered with the criminal investigation of the Atlanta branch of Bank Lavoro. Interfering with a criminal investigation can lead to charges of obstruction of justice.
Specifically, Congress is investigating whether the Administration, in an attempt to keep from embarrassing the Iraqi Government by exposing its role in the matter, delayed for a year the indictment of the man who is accused of being the mastermind of the suspected fraud, Christopher P. Drogoul. Mr. Drogoul has acknowledged taking cash and gifts from companies that did business with Iraq and benefited from his loans to Baghdad.
Internal documents show that in the months after the bank was raided by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in August 1989 the prosecutors in Atlanta were telling other Government agencies that they could bring indictments within months. In fact, Gail McKenzie, the aggressive prosecutor who has run the investigation from the beginning, had prepared what one official described as a "bare bones" indictment in January 1990.
But the Justice Department did not announce the indictment until late February 1991, one day after Mr. Bush announced a cease-fire in the gulf war. Documents made public in recent months show that the investigation was the subject of high-level discussions in the State Department, with some officials arguing that the case could jeopardize United States relations with Iraq. Ms. McKenzie has acknowledged receiving a phone call early on from a White House aide inquiring about the status of the investigation.
The White House denies exerting any pressure on prosecutors, and the Justice Department disputes that the indictment was delayed. In interviews, department officials said that prosecutors exaggerated their ability to try the case early because of pressure from the United States Attorney in Atlanta at the time, Robert Barr, who was eager to get the prosecution of the biggest bank fraud case under way before he left office.
"The only reason we would ever seek an indictment is if we believed we had the evidence," said Mr. Barr, a lawyer who is seeking the Republican nomination for the Senate in Georgia. "Whether I or anyone else was leaving the office was irrelevant."
 
The Suspect Loans
A Hint U.S. Money Paid for Iraqi Arms
 Beyond the question of interference, some lawmakers have also charged that some of the American farm loans were used by Iraq to buy military equipment -- an explosive charge that would mean that the United States helped pay for some of the weapons it later went to war to destroy.
In a memo seized on by critics of the Administration's policy, a Commerce Department official, Frank M. Lemay, warned that there was evidence suggesting that some of the loans guaranteed by the farm program may have been diverted into weapons purchases. But no investigation has established that that occurred. And Bush officials note that because of the Federal investigation of the bank, the Administration excluded it from the loan credit program in August 1989.
Misuse of the loans would not constitute a crime by the Government unless it knowingly took part. Even so, lawmakers say the Administration should have been more alert to the warning signs of Iraq's arms procurement program.
 
Chart: "What Congress Wants to Know"
 
In the House
 
HOUSE BANKING, FINANCE & URBAN AFFAIRS
The chairman, Henry B. Gonzalez of Texas, began looking at loans to Iraq by the Atlanta branch of an Italian bank and came across evidence that he said suggested the bank may have misused United States-backed farm loans to help Iraq acquire military technology. The committee is also investigating Commerce Department licensing of exports of high-technology goods to Iraq, as well as whether the Justice Department tried to delay bringing fraud indictments against the bank, the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro.
 
HOUSE JUDICIARY
The committee is considering whether to grant a request by Representative Gonzalez for appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate whether the Bush policy on Iraq broke the law.
 
HOUSE FOREIGN AFFAIRS Subcommittee on International Economic Policy and Trade
The subcommittee is looking at what militarily useful equipment was sold by the United States to Iraq, at the Bush Administration's prewar policy toward Iraq and at the withholding of information from Congress regarding that policy.
 
GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS
Subcommittee on Commerce, Consumer and Monetary Affairs
The panel is investigating American exports to Iraq. Its chairman, Doug Barnard, obtained a Commerce Department list of high-technology items approved for sale to Iraq between 1985 and 1990 and determined that it had been altered in 68 instances to delete references to military applications.
 
ENERGY
Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations
The subcommittee is investigating why the Department of Energy and the Bush Administration did not do more to prevent the buildup of Iraq's nuclear weapons program.
 
AGRICULTURE
Subcommittee on Foreign Agriculture
The subcommittee wants to determine whether the commodity credit program that guaranteed loans to Iraq was part of a scheme to finance Iraq's military buildup and whether that program improperly became an instrument in the Bush Administration's foreign policy.

In the Senate
 
AGRICULTURE
This committee is also looking at the Commodity Credit Corporation guarantees and their role in the Administration's foreign policy.
 
FOREIGN RELATIONS
Senator Jesse Helms, supported by some Democrats, is holding up the nomination of James P. Covey to head a new State Department bureau for South Asia until the department turns over documents relating to Mr. Covey's role in prewar Iraq policy.
 
SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE
The committee wants to know what the intelligence agencies knew about links between the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro and the farm credit program, and whether either was involved with Iraq's arms network.

HEADLINE: POLITICAL NOTES;
Peacemaker's Tribute or Trojan Horseplay?

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING

 BODY:
After months of riding roughshod over the minority Democrats in the Legislature and Democratic Gov. Jim Florio, the combative Speaker of the New Jersey Assembly, Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian, now says he wants to meet regularly with the Governor to plan the course of the ship of state.
In a letter last Wednesday, Mr. Haytaian invited Mr. Florio to meet with him and Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco tomorrow and on a "regular, weekly basis" to discuss "various issues of mutual concern." 
 Governor Florio's press secretary, Jon Shure, cited the Governor's full schedule and ruled tomorrow's meeting out, but said the Governor was "always open" to meeting with the legislative leaders.
The overture put the administration in a difficult spot, on the one hand not wanting to appear obdurate, but on the other, being unwilling to establish something that could amount to sharing the governorship. Nor would the administration want to share responsibility for negative effects of Republican budget cuts.
There was also some private trepidation over just how deep the spirit of cooperation goes. Both Mr. Haytaian and Mr. DiFrancesco pledged to cooperate with the Governor when they took veto-proof control of both houses of the Legislature in January, but then attacked, primarily by bashing the Governor relentlessly for his 1990 tax increase.
And even as Mr. Haytaian's letter went out, the Speaker himself was in Colorado Springs at a meeting of the American Legislative Council, where both he and Mr. DiFrancesco picked up "Legislator of the Year" awards.
Mr. Haytaian used the occasion to -- what else? -- bash Jim Florio. "Our once vibrant economy didn't just shut down one day because our free-market system failed," he said. "It came to a grinding halt because it was fed a lethal dose of government overkill."
He stopped just short of calling Mr. Florio a Communist. Just six months into office, he said, "the Governor introduced a new economic agenda that at best could be called Socialist."
He went on to say that "while Eastern Bloc countries were gaining their freedom from governments that denied them opportunities for a better quality of life, Jim Florio was building his version of the Berlin wall in New Jersey."
Perhaps disarmament could be the first item on any meeting agenda.
 
Signals Scrambled
 When the Republicans took control of the New Jersey Legislature, they had a clear mandate to cut taxes and spending, but they also decided there was an implicit message to privatize state government functions. They are studying ways to do that, from returning bus service to the private sector to farming out incarceration -- as is done in some other states -- and auto inspections.
But the Senate President, Mr. DiFrancesco, appeared this week to abandon another privatization scheme: divesting the state of the New Jersey Network and turning the television service over to another nonprofit operator, like WNET Channel 13. The idea was to pare down NJN's annual $8 million state subsidy -- it was cut to $4 million this year, essentially giving the station six months to transfer its operations to WNET or some other operator -- and also divest the network of three of the UHF stations it operates.
But while Channel 13 made it clear they would like nothing better than to broaden its market, it had no intention of paying anything for the network's $53 million in assets, including a brand-new studio in Trenton that alone is worth $23 million. And the Federal Communications Commission quickly threw cold water on Mr. DiFrancesco's idea that the educational UHF stations could be converted to commercial operation and sold for up to $150 million. The F.C.C. made it clear it had never happened and never would.
And a lot of NJN supporters made it known that they looked with considerable disfavor on the whole idea.
On Tuesday, Mr. DiFrancesco threw in the towel. Meeting with editors and reporters of The Record of Hackensack, he conceded the network had a lot more friends than he had thought -- "They have a constituency, I'm finding a lot of opposition" he said -- and announced he would withdraw his plan if the network would come up with some better ways to fund itself and change its programming, "maybe gavel-to-gavel legislative coverage," for example.

HEADLINE: A Test of Mr. Clinton's Backbone

 BODY:
Trade policy is about to burst into the Presidential campaign. President Bush is expected to announce this week a free-trade pact with Mexico and Canada that, he promises, "will mean more jobs, more growth . . ."
But powerful Democrats, led by the House majority leader, Richard Gephardt, have threatened to oppose the agreement. They claim it could destroy jobs and the environment by spurring American corporations to flee to Mexico "to take advantage of cheap labor, lax enforcement of health, safety, environmental and labor laws . . ." 
 The dispute will pose a severe test for Gov. Bill Clinton, who has portrayed himself as a new-generation, pro-market Democrat who won't pander to the traditional Democratic constituents, like organized labor, now clamoring for protection.
If the treaty turns out to be as good as leaked reports say, Mr. Clinton will have to choose between the protectionist politics of old and his pro-growth campaign promises. Voters who want to know if Mr. Clinton would have the backbone, as President, to stand up to powerful Democratic leaders when they're wrong may get a powerful clue this week.
Mr. Gephardt's contention that free trade will destroy American jobs is off base -- as is Mr. Bush's promise that it will create jobs.
There will be selective gains and losses in various industries. But free trade won't affect the total number of employed Americans. At any time the Federal Reserve Board can pump up the economy, and create more jobs, by printing money. But if it goes too far -- by trying to drive unemployment below, say, 5 percent -- it will ignite accelerating rates of inflation. Thus the U.S. will continue to muddle along with unemployment rates above 5 percent in good times, 7 or 8 percent in bad times, free trade pact or not.
The great value of free trade is that it can raise the living standards of most Americans. By redirecting production where it's cheaper, the treaty would help hundreds of millions of consumers.
In the U.S., textiles and sugar production will shrink; chemicals and business services will grow. This will be traumatic for thousands of affected workers. Yet the humane way to address their plight is not to deny everyone else the benefits of free trade but to provide them generous relocation and retraining assistance.
Environmental and health standards are a trickier problem. The danger is that American standards might be challenged by Mexico as unfair trade barriers or lowered to compete with Mexico. But as Keith Bradsher reports in yesterday's Times, the agreement makes impressive strides to block the threat.
Caught up in Presidential politics, the trade pact has been magnified beyond its true importance. The Mexican economy is tiny compared with the U.S., and U.S. tariffs are already low. Dropping them to zero poses little threat to domestic industries. The fear of companies fleeing across the border to hire dollar-an-hour labor is grossly exaggerated. If low wages siphoned away business, Sri Lanka would rule the international economy.
Mr. Bush has determined to reap the gains of free trade. Now Mr. Clinton must decide if he's really for trade -- with generous help for the relative few who will be hurt in the process -- or for the politics of old.

HEADLINE: Q and A

BYLINE: By Carl Sommers

 BODY:
Studying Russian in Russia 
Q. I would like to study the Russian language formally in Russia but not for credit. I hold a master's degree in library science. Are there organizations that can assist me? -- Thomas Pkorovo, McLean, Va.
 A. Two organizations that arrange overseas study programs offer Russian-language study for one academic year in St. Petersburg and another offers a year in Moscow. All three say that though the courses can be taken for academic credit, many participants are college graduates. Students should be aware that in many classes textbooks are not used, classes consist almost entirely of lectures by the instructor, and there are few tests or other means of assessing progress before a final exam.
 The American Institute for Foreign Study, 102 Greenwich Avenue, Greenwich, Conn. 06830, (800) 727-2437, offers its program at St. Petersburg State University (formerly Leningrad University). All students must enroll in an intensive Russian language course of 15 hours a week -- no previous study of Russian is required -- plus other classes, which can include history, art history, Russian literature and contemporary Russian life. Participants live in a residence hall. The fall semester begins in late August and ends in mid-December. The spring semester begins in late January and ends in mid-May. Each semester includes a four-day excursion to Moscow. Applications must be received by May 15 for the fall semester and Oct. 15 for the spring. The fee for 1993-94 will be $12,995 for the full year, $6,995 for one semester and $5,270 for a quarter, about a month shorter than a semester. The prices include round-trip air travel from the United States, required, and all meals.
 The Council on International Educational Exchange, University Programs Department, 205 East 42d Street, New York, N.Y. 10017, (212) 661-1414, also offers a year of academic study at St. Petersburg State University, but for people with at least three years of Russian. (The council offers summer and semester programs with less stringent prerequisites.) The program is 38 weeks, from late August to late May. Course work includes 10 hours a week of language instruction, and two other courses chosen with one's academic advisor. The cost for the 1992-93 academic year is $10,600 (a semester costs $6,500), including tuition, room and board (students must stay in a dormitory), transportation to classes, group excursions and round-trip air fare from New York, required. Application deadline is March 1. The organization also has shorter-term programs for students of business, science, social sciences and Slavic languages and literature, in Tver, Novosibirsk and Moscow.
 The American Council of Teachers of Russian, 1776 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Suite 300, Washington, D.C. 20036, (202) 833-7522, offers its program at Moscow State Pedagogical University. The next sessions are Sept. 4, 1992, to June 15, 1993. The fall semester consists of language, history, literature and economics courses and the spring semester comprises a language seminar, two other courses and preparation of a term paper. The cost is $11,000, which includes course work, round-trip air fare from Washington (also required), dormitory room and board, weekly visits with teachers, journalists and other professionals and two one-week trips outside Moscow each semester. The application deadline is March 1.
 
New York Guides in Spanish
 Q. Are there Spanish-language guidebooks to New York City? -- Bonnie DeMeio, Stroudsburg, Pa. A. Berlitz publishes a Spanish-language version of its pocket-size guide to New York. The 1991 edition, $6.95, is 128 pages long and is available at a few bookstores in New York. One is The Complete Traveller, 199 Madison Avenue, (212) 685-9007. Another, New York Bound Bookshop, 50 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, N.Y. 10020, (212) 245-8503, will mail the book. The minimum charge for mailing is $1.50.
 A bit more extensive is the 127-page New York guide in the Guia Naranja (Orange Guide) series, published by Ediciones Tinatvera in Barcelona. The 1990 edition, $24.95, is available from French and European Publications, 115 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10003, (212) 673-7400. The shipping cost is an additional $7.50.
 
Weather in India and Nepal
 Q. I will be touring India and Nepal in October. What will the weather be like? -- Sergio Leyva, New York, N.Y.
 A. Except for the southeastern coast, the Indian monsoon season ends in October. There may be a few rainy days, especially at the beginning of the month, but rainfall is likely to be fairly light. In the Himalayas and their foothills in the north of India, high temperatures generally are in the low 60's and the lows in the low 50's. For example, Darjeeling has an average high of 61 and an average low of 51; there are five rainy days on average and a total rainfall of 5.1 inches. The northern plains are considerably hotter. For example, New Delhi's average high is 89 and the low is 74, with six rainy days and 4.5 inches of rain. In the drier west, Calcutta has an average high of 93 and a low of 65, with only one rainy day and 0.4 inches. The Rajasthan Desert, one of the hottest places in the world, has high temperatures of close to 100 and lows in the mid-60's; any rain in October is rare. On the west coast, Bombay has an average high of 89, a low of 73 and three rainy days with 2.5 inches; the weather in the interior and the south is very similar. In the southeast, the monsoons begin in October and continue into December; Madras has a high of 90, a low of 75 and 11 rainy days with 12 inches total.
 The monsoon season in Nepal is late June to September. In October, Katmandu has an average high of 80, a low of 56 and four rainy days with 1.5 inches of rain.
 
Health Insurance in Canada
 Q. I am planning to do some cycling in Quebec this summer. In Canada, which has a national health care system, what are the payment requirements of United States citizens who need medical treatment? -- Veronica Dee, New York, N.Y.
 A. People who are not citizens of Canada are not covered by the country's national health insurance plan, according to the Quebec tourist office. Travelers should check with their health insurance carrier before they leave. If their insurance does not cover them while in Canada, there are several companies that offer short-term coverage for travelers. Some of them are Access America, 6600 West Broad Street, Richmond, Va. 23230, (800) 284-8300, which charges $49 a person for two weeks; Travel Guard International, 1145 Clark Street, Stevens Point, Wis. 54481, (800) 782-5151, $39 a person for two weeks, and Health Care Abroad, Post Office Box 480, Middleburg, Va. 22117, (800) 237-6615, $3 a day. This type of policy may have a deductible for each claim.

HEADLINE: ART;
Peter Max Is Poised to Replay His 15 Minutes

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
Close your eyes and imagine a blank canvas filling with bright colors, fluid lines, delicate forms. That, for the artist Peter Max, is pure creativity.
Now imagine an artist, brush heavy with color, moving with energetic dance steps before the canvas, filling the canvas with sweeping strokes. That, for Mr. Max, is creativity made manifest. 
 Now imagine a cameraman videotaping the artist dancing before the canvas. That is creativity made manifest through many media.
Now imagine that the canvas is not a canvas at all but the Berlin wall in the fall of 1989. That the creative moment reaches its apex when he writes a single word: "Max." That the camera zooms in for a close-up. That the resulting image, part of a longer videotape of Mr. Max and his work, is poised for playing on a bank of 18 screens in his New York studio.
Even in a world where exhibitionism is a way of life, that might smack of self-promotion. Not for Mr. Max. Call it creativity made manifest through many media many times and many ways -- art and ego in synergistic partnership.
Welcome to West 65th Street and the well-lighted studios of Peter Max. This is the 50-something artist whose work, from the "Yellow Submarine" cartoon in 1968 to the multiple Statues of Liberty of recent vintage, serves as a visual time machine spiriting the 40-something generation back to its 20-something (10-something?) roots. Two decades and more after he became a cultural icon, Mr. Max has, figuratively and literally, videotaped his 15 minutes of fame. And he's always ready for a replay.
After 17 years in seclusion, a divorce from the mother of his two children, and endless hours of meditation, Peter Max is back in motion. Since the mid-1980's, he has re-emerged in high-profile venues ranging from the Berlin wall to Moscow (where he got the inspiration for the multiple-panel portrait "40 Gorbys"). He has created stamps for the United Nations to commemorate this year's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. Two large Max murals are featured at the world's fair in Seville.
Yet, though he works at keeping his profile up, he is not the sort for whom the artists and critics who populate the "serious" art world would save a place at the table. "There are enthusiasts with a lot of money out there," said Steven Madoff, executive editor of Art News magazine. "There's a warm nostalgic feeling about Max because of his past as an illustrator. But he is not considered a serious contemporary artist."
But, hey, who needs serious, if you can still have your picture taken with Ronald Reagan, George Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev? In any case, Mr. Max's signature has always been the democracy of his images -- you can find them on coffee cups and T-shirts as well as in galleries. Wherever they occur, they evoke the era of flower children, preserving a Zeitgeist in psychedelic hues.
Asked to compare the 1969 model Max with the new, post-seclusion model, he said: "Nineteen sixty-nine was a very big year for me because I felt, you know, this recognition. I was on the cover of Life. It was the year of Woodstock. It was the year of man on the moon. And these are all things that are interesting to me. I was as excited about man going to the moon as me being on the cover of Life, if you can imagine that, because I had always loved astronomy. And it was the year I decided to go on retreat. There were 17 years when I did a lot of contemplation, a lot of meditation. And I worked on my craft every day."
The result is a protean outpouring of primary colors and sinuous forms: mountains that inspire contemplation or female bodies sketched with an economy of line that still permits Maxian flourishes. Or faces, faces, faces, their colors bright, their expressions whimsical, or impassive, or inscrutable and gentle like those of the Buddhist monks who populated Mr. Max's childhood in Tibet. (His parents, a German pearl merchant and his wife, left Nazi Germany in the late 1930's when Peter was an infant and fled to Shanghai. Mr. Max said his 10th and 11th birthdays were passed in Tibet. In 1953, after a sojourn in Israel, the family moved to New York.)
It is unabashed devotion to his swami, or spiritual leader -- he takes time to spell out the name, with pauses, "Swami S-A-T, C-H-I, D-A, N-A-N-D-A" -- that helps make him eerily un-self-conscious, a sort of Maxchild in the Promised Land. Ask him how the Peter Max of today is different from the Peter Max of the 60's, and the response is all about the swami.
He met the swami because an acquaintance put him in touch with a French director who had been "making a film about the meaning of life," Mr. Max said. "This was my biggest question in the 60's: What is the meaning of life? Why am I here? I just couldn't shove these questions aside." The swami was staying with the film crew in Paris, and Mr. Max found some of what he was looking for in the swami's teachings and the discipline of meditation.
This new approach to life led him to collect places to retreat to: from St. John in the Caribbean to upstate New York to, most recently, the hills and meadows of rural Virginia, west of Charlottesville, where he bought 190 acres in 1991. He has said he hopes to build a new studio there. It is close by "Yogaville," the swami's western Virginia retreat, which is a magnet for many young potters and craftsmen.
It is also a far distance from most of the ills that crowd New York's streets, like poverty, homelessness and AIDS. For him, that is just as well.
"Problems have nothing to do with creativity," he said. "Creativity is something that comes from within. It's a creation. A flower grows without any notice of problems in the outside world. Creativity is a flower. It's hidden inside. If you do think about problems in the outside world, as soon as the work comes out it is tainted with these problems. It is not pure creativity.
"Now, as a person I am very sensitive to AIDS, homlessness, animal rights, the Tibetan situation, the rain forests, the rivers, the oceans, indigenous people -- all those things that are boggling the minds of true thinking people in the world today. These are the things that I am aware of." He would like to help change things, he said, and believes that he is doing so. "But as an artist I have to stay pure, you know. I don't paint animals. I don't paint indigenous peoples."
What he does do, undeniably, is create. It seems he never met a medium he didn't like.
His publicist says his works are offered for prices ranging from $1,000 for a lithograph to $1 million for a large canvas now in progress. New York dealers, who find their pool of buyers depleted these days, raise their eyebrows at such figures. But Max works are not auctioned at major houses like Christie's or Sotheby's, which would keep a record of sales prices, so there is no independent way to determine what price they command.
Still, there is no denying the mass appeal of his art. A Japanese businessman signed a $3 million licensing deal with him to open a chain of "Neo Pop" stores in Japan, although a spokesman for Mr. Max said that since the economic downturn in both countries, this project has lain fallow.
It's also hard to deny that his name has cachet. A few years back, President Reagan asked him to do his "Liberty" riff on the White House lawn.
"What I love a lot about art is I've set myself up where I have the variety," he said. "I like every medium. I have seen people make sand castles and I went right in there with my hands and did my own.
"This is a very large confusion about people thinking I'm a commercial artist," he added with a frown. "When you look around here you see me as a total painter."
What comes first, he said, is the image, the creativity. If it fits the postage stamp, the coffee cup, the cause, the sound bite, that's fine, too. "But I don't go around with a sign explaining myself. So there is this false idea about me, about being commercial."
"I love the media," he said. "Media is a billboard, a T-shirt, posters, postcards, a baseball jacket with something on it. That's modern media. If Picasso were alive today, he'd probably work in video. Why couldn't Gaugin want to have one of his images on a baseball jacket?"
Creativity, he said, is what really matters. "Love" is his verb of choice when he discusses it. "I love a thick load of brushes and I like a lot of color on the brush and I love the movement, the fact I am six to eight inches away from my canvas. The first stroke as it lays itself on the canvas -- that is what I love the most. The second most is looking in a mirror and seeing my art far away." In case you missed it, Peter Max is back. Film at 5. And 6. And 7. And . . .

THE NATURE OF DEVELOPMENT
A Report From the Rural Tropics
on the Quest for Sustainable Economic Growth.
By Roger D. Stone.
Illustrated. 286 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $23. 
 IN his 1949 inaugural address, President Harry S. Truman outlined his Point Four Program, which he called a means of "making the benefits of our scientific advances and industrial progress available for the improvement" of the world's poorer countries. He thus set the stage for an emphasis on Western-style growth as the single most desirable and attainable goal of international aid. Driven by this notion and pursuing an unabashedly top-down strategy, the United States Government and American-backed agencies like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund bankrolled huge dam and canal complexes, roads into jungles, and massive electrification and population resettlement programs from the Nile to the Amazon basin to the Himalayas.
Well into the 1970's, planners were preoccupied with the quest for "takeoff," that elusive, semi-mystical moment when a less developed economy's latent potential suddenly turns into actual growth. As a result, they paid scant heed to the social and environmental dislocations that almost invariably accompanied large-scale public projects.
Over the last two decades, however, experts have begun contemplating how to stimulate the economies of the impoverished nations of the Southern Hemisphere (meaning, by one common definition, those where annual per capita incomes are $370 or less) while simultaneously preserving as much as possible the indigenous cultures, wildlife and landscapes. This shift, as yet perhaps more conceptual than real, has been brought about in part by the efforts of environmentalists along with third world bureaucrats and native peoples who have become increasingly skilled at ecological research and resource management and ever more adept at communicating their needs and opinions.
Roger D. Stone, a 25-year veteran of the international conservation movement and now an environmental consultant to the Council on Foreign Relations and a senior fellow at the World Wildlife Fund, has logged thousands of miles flying, driving, boating and hiking in the third world. Visits to rural outposts between 1988 and 1990 form the basis of "The Nature of Development," which might be called an eco-travelogue. Convinced that economy and ecology must proceed hand in hand, Mr. Stone believes that a sound tactic for solving the problems of the world's poor lies in bottom-up planning, in which farmers and town dwellers participate with on-site specialists in shaping their futures. Describing projects in Central and South America, Asia and Africa, the author explores the particular successes and failures of human-scale attempts to foster ecologically renewable and economically viable development.
Mr. Stone knows the "excruciating difficulty of accomplishing anything in rural work." He sets high standards for success; yet, touring remote portions of the tropics, he does see some signs of it. On the slopes of Kilum Mountain in northwest Cameroon, two British naturalists enlist Oku tribespeople and other villagers to mark boundaries of a 17,000-acre forest that is home to birds like the red-crested Bannerman's touraco, stands of podocarpus trees and other rare species. The pair also sets up an experimental tree nursery, introduces cool weather crops like kale and broccoli and conducts educational workshops on an assortment of topics. In upland Irian Jaya, an Indonesian province abutting Papua New Guinea, fieldworkers help organize groups of the Hatam and Arfak peoples to combat deforestation and soil losses, to diversify agriculture and to protect forests.
The author offers similar stories from Ecuador, Costa Rica, the Caribbean island of St. Lucia, Zambia and Thailand. In each case, representatives of nongovernmental aid agencies, educated nationals or inspired freelancers have joined with locals to implement sound development. At the same time, they have founded or streamlined small business ventures like beekeeping, butterfly ranching or seaweed farming in attempts to provide needed capital and also to husband valued resources.
Mr. Stone's narrative proceeds in somewhat jerky fashion, interrupted by fairly standard if deft accounts of the rise of the conservation movement and the history of development. But his survey is on the whole fascinating and full of surprises, as when he tells of the Brazilian iron mine "where scarlet macaws fly freely over the open ore pits, where brilliantly blue Morpho butterflies flash and flutter" in the virgin forest preserved on company land.
Contending that steps toward healthy development bring into play a "cluster of ideological forces," among them democratic principles and market economics, the author argues for shifts in funding policies that would encourage more small-scale projects, and for more debt-for-nature swaps and similar measures. Making villagers partners in their own betterment and focusing on the demands of what Edward Seaga, the former Prime Minister of Jamaica, once called the "kitchen economy" are vital, the author says, if the South is to move from "despair to stability."

HEADLINE: Tennis Group's Move Cheers Realtors

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: HARRISON

 BODY:
THE United States Tennis Association's purchase last month of a four-story office building off Westchester Avenue here is good news for the county's commercial real estate market, which has been hit hard by difficult economic times. It is part of a trend that has begun to counter the moves of some corporations out of Westchester and the restructuring of others, officials and real-estate agents said.
"In this economic climate, with all the downsizing of corporations, we have been experiencing a high vacancy rate," said Margaret S. Soter, the county's director of Commerce and Economic Development. "But we also have been seeing a trend of mid-size companies moving in." 
 The nonprofit tennis association, which sponsors the United States Open Tennis Championships, will move its headquarters to the 110,000-square-foot building on West Red Oak Lane in January.
The vacancy rate in corporate parks along that stretch of Westchester Avenue, nicknamed the Platinum Mile because 5 of the county's 10 Fortune 500 corporations have offices along it, was 21.9 percent for the first half of this year, said William V. Cuddy, vice president of Rostenberg-Doern Company, a corporate real-estate company.
The tennis association's move, along with the relocation of small and mid-size companies to Westchester, "takes up the slack" left behind by larger corporations, Mr. Cuddy said. Conrans Habitat, a retail chain, has moved its headquarters to White Plains, and National-Gottesman, a paper products company, has moved to Purchase.
 
100 Employees to Move
 About 100 employees from the tennis association's current headquarters on Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan and its offices in Jericho, L.I., and Princeton, N.J., are to move to the new site.
The organization's National Tennis Center, where the yearly tennis championships are held, will remain in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens. Two years ago the organization was looking to move both its headquarters and the tennis center to Westchester, but that did not materialize, Mrs. Soter said.
Although the association, which is the national governing body for tennis in the United States, decided to expand the 17.3-acre Queens tennis center site, it still needed to consolidate its regional offices, said Joyce Baumgarten, a spokeswoman. It considered leasing larger quarters in New York City, but the building here, along with 5.5 acres, was "too good an opportunity to pass up," she said.
The organization paid $3.3 million for the land and building, said Gregory J. Colosi, the broker representing the building's owner. Mr. Colosi, who is a senior vice president for Friedland Realty in Yonkers, said that four years ago the site was on the market for $20 million.
"In this kind of a real estate market, it is an excellent buy," he said. "They couldn't get comparable value in New York City."
The building, constructed in 1974, was first occupied by General Foods and then by Nynex. But in recent years it had been vacant and went into foreclosure. The Travelers, a Hartford insurance company that financed the original mortgage, took back ownership from a real-estate company this year.
Mr. Colosi said he showed officials from the tennis association other sites in Queens, White Plains and Scarsdale, but the campuslike setting off Westchester Avenue, he said, was most suited to their needs. The association, which plans to occupy two or three floors and lease the rest, may also build tennis courts on the property.
 
Private, but at the Hub
 The site is next to the Stouffer Westchester Hotel, which will serve as a conference center for the association, Mr. Colosi said. It is an eight-minute drive to Westchester Airport and five minutes from downtown White Plains.
"Of all the sites, this one suited their needs perfectly," Mr. Colosi said. "It has a bus stop in front of the building. It is a little remote, so it has some privacy, and it is still at the hub of county."
The building has generated $202,000 a year in state, county and municipal taxes, but as a nonprofit organization the tennis association could file for tax-exempt status. For Harrison, that could mean a loss of $50,000 a year, said James J. Calandruccio, the Town Assessor. The Postal Service recently moved to a building on Westchester Avenue and claimed tax-exempt status, costing the town $440,000 a year.
The 325,000-member tennis association, established in 1881 and governed by a volunteer board of directors, promotes recreational tennis, initiates and maintains rules of play and also promotes amateur and professional tournaments.
In addition to its national headquarters, it has 17 other offices in the United States. The tennis center, where the United States Open is held in the last week of August and the first week of September, has three stadiums and 28 outdoor and nine indoor public tennis courts. It is run by the association for the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. The proposed expansion of the center is expected to cost the association $180 million.

HEADLINE: Unemployment Rises in County, Despite Signs Of a Recovery

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
UNEMPLOYMENT continues to climb in Westchester despite some signs of an economic rebound, and labor market analysts are trying to determine why. Perhaps, the economists say, larger forces are at work in the county, causing the employment picture to remain bleak.
"The recession has let go, but when a recovery doesn't behave like an average recovery, there may be something else going on," said Thomas J. Spitznas, an economist in Mount Vernon. "It may mean this is a different ball game from what we are used to." 
 At first glance, indicators suggested that the local economy, while not leaping ahead, might at long last be inching forward. For example, the State Labor Department reported that the number of jobs in the county increased in June by 1.1 percent from May. And average weekly earnings for manufacturing jobs, along with the number of hours worked, were up somewhat from a year before.
But 29,700 people in Westchester were out of work in June, propelling the jobless rate to 6.4 percent, the highest June figure since 1983. The May rate was 5.8 percent; in June 1991, it was 5.4 percent.
But the county's June unemployment figures, which were released 10 days ago, were not as high as New York City's rate of 11.5 percent, or 8.9 percent for the entire state. Even though there were 4,300 more nonagricultural jobs in Westchester in June than in May, most of those jobs reflected seasonal trends and therefore could not be counted on as long-lasting influences, the economists said. They were jobs at golf courses, beaches and other recreational sites and in restaurants and stores that cater to tourists.
During healthy economic times, job growth from month to month averages 6,000 to 8,000, making June 1992 "not the worst of times, but also not the best," said Frank M. Surdey, a regional economist with the State Labor Department. But growth in June was better than it was a year before, he said, when the job base expanded by only 3,900 over May.
Despite the fact that the number of jobs increased in the county, the number of job seekers outstripped the number of available openings, causing the unemployment rate to surge. The market was not able to accommodate a labor force that swelled with college graduates and students looking for work, Mr. Surdey said.
An even more worrisome labor picture emerged when analysts stripped away the seasonal influences, which must be done to understand the full significance of the unemployment figures, they said. Mr. Spitznas, who owns T. J. Spitznas and Associates, an economic consulting concern, estimated that when seasonal adjustments were factored in for June, the county actually lost 2,300 private, nonagricultural jobs, because fewer new jobs came in than would be expected for this time of year.
June's unemployment rate "is as bad as it looks, and worse than it looks," Mr. Spitznas said. When the jobless rates were seasonally adjusted, May's was revised downward to 5.5 percent, and June's remained at 6.4 percent. With those calculations, the increase from May to June becomes almost a full percentage point.
"All of this throws out a caution signal," Mr. Spitznas said. "And what we thought were signs of life in the economy, are not. The employment picture has me worried."
As Mr. Surdey described it, "No matter how you slice it, June was a downer."
Projecting ahead to the July and August figures, the employment picture is likely to be even bleaker, the analysts said, when jobless rates reflect workers laid off in North Tarrytown from the General Motors night shift, and the closings of Alexander's department store in Yonkers and Macy's in New Rochelle. Although Alexander's closed earlier this year, severance packages delayed workers' filing for benefits.
 
Longer Workweek in June
 "These are gray clouds hanging over Westchester," Mr. Surdey said.
In looking at the indicators, analysts were pleased to see that the average work week lengthened in June, and they said that on the surface those figures suggested that the economy was pulling out of the recession.
In June, for example, the workweek for manufacturing averaged 39.6 hours, about 30 minutes longer than a year before. But while the figures indicated that demand for products was up, many companies were relying on overtime and part-time help -- and were not rehiring full-timers -- to meet increased demand for goods, the analysts said.
Noreen L. Preston, a specialist with the County Commerce and Economic Development Department, said many companies were loath to create new jobs because they were still catching up with debts accumulated during the recession.
Also, she said, the employers have not wanted to take on the added costs of benefits packages for full-time workers. And because companies do not feel they can raise prices on their products now, they have to effect savings elsewhere to maintain profits.
"Companies are very much copycats," Ms. Preston said. "They are taking their cues from the big guys, the corporations. They are going to squeeze what they can out of what they have to work with, because they're not going to get it elsewhere."
The analysts explained that the way companies were dealing with the increased demand for products suggested a deeper trend in the economy and provided some clues to why this recovery was not following a typical pattern.
As companies continue to restructure and become "lean and mean," there is little hope that they will restore some of the jobs they shed during the recession years. Not just because of the recession, but also as a result of global competition, many companies will continue to cut costs by paring their work forces, the analysts said.
Mr. Spitznas termed the situation a standoff. "It is between a business cycle that, on the one hand, is slowly improving and structural changes taking place in companies that partly offset the improvements."
"It's a story of crosscurrents" that are acute in Westchester, where many corporations are still restructuring, he said.
The restructuring, Mr. Spitznas said, will likely lead to permanent job losses, specifically for middle-management workers. Any new job generation in the near future will be different from the past and will come mainly from small- and medium-sized business that provide services to the larger corporations.
Middle-management workers therefore may be in what Mr. Spitznas called "situations of permanent unemployment." They will have to develop skills for other types of jobs or try to become entrepreneurs, he said.
While the economists agreed that some national and local indicators were promising, they said that until the jobless rate moved downward in the county, they would not take encouragement from reports that a recovery had arrived.
"New York City has to provide more jobs for Westchester residents, and the national economy has to pick up more steam," Mr. Spitznas said. "Those factors will filter down to people here."
When might a recovery take hold? The analysts were not optimistic.
"I had thought for sure we would see an upturn by the end of the year," Mr. Spitznas said, "but I'm not going to hold my breath."

THE GREAT DEEP
The Sea and Its Thresholds.
By James Hamilton-Paterson.
Illustrated. 300 pp. New York:
Random House. $23. 
 JAMES HAMILTON-PATERSON'S new book is about the mysterious element covering seven-tenths of the world's surface, and he starts by plunging, literally, straight in. A fisherman some distance from land jumps from his outrigger canoe. But the cord attaching his ankle to the prow snaps and the canoe vanishes -- blown away by wind or tide, possibly sunk, but certainly no longer available to carry him safely home.
"I am lost." These are the first words of "The Great Deep," and throughout we return to this abandoned, increasingly desperate figure for reports on his status. In the end the canoe reappears, the fisherman clambers aboard and returns -- with six mackerel -- to the refuge of his island shack. By now it has dawned on us that our lucky castaway is Mr. Hamilton-Paterson himself. What we do not learn is whether he got the idea for his book during those lost, scary hours in the water. It seems likely. He certainly did a lot of hard thinking out there, and his reflections on every conceivable aspect of the oceans serve to underpin this intricate and scholarly survey.
"The Great Deep" is a collection of linked essays covering topics as diverse as reefs, islands, charts, wrecks, fishing, pirates and monsters.
In the Philippines Mr. Hamilton-Paterson learns of a scheme to rebuild damaged reefs with used automobile tires -- an inspired purpose found for some of the world's most useless objects. There, too, he revisits the tiny, obscure, unpopulated, unwatered, beachless offshore island celebrated in his previous book, "Playing With Water," and finds Japanese developers turning it into the Fantasy Elephant Club. Equipped with a transplanted beach, piped water, restaurants, sushi bars, sports facilities and a casino, the establishment will cost its Japanese-only clientele $320 a day for accommodation only; it will cost extra to "be massaged by geishas, recline on vinyl couches to watch porno videos, gamble and sip Chivas Regal." Thus does Japan adroitly extend its restricted territorial boundaries.
Mr. Hamilton-Paterson hitches a lift aboard a United States Geological Survey vessel mapping the seabed contained by the 200-mile American Exclusive Economic Zone and records, north of Hawaii, an underwater range known as the Musicians Seamounts. These substantial peaks include a Strauss and a Mendelssohn, ridges named for Bach and Beethoven, a Mount Mozart that is higher than Fuji.
WE learn about piracy ancient and modern, the latter practiced by Filipino thugs, armed with M-16 rifles, who steal boats, engines, money, cargoes, lives and hostages. (The M-16's, Mr. Hamilton-Paterson reports, are not hard to come by: you enlist in the army, and the moment you've got your gun, you desert.) As for the traditional buccaneers, the legendary Spanish Main brawlers like Blackbeard and William Dampier, Mr. Hamilton-Paterson cites a scholar who offers evidence to suggest they were -- shiver me timbers -- probably gay.
The book's overriding theme is the spoiling of the seas. In Fraserburgh, Scotland, the author boards the Garefowl, a small trawler heading out into the overfished North Sea, and notes the anger and despair in his companions' voices.
The seabed is littered with discarded junk from the oil rigs (one night the nets brought up a life-size sex doll), and catches are diminished by bureaucratic rulings that also diminish the fish stocks. European legislators seem unaware that the smaller fish they decree must be thrown back do not survive the trauma of the net. "The violence of their capture and the hauling up through 60 fathoms has ruptured capillaries, made flotation sacs bulge out of mouths," Mr. Hamilton-Paterson writes. "Those fish with patches of scales torn off will anyway become prey to disease, to worms and saprophytes." Meanwhile, the boats of too many nations anxiously pursue an ever-decreasing harvest.
The situation in the north Pacific is equally grim. Mr. Hamilton-Paterson states that, for six months of the year, 1,500 Japanese, Taiwanese and South Korean ships lay up to 50 miles of drift net each -- a nightly total of up to 50,000 miles, enough to circle the planet twice. Marketable fish are kept, the rest dumped overboard by the ton. Countless sea birds become entangled in the nets and perish. This technique (known as "strip-mining the oceans") will, the Japanese promise, be discontinued next year. But a billion-dollar industry does not just fade away. What will take its place? Who will set the quotas and how will they be enforced?
Mr. Hamilton-Paterson is at his brilliant best when addressing matters like these. Though he always displays erudition and a rippling, sinewy intelligence, some of his other chapters have a deskbound feel. These cover, discursively, all manner of arcane historical and philosophical maritime-related subjects, often in supertanker-length paragraphs that will require the reader's close attention. Out of sight of land, though, the book provides an urgent reminder that the old sailor's hymn needs updating. It is not for those in peril on the sea we should be worrying. The sea itself is now in peril, and "The Great Deep" should be required reading for the decision makers of every maritime nation.

IMPOSTORS IN THE TEMPLE
By Martin Anderson.
255 pp. New York:
Simon & Schuster.
$22. 
 THE growth of conservative foundations, think tanks and publications outside the academic world over the last two decades has changed the battleground of ideas in unexpected ways. Today conservatives are better represented among intellectuals outside the academy than in it, and the old right-wing distrust of independent intellectuals as free-floating cosmopolitans of uncertain piety and doubtful patriotism has given way to a more sharply focused attack on the liberal professoriate.
"Impostors in the Temple" is both an example and an exploration of the cleavage in the intellectual world. The author, Martin Anderson, is an economist, a former adviser to Republican Presidents and a fellow of one of the leading conservative research institutes, the privately endowed Hoover Institution in Stanford, Calif. Mr. Anderson describes it as the West Berlin of the academic world -- no doubt because it is a bastion of free-market thought in the middle of the Stanford campus (whose resemblance to East Germany will presumably have struck even the most casual visitor). Following Dinesh D'Souza's "Illiberal Education" and Roger Kimball's "Tenured Radicals," "Impostors in the Temple" shows how broad an assault conservatives are now prepared to make on the academy.
Mr. Anderson divides intellectuals into two classes. He esteems the first group: professional intellectuals to be found in research institutes, the news media and elsewhere. While opinionated, they have to survive by their wits in the marketplace and are therefore hard-working and honest. Almost everything wrong with intellectual life comes from the second, suspect group: academic intellectuals who luxuriate in the lap of quasi-socialist institutions, with job security, high pay, elaborate perks and a system of peer review that protects them from outside scrutiny and the wrath that would undoubtedly descend upon them if the public ever understood their scam.
THE tone of much of Mr. Anderson's criticism is reminiscent of Representative Newt Gingrich's attacks on Congressional pay and privileges. Indeed, Mr. Anderson seems to want to do for the universities what Mr. Gingrich and his confreres have done for the Congress: bring the institution into such disrepute that conservatives, long stuck in minority status, will have a chance at gaining power. It is an old strategy: apres le deluge, nous.
So Mr. Anderson throws everything into his indictment that could conceivably be held against higher education today -- incidents of sexual harassment; abuses of athletic programs; inadequacies in undergraduate teaching; cases of scientific fraud; even boring articles in academic journals -- all of which would vanish, we can be certain, if universities had a properly conservative regime. To Mr. Anderson, the many sins of the academy are evidence not merely of human fallibility but of a deep corruption and the need for a thoroughgoing reformation, including the abolition of tenure, a ban on teaching by graduate students and the appointment of conservative intellectuals like the former Secretary of Education, William Bennett, to the boards of trustees at the elite universities.
Mr. Anderson is right that a lot of the vitality in the intellectual world today is to be found on the non academic side. Conservatives no doubt benefited when they set up independent research institutes and avoided the usual scholarly pretenses and constraints, not to mention teaching obligations, that inhibit many liberal academics from full-fledged ideological combat. But it is a curious thought that conservatives comfortably ensconced in well-endowed, nonprofit institutes are more disciplined by the marketplace and therefore more virtuous than are liberal professors comfortably ensconced in well-endowed, nonprofit universities. If virtue were so predictably aligned with the market, both would be in trouble -- and Vice President Dan Quayle would have nothing to worry about from television sitcoms that have, after all, met one of the market's most exacting tests.
To be sure, Mr. Anderson's complaints about dull and irrelevant academic work have much merit; he is especially harsh on his colleagues in economics, of whom, I should confess, I am quite prepared to believe the worst. Mr. Anderson recalls, for example, that while in the Reagan White House he never heard anyone refer to an article published in an academic economics journal -- and I could not decide whether to enjoy this as a reflection on the Reagan Administration or on the economics profession. Outside of economics, Mr. Anderson does not give evidence of any direct familiarity with the world of scholarship. But, brave man that he is, he is not prevented by a lack of acquaintance with other academic disciplines from condemning them in the most sweeping terms as given equally to arid irrelevance and intellectual dishonesty.
Still, it is an odd echo of the 1960's to hear a conservative demanding greater relevance from academics. After all, relevance is in the eye of the beholder, and Mr. Anderson might not like work that is relevant to achieving goals he disapproves of. Indeed, he would call such work impermissibly politicized. But if relevance is your test, you have given up any battle against a politicized academy.
Mr. Anderson considers it a devastating commentary on scholarly work that a great many academic articles -- in some fields the majority -- are never cited after publication. That is like condemning capitalism because the majority of new businesses fail. The test of intellectual work is not whether the average journal article is a success, but whether the leading achievements -- admittedly rare -- enrich and advance our understanding. And for that process to work, a wide-open publication system is the equivalent of a market with low barriers to entry.
The nation's system of colleges and universities is, in fact, highly competitive and decentralized, and that is the nub of a problem for conservatives. Martin Anderson's reformation would have to be carried out one university at a time, and any institution that dropped tenure and threatened to impose the regime he advocates would face devastating losses among its most eminent faculty. Proposing to increase teaching loads, he suggests, therefore, that "universities and colleges could get together and decide to implement such a policy collectively, so that none would be at a competitive disadvantage." No doubt advising collusion was a hard decision for a free-market economist, but I suppose it shows that at heart he is a pragmatist, willing to recognize that there are limits to the free market after all.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Platform;
BUSH GETS A NUDGE ON HIS TAX POLICY

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 9

 BODY:
Asserting that their party needs a dramatically bolder economic policy to win in November, seven leading Republican conservatives are urging President Bush's campaign to adopt a growth-oriented platform that would include sharp cuts in taxes and limits on growth of entitlement spending.
"People are willing to forgive past mistakes, but they won't forgive a lack of vision for the future," the seven conservatives said. Their memorandum was sent Friday to the President and senior campaign strategists as party officials gathered in Houston to craft the platform for next week's Republican convention. 
 "Should the President just resort to old Republican exhortations about the balanced budget amendment or the line-item veto, the American people will quickly lose interest," the group declared. "They are tired of the old cliches."
 
The Seven Signers
 The memorandum, first reported today by The Washington Post, was signed by Jack F. Kemp, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, by Representatives Vin Weber of Minnesota and Newt Gingrich of Georgia and by Senators Connie Mack of Florida, Trent Lott of Mississippi, Bob Kasten of Wisconsin and Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming.
In response, Charles R. Black, senior adviser to the Bush campaign, played down the memorandum this evening. "It's not unusual for that group to send a memo to the President with a lot of economic ideas," he said.
Mr. Black added that most of the ideas were consistent with those of both Mr. Bush and Ronald Reagan. He called them "goals everybody shares." Mr. Black said that the magnitude of budget deficits had so far prevented the President from proposing cuts in individual taxes.
Separately, Bush campaign headquarters said today that the Clinton economic program involved "massive hidden taxes" that would destroy jobs, particularly among small businesses.
 
Acceptance Is Predicted
 Mr. Gingrich, the Republican whip, said today in an interview on the Cable News Network that the odds were "very high" that the President would embrace the conservatives' program in his acceptance speech.
The memorandum's signers, who seek to roughly triple recent economic growth rates of 1 percent to 2 percent, call for "a flatter, lower, simpler tax system" in which the present 15 percent income tax bracket would be reduced to a 12 percent bracket and the tax on capital gains eliminated for long-term investments and indexed to inflation by executive order.
"The President has a wonderful opportunity to draw a very dramatic contrast with the redistribution, tax increase, welfare state policies of Bill Clinton, and where we would go if we had control of the House and Senate," Mr. Gingrich said in his television appearance.

HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS;
What Price Bosnia?
Atrocity Reports Make West Consider How Far It Should Go to End Violence

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 9

 BODY:
So far, not a single Western leader has determined what price should be paid, in Western lives and money, to halt the barbarity in what used to be Yugoslavia.
Until now, the unspoken assumption in the West was that as long as Serbs, Croats and Muslims were determined to fight one another, there was little the outside world could do to stop them. 
 But under the impression of powerful reports of atrocities that echo those perpetrated two generations ago by the Nazis, that assumption is beginning to crumble, and the West is asking crucial questions about how far it is willing to go to stop the slaughter.
This weekend, diplomats in London, Paris, and New York were contemplating the first circumscribed steps to be outlined in a Security Council resolution authorizing United Nations forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina to use or call in force to keep food and medicine flowing to the civilian victims.
If such a resolution is adopted, its logic could lead to the commitment of tens or hundreds of thousands of soldiers, according to military experts who estimate that is how many troops would be needed to end depredations that have horrified the world.
 
Is the Threat Empty?
 Whether the mere threat of willingness to go so far could stop the aggressors remains to be seen. Until now, they have clearly not been deterred by empty Western threats, and the West has been reluctant to pay the price of committing those troops.
But Western willingness to become involved could increase if events keep running out of control.
The British, among the most reluctant to send in troops, have called an international conference on the former Yugoslavia in London for Aug. 26 to 28 to try to deal with the causes of the violence, and try to keep it from spreading to Kosovo and Macedonia or dragging in Greece, Turkey or Albania.
"I hope that there will be a Security Council resolution in the next few days which will put the emphasis on the escorting, the protection, of humanitarian help," the British Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, said today on B.B.C. radio. "We are talking about the protection of humanitarian help, but it may well involve the use of force."
But President Bush, Prime Minister John Major of Britain and President Francois Mitterrand of France all remain unwilling to send in troops to stop the aggression, which they attribute mainly, but not exclusively, to Serbian nationalist forces.
 
Gulf War Is Cited
 Two years ago, when Iraq invaded Kuwait, there was little reluctance on the part of any of the three countries to consider sending huge numbers of troops, weapons and supplies to the Persian Gulf to expel President Saddam Hussein's forces.
Why, critics like the former Prime Minister of Britain, Margaret Thatcher, have asked, is there such reluctance to consider using military force to aid innocent civilians in Bosnia?
The first reason, as Mr. Hurd said today, is the tangled ethnic weave of the Balkans. "The main fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina is now being done by the people who live there," he said. "The Serbs are mainly responsible, and they are being helped and egged on by help from Belgrade -- that is undoubtedly true. But you cannot actually separate them out in the same way that you could separate the Iraqis from Kuwait or the Argentines from the Falklands."
 
10,000 Troops for Land Corridor
 But even the limited authorization of the use of force by the United Nations troops to protect relief shipments could bring on many complications, according to some military experts.
Gen. Sir Anthony Farrar-Hockley, a former NATO commander, argued in The Sunday Times today that if force were to be used to try to open a land corridor to move food and medicine from the Adriatic port of Split for 100 miles through the mountains to Sarajevo and beyond, it would take three brigades -- around 10,000 soldiers -- and strong helicopter support.
Another former military officer, Maj. Gen. Julian Thompson, wrote in The Observer: "Air cover for humanitarian convoys seems an attractive option. But anyone wishing to disrupt the supply system need only set an ambush in a village full of civilians to pose an agonizing choice for those controlling air retaliation."
And, he pointed out, in the guerrilla warfare for which the Serbian army and the irregular militia forces have been trained for years, "a handful can hold up a host."
Lady Thatcher and others have argued that the use of air power to carry out precise strikes against the mortars and tanks that have pounded Sarajevo would be an effective way of reducing the violence, but skeptical experts say that is illusory, too.
 
Danger of Civilian Casualties
 General Thompson wrote: "Locating even the largest guns and tanks can be difficult in heavily wooded, hilly country, or among buildings. Once found, the target must be struck quickly before it moves, and with precision to avoid 'collateral damage,' a euphemism for destroying adjacent buildings or killing and injuring innocent civilians."
The same risk of inadvertent civilian casualties would be run by an air bombardment campaign against Serbian munitions stores or arms factories on Serbian territory, another option that has been advanced by critics of Western inaction. The Western and Arab allies ran such risks to liberate Kuwait, a major oil producer, because on balance they judged the result, a deterrence of Iraqi aggression, to be worth the risks and the other costs.
The United States was in overall charge during that war, though it was paid for mainly by the Germans and the Japanese, who were not combatants. A year and a half later, the United States and Britain are both sapped by economic recession, the Germans have run out of money, and the Japanese feel a long way, culturally and physically, from Sarajevo.
 
Proposal for Refugee Havens
 At the London peace conference later this month, Mr. Major reportedly plans to propose safe havens for refugees in the Balkans as the first stage toward a cantonization of Bosnia into three separate ethnic regions.
But Edward Cowan, a former British military attache to Yugoslavia, argued in The Sunday Times today that merely securing the perimeter around Sarajevo could take 10 battalions, or 30,000 soldiers. It could take 100,000, he said, to make the entire Muslim-occupied region safe from attack.
These are among the reasons not to go in. The reasons to go in anyway include, as Lady Thatcher wrote in The New York Times last week, "refugees, terrorism, Balkan wars drawing in other countries and worse."
And Mr. Hurd said, "I think it would be morally justified if a way of using force could be devised which would actually bring the suffering to an end, and that of course is the difficulty."

HEADLINE: Cruise Lines Shrug Off Mishap

 BODY:
The accident involving the Queen Elizabeth 2 is not likely to hurt the finances of the ship's owner, the Cunard Line, or the health of the cruise industry, analysts and company executives say.
Cunard, a subsidiary of Trafalgar House P.L.C. of London, was insured to cover all lost revenue, except for a $100,000 deductible, while the company's flagship is out of service. And Joseph Smyth, executive vice president of operations for the cruise line, said yesterday that no one had called the company to cancel their travel plans on the ship, which represents 1,800 of the company's total 5,000 berths on seven ships. 
 Analysts also said yesterday that they doubted the incident would prompt fears among vacationers. They noted that most cruises followed well-traveled routes in the Caribbean and the Bahamas, as well as Alaska. The QE2 incident occurred off the south coast of Massachusetts on a route that the ship takes only twice a year.
"The likelihood of accidents happening is very small," said Michael G. Mueller, an analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. "I don't view it as significant at all for the cruise industry."
Cruise lines have been the bright spot in the travel business in recent years, much more profitable than the airline and hotel industries.
Despite the recession, cruise companies have added capacity to their fleets in recent years, and still managed to attain an occupancy rate of about 90 percent for their 90,000 berths last year. Repeat business rates range from roughly 25 percent to over 50 percent on luxury liners like the QE2.
At the same time, the cruise companies have grown more profitable by introducing larger ships that let them spread costs over more customers.

HEADLINE: 2 'Baby Bells' Reach Agreements With Unions

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
Southwestern Bell and Bell South, providers of local telephone service for more than 30 million customers, reached agreement with its unions early yesterday morning, as three other large carriers continued to negotiate past the weekend expiration of their labor contracts.
The tentative labor accord at Southwestern Bell, based in St. Louis, gave 40,000 workers a 12.3 percent wage increase over three years. About 66 percent of Southwestern Bell's work force is union. The agreement at Bell South, based in Atlanta, gave 62,000 workers an 11.3 percent wage increase over the same period. About 64 percent of Bell South's work force is union. Union members will be voting on whether to approve the accord over the next several weeks. 
 Other details of the agreements were sketchy. But the central issues in the talks with Ameritech, Bell Atlantic and the Pacific Telesis Group as well as Southwestern Bell and Bell South talks were health care, wages and pensions.
 
Retrenchment for 'Baby Bells'
 The contract talks with the two unions representing the workers, Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, were held in a time of continuing retrenchment for the former Bell system. As a monopoly provider, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company could turn a blind eye to inefficiencies in one area of the country as long as other areas were more efficient.
With the boom in demand for telecommunications services in the early 1970's, A.T.& T. hired thousands of workers straight out of college or high school.
But since A.T.& T. was split up in 1984, both A.T.& T., now a long-distance carrier and equipment manufacturer, and the regional "Baby Bells" have had to lay off tens of thousands of workers in efforts to cut costs.
The issue in this year's contract talks was not whether workers would lose their jobs but what could be done to ease the pain of laid-off workers in terms of severance and retraining, and increase the productivity, if not the wages, of the workers who stayed.
 
Strikes Not Expected
 Both union and management said strikes were unlikely, not only because the persistent recession made workers wary of walkouts but because modern telecommunications equipment requires fewer workers. Phone company management could, for the most part, step in for striking workers in ways that would be impossible at a steel or automobile plant.
Still negotiating yesterday were Ameritech, based in Chicago; Bell Atlantic, in Philadelphia; and Pacific Telesis, in San Francisco, serving a total of nearly 49 million customers. Union contracts at these carriers, like those of Southwestern Bell and Bell South, expired at midnight Saturday.
The contracts of US West, based in Englewood, Colo., expire next Saturday.
The Nynex Corporation reached agreement with its unions last year. And some contracts for subsidiaries of the GTE Corporation, which was not part of the old Bell system and is the nation's largest local carrier, expired in May, June and July, but contract talks continue. Most of GTE's contracts, including that of California, the largest GTE subsidiary, expire later this year.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
Bush Stirs Fears to Run Against
Trying to Convince Voters That Clinton Would Be a Gamble

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KENNEBUNKPORT, Me., Aug. 9

 BODY:
As President Bush struggles to revive his campaign, he is returning to an approach that worked for him in 1988: portraying himself as the less scary of the two Presidential candidates.
At campaign appearances in recent days, Mr. Bush used the same rhetorical techniques he employed against Michael S. Dukakis four years ago, describing threats that he would stand up against and implying, without actually saying so, that his opponent's election would make the threat a reality. 
 It is all part of the announced White House strategy of raising "the fear factor" by pointing out that Gov. Bill Clinton represents a gamble for the voters. Campaigning last week in New York, Georgia, Florida, Nevada and Colorado, Mr. Bush was painting a dark, monochromatic picture of what the losing side of that gamble might look like.
In 1988, he did this by saying frequently that people should vote for him because he was "on the American side," suggesting, presumably, that Governor Dukakis was not.
 
Guarding Against 'Them'
 In the same vein, Mr. Bush has recently assured his audiences that he would prevent "them" from dismantling the veterans' health system, although no one has suggested that that be done. He has said he would work to "establish freedom and democracy" around the world, a task that both Mr. Bush and his predecessor, Ronald Reagan, have repeatedly implied is beyond the abilities of the Democrats.
Much of what the President had to say last week was drowned out by his disavowal of a news release reviving accusations about marital infidelity against Mr. Clinton, by rumors about Mr. Bush's health and by the lingering disorganization of his campaign.
Polls still show Mr. Bush lagging far behind Mr. Clinton. But a few cautionary notes might be prudent.
Mr. Bush's re-election effort is showing new life as he gives more focused, ideological speeches and moves to capitalize on the power of his office by calling news conferences, as he did on Friday and again Saturday to talk about a slight dip in unemployment, the Balkan war and tensions in Iraq.
The weapons of fear are also potent ones, and Mr. Bush shows no hesitation in constructing frightening scenarios to place between Mr. Clinton and voters.
At times, Mr. Bush does that directly, as he did Thursday, when he said the Arkansas Governor would raise taxes if he became President. But he also does it through implication.
"As long as I am President, I will not allow a madman to get a finger on the nuclear trigger," Mr. Bush told a group of cheering disabled veterans in Reno last Wednesday.
On some fronts, like abortion, Mr. Clinton has made himself vulnerable. "In some places, a 13-year-old girl cannot get her ears pierced without parental permission -- without bringing her mother and father along," Mr. Bush said at a Knights of Columbus conference in New York on Wednesday. "But some believe that the same girl should be able to get an abortion without parental consent."
Certainly, Mr. Clinton is not encouraging 13-year-old girls to get abortions. But his position on abortion gave Mr. Bush ammunition for the attack: while Mr. Clinton thinks that parents should be notified before their teen-agers have abortions, he does not believe the law should require their advance consent.
Mr. Bush has raised fears about the Democrats on the Presidential ticket and in Congress that have little to do with their policies.
"If, in all this talk about change, Congress sends me legislation to dismantle the V.A. system, I will whip out my veto pen and knock down that incoming Scud missile, that Scud missile aimed right at your very well-being," Mr. Bush told the veterans.
Neither Mr. Clinton nor Congressional Democrats have suggested dismantling the veterans' health-care system.
 
Morality and Religion
 Last week, Mr. Bush was offering subliminal images of fear on another facet of his offensive: morality and religion. "Now that our moral values are victorious around the globe, we cannot and we will not abandon them at home," Mr. Bush said in a speech to the Knights of Columbus gathering. "We didn't stand together to see courageous moral values rise in Russia, only to be ignored here at home."
As in previous years, patriotism and national security are central themes for the Republicans in raising voters' concerns about the Democrats.
Mr. Bush is basing his patriotic appeal in part on the suggestion that because Mr. Clinton and the Democrats have talked about America's declining economy and shrinking exports, they are "running down America" and would allow the nation's exports to collapse.
Addressing workers at a carpet factory in Dalton, Ga., on Monday, Mr. Bush said: "They see these unbelievable opportunities, these vast markets to sell your goods, and they say, 'Well we'd better not try. And the challenge is too great. The odds are too long.' "
Mr. Bush is also using Mr. Clinton's lack of experience in military policy and foreign affairs to imply dire consequences if he became President.
Speaking at a high-technology company in Orange County, Calif., on July 30, Mr. Bush painted a picture of a Democratic administration recklessly slashing military spending. "Someone has to say, even now that we've won the cold war, America is safe, but just so long as America stays strong," Mr. Bush said. "And if we took the course that some recommend, we literally wouldn't know what we're missing until we found it out in the heat of battle."
There are risks to this approach. Mr. Bush's tough, ideological talk may bring back wayward Republicans, but the President must appeal to a broader audience to win in November. After the 1988 campaign, Mr. Bush is also vulnerable to charges of negative campaigning, and the Clinton team is doing everything it can to make Mr. Bush seem guilty of just that.
But the President has made it clear that he intends to press the attack. "After my being hounded and pounded for nine months by my principles being ill-defined and what I stand for being ill-defined, you're going to see some hard-hitting attacks which are going to fairly define his positions," Mr. Bush said Friday. "That's going to be fun."

BEHIND THE DEMISE OF TIMES SQUARE PLAN 
The villains were many in the failure to redevelop Times Square: a real-estate glut, a deep recession and, most important, a government campaign to use bulldoze-and-build policies at a time when large-scale development has become a much more intricate art. There was no lack of financial incentives in the drive to replace the cut-rate movie houses, street hustlers and sleaze. What was missing was a major tenant to commit to office space in any of the new buildings.

But they drive back to their neighborhoods, where they show off their driving skills, performing "doughnuts" on the streets and other bold stunts.

HEADLINE: Miscalculations in Times Square;
Project Shows That Renewal Needs More Than Bulldozers

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
In the end, the culprit was a real estate glut during a deep recession. But the failure of a 15-year government campaign to redevelop Times Square may rest more squarely on the government's attempt to use bulldoze-and-build urban renewal policies at a time when large-scale development has become a more intricate art.
From its inception in the late 1970's, the project proceeded on the premise that extraordinary financial incentives by city and state agencies could produce towering office buildings to replace the haphazard mix of cut-rate movie houses, street hustlers and sleaze at the south end of Times Square. 
 The developers, the Prudential Insurance Company of America and Park Tower Realty, headed by George Klein, were selected in 1981 to construct four million square feet of new offices in buildings whose height and bulk would have stood out even in midtown Manhattan.
The government incentives were rich: tax abatements from the city extending into the next century. More than that, through New York State's power to condemn property, the Times Square site was supposed to be delivered as clean canvas for development: vacant lots, devoid of cantankerous tenants, and clear of the arduous process of public review.
But by the time the project was put on indefinite hold a week ago, it had become a case study for planners and government analysts of how the urban renewal policies of the 1960's and 1970's would founder in the 1980's.
"As a planning concept, it was badly flawed from the beginning," said Peter Salins, a professor of Urban Planning at Hunter College.
 
City Undermines Itself
 What distinguished the project was what it lacked. Most importantly, no major tenant committed to office space in any of the new buildings, even during New York City's economic boom of the mid-1980's, when banks, securities firms and others were expanding rapidly.
Proponents of the project also failed to anticipate the cascade of public protest and lawsuits that would block construction for at least a decade.
Critics of the project condemned its size and bulk, and more than 40 lawsuits were filed in the early 1980's by environmental groups, property owners and others opposed to the project. By the end of the decade, when the rest of midtown Manhattan was in an office-building boom, the Times Square project was still languishing in court.
And while no one could have predicted the recession, the project's prospects for success were severely undermined by the city itself, which offered zoning incentives to office developers elsewhere in the western half of midtown Manhattan. That put the Times Square project in competition with many others, and in a battle for tenants it was bound to lose.
Now, as the boom in midtown has gone bust, office vacancies have soared and rents have declined. Real estate experts see no market for the huge office towers in Times Square, with or without government help.
"Four million square feet of new office space is simply not going to be built in the next decade by the private sector, and it makes no sense for the city to pour massive subsidies into having it built," said Marc A. Weiss, director of real-estate development research at Columbia University.
 
Successful Plans Elsewhere
 Although developers hold out the hope that the towers will eventually be built, the condemnation process has already changed Times Square. Numerous businesses, including the venerable Nathan's restaurant on the east side of 43d Street and Broadway and several movie houses on 42d Street, have been forced to close.
"This was a back-from-the-dead example of the thoroughly discredited bulldozer urban renewal of the 1960's," said Ada Louis Huxtable, a New York City architecture critic and historian, in a 1990 essay, even before the project collapsed.
The deal for Times Square redevelopment was struck after two decades that had made urban renewal a rallying cry in some of the nation's cities. Beginning in the late 1960's, and backed by huge Federal susbsidies, Boston, Baltimore, Portland, Ore., and Stamford, Conn., for example, had revitalized tawdry downtown and waterfront areas with offices, restaurants and shopping malls.
But by the time the Times Square plan was in final form Federal money for urban renewal had dried up.
City and state officials took a new approach, agreeing to acquire the Times Square site only if the developers would pay for it. Then, upon completion of their office towers, Mr. Klein and Prudential would be paid back not only through tax abatements, but through rent credits.
 
New Strength for Opponents
 Although this financial arrangement may yet prove successful, other roadblocks emerged in the early 1980's. The project was initiated at a time when environmental groups, neighborhood coalitions, and others had begun to emerge as potent new forces in opposing development.
For example, Westway, the proposed highway and commercial project along the Hudson River below 57th Street, collapsed under litigation and citizen protest.
Although public response to the Times Square plan was far from unified, those who opposed it in the 1980's called upon a growing arsenal of legal and public relations skills.
"This is a project that overreached," said Kent Barwick, president of the Municipal Arts Society.
He added, "Everyone loses in these situations. We have seen lots of viable activity in Times Square destroyed for offices we didn't need."
Yet, proponents of the project needed only to look as far as downtown Brooklyn to find a redevelopment scheme that shows strong signs of success. Since 1988, more than four million square feet of offices have been built, or are nearing completion, on a dozen commercial blocks in downtown Brooklyn. Land was condemned by the state, and tax abatements were offered to developers.
 
In Brooklyn, Tenants First

But a major difference in Brooklyn is that corporate tenants, including the Chase Manhattan Bank, Morgan Stanley & Company and the Securities Industry Automation Corporation were courted aggressively by the city and Brooklyn's developers. Long-term leases for most of the new Brooklyn offices were signed before construction began.
In the Times Square redevelopment scheme, no corporate tenants were ever found for any of the proposed new space.
Also, beginning in 1982, the year after its agreement was signed with Mr. Klein and Prudential, New York City adopted zoning inducements to encourage developers to put up office towers elsewhere in the western half of midtown Manhattan.
The intent was to attract new development away from the congested blocks on the east side of midtown, and upgrade the declining blocks around Time Square. Planners thought that there would be more than enough development to fill both the sites on the West Side and the Times Square project.
But the plan backfired. When the city imposed a deadline on the zoning incentives, which allowed buildings larger and bulkier than otherwise, for the end of 1988, developers raced to put their foundations in the ground. More than a dozen large office towers rose near Times Square just as the city was sinking into recession and its real-estate market into a glut.
As a result, experts say, there is a lean market for new offices in Manhattan, and the outlook for Times Square, at least for now, is zero.
"If we do this kind of thing in the future, even in a more robust economy, we are going to have to have a better idea of what the market will bear," said Mr. Salins, the urban planner.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Newsprint Makers' Troubles May Haunt Papers One Day

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
THE newsprint business has rarely, if ever, seen worse days. There is a glut of newsprint available for sale, but the demand from newspapers is tepid because of the recession. This huge imbalance in supply and demand has been the status quo for more than two years.
"It's an unmitigated disaster," said George B. Adler, an analyst specializing in paper companies at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. 
Indeed, the newsprint business is so bad that newspapers are extremely concerned about the financial health of newsprint manufacturers, even though they have previously shown no mercy in demanding ever-larger discounts as newsprint supply far outstripped demand.
With leading newsprint companies like Abitibi-Price Inc. and Bowater Inc. losing money, the fear among some newspapers is that by pressing for the lowest possible prices, they may have created a monster that is preparing to attack them.
This theory is that prices have dropped so low that newsprint companies will demand staggering increases as soon as they can get away with it. Though advertising remains generally flat, many newspapers expect a slowly improving economy to increase advertising in the next year or two. And as newspapers run more advertising, in turn, their demand for newsprint increases.
Newspapers have come to depend on low newsprint prices in the last two years, as the recession has eroded their profits.
If newsprint prices were to skyrocket, the prospective gains from improved advertising could be virtually wiped out at all papers, and some weaker papers -- especially the smaller dailies in Chicago, Houston, New York, Denver and other cities with newspaper competition -- could even be forced out of business.
In these cities, the smaller papers already make little if any profit and would probably get less new advertising in an improving economy than the dominant papers. As such, surging newsprint costs would wound the weaker papers much more than the dominant papers.
Nonetheless, there is little evidence that such concerns have encouraged newspapers to pay more than the market will bear for newsprint.
For instance, earlier this year, a number of newsprint companies announced that the price of newsprint would increase on Aug. 1.
The current list price for a metric ton of newsprint is $685, but newspapers actually get an average discount of about 40 percent off the list price. The Aug. 1 increase, in effect, was intended to reduce the discount to 35 percent, which would have increased the price by about $35 a ton.
But as Aug. 1 approached, word rippled through the newspaper industry that the newsprint manufacturers were not going to be able to make the new price stick, because there was so much excess newsprint available.
"I've got a nagging intuition that there is way too much newsprint out there to make this thing happen," said Homer E. Taylor, vice president of supply for Knight-Ridder Inc., owner of The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Miami Herald and one of the largest consumers of newsprint.
Essentially, the economics of producing newsprint make such gluts very difficult to avoid.
Building newsprint mills is very expensive. But once the mill is operating, the cost to the company of producing each ton of newsprint is very small. The newsprint companies need cash to pay for the cost of building the mills, so they produce as much paper as they can and then sell it for whatever the market will bear.
And now, what the market will bear is so low that even highly efficient operations like Bowater cannot sell paper for more than it costs to make and deliver it.
In the first two quarters of this year, Bowater, the nation's largest newsprint manufacturer, reported an overall operating loss for the first time since the company went public in 1984. Though the company makes a profit from products like the coated paper used for magazines, the loss from newsprint dragged the whole operation into the red.
"The industry cannot continue to operate as it has in a money-losing situation," said David G. McMaster, president of Bowater.
Of course, the older and more remote mills, like some of those in Canada, could simply stop producing paper, thus bringing supply and demand more into equilibrium.
But the social costs of such a Darwinian solution in lost jobs and shattered communities has prompted the Canadian Government to step in and save newsprint mills that might otherwise stop production.
For instance, the Kimberly-Clark Corporation and The New York Times Company jointly operated a newsprint mill at Spruce Falls in Ontario, about 500 miles north of Toronto. Because it had been unprofitable for years, the owners decided to stop operating it and in December gave it to the employees.
Through loans from the former owners and subsidies from the Canadian Government, the plant is now producing almost as much newsprint as before.
To make the burden on newsprint manufacturers even greater, they are under mounting pressure from newspapers and state and local governments to produce newsprint from recycled used newspapers.
Such recycled newsprint must be turned back into pulp, which requires a de-inking process.
And the capital cost of building such de-inking plants must be born by the newsprint manufacturers, just when they have the least amount of capital to spend.

HEADLINE: Raychem Wins a German Phone Contract

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The Raychem Corporation has won a $100 million contract to help provide modern telephone service in the former East Germany and in the process test some of the most advanced features incorporating fiber optics.
Raychem is the only American company to participate in one of the world's most ambitious telecommunications projects: the German Government's $30 billion five-year effort to bring a working telephone system to the backward regions of eastern Germany. 
 Robert J. Saldich, Raychem's chairman and chief executive, said in an interview last week that "the former East Germany, much like West Germany after World War II, has the potential for leapfrogging other countries, this time in telecommunications rather than in manufacturing."
When the Berlin wall fell in 1989, there were only 1.5 million telephone lines in East Germany and a two-decade wait for a telephone to be installed. Many of the telephone lines were unreliable.
"The system in East Germany is a train wreck," Mr. Saldich said. "There were many Western companies, not to speak of West German companies, who simply refused to do business in East Germany because of the lack of working telephones. So the German Government very wisely concluded that the first priority must be to establish modern telecommunications."
By the late 1990's, Deutsche Bundespost Telekom, the state-owned telephone company, plans to install 6 million business and residential lines and replace the existing network, for a total of 7.5 million lines and perhaps more.
About 1.2 million of the new lines will be fiber optic, providing clear voice telephone service as well as future capacity for video and data services. The fiber-optic lines, which transmit via rapid pulses of light over thin glass filaments rather than electric current through copper wire, may cost $2.4 billion or more to manufacture and install.
The German Government awarded contracts for the first 200,000 fiber-optic lines. Three European companies -- Siemens of Germany, Alcatel of France and a consortium led by Philips of the Netherlands -- won contracts for most of the work.
 
A Smaller Contract
 Raynet, a unit of Raychem, won the contract for 48,500 lines in five German cities, including Brandenburg. The lines are scheduled to open in December 1993.
The fiber-optic lines will not provide some of the most advanced services like videoconferencing or rapid use of data bases but will provide digital, and therefore highly reliable, telephone service, as well as 36 to 50 channels of cable television. The main advantage for Raychem is the opportunity to demonstrate its equipment, Mr. Saldich said.
By showing that fiber optics work, the project may help Raychem's sales efforts in West Germany, which has Europe's largest economy, Mr. Saldich said.

As the car, a translucent gleam, reached the intersection of 18th Avenue the driver stomped on the brakes, yanked the emergency brake and twisted the steering wheel sharply to the left, causing the squealing car to spin in a tight circle and leave behind the telltale black smudges of a "doughnut." 
 The maneuver was expertly executed, and swarms of goggle-eyed friends on the sidewalks registered their zealous approval. Two kids with manic grins gave the thumbs-up sign. One scrawny onlooker screamed out: "Yo, good dough."
The driver of the Acura was a car thief, his vehicle stolen property. And on this hot summer night he and many other youths had fanned out into the emptying streets of Newark to display their profligate talents behind the wheels of hot cars.
"Some kids play sports for identity," said Sgt. Henry Alston of the Newark police auto-theft squad. "Some kids read books to be somebody. And some kids steal cars. So one kid is the quarterback, one kid is the president of the eighth-grade class and one kid is the doughnut man."
Car theft in Newark and neighboring cities has reached epidemic proportions in recent years. Day or night, no automobile is safe. Even the most youthful thieves -- some are as young as 9 years old -- can penetrate any barrier and be behind the wheel in a matter of seconds; soon they are thundering down the road, riding like the wind. Every 24 hours, 40 automobiles disappear, making this troubled city of 275,000 the car-theft capital of the country.
While some of the larceny is for profit, in which the criminals either retag the cars with new license plates and sell them or peddle them to "chop shops" that carve them up for the parts, most of the recent theft here is of a different stripe. It is the work of juveniles and tender adults interested in possessing the cars as a rite of passage and a means to gain veneration in their neighborhoods.
Once they have the cars, it is incumbent upon them to demonstrate their deft driving by doing doughnuts and other bold stunts. After the cars run out of gas or become crippled beyond appeal, they are usually ditched.
To the youths, it is just a daring game, but to the rest of Newark it has become a deadly and costly abuse. Two months ago a 17-year-old car-theft suspect named Howard Caesar was seriously wounded when he was shot -- apparently by a police officer.
The suspect is now in stable condition, and three officers have been charged with conspiring to conceal their actions. Last Thursday another officer who was suspended in the case pleaded guilty to lying on a police report and agreed to testify to a special grand jury.
 
The Price
Damaged Vehicles, Damaged Lives
 The game has also meant that dozens of parked or passing cars have been bashed and pedestrians have been injured and even killed. Some of the thieves have never driven before and learn to operate cars at 70 miles an hour. Some must climb atop phone books or rolled-up floor mats just to see over the wheel. Their bodies are slight, but their feet are lead.
Then there is the wrenching impact on victims who find themselves stranded without transportation, saddled with towing and repair costs and anguished over their sense of violation. A woman who recently moved to Newark from San Francisco with a 1991 Jeep Wrangler allowed her insurance to lapse for a few days while she switched to a new carrier. The day after the insurance expired, her car was stolen. It was recovered with $2,150 worth of damage.
And there are other economic costs. Since New Jersey limits insurance rates in the Newark area, hoping to spread the burden more evenly, every car owner in the state bears part of the cost of the city's myriad stolen cars. Indeed, auto theft is one of the principal reasons the state's insurance rates are the third highest in the country.
It is impossible to calculate all the time and expense mustered against car theft here. But a new task force of officers from Essex County, where Newark, Irvington and East Orange are situated, and neighboring Union County, which includes Elizabeth, costs more than $1 million a year. Meanwhile, the Newark police have about 20 officers assigned full time to fighting car theft, and virtually every member of the department periodically finds himself pitted against a car thief. Auto theft is the most commonly reported major offense in the city, last year accounting for 34 percent of all serious crimes.
 
Stealing Reputations
 The sauciness of the thieves is striking. On the streets, 18-year-old Easy E, whose nickname suggests how simple it is for him to steal cars, boasts of taking 200 vehicles in the last three years and tells how those deeds have fortified his sense of who he is. "I usually wear my shades and driving gloves," he said, because his admirers expect it.
Last year, one youth was brought into a police precinct station house for stealing a car and released on his own recognizance. Not much for taking the bus, he stole a police officer's car to go home.
Several months ago, while the Essex County Prosecutor was busy delivering a talk on auto theft at a Newark church, a thief was busy stealing his car.
As the police and prosecutors have bolstered their efforts to stem the problem -- most notably by forming the task force last December -- the youths have upped the ante. They taunt the police and increasingly ram stolen cars into police cruisers, taking special delight in exploding a cruiser's air bags. During the first seven months of the year, 20 Newark police cars have been smashed in brushes with thieves.
"I hate the word joy riding," said Sgt. Thomas DeCastro, the head of the Essex-Union task force. "They kill others; they kill themselves; they kill us. A teen-age kid with 3,000 pounds of metal under him going 80 miles an hour is not a joy to behold. He's an absolute terror."
Virtually nothing stops the thieves. Stealing a car is easier than breaking into a house. And why break into a house? It doesn't take you anyplace; it doesn't do doughnuts.
 
The Numbers
Leading the Nation In Auto Thefts
 Like any densely populated city, Newark has long been stained by car theft. Not until 1985 did the problem begin to spiral out of control. A decade ago, Newark ranked ninth in car theft per 100,000 people among cities of more than 50,000 population, with 6,424 cars stolen. By 1986, the number had swelled to 12,918, and Newark vaulted to first place, a dubious distinction it has yet to relinquish. New York City, by comparison, ranked 36th in 1990. (New Jersey itself ranks third among states in car theft per capita, behind California and New York.)
Between 1984 and 1989, theft in Newark doubled to 15,674 cars. In each of the last two years, largely because of more vigilant efforts against insurance fraud, the numbers have decreased somewhat, falling to 13,961 last year. So far this year, theft is down an additional 14 percent, a mark that local officials say shows the impact of the the new task force. But, they say, the level remains wholly unacceptable.
 
'Mostly Joy Riding'
 Insurance companies find that in central and southern New Jersey only about one-third of stolen cars are recovered, suggesting they have been chopped up or shipped overseas for sale. But in northern New Jersey more than two-thirds are recovered, indicating that the prime intention is to drive them. The Newark police estimate that they recover about 78 percent of the city's stolen cars.
"In Newark, it's mostly joy riding," said Thomas J. Cleary, northeast manager for the National Insurance Crime Bureau, a group that monitors and studies car theft for a consortium of insurance companies. "It is not unique there for a young chap to get picked up 25 to 30 times for car theft."
Sergeant DeCastro, an old auto-theft hand, has seen the motivation change. "I was an undercover operative in a car sting four years ago," he said. "If you asked me then why they were stealing, it was to sell the cars to get money to buy drugs. That was the main reason. Now it's a street game. Who can steal the coolest car, the fastest car, the prettiest car and who can drive it the best."
 
The Perpetrators
Light Sentences, Repeat Offenders
 As with so many fads that entice the young, no one seems certain how this one began. "We wanted our own thing," explained Keekee, a 15-year-old thief who said Newark youths drifted into car stealing and stunt driving to stand apart from urban youths who expressed themselves through graffiti or other acts.
Certainly, the game has been fueled by the light penalties attached to the crime. Judicial overload and clogged prisons in New Jersey have meant that car thieves rarely serve much, if any, time behind bars. Probation seems to be the most common punishment, and juveniles are frequently released on their own recognizance the day they are arrested. Adult thieves often give fake names and ages to evade penalties.
What's more, because of the perils to bystanders, the police are restrained from chasing stolen cars at high speed unless they believe the drivers were involved in another, more serious crime
The police say there is little recognizable pattern to where car theft takes place. No area of Newark is immune, though incidents are scarcer in the East District. Many of the thefts in surrounding cities like Irvington, Elizabeth and East Orange, the police have found, are the handiwork of Newark thieves who venture out in bands and bring cars back in caravans to Newark. One reason for straying out of town is that thieves do not want to steal cars in neighborhoods where they are known. Any number of times, they have mistakenly stolen the cars of drug dealers from their area, only to have the dealers track them down and beat them up or shoot them.
There is a very definite pattern to where the cars are recovered. Most turn up in Newark's South and West districts, impoverished, sad areas of the city where most of the car thieves live and where they especially like to put on their driving exhibitions.
Nationwide, the most commonly stolen car is the Ford Mustang, though on the streets of Newark the car of choice is a Honda, especially an Accord, or its upscale sibling, the Acura. Thieves favor small, zippy cars because they handle well on the dense streets and are ideal for doughnuts. A black Honda with tinted windows is prized the most.
A $2 screwdriver or a "slim jim," a sliver of steel that slips between a car window and door, usually gets thieves past the door lock, or else they'll break a window. If a driver uses a locking bar like the Club to guard the steering wheel, the thieves will spray it with freon, freezing it, and then smash it with a hammer. To start the car, they'll crack the steering column with a flat-bladed screwdriver and insert the tool into the opening to start the car. On Hondas and other Japanese cars, they'll yank out the ignition switch and then stick a screwdriver into the housing and turn it. Hidden shut-off switches do deter many thieves. But if a thief really wants a car, he'll get a tow truck.
According to profiles put together by the joint task force, more than 65 percent of the offenders are aged 9 to 17. Few flirt with car theft once and then resist its scent. The Newark police keep a list of juvenile repeat offenders known as the target auto-theft offenders list, the equivalent of its roster of career adult criminals. To make the list a youth must be arrested at least five times. Dozens have been.
Sergeant Alston unfolded the rap sheet of one 11-year-old who has been on the list for two years. It contained 15 arrests for auto theft. The boy has been removed to foster care. Then the sergeant held up the sheet of a 14-year-old who had nine arrests. "Nothing has happened to him," he said. "He got a one-year suspended sentence and hasn't gone anywhere. That's crazy. And he's a prime-time player. What I'm showing you is how the home failed first and now the state failed."
 
The Victims
For Car Owners, A Losing Battle
 Bedeviled residents of Newark have been stumped over how to protect their cars.
For Loretta Hilton, seeing her car stolen has become a yearly ritual. In 1990, it happened at Thanksgiving when she was visiting a friend in East Orange. In 1991, it happened just before Christmas when she stopped in to see another friend in Newark. This year, it happened early, just three months ago, while the car was outside her house in the West District. The first two times, the car was recovered, badly dented. This time, it was not found at all.
"The last payment on the car was June," said Ms. Hilton, a 35-year-old medical technician. "So the car was finally mine. Except there was no car."
Leticia Nagbe, a 23-year-old computer operator who lives in Orange and drives to work in Newark, has had it worse: three thefts in two years. "It's depressing," she said. "These awful people have no regard for other people's feelings. I am so mad."
There are visible signs of the fury. Seething residents of the South and West districts, so often victimized, sometimes fling rocks as thieves race past. They occasionally shatter windows of stolen cars, adding to the damage toll for the victims.
Just the other week, a stolen car veered wildly down Avon Avenue and mowed down a 16-year-old girl, who subsequently underwent 10 hours of surgery. When the police arrived, inflamed residents of the area were rocking the car, trying to get at the passengers. Had the police not hustled the thieves away, they said, the residents might have killed them.
As the game stubbornly continues, its players keep devising new thrills. Thieves pile into cars and soar down the street with some of them trying to see how far they can droop out the window. Friends like to hurl bricks at the cars, or shove thick tree limbs in front of them as the thieves whiz by to see if they can avoid swerving out of control or flipping over.
"Another new thing is deliberately crashing them and then burning them up," said Amando Crespo, a security guard who patrols Pilgrim Baptist Village, a housing development in the West District. "It's crazy. These kids think they're immortal. They don't know. No one is immortal."

HEADLINE: LONG ISLAND SOUND JOURNAL;
Beating the Traffic by Taking a Ride on the Waves

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn.

 BODY:
Tucked behind a tangle of highway ramps and storm fencing, a century-old ferry service here seems to be thriving, even as much of the rest of this city falls into disrepair.
Founded in 1883 by a group of businessmen, including P. T. Barnum, the Bridgeport and Port Jefferson Steamboat Company traverses Long Island Sound with loads of highway-weary travelers interested in cutting their travel time and experiencing a different way to get around. 
 "It's nice knowing that something like this exists," said Richard Mizdal, an artist from Remsenburg, L.I., who was returning from a visit to New England. "It's not only the efficiency factor, but it's kind of a romantic notion, of travel on the water."
Ferry service became more popular in several states during the 1980's amid concern over traffic congestion and declining air quality. In New Jersey, several companies sprang up to provide ferries between cities along the Hudson and points in Manhattan. New London, Conn., remains a ferry hub, with service to summer resorts like Block Island, Fishers Island and Orient Point, on Long Island's North Fork. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York has proposed high-speed ferry routes between Shoreham, L.I., and New Haven, as well as routes linking Manhattan with towns along the Hudson River and other parts of the state.
On a pair of crossings last week, many of the parents aboard the Park City, one of two ferries operated by the Bridgeport company, seemed relieved to let their children out of their cars. Toddlers scampered around the broad, open decks. Older children leaned against the railings as Bridgeport's waterfront gave way to a flat, steel-gray expanse of the Sound.
Elsewhere, businessmen whispered into cellular phones, retirees relaxed as they headed for resorts on Long Island's South Shore. Others spent the trip absorbed in their newspapers or their laptop computers.
"We want to talk about the recession," said Patricia Churko of Stratford, Conn., who was traveling with two friends. "This is my trip this summer, instead of going to Cancun. This is my vacation. I've ended up on the Long Island ferry."
Several passengers said that were it not for the ferry, they would have little contact with Bridgeport. Some said they were grateful to the ferry for helping them avoid what they evidently regarded as a fate worse than Bridgeport: entering the maelstrom that they believe New York City to be.
"I hate to drive back into the New York area and all that if I can help it," said Jim Richardson of Westport, Conn., who was heading to Quogue, L.I., with his wife, Debby. Joe and Mary Stark, who grew up riding the Staten Island Ferry, were driving to Southampton from Goshen, N.Y. The ferry cut their travel time by an hour.
Their daughters, ages 4 and 2, ran past as they spoke. "Instead of having them in the car for four and a half hours, which is torture," Mrs. Stark said, "this is a nice break."
Within an hour, the jetties and sandy beaches of Port Jefferson came into view. In Port Jefferson, the ferry docks on a pier clearly intended for public pleasure. Seafood restaurants line it, pedestrians stroll up and down it, and seagulls wheel overhead. Bridgeport's pier, in contrast, has a lone snack bar and a basketball hoop, monopolized by ferry employees when they are between boats.
Originally the ferry service was meant to link the agricultural realm of Long Island with the industrial wonders of coastal Connecticut, "specifically Bridgeport," said Frederick A. Hall, the company's general manager. Bridgeport was also a popular destination for Long Islanders needing dental work, he added. The company grew quickly from one boat to two, where it has remained for most of its 109 years.
About 700,000 people ride the ferries every year, Mr. Hall said. Last year, 234,000 cars were carried as well. The price for a car and driver is $30 one way on weekends, and $24 in the middle of the week. Individuals pay $10 each way on weekends, which run from Friday to Monday in the ferry world, and $8 on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. Round trips are available at a discount.
During the summer, the boats -- the Park City, which is Bridgeport's nickname, and the Grand Republic, which has nothing to do with either destination -- make 10 round trips a day, Mr. Hall said. Demand falls off after Columbus Day.
The ferry definitely has its fan club, and everyone seems to have a different reason.
"You know what I like to do," confided Guy Reuge, chef and owner of a restaurant called Mirabelle in St. James, L.I., who has taken the ferry several times as part of family vacations. "I take a big cigar usually. It has to be big enough to get me all the way there. By the time I arrive, I've finished it." Then it's back into the car, and on with the trip.

HEADLINE: Success of Canadian Exporter Is a Trade Issue

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, Aug. 9

 BODY:
Peerless Clothing Inc., a family-owned suit maker in Montreal, has done so well in shipping its men's wool suits to the United States that it has emerged as one of the final stumbling blocks in the lengthy negotiations for a free-trade agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada.
In the last three years, Peerless has tripled its sales, to $100 million (Canadian), and now provides 80 percent of all the Canadian men's wool suits shipped to the United States. Because of its growth and that of some other companies, the American textile industry has persuaded American negotiators to try to keep curbs on imported apparel. The Canadians have resisted, and the haggling continues as negotiations in Washington remained unresolved today. 
 Canada's International Trade Minister, Michael Wilson, standing up for Peerless and other companies in the small but vocal Canadian apparel industry, argues that Washington is clamping down unjustly on success.
 
Minuscule Market Share
 Jack Kivenko, president of the Canadian Apparel Manufacturers' Institute, complained, "As soon as we have any degree of success -- even though the amount of our exports is minuscule in the U.S. market -- the Americans are trying to stop us, which is not really fair."
The United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, has so far been unwilling to make an exception for Canada.
Imports by the United States of men's woolen suits from Canada rose ninefold, to 456,000 in the 12 months that ended May 31, from 49,000 in 1987. That growth was largely a result of the dismantlement of barriers under a free-trade agreement between the United States and Canada that went into effect on Jan. 1, 1989.
Peerless, whose 300,000-square-foot computerized plant employs 1,300 people in the north end of Montreal, saw the trade liberalization coming and capitalized on it. The 73-year-old company turns out 17,000 men's suits a week, as well as trousers and sport jackets.
Its chief executive and principal owner, Alvin Segal, a 58-year-old Montreal resident who calls himself a manufacturing specialist, said he had prepared for expansion by turning to a process known as European engineering to make what look like hand-tailored suits without the hand tailoring. Instead, pieces of fabric are carefully molded and fused to garments.
"When I saw what the Europeans were doing, I was fascinated, and began implementing it right here," he said in an interview on Friday. "The technology is widely available. I didn't do anything anyone else couldn't have done."
Such machine-made suits were developed in Europe after World War II, after a generation of tailors died in the Holocaust or fled the Continent, Mr. Segal said.
The process allows him to sell his suits to American retail outlets for as little as $130. The stores put on their own labels and mark up the suits to around $300.
Peerless has 2,000 retail accounts, most in the United States, and some in Puerto Rico and in Mexico.
Under the Canadian-American free trade agreement, Canadian manufacturers like Peerless can import spools of yarn from Europe and Asia and knit them into fabric for garments that are considered to be Canadian for trade purposes.
Such garments qualify for lower duties and eventually duty-free trade with the United States under the staged reduction of tariffs that is part of the United States-Canada pact. Peerless's suits pay a 15 percent duty, down from 25 percent in 1989.
But under the negotiations for the new North American Free Trade Agreement, the United States is insisting that suits or other garments made of foreign yarn come in under a special quota to get the preferential duty. Once that quota is filled, the suits would have to pay the full 25 percent tariff, the same as those from South Korea or Italy, for example.
In other words, the way the Canadians see it, Canadian companies that do not use American fabric to make garments would not be able to enjoy the freer trade benefits of the pact.
Asked his reaction, an American trade official said, "The Canadians are beefing because they are trying to get themselves a bigger quota." He declined to predict the outcome of the conflict.
 
Focus on Hills
 So far, Mrs. Hills has been unwilling to budge. Any eventual concession to the Canadians would depend on her judgment of the political as well as economic trade-offs.
The reason the United States has been so tough is that Canadian garment manufacturers like Peerless pay much lower import duties on foreign yarns and fabrics than their counterparts in the United States.
The powerful American textile lobby, which in recent years has been able to sway the votes of more than half the members of Congress, has kept duties on imported fabrics and yarns as high as 36 percent. Peerless and other Canadian companies pay only 8 percent on their European woolens and worsteds.
"It's the fabric that makes one garment different from another," Mr. Segal said. "We have access to world fabrics at world prices, and we don't want to give that up."

HEADLINE: Aldus to Cut Its Staff by 100

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Aug. 9

 BODY:
The Aldus Corporation, one of many software makers plagued by falling revenue, is restructuring its United States operations and laying off 11 percent, or about 100, of its temporary and permanent staff.
The restructuring follows "economic and competitive pressures that continue to have a negative impact on our business," said Paul Brainerd, president. Last month, the company posted a second-quarter loss of $900,000 on revenue of $38.9 million. 
 "There's no evidence of any improvement yet in either the U.S. market or in Europe," said Robert Klieber, an analyst with Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis, referring to the company's products. "Cost-cutting can continue to help only if there's a boost to the top line."
Mr. Klieber said he expects the company to post net income of 46 cents a share on revenue of $165 million for 1992 and 80 cents on revenue of $180 million for 1993.
Aldus shares closed Friday at $13.25, down 50 cents, in over-the-counter trading.

HEADLINE: America Isn't Asia's Cop

 BODY:
The Soviet threat is ended. America has been able to scale down radically its troop strength in Europe. But in Asia, apart from the unplanned base closings in the Philippines, U.S. forces remain in place -- including 40,000 each in South Korea and and Japan.
Political and budgetary pressures will rightly tempt the next President to scale down these troop levels. A smaller U.S. military garrison makes good sense, provided Washington also works to build up a new system of regional collective security. Such a system would provide the best insurance against conflicts between Asian states as Japan raises its military profile in the region. 
 Worrisome conflicts are already taking shape. China and Korea are unhappy about rising Japanese defense budgets and a new law that permits Japanese military units to join U.N. peacekeeping operations. Today's Japan is not militaristic and lacks long-range weapons. But that doesn't reassure Asian victims of past Japanese aggression.
Seoul and Beijing will soon establish formal diplomatic ties. There is a danger that they might go on to fashion a military alliance that could isolate and provoke Japan.
North Korea's secretive nuclear program also threatens regional security. Unless South Korea can satisfy itself that Pyongyang isn't building a bomb, Seoul may reconsider its own renunciation of nuclear weapons. A Japan faced with four nuclear neighbors -- Russia, China and the two Koreas -- would undoubtedly feel pressure to go nuclear too.
Russia and Japan, meanwhile, remain locked in a territorial dispute left over from World War II. And China now rattles its neighbors by asserting sovereignty over islands claimed by Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan.
These problems could be resolved through a new regional security organization that would include Japan, China and South Korea as well as Russia and the United States. As things now stand, aggrieved parties typically lobby for America's support. That could begin to put Washington in ticklish situations. But in a collective security arrangement, a natural forum for direct talks would be created. Washington would not feel compelled to take sides.
Members of Asean, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, also might want to participate. And diplomatic outcasts like Vietnam and Taiwan might eventually be brought in. A regional security organization might even become a modest force for democratization by subjecting each member's military forces to a healthy degree of outside accountability.
Even before the cold war ended, the mission of U.S. forces in the Pacific had shifted from containing Communism to keeping potential Asian rivals at arm's length from each other. There's no good reason for America to bear this regional security burden alone as Asian societies grow increasingly rich and powerful.
Moving from a U.S.-centered security system toward regional collective security won't be simple. But it could establish a more reliable basis for future regional peace.

HEADLINE: A New Opening for Times Square

 BODY:
Times Square, magnet for millions, "crossroads of the world," has come to a crossroads of its own. The decision to suspend construction of four giant office towers as the core of a private-public redevelopment plan is a sensible bow to reality; the market for new mid-Manhattan skyscrapers is dead.
Planners will now want to rethink their grand design, and doers must move quickly to resuscitate the half-abandoned entertainment block of 42d Street. A stretch of theaters and small shops stands empty, its tenants evicted to make way for construction of the office towers. Boarded over with plywood and "Post No Bills" signs, two-thirds of the block between Seventh and Eighth Avenues has the sad look of a deserted Main Street. 
 The block was tawdry before the evictions, dominated by vendors of porn, tacky knickknacks and XXX-rated movies. Their departure is good riddance. The crime rate fell when they left. But, now that new construction is on hold, it is urgent that the emptiness be refilled -- and with something better than was there before.
Final agreement on revised priorities is said to be near, and the new plan will then undergo extensive public review. It is expected to incorporate several major changes, all reasonable under the circumstances.
The private developers, the Prudential Insurance Company of America and Park Tower Realty, will be released from an agreement to start building next year; they can wait until the market revives, or perhaps not build the towers at all. They will also be relieved of the immediate cost of renovating the sprawling Times Square subway interchange.
But they will reportedly assume new responsibility, to put serious money and effort into shoring up the block's retail activity and six old theaters right away. It is essential that they attract a variety of entertainment and retail businesses that can restore the zest suppressed by abandonment.
There is no reason to doubt the commitment of Prudential and Park Tower. Both are reliable, and both have a financial stake in the area's eventual prosperity. Equally certain, the block in question is prime territory for development. On average, some 8,000 people pass through every hour. Times Square itself remains a mecca for New Yorkers and visitors from every corner of planet Earth.
City and state agencies now have added burdens, too. At the Seventh Avenue end, the subway station still needs a complete overhaul. Where's the $91 million to pay for it? The Eighth Avenue end remains tawdry, because plans for that part of the block are still not firm. If that section remains as is, it can only be a drag on the end that's being improved.
The suspension of the major construction is a loss. Perhaps it's the fault of overambitious plans to begin with, or the delay caused by 47 lawsuits. The project may also have been undercut by city incentives that led to a glut of offices and hotels in the Times Square area. And surely the plan has been set back by the commercial real estate recession afflicting cities everywhere.
But the loss is also an opportunity -- for faster restoration of the street-level hurly-burly and empty theaters. This new opening challenges the creativity of private developers and public authorities alike. Times Square needs help.

HEADLINE: Navy Resembles a Fraternity in Its Sexism;
New York Hearings

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The impact of the Clarence Thomas hearing on public awareness about sexual harassment has indeed been dramatic, as shown in "Suffering in Silence No More: Fighting Sexual Harassment" (front page, July 13). 
 Millions of Americans recognized in Prof. Anita Hill's testimony a description of the kind of hostile environment in which they have been working. Now some of these victims are speaking out, and employers, including of New York State, are listening with renewed attentiveness.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has created a task force on sexual harassment, one of the first of its kind, to continue the public dialogue and to devise constructive approaches to preventing and redressing sexual harassment. The Governor appointed both men and women to this task force, understanding that both sexes must be involved in addressing the problem.
Members of the Governor's task force have been visiting communities around the state to hear suggestions from the public on how to stop sexual harassment. The task force has scheduled a public forum in Seneca Falls on Women's Equality Day, Aug. 29, and will be in New York City for three days of public hearings Sept. 22, 23 and 24.
We are also conducting roundtable discussions with people who have been sexually harassed, employers, therapists, lawyers and people of color, as well as lesbians and gay men.
As task force head, I have been moved by the courage of victims and their families in coming forward to describe their experiences. One woman in Albany spoke of a boss who, even after being brought up on disciplinary charges, continued to harass her. On Long Island we heard from a victim's husband, who told of the painful dilemma his wife faced in having to choose between staying in a job where she was sexually harassed or losing the income that would help provide a college education for their daughter. We have also heard instances of men being harassed by women and same-sex harassment.
We also have been impressed by the efforts of many employers to grapple with this difficult issue and work to find solutions.
The social and economic costs of sexual harassment are too high, both for the victims and for society. Prevention should be our goal. In New York City the task force can be reached through the State Division for Women offices at 2 World Trade Center, 57th floor.

Republicans began writing a party platform today that advocates a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion and embraces a variety of other conservative doctrines, including a repeal of the tax increases President Bush signed two years ago.
In contrast to the Democrats, who sought in the platform they adopted last month to round the edges on their sharpest liberal stances of the past, the Republicans seem determined to stress conservative principle over pragmatic drift toward the center. 
 While the platform will not be completed until later this week, the drafters indicated they would stick with the language on abortion used in the last two Republican platforms.
It declares that "the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed." It does not provide for even the exceptions President Bush accepts: allowing abortions to end pregnancies that result from rape or incest.
The plank also supports appointment of judges who would overturn the constitutional right to abortion.
The Republicans who gathered here today in the downtown convention center, across town from the Astrodome where the Republican National Convention will be held next week, tried in their speeches to change the electoral tide that has been running against President Bush for the last month.
This morning, Richard N. Bond, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, kicked off the party's two weeks here with a rousing speech about "what a horror show a Clinton Presidency might be."
He suggested that Representative Patricia Schroeder of Colorado would become Secretary of Defense, former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California would be Secretary of the Interior and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York would get the first nomination to the Supreme Court.
Ms. Schroeder's first recommendation, Mr. Bond asserted, would be "to stop referring to naval vessels as 'she.' "
Representative Bill McCollum of Florida, a co-chairman of the platform committee, declared, "Today is the first day of the re-election campaign of George Bush and Dan Quayle."
The chairman of the platform committee, Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, said the goal of the platform was to draw distinctions between Republicans and Democrats, and the document that was being drafted today did that on issues across the board: the economy, welfare, gun control, military spending and the environment, among others.
The sharpest difference, not surprisingly, involved abortion. The Democratic platform endorses a woman's right to choose abortion without exception and calls for government financing of abortions for poor women who cannot afford them otherwise.
 
Opponents in Control
 The Republicans' subcommittee on "individual rights, good homes and safe streets," which had jurisdiction over the abortion question, was stacked with abortion opponents, and they created a parliamentary situation that prevented the few delegates here in favor of abortion rights from amending the platform.
Two of those delegates, Bobbi Breske from Delaware and Mary Wiese from South Dakota, said in the subcommittee debate that Republicans from their states had expressed dissatisfaction with the hard line against abortion, especially in the cases of rape and incest, and that some were threatening to vote against the ticket over the issue.
"Are we just to put lives in jeopardy because a woman has been raped and she does not want to carry it?" asked Mrs. Breske, who works with Mary Kay Cosmetics and has long been active in Republican affairs in her state.
"The realities of life are sometimes very ugly," she added.
But Mrs. Breske and the handful of other supporters of abortion rights who attended the session were routed by the overwhelming majority of Republican platform writers who want to make abortion illegal.
 
'A Party of Principles'
 The subcommittee chairman, Mary Potter Summa, an assistant district attorney from North Carolina who is four and a half months' pregnant, declared, "What's in me is a human life that's kicking me and sitting on my bladder."
Texas newspapers are reporting that a large majority of Republicans, even in this conservative state, favor legal abortions in at least some circumstances, but Mrs. Summa said, "We are a party of principles and not a party of the whims of polls."
Representative Henry J. Hyde of Illinois made the case against allowing women who have been raped to have abortions. "The value of human life is transcendent," he asserted.
The subcommittee adopted the rigid language by a vote of 13 to 3.
Today, six subcommittees worked on various facets of the platform. Their work will go before the 107-member platform committee on Tuesday, and the abortion question will probably be raised again. But no one expects the outcome to be any different.
 
What Kind of Change?
 Before the drafting work began, the delegates gathered for what amounted to a pep rally and heard stem-winding speeches from Mr. Bond and other party leaders that did not praise President Bush so much as they hammered Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas.
In what sounded like a preview of the keynote address he will deliver at the convention next week, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas accused the Democratic Presidential candidate of supporting the largest tax and spending increases in the nation's history, steps that the Senator said would drive the country and countless businesses into bankruptcy.
"In a country that comes out for change, is this the change America wants?" Senator Gramm asked. "I think it is not."
One change the platform is pushing for is a repeal of the tax increases Mr. Bush signed as part of the 1990 budget deal. Among those were an increase in the tax rate on the wealthiest Americans to 31 percent from 28 percent and a higher annual Medicare tax on workers with incomes from about $55,000 to $125,000.
The whole budget agreement was a mistake, the subcommittee dealing with the economy declared. That conclusion goes somewhat beyond what Mr. Bush has said. He has maintained only that the agreement was a political mistake, not necessarily a substantive one.
A small group of backers of Patrick J. Buchanan, who ran against Mr. Bush in the early primaries this year, advocated such causes today as a wall across Southern California and the Rio Grande Valley to keep illegal Mexican immigrants out and the abolition of foreign aid. But such proposals are clearly going nowhere.
Mr. Buchanan is scheduled to address the convention next week, and his sister and campaign manager, Angela Buchanan, said her brother would put differences aside, support the President's re-election and "do nothing to harm the Republican Party between now and the election."

HEADLINE: Justice Dept. Rebuffs Democrats On Special Prosecutor on Iraq Aid

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 10

 BODY:
The Bush Administration rebuffed House Democrats today and refused to seek the appointment of an independent prosecutor to investigate whether officials violated the law by trying to aid Iraq before the Persian Gulf war.
The decision may spare President Bush some political embarrassment in this year's campaign, but the Attorney General insisted that politics did not influence the decision. Democrats immediately attacked the decision as part of a politically motivated cover-up. 
 House Democrats requested an independent prosecutor in a letter to Attorney General William P. Barr on July 9. Mr. Barr responded today that there was no basis for a special prosecutor because the Democrats had not provided specific, credible information to suggest that high-ranking officials had committed any crimes.
 
'Stonewalling,' Democrat Says
 Mr. Barr said the Justice Department itself could investigate the actions of lower-level officials, including the alteration of Commerce Department documents relating to the approval of export licenses for Iraq.
The Democrats' request for a special prosecutor "fails to identify any particular person alleged to have committed a crime, or to describe any particular acts alleged to constitute a crime," Mr. Barr said.
Mr. Barr's decision appears to be final. The law on appointing special prosecutors says the Attorney General's decision "shall not be reviewable in any court."
Representative Jack Brooks, Democrat of Texas and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said Mr. Barr's decision was "stonewalling, plain and simple."
 
'Extra Heavy Responsibility'
 Campaigning today in Philadelphia, Gov. Bill Clinton, the Democratic Presidential candidate, said he was "really troubled" by Mr. Barr's decision.
"It appears there is a lot of evidence there, and I understand the Attorney General thought there wasn't enough evidence," said Mr. Clinton. In the absence of a special prosecutor, he said, the Justice Department will have "an extra heavy responsibility to look into the apparent irregularities."
Mr. Bush has repeatedly asserted that the conduct of foreign affairs is his greatest strength, but Congressional investigators have challenged that contention with evidence suggesting that the Administration strengthened Iraq with economic aid and sophisticated technology before the gulf war. Administration officials say they were trying to moderate Iraq's behavior, and admit the effort failed.
In his combative response to House Democrats, Mr. Barr said, "The criteria for invoking the independent counsel statute are not present." He said that the Democrats had offered "vague and conclusory allegations" that were "wholly inadequate" to justify a request for a special prosecutor.
 
The Political Spin
 Mr. Barr warned the Democrats: "Repeated and unjustified attacks on the integrity of the department tear down the institution and undermine our ability to advance justice. As Attorney General, I believe strongly that we cannot allow the criminal process to be used as a political weapon or for partisan purposes."
But House Democrats said it was Mr. Barr who was playing politics. Representative Henry B. Gonzalez of Texas, chairman of the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs, said, "Mr. Barr is playing a dangerous political game in a desperate effort to protect the Bush Administration."
Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, said the Administration was "hiding in technicalities."
"The Attorney General is saying that you need to know the place, the time and the motive of the alleged crime," he said. "If you had that, you wouldn't need an independent counsel. It's like saying that the victim of a mugging has to have a videotape of the incident and the perpetrator in handcuffs before reporting the crime to the police."
The procedures for appointing a special prosecutor were established by the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, which was amended in 1983 and 1987. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia must appoint a special prosecutor if the Attorney General requests one.
Under the law, the Attorney General is supposed to consider only two questions: "the specificity of the information received and the credibility of the source."
Because Mr. Barr's decision cannot be challenged in court, Congress is likely to intensify its investigation. "The court of public opinion is open for business 24 hours a day, and that court will not be satisfied with the subterfuge concocted today," said Mr. Brooks, the Judiciary Committee chairman.
From 1986 to 1990, Iraq got more than $4 billion in loans and letters of credit from the Atlanta branch of an Italian bank, Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, and Congressional investigators say Iraq used some of the money to buy technology for weapons projects.
When a former executive of the bank pleaded guilty in June to charges of conspiracy and bank fraud, Federal District Judge Marvin H. Shoob, in Atlanta, said an independent prosecutor was needed to investigate the Justice Department's handling of the case.
Democratic members of Congress said there was evidence that Justice Department officials intervened to postpone indictments that could have embarrassed Iraq.
 
No Evidence, Barr Says
 But Mr. Barr said today that "there is not a shred of evidence that any department employee acted improperly" and that "there was no wrongdoing" by the department. Moreover, Mr. Barr said, Judge Shoob did not understand the case.
In the 1980's, the United States guaranteed several billion dollars of loans to Iraq. Such guarantees typically make it much easier and much less expensive for the borrower to raise the money.
Iraq was supposed to use the money to buy food grown on American farms; Congressional investigators say some was used to buy weapons and technology.
But Mr. Barr said today that even if Iraq had misused United States aid, "we have found no evidence that United States Government employees knowingly participated in or facilitated any such diversion."
The Attorney General acknowledged that the Agriculture Department continued to give aid to Iraq after seeing "possible evidence of irregularities." But he said the continued operation of the aid program was no crime.
 
Presses Justice Department
 Mr. Barr promised that the Justice Department would "continue to fully and fairly investigate" issues it was already reviewing. These include the alteration of Commerce Department records and apparent contradictions in Congressional testimony by Administration officials.
Mr. Barr said his decision was supported by other Justice Department officials, including two career prosecutors: the Deputy Attorney General, George J. Terwilliger 3d, and Michael Chertoff, the United States Attorney for New Jersey. Mr. Chertoff reviewed the department's handling of the case against Banca Nazionale del Lavoro.
In the latest in a series of speeches on American policy toward Iraq, Representative Gonzalez said today that the Administration knew Baghdad was using United States companies to buy military technology in 1989 and 1990.
"In part deliberately, in part through sheer neglect, the Bush Administration did little or nothing to stop Saddam Hussein's ambitious efforts," he said.

HEADLINE: For Idle Young in Newark, Pride in a Theft Done Right

SERIES: Growing Up, Stealing Cars -- First of three articles.

BYLINE: By MICHEL MARRIOTT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
For a demonstration, a 15-year-old boy, his frame as compact as a sparrow's, slid beneath the dashboard of a stranger's car. "This," he said in a boyish voice, "is how you get a car." The youth, known on the street as Monk, tugged back a plastic collar and displayed a tangle of wires, switches and pins that he had manipulated on so many other cars to start their engines and unlock their steering wheels.
If this had been another car -- a car that Monk wanted -- it would now be his, he said. But he was merely showing a visitor the ropes. And in doing so Monk offered a glimpse into the world of young car thieves. Nothing stops them: neither shrieking alarms nor locked bars on steering wheels nor even their consciences.
 
Black, Jobless and Poor
 "You can steal any car in the world if you know what to do," said Monk, a ninth grader who said he made it his business to know exactly what to do, especially when it came to his favorites: 5.0 Ford Mustangs and top-shelf Japanese imports, like Acura Legends and Vigors. 
 Throughout Newark's impoverished neighborhoods, mostly desperate places of vacant lots, overcrowded public housing projects, tumbledown homes and struggling inhabitants, there are scores of boys and girls like Monk, say the Newark police and Essex County prosecutors. Usually young, black, jobless and poor, they have helped make Newark the nation's top city for car thefts.
Some of Newark's young car thieves acknowledge that they strip off the most lucrative parts from cars they steal and sell them to drug dealers and unscrupulous auto shops. But many, like Monk, steal cars for the sheer thrill of it.
Local newspapers are often peppered with accounts of injuries and death resulting from accidents caused by youths in stolen cars. Many times, it is the car thief himself who is hurt or killed.
But the young thieves, who know full well the risks, shrug off such possibilities as something that happens to someone else.
"I drive, crash a couple of them, dump them and go get some more," said Monk, who is usually seen in baggy knee-length shorts, tattered T-shirts, sour sneakers and an eyeshade.
Shortly after 2 A.M. on a recent Saturday, teen-agers were playing "chase to kill" through an otherwise sleeping neighborhood. A Buick with Massachusetts license plates -- the driver said he had just stolen it -- sped off, its rear end fishtailing like a bass out of water. A Hyundai Sonata packed with four teen-agers raced to catch up.
But a miscalculation sent the Hyundai flying over the curb at a corner, creating a bath of sparks. After careering across the street, the car slammed against the curb, blowing out a front tire as smoke curled from under its hood and its windshield wipers started.
The teen-agers jumped out of the Hyundai and into the Buick, which had pulled alongside. In seconds, the Buick was gone.
Yelling, "everybody's going to drive tonight!" a 13-year-old boy called Sal-Dog ran to the Hyundai and drove it on the three good tires into a nearby school parking lot. Five minutes later, the Hyundai was a heap of smoking, dented sheet metal. Children ran from the parking lot with floor mats and a container of anti-freeze.
"It feels good," Sal-Dog said after his ride in the Hyundai. "You get this feeling like you are scared, like you feel high, like you're going to top over."
 
No Role Models And Little to Do
 Since 1986, Newark's car-theft rate has led other cities with populations of 50,000 or more. While the thefts have decreased here in the last two years, city officials and residents still wrestle with a reputation for a problem that remains at epidemic proportions.
The one thing Sal-Dog said he did not feel was remorse, excusing the epidemic by saying, "we take from other races."
Many of Newark's young people believe they are justified in stealing cars, explained Bernard James, a 26-year-old unemployed construction worker familiar with the lives of the youths, because the "rich thrive off the poor." And though the police say local black car owners are the major victims, in some of the city's harshest neighborhoods, rich is understood to mean white, suburban and able to afford an expensive car. Newark's car thieves are increasingly finding their prey in suburban towns, the police say.
Marie Sparks, mother of Demarko Sparks, an 18-year-old who was recently paroled after serving time for car theft, said she realized that stealing was wrong but understood the motivation. "This society is all about money," she said. "If you don't have any, you will do anything to get it. How can you blame them?
"How can we correct these kids when the ones like the mayors, police and politicians are doing all this dirty stuff?" she asked. "How can we expect these kids to do anything right?"
Many of the youths are for the most part raising themselves. They sleep by day and prowl by night far from the sight or guidance of parents. Many appear unkempt, malnourished and small for their ages. But almost every night they have the stamina to find the best examples of automotive science to make theirs for a night or two.
"I don't want a job, I just want to have fun," said Keekee, a 15-year-old eighth grader who says her greatest joy in life is stealing cars and riding them through her neighborhood.
Jackie Lawrence, president of the Newark chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, sees the roots of the problem as similar to the causes of drug abuse and other forms of juvenile crime. "What it has to do with is that our kids have nothing to do," she said. "There is so much energy within our young people today, and in Newark they don't have the proper outlets for all this energy."
Perhaps more disturbing, say police and city officials, is that there are hundreds of youngsters in Newark whose heroes spin the tires of stolen cars rather than lead classrooms, nations or even fast breaks on basketball courts.
Too many, say worried parents and youth counselors, want to be like Monk.
 
Struggle to Resist Strong Temptations
 Earlier this month, an 11-year-old boy who sat in a lawn chair in his yard to watch the car thieves driving their spoils said admiringly that when he got older he planned to start stealing cars, too.
He'd already picked out his first choice: a Mustang with a 5.0-liter engine, the most powerful of Ford's commercial line.
Bayyan Banks, who is 16, said he has watched a childhood friend and his friend's older brother grow up to be two of his neighborhood's most notorious car thieves. Resisting the allure of a stolen dream car has been difficult, he said.
"I couldn't do it because it would break my mother's heart," said the teen-ager, who plans to attend college and study automotive design next fall.
But when pressed, he confessed that there was another reason.
"When I was young I got in a car my friend stole," he said. "I couldn't really drive."
As he tried to drive the car down a narrow street near his home, he recalled, he panicked when he saw his friend's father driving toward him. "I didn't know enough to put the car in reverse, so I bumped into some cars then ran away.
"I was always terrified the police would come looking for me," he said. His mother, Carol Brooks, said she wanted to move her son and 14-year-old daughter out of the city, away from its influences. Mrs. Brooks said her first car was demolished in an accident involving a car thief being chased by the police.
"I told him, 'If I had a gun I would kill you,' " she recalled shouting as the thief was being arrested.
Although he refuses to steal cars, Mr. Banks has managed to retain the respect of his peers by making himself an expert on automotive technology. He studies popular car and consumer magazines and -- to maintain his part in conversations -- knows how to steal a car.
 
The Gathering Spot For Showing Off
 Almost every night, bands of teen-age thieves gather in several Newark locations for what youngsters call "car shows."
One of the most popular spots is along a two-lane stretch of Muhammad Ali Avenue between Bergen Street and Jelliff Avenue, just west of downtown, and the poorly lighted parking lot of nearby Harold Wilson School, a few blocks from where Mrs. Brooks and her family live.
Stolen cars from all over the region are brought here to be spun, raced and often banged and crashed to the delight of their drivers, fellow thieves and hangers-on along the sidewalks.
Imitating scenes in action films, the thieves make other people's cars howl and roar like wounded animals. High on their list are stunts called "figure eights" or "doughnuts," in which cars are made to spin leaving oval tire marks on the pavement, and "backward threes," three tight spins while driving in reverse.
Many also say they like to go "riding ghost," driving at night without headlights.
On a recent night, a shiny new red Honda Prelude rocketed down the slope of Muhammad Ali Avenue. At more than 60 miles an hour, the car -- filled with teen-agers, its stereo cassette deck thundering the latest "gangsta" rap, its air-conditioner blowing full gale -- almost separated from its wheels as it flew over a deep dip in the street.
As planned, the maneuver flung the car's passengers from their seats, teasing gravity and giving each an intoxicating moment that some said felt like weightlessness.
"It gets you 'suped,' " said Rahlude, a 13-year-old car thief, using the street slang for feeling super. Stealing late-model cars and playing "chase to kill" through his neighborhood "just makes you be happy," Rahlude said.
One night he was so happy, in fact, that he stole five cars in less than 12 hours.
 
Hiding Fear And Defying Police
 Jeffrey Fagan, a professor at Rutgers University's School of Criminal Justice, suggested that some of Newark's teen-age car thieves may be far from happy. "They are angry young men," he said, "and this behavior is a chance to get back at people making them angry. By and large, they can't own cars. These kids have channeled risk-taking and thrill-seeking into car theft."
Monk said that when he was arrested about a month ago for car theft his grandmother simply went to the city's juvenile authorities and took him home. "I got to go to court in a month," he said without concern.
Fear, or showing it, is anathema to car thieves whose reputations are based on daring and grace under pressure. To crash a car is humiliating, the teen-agers say. But when a young thief loses control of a car, as they often do, it is considered breaking the rules to show any emotion, even if a person is injured or killed.
"I never want to hurt anybody," said Easy E, an 18-year-old thief described by his peers as one of the best in the city. "It's the little boys who don't know what they're doing. That make it bad for everybody."
As he spoke, a Honda Accord whooshed past with a police cruiser in tight pursuit. Several thieves said in recent interviews that the Newark police still chase them despite a city policy prohibiting chases unless there is reason to believe that a stolen car has been involved in another, more serious crime.
If the police are reluctant to give chase, some young thieves say they try to provoke pursuit by ramming police cars. The cruisers are regarded as very slow, the thieves agree.
"I've done spins right in front of the cops," said Easy E, a charismatic high school senior who estimates that he has stolen about 200 cars in a three-year career. He says he enjoys taunting the police to chase him in road wars that risk arrest and jail time.
"It's a bad habit," he said. "But it feels good."

Many teen-agers, who still play with their bicycles, have made a life out of stealing cars. One, called Monk, said, "You can steal any car in the world if you know what to do."

HEADLINE: Report to Congress Opposes Synthetic Hormone in Cows

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 10

 BODY:
Congressional investigators said today that the Government should delay commercial approval of a genetically engineered hormone that increases milk production in cows until questions are resolved concerning its effects on people's health.
The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, said it agreed with most scientific opinion that synthetic bovine growth hormone wais not harmful because humans did not absorb or use the animal protein. 
 But in a report issued today, the accounting office said cows treated with the hormone had a higher incidence of mastitis, an inflammation of the udder that often requires use of more antibiotics, which could be harmful if passed on at high levels to consumers through milk and meat.
"Concern exists now about whether antibiotic levels in milk are already too high from present antibiotic usage," the report said.
 
Most Substances Not Tested
 Referring to another report it issued last week, the accounting office said Federal and state inspectors routinely tested milk for only 4 of the 82 drugs used to treat dairy cows. "We cannot conclude at present that the nation's milk supply has not already been contaminated by antibiotics beyond acceptable levels," the report said.
Until the issue of indirect human safety risks is resolved, the investigators said, the Food and Drug Administration should stop allowing the sale of food products from research animals getting synthetic growth hormone.
Gerald B. Guest, director of the F.D.A.'s Center for Veterinary Medicine, said the Government was studying the issue of growth hormone-treated cows and whether they required more antibiotic treatment because of mastitis and other conditions.
"We have not seen the entire G.A.O. report and will review its recommendations when we do," Dr. Guest said in an interview, "but from what we've heard, it has not raised any new questions we have not considered before."
There is no indication the food products from treated animals are significantly different from those from normal cows, Dr. Guest said, and no immediate reason to keep the products off the market or require that they have special labeling, as recommended by the General Accounting Office.
 
Allowed Since 1985
 The Food and Drug Administration has approved the research use of synthetic growth hormone, also known as bovine somatotropin, made by four biotechnology companies. The hormone increases milk production in cows from 10 to 25 percent and is being tested in more than 100 herds around the country, industry spokesmen say.
Since 1985, the agency has allowed the sale of milk and beef products from cows treated with the drug, but does not require that those products be labeled as coming from animals treated with the synthetic version of the naturally occurring hormone.
Use of the synthetic cow hormone has been opposed for years by some consumer groups, who fear unknown health consequences of its use, and advocates of family farming, who say increased milk production could reduce milk prices and drive small dairy farms out of business.
Jeremy Rifkin of the Foundation on Economic Trends, an organization critical of genetic engineering, said that on the basis of the study, his group would file a formal petition with the F.D.A. calling for the agency to halt sales of food products from treated animals immediately.
But Richard D. Godown, president of the Industrial Biotechnology Association, a trade association, disagreed with the major conclusions of the report, saying that current Government testing procedures were adequate.
Several members of Congress who requested the accounting office's report on the hormone said they were concerned that the F.D.A. had allowed marketing of food products from animals involved in research.
Representative John Conyers Jr., the Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the Government Operations Committee, called for an independent investigation of the potential risk of increased antibiotic levels in milk and beef because of the hormone use.
"I hope this report will cause an immediate stop in the marketing of food products" from bovine growth hormone treated animals, he said. Representative Ted Weiss, Democrat of Manhattan, said he was "profoundly disturbed by F.D.A.'s failure to adequately study the risk to consumers from antibiotic residues"

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Week;
To Republicans' Relief, Bush Hones Campaign

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 10

 BODY:
His speeches are getting sharper, more partisan, more laden with red-meat lines and tough-guy attitude. His surrogates are taking on Gov. Bill Clinton, the Democratic nominee, with more gusto and fewer stumbles. President Bush finally seems to be entering what he calls the campaign mode.
For his fellow Republicans, it is not a moment too soon. Mr. Bush's campaign has been a series of missed opportunities to make the case for a second term, but he cannot afford to fumble the next two weeks. The Republican National Convention begins Monday, and the most recent spate of polls shows Mr. Clinton still holding on to a formidable lead of about 20 points. By contrast, four years ago the Bush campaign had cut Michael S. Dukakis's lead from 17 percentage points to 7 in the three weeks between the conventions. 
 Republicans know that 1992 is a year of great swings in the polls, but they are ready for the next swing now, please.
After a month of anxiety and outbursts of outright despair, they do see a few reasons for hope. Some believe that Mr. Bush is finally beginning to energize the Republican base with his portrait of Mr. Clinton as a man just itching to cut the military, raise taxes, and turn the health-care system into some Kafkaesque Department of Motor Vehicles and Medical Procedures.
On the organizational front, some senior Republicans expect an official announcement by the end of this week that Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d is finally returning to the White House to oversee the campaign. "You can't go through the convention with this kind of uncertainty, and it will give a lift to insiders at least," said one Republican strategist close to the Administration.
Moreover, the buildup to the convention this week will highlight Mr. Bush in the role he likes best, Commander in Chief and world leader. He was meeting with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel today, after holding forth on Bosnia and Herzegovina over the weekend. These are far better images from Kennebunkport than the cigarette-boat-and-golf-cart pictures that some Republicans have come to dread in these angry, recessionary times.
There are risks, of course, to all these world issues, most notably Bosnia, where Mr. Bush has come under criticism for not responding forcefully enough. Still, foreign policy expertise is a hard card for the Governor of Arkansas to match; when quizzed about his preparation to be Commander in Chief today on the CBS News program "This Morning," Mr. Clinton found himself discussing his experience deploying the Arkansas National Guard, which is not quite the same thing.
So much for the good news for Mr. Bush.
Barring some unexpected catastrophe, this election will revolve around domestic, not foreign policy. Mr. Bush's difficulty in articulating a powerful, persuasive domestic agenda for a second term has haunted him throughout this campaign. Ironically, that vulnerability was highlighted in his recent television commercials; one was devoted to Mr. Bush talking about the balanced-budget amendment and the other to a general expression of commitment to the principles of strong families, fiscal responsibility and the fight against crime.
At a time when polls show close to 80 percent of the American people believe that the nation has gotten off on the wrong track, when unemployment and the nation's fundamental economic competitiveness are painfully sensitive issues at the grass roots, the commercials seemed a tad unfocused. A few Republicans, speaking on condition that they not be identified, spoke yearningly of the heyday four years ago of Roger Ailes, the former Bush media consultant who has never been accused of lacking focus or edge.
Another danger for Mr. Bush: While energizing the Republican base is essential, it is also not enough, as Mr. Dukakis learned in 1988 when he rallied Democrats in the final two weeks of his campaign but still lost in a landslide. Presidential elections, by and large, are won or lost in the political center. Mr. Bush appears to be taking a gamble that he can shore up his conservative support without paying a price for it among the voters in the center.
To wit, the draft of the Republican platform released today, which is an unmistakably conservative document. It reasserts, for example, the party's support for a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion, arguing, "We believe the unborn child has a fudndamental right to life which cannot be infringed."
Mr. Clinton, of course, has challenges and problems of his own. The Democrats have had the political winds at their back for the last four weeks, aided enormously by the withdrawal of Ross Perot, the success of the Democratic convention, the stumbles of the Bush campaign and a wave of bleak economic statistics. Now, however, Mr. Clinton will have to raise his game to a new level.
It is not simply the return of Mr. Baker, or the expected reorganization of the campaign, or the spotlight of the Republican convention and the almost inevitable bounce in the polls it will give Mr. Bush. It is simply this: For all Mr. Bush's difficulties, he is now entering "campaign mode," the time when he is ready, mentally, to fight, and becomes very, very dangerous.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
Clinton Says G.O.P. Conflict on Economy Promises Higher Deficit

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 10

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton asserted today that President Bush had abdicated responsibility for the nation's economic troubles and that conflict between the President and his fellow Republicans promised larger Federal budget deficits.
"President Bush says the buck stops somewhere else, and you ought to be afraid of my opponents that might even be worse than me," the Democratic Presidential nominee said at an afternoon rally outside Independence Hall here. 
 "It would be funny if it weren't so sad," Mr. Clinton said, "a Government moving from crisis to crisis, having its best moment in a crisis or two, but never with any vision, never with any plan, never with any direction, never with any responsibility, never with any courage for the future."
 
Alert for Signs of Weakness
 A week before the Republican National Committee convenes in Houston, Mr. Clinton is seizing on any signs of weakness in his opposition.
Today's opening was provided by a memorandum sent to the President on Friday by Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp and six Republican members of Congress urging Mr. Bush to include a call for tax cuts in the party platform.
Mr. Clinton said that such a move would drive the deficit higher and that voters should force Mr. Bush to say where he stood on the proposal. Mr. Clinton said such measures would "recreate the Reagan revolution" by eliminating the capital gains tax.
"They want another round of tax cuts for the wealthy," the Governor said. "They want to add $430 billion more to the deficit" over five years."
 
Shifting Spotlight
 Mr. Clinton has spent the last few days trying to force Mr. Bush into corners on both foreign and domestic policy matters. On Sunday, he marshaled Democratic leaders in Congress to chastise the White House on its stand on the civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Today, the spotlight was on the flagging economy, where the Clinton camp would like to see it remain.
Responding to Republican attacks on Mr. Clinton's economic proposals, sent today in a three-page statement to reporters, Mr. Clinton's campaign released 10 pages of information and official statements.
The Republican statement read, "Clinton unabashedly proposes the largest tax increase in American history," and said the Democratic nominee's call for increased investment was a "code word for more Government spending."
"Clinton's bus tour isn't finished yet," Senator Phil Gramm of Texas said in the statement. "The next stop is deep in the heart of taxes."
George Stephanopoulos, the communications director for the Clinton campaign, called the Republican statement a "concerted, if pathetic, assault" and "exactly what you would expect from people who have no plan to get the economy moving again."
And Mr. Clinton, in a two-hour appearance with his running mate, Senator Al Gore of Tennessee on the CBS News program "This Morning," said criticism of his economic plan came from "people who don't believe investment leads to growth."
Those critics, he said, "are the same people who got us into this fix right now."
In what is becoming a trademark attack-and-response tactic for the Democrats' campaign, Mr. Clinton also used his speech here to anticipate new Republican criticism of the Clinton-Gore ticket.
"Now, building up to their convention in Houston, they're going to tell you every reason in the wide world why you ought to be afraid of Al Gore and Bill Clinton," the Governor said to thousands of people who attended the rally here. "Let me tell you something, in my little state, we've created almost as many private-sector jobs in the last three years as he has in the entire United States of America."
The Clinton organization has said that as Governor Mr. Clinton helped create 90,000 private jobs in Arkansas since Mr. Bush took office. The Bush Administration, it said, has been responsible for creating only 100,000 new private sector jobs nationally in that period.
Noting that he was speaking at the same site former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California used to begin his Presidential campaign earlier this year, Mr. Clinton strayed from his standard campaign speech to emphasize his plan for changing the way campaigns are financed.
Mr. Clinton has integrated talk of "reform" into his overall call for change and now says Mr. Bush is trying to convince Americans that they should be "afraid" of change.
"When the Republicans raise the old flag of fear, you tell them, 'No thanks. This time we're going to vote on our hopes,' " Mr. Clinton said today. "When they tell you Al Gore and Bill Clinton propose crazy ideas and we can make things worse, you tell them, 'No thanks, we're going to make things better.' When they sell you on a blame game, you say, 'Mr. Bush, you haven't even said how you stand on your party's own plans for economic growth.' "

HEADLINE: Barnes & Noble Plans $100 Million Stock Sale

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON

 BODY:
Barnes & Noble, the nation's second-largest bookseller, disclosed plans yesterday to sell more than $100 million in common stock to help finance an aggressive expansion of both its "super stores" and its mall outlets.
Barnes & Noble Inc., a private company, plans to sell 6.87 million shares, or about 36 percent of its stock, at about $15 a share, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It will also issue $170 million in new debt. 
 With 869 stores nationwide, Barnes & Noble operates booksellers under several names, including its own and B. Dalton. Second in size only to Waldenbooks, which is owned by the Kmart Corporation, Barnes & Noble has grown in recent years far beyond its flagship Manhattan store at 18th Street and Fifth Avenue.
 
A Financial Opportunity
 Mitchell Clipper, Barnes & Noble's chief financial officer, said the stock and debt plan would allow the bookstore chain to take advantage of low interest rates and high stock prices to finance expansion.
"There's an opportunity here," Mr. Clipper said . "We want to take advantage of it."
Under the recapitalization, the company will issue 5.5 million shares of stock in the United States and Canada, and an additional 1.37 million overseas. A further 6.06 million shares will be exchanged for existing preferred stock and subordinated debt, and 3.75 million shares will be sold to Leonard Riggio, the company's chairman, and to Vendex International, a Dutch retailer.
The company plans to use the proceeds from the $170 million in new debt to retire more than $130 million in B. Dalton notes and to pay more than $19 million in unpaid dividends and interest.
Mr. Riggio and Vendex are currently 50-50 owners of the company's privately controlled stock, and the recapitalization will reduce their holdings to 32 percent of the common stock each.
Mr. Riggio bought Barnes & Noble in 1971 and is given credit for pioneering discount bookselling on a large scale. In 1986, when he had 35 stores in the New York City area, he acquired B. Dalton, which was the nation's second-largest chain, for about $300 million.
In the following years, Barnes & Noble also acquired Doubleday Book Shops and Scribner's Bookstores.
Recently, book sales at Barnes & Noble have been growing faster than profits. Mr. Clipper attributed that to the overhead costs involved in opening new stores.
The company's revenues increased from $880 million in 1990 to $920 million in 1991, he said. But for the 52-week-period that ended on Feb. 2, Barnes & Noble recorded a loss of $371,000. In the quarter that ended May 2, the loss ballooned to $9.4 million.
"It's up-front costs, the costs involved in opening a lot of new stores," Mr. Clipper said. "You get it back at the end of the year."
At present, the company operates 68 super stores, which average 15,000 square feet each and carry 100,000 titles, compared with 3,000 square feet and 10,000 titles in most of its 770 mall stores. It also operates a mail-order business and 31 other retail stores.
The common stock offering will be made through Morgan Stanley & Company; Dillon, Read & Company; Paine Webber Inc., and S. G. Warburg Securities.

HEADLINE: Car Buyers Turn Back to Detroit

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 10

 BODY:
Suzanne Welsh, a clerical worker from Buena Park, Calif., had no intention of trading in her 1989 Toyota Camry, but her brother-in-law's new Saturn started her thinking.
"I've had three Japanese cars in a row, and I started to feel real guilty," she said. 
 Ms. Welsh recently decided to buy a Saturn, built in Spring Hill, Tenn., by the General Motors Corporation.
Two years ago, the Saturn was not on the market. This year, nearly 7 percent of all small cars sold in the United States are Saturns.
Chalk up a victory for the much-maligned American auto industry. After years of affection for Japanese and European brands, many hard-core import buyers are switching to American makes. That is helping the Big Three to reverse years of declining profits, and more recently steep losses, and putting foreign rivals somewhat on the defensive. In the recent quarter, the Detroit auto makers all reported vastly improved financial results.
 
Younger Buyers

 Among those turning to American brands are younger buyers, many of whom may never before have owned a car from the Big Three.
In the 1980's, many younger, well educated, affluent people were taken with imports like the BMW, the Volvo and the new Japanese luxury lines: the Acura from Honda, the Infiniti from Nissan and the Lexus from Toyota. But there now seems to be a growing recognition that some models built by American companies, like the Saturn and the Ford Explorer, a large sport utility vehicle, offer quality that is close to comparable Japanese and European models at prices that are significantly lower.
"Facts about quality and value have led to some powerful rethinking of domestics versus imports," said Madelyn Hochstein, president of DYG Inc., a research firm in Elmsford, N.Y.
And Richard Lepley, senior vice president of sales and marketing for the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation in Cypress, Calif., said of the Big Three, "They're making better cars, no question about it."
 
 
Sunroof Patriots
 What is more, buying from Detroit is perceived as patriotic, a bulwark for the nation against a flood of foreign cars.
Consider Carol Miller, 40, a teacher from Canton, Mich., and a new fan of Ford. "I have done nothing but put down Ford in the past because of two bad cars I had in 1981 and 1982," she said. "We started feeling guilty for owning a 1991 Nissan Stanza because family members worked for the auto companies. I bought a Ford Escort, which I love because I get 40 miles to the gallon."
Buying American brands does not necessarily guarantee that jobs will be kept in this country. Some Escorts, for example, are made in Mexico, and many of Chrysler's mini-vans come from Canada.
Besides the Saturn and Explorer, other models enjoying new popularity include the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Cadillac Seville STS. Vehicles like these from the Big Three are drawing buyers away from Japanese-made rivals like the Acura Integra, the Isuzu Trooper, the Nissan Maxima and the Lexus LS400, all made in Japan.
Eighty percent of Saturn buyers said they would not have considered another General Motors car, the company reports, and 50 percent had not planned to buy an American make.
Detroit is heartened that years of cost-cutting and improving productivity finally seem to be paying off. During the first half of 1992, Ford, G.M. and Chrysler together grabbed a 71.9 percent share of the 6.5 million cars and trucks sold in the United States, an increase of 1.7 percentage points from a year earlier.
That was the first time since 1988 that American auto makers' market share increased as Japan's share dipped. And those fractional gains have meant the difference between a profit and a loss.
This year, the Ford Taurus could surpass the Honda Accord as the biggest seller in America, the first time in three years a car built by the Big Three would hold the top spot. Taurus appeals to buyers with families -- baby boomers with children.
Honda, in fact, recently decided for the second time in a year to trim car production at its two plants in Ohio.
 
 
Wide Range of Prices
 The buyers turning to American brands seem to be from many income groups, judging from the price ranges of the popular brands, from the $10,000 Saturn to the Seville STS, which can cost $45,000 or more.
Yet Mr. Lepley of Mitsubishi contends that the recent wave of purchases is by less affluent consumers, who are traditionally more loyal to domestic brands than the average buyer. "They tend to hold onto their cars longer, and we're now in a part of the automotive cycle when many of them are trading," he said.
If he is right, sustaining the trend could be tricky. What is more, Detroit's popular models are more than matched by its laggards. While G.M. and Ford are already making all the Saturns and Explorers they can without opening new assembly lines, some Big Three models are badly trailing in important market segments.
It is unclear whether Japanese rivals will counterattack. American auto makers expect them to up the ante with new models and more cost-cutting. Japanese car makers could also increase their sales immediately by selling to buyers for rental fleets or offering cash rebates -- practices they have resisted.
One catalyst for this turnabout has been Detroit's argument that spending money on American cars will help fortify employment and national prosperity. That argument is not new, but it comes as consumers have less reason to be fearful that they will be stuck with a lemon.
"We're seeing not just a buy-America attitude, but an attitude that says let's give American products a chance," said John Middlebrook, general manager of G.M.'s Pontiac division. "We're getting a shot at people we haven't seen for years."
Buy-American fervor peaked in January during President Bush's trade mission to Japan. Big Three executives charged that Japan's trade imbalance had contributed to the recession, though many economists argue that American auto makers have themselves to blame for losing customers to Japanese franchises.
 "I know buy-America is working because of the number of people who come in and say, 'I like your buy-America advertising; the flags got us thinking about American cars," said Doug Alverson, a salesman at Young Pontiac-Cadillac-Saab in Escandido, Calif.
Japanese auto makers are working to neutralize the national origin of cars as a factor in consumers' decisions about what to buy. They take pains to point out that they build cars in United States plants. And they have been publicizing more aggressively their role as employers, parts buyers and contributors to American education, art and charity. Honda and Toyota have each produced advertising featuring workers at their plants in Ohio and Kentucky.
 
 
Imports Suffer in California
 Japanese companies contend that their drop in market share may be no more than a temporary pause caused by the uneven economic recovery. Honda executives, for instance, say sales of their cars have been disproportionately depressed by economic weakness in California, a stronghold for Honda and other import lines.
Yet the American car's revitalization is notable in California, the front line of the Big Three's campaign to win back customers.
 In San Diego County, for example, registrations of Pontiacs rose 87 percent in the first three months of the year, while registrations of Hondas and Toyotas declined. Behind the rise: advertising bought collectively by Pontiac dealers compared the Pontiac Grand Am SE with the Honda Accord LX and Toyota Camry LE, which are both slightly larger. The ads also emphasized price, noting that when comparably equipped, the Grand Am costs $14,832, compared with $17,230 for the Accord and $18,488 for the Camry.
"Imports have gone up in price twice as fast as domestics," said Ronald Glantz, an automotive analyst for Dean Witter, who studies pricing trends. His research showed that the average imported vehicle sold during the first quarter cost $19,411, compared with $16,666 for the average domestic. Since last year, the average import rose $1,734 in price, while the average domestic increased $822.
Japanese auto makers have been forced to raise prices for several reasons. The dollar's weakness against the yen has made products from Japan more expensive for Americans. The collapse of stock prices in Tokyo and the decline in Japanese real estate values has hurt auto sales in Japan, forcing that nation's auto makers to raise prices overseas to bring in more revenue.
Finally, pressure resulting from protectionist sentiment in Washington has led Japan to reduce its "voluntary" car exports to 1.65 million, from 2.3 million. Fewer exports may prompt the Japanese to increase production at American plants, but in the short term may limit the supply of some models, forcing prices up.
 Though Asian brands still dominate the top ranks of the influential J. D. Power & Associates annual survey of owners about auto quality, domestic brands have been earning much higher marks. The average number of reported problems for all brands, foreign and domestic, has fallen consistently for the last four years to 125 per 100 new cars, from 177 per 100 new cars.
"Quality differences are minimal any more," said Joel Pitcoff, a Ford research specialist. Therefore, "fewer people go directly to the import store without considering domestic alternatives."
He added, "The problem all along was, we weren't getting people to consider our products."

HEADLINE: Dinkins Offers Loan Plan For Businesses

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
New York City yesterday announced a plan to help small and medium-sized businesses by reducing the risks faced by banks that make loans to them.
The program represents a sharp change in the way the city has supported small business, which is considered vital to producing jobs. 
 In recent years, the city has maintained a fund of $10 million to make loans directly to such businesses. But under the new plan, it would dedicate half that fund to insuring bank loans, partly covering any losses the banks may have and presumably creating incentives for them to lend far more.
 
Support for Small Business
 The plan, announced by Mayor David N. Dinkins and the city's highest ranking economic development officials at City Hall, underscores the influence of Barry Sullivan, the retired bank chairman who was appointed Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development earlier this year. Mr. Sullivan has made city support for small business a priority.
Until recently, the city has geared most of its incentive efforts, ranging from energy subsidies to tax abatements, toward large corporations.
The new program will try to persuade banks "to open their doors, and their wallets, to more small business," said Mayor Dinkins, who described the program a "true public-private effort."
Under the plan, the city said its $5 million will be used to match contributions made by borrowers and the banks themselves in setting up a Small Business Reserve Fund, that would, in effect, guarantee at least 10 percent of the loans.
For instance, on a $100,000 loan, the lender and the borrower would each be asked to put $2,500 aside in the fund. The city would then match the $5,000 total. If the loan was not repaid, the $10,000 in the reserve fund would go to the bank.
Over time banks are expected to build up their contributions to the fund. They would then be allowed to use any surplus to recover up to the full amount of some delinquent loans.
Ultimately, city officials said, the fund could stimulate as much as $100 million in loans to small and medium- sized businesses.
So far, no banks have been selected to participate, but the city said several, including Chemical Bank, Apple Bank, Citibank and Chase Manhattan have expressed interest.
"Bankers are extremely enthusiastic about this idea," said Carol Parry, manager-director for community development at Chemical Bank. If it succeeds, she added, the program would "create a level of comfort among banks in making loans that in the past have been considered too risky."
Carl Weisbrod, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, said the city would seek 10 banks to participate in the program, and would make its selections based upon how aggressive the lenders promise to be in working with small businesses.
 
Select Banks by Oct. 1
 He said the city would select the banks by Oct. 1, and hoped lending would begin under the new program by Jan. 1.
For banks in the program, the reserve fund would represent a cushion, and limit their losses in lending to the kinds of small and mid-sized businesses that have in the past had high rates of failure, and therefore been considered credit risks.
If the program succeeds in prompting a large enough volume of new loans, participating banks will have set aside enough money in the reserve fund that they can recoup all of their losses on occasional loans that sour, officials said.
The program is patterned after a somewhat similar one in Michigan, where that state's Department of Commerce began building the Michigan Strategic Fund in 1987. In an interview yesterday, Mark Morante, the director of the Michigan program, said 80 banks were now participating, and $25 million in financing had been extended to small businesses.
"We consider it a great success," said Mr. Morante, adding that only 5 percent of the money loaned out by banks in the Michigan program had been lost through defaults, and the bank losses were fully covered with money available in the Strategic Fund.
But he added that one shortfall of the Michigan program was that participating banks had in some cases held to conservative lending policies, and turned down applications by promising small companies, even though their losses were limited.
"The key issue is whether banks can adopt a new and more aggressive philosophy of risk management," he said.
If it succeeds, the New York City program could rival the Small Business Administration in financing for small and medium-sized businesses. The Federal agency, which underwrote tens of millions of dollars in New York City loans last year, guarantees banks that it will compensate them for up to 85 percent of loans that they make to qualifying small businesses when those businesses default.
City officials and bankers said the city's program would offer advantages over the system employed by the Small Business Administration. One is that nonprofit organizations, which do not qualify for financing by the Federal agency, would qualify in the city's program.
Another is that the city's program would require less red tape than the Federal Government. Indeed, Mr. Sullivan said yesterday that the program was designed to give banks as much freedom as possible to control their lending, but would give them a financial nudge to take more risks.
"We are letting the experts make the loans," he said. Nonetheless, if the program succeeds, "we are going to make it a bit easier."
Although the city has traditionally deemed businesses with under 100 employees or less than $10 million in annual sales to be "small" -- thereby qualifying for consideration in small business lending -- it said it would let the banks define what they consider a small or medium-sized business. One catch for businesses that hope to apply for financing under the new program is that their borrowing costs are almost certain to be higher than for companies that qualify for more conventional bank loans. That is because of their contributions to the reserve fund, and those of the banks.
As is customary in banking, experts said the borrowers would pay their own costs as well as those incurred by lenders. Although few expect borrowers to make up-front cash payments for their loans, the reserve fund costs will be financed, requiring them to take out larger loans.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Yield on 30-Year U.S. Bond At Lowest Level in 5 1/2 Years

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell yesterday to its lowest level in five and a half years, and now investors and dealers are waiting to see if this week's three big Treasury auctions will knock this rally in bond prices off the track.
But if that does not happen, long-term interest rates are moving into a new zone, a level not seen for decades. Some analysts predict that rates could fall to 7 percent by the end of the year, the lowest they have been since the early 1970's. 
 "The generation that is investing now has to get used to it," said Lawrence C. Waldorf, the portfolio manager at First Investors Management Company.
Pat Rothstein, managing director at Merrill Lynch Government Securities Inc., said, "The only bearish thing I can say about the market is that I can't think of anything bearish."
In secondary trading of Treasury securities, the yield on the bond due in 2021 fell to 7.36 percent, the lowest level since early January in 1987. The previous low had been the 7.38 percent hit in January of this year. Since July, the yield on the long bond is down four-tenths of a percentage point.
The market is being driven higher by several factors, including the slow growth of the economy, the belief that short-term rates will not turn up for some time, and the good data on inflation, which continues to remain low.
In addition, a lot of investors are selling mortgage-backed securities because of the fear of losses from early prepayments of existing mortgages. Now that long-term rates have fallen so sharply, homeowners are refinancing their mortgages. The cash from these sales is being plowed back into the longer end of the Treasury market, traders said.
The unemployment data for July, released Friday, added fuel to the rally that began in July, when the June employment data indicated that the economy might even be in for another dip. The July data confirms there is some growth but so sluggish that investors are more confidently shedding the two usual worries of a recovery: rising inflation and rising short-term interest rates.
The fall of long-term rates would be of some relief to the Federal Reserve Board, whose sharp cuts in short-term rates have yet to enliven the economy in any convincing way. The chairman of the Fed, Alan Greenspan, has complained that the high level of long rates is inhibiting the recovery.
The rally yesterday was across the board. In the auction for three- and six-month bills, the average discount rates fell sharply after rising for two weeks. The 3.13 percent discount rate for the three-month bill was the lowest since Feb. 14, 1992. The 3.19 percent on the six-month bill was the lowest since July 1, 1963.
 
Something Perplexing
 Mr. Rothstein said a rally just before the three big Treasury auctions was a bit perplexing. He said the dealers would have liked the market to fall a little bit because that gives them more flexibility in bidding in the auction. But he added: "I think if the market stays strong all through the refunding something else will have to knock the market back. But I don't know what will do it."
On Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, the Treasury will auction $36 billion in 3- and 10-year notes, and 30-year bonds. Some dealers are worried that this huge new supply of Treasury securities could weigh down a market that is already very heady.
"You will need some continued good news to continue this," one trader said. He argued that there could a sharp correction downward in the market after the auctions. But others were less worried, especially about the three-year auction today.
Several traders said they expected the three-year auction to go well because banks have been buying a lot of three-year notes recently. The banks are not finding a lot of loans to make and the yield on three-year notes of around 4.5 percent is a lot better than on the average money market fund, which is around 3 percent.
These traders said that this demand has left a lot of the dealers with few or no three-year notes, and that they will want to replenish their stocks.
In the pre-auction, or when-issued, market yesterday, the new three-year note was trading at a yield of 4.66 percent, down from 4.71 percent on Friday.
In the 10-year, auction, which is Wednesday, and the 30-year auction on Thursday, the outlook is not as clear. One reason is the inflation data due on Wednesday and Thursday. If the actual numbers for the Producer Price Index and the Consumer Price Index are much higher than consensus forecasts, investors could suddenly be less interested in these longer-term securities.
A trader who said he expected the inflation data to be positive and the auctions to go well did say there could be a brief period of indigestion after the auction when the prices fall and yields rise. But then the market should resume its rally, he said.
In the pre-auction market, the new 30-year bond was offered at a yield of 7.32 percent, down from 7.36 percent on Friday. In the secondary market, the current bond due in 2011, was offered at 107 5/8, up 13/32 to yield 7.36 percent, compared with 7.39 percent on Friday.
The 10-year note was traded at 6.48 percent, down from 6.54 percent on Friday. While there is no price in the pre-auction market, a decline in yield means that the security is rising in value.
Traders said that yesterday's rally began overnight in Tokyo and continued in the morning trading in New York and then the market was quiet for the rest of the day. A lot of the buying, one trader said, was by investors and institutions that had not joined in the buying on Friday and, therefore, were in short supply of Treasury securities and worried about missing a rally.
Following are the results from yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: Stock Prices Close Mixed in a Lazy Session

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks were mixed yesterday in one of the year's laziest sessions. Traders found few insights on the economy and kept a close eye on the bond market.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which traded mostly lower throughout the day, moved ahead in the final minutes to close up 5.40 points at 3,337.58. That small gain came after the Dow lost 61.60 points last week. 
 In the broader market, declining issues led advancers 6 to 5 on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume was extremely light, with 142.5 million shares trading hands -- the second slowest session of the year. The quietest session of 1992 was on March 20, when volume came to 134.17 million. On Friday, 190.6 million shares changed hands.
 
Bond Prices Soar on Jobs Data
 No major economic reports were released during the session to drive trading in either direction. On the corporate front, none of the day's developments seemed to affect the overall market.
Stock analysts instead were examining developments in the bond market following last week's strong rally, said Steven Van Brunt, assistant vice president for equity trading at Nikko Securities Co. International.
Bond prices soared and yields fell after release of the July employment report, which showed the jobless rate fell slightly to 7.7 percent but also indicated that the economy grew little over all.
A strong bond market makes stock analysts nervous because they believe investors may decide to shift their cash out of stocks and into bonds. Late in the day, the Treasury's 30-year bond was up 3/8 point while its yield fell to 7.36 percent.
Deepening troubles in the Japanese stock market had little effect on the United States markets, analysts said.
 
Navistar Down, McDonnell Up
 Navistar was among the session's most actively traded issues, down 1/8 at 2 1/8. The Chicago truck maker has angered union members with plans to cut health insurance benefits, and workers said they planned to picket a meeting of management today.
McDonnell Douglas gained 2 1/4, to 37 5/8, after it announced a broad corporate restructuring. The St. Louis company said it planned to consolidate its six military contracting units into two, seek a partner or buyer for its helicopter company, and close a plant in Columbus, Ohio.
The most active Big Board issues were Texas Utilities, up 1/4 at 42 3/4, and Nationsbank, down 1/2 at 45 1/4.
Technology issues faced another mixed session.
Storage Technology sank 6 1/8, or 18 percent, to 27 1/4. The computer memory maker said last week that it was delaying introduction of a new product.
Hewlett-Packard fared better, up 1 5/8 at 60 1/2. Yesterday's buying followed Friday's plunge -- 12 5/8, to 58 7/8 -- when the computer maker said third-quarter earnings would fall below analysts' expectations.
In other technology issues, I.B.M. was up 1 3/8, to 88 1/2; Kyocera, fell 1 1/2, to 54 1/4, and Matsushita, was off 1 1/2 to 93 1/2.
Among widely held issues, Coca-Cola gained 1/2, to 43 1/8; Citicorp dropped 3/4, to 18 7/8, and General Motors rose 7/8, to 37 7/8.

Procter & Gamble Earnings Rose 12% in Latest Quarter

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
The Procter & Gamble Company reported yesterday that fiscal fourth-quarter net income increased 12 percent, saying that a gain from the sale of its Italian coffee business was offset by heavy spending for new products in Europe.
For the quarter ended June 30, the consumer-products company earned $339 million, or 46 cents a share, compared with $304 million, or 41 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Sales advanced 6.6 percent, to $7.17 billion from $6.72 billion. 
 "It was weaker than expected," said Diane L. Mustain, an analyst with Duff & Phelps Inc. in Chicago. Indeed, earnings were about a penny below analysts' consensus estimate of 47 cents a share.
Shares of P.& G. eased 62.5 cents, to $49.25, yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Analyst: U.S. Lines 'Subpar'
 Ms. Mustain noted that without the one-time $61 million gain on the sale of the coffee business, earnings would have lagged behind expectations.
But Joseph Kozloff, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, said the underlying quality of Procter & Gamble's earnings was a little stronger than the numbers indicated. He said that because of the windfall from the sale of the coffee business, the company spent heavily to introduce Always feminine-protection pads in Europe and some laundry detergents.
"They are implying they are managing their earnings stream," Mr. Kozloff said.
Still, Mr. Kozloff called the fourth-quarter performance in the United States "subpar." He said the weak economy hurt the company's shipments, which he calculated declined 2 percent. "Everybody is having a tough time in the United States," he said.
He said P.&G.'s overall volume grew 4 percent, with international shipments rising 12 percent.
For fiscal 1992, P.& G.'s profits grew 5.6 percent, to $1.87 billion, or $2.62 a share, from $1.77 billion, or $2.46 a share, in fiscal 1991. Sales climbed 8.6 percent, to $29.36 billion from $27.03 billion.
Procter and Gamble's chairman and chief executive, Edwin L. Artzt, said, "This was a year of solid growth." After a slow start, the company's earnings grew an average of 10 percent over the last three quarters, he said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar and Gold Are Mixed In Absence of Trading News

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed against other major currencies yesterday, rising overseas and then falling in New York in the absence of any news to move the market.
Gold prices were also mixed. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid of $350 an ounce, off $1, after gold had risen 10 cents, to $350.40 an ounce, on the New York Commodity Exchange. Analysts said there was little news to affect the market. 
 Charles Cossentino, a vice president for foreign exchange at the Deutsche Genossenschaftsbank, said the dollar fell in thin trading as investors cautiously watched the Federal Reserve for possible intervention on the dollar's behalf.
The Fed entered the market at least three times on Friday, buying dollars in an attempt to bolster the sagging currency.
Stephen Flanagan, vice president at the Mitsubishi Bank, said the market saw "a steady stream of mark buying and dollar selling that will continue unless the Federal Reserve intervenes again."
Traders were marking time in anticipation of fresh news on the economy. The Government's producer price index is to be released tomorrow and retail sales figures for July are due out Thursday.
The financial markets are waiting to see if the new figures indicate any strength in the economy. If the nation appears on its way to recovery, the Fed will be under less pressure to nudge interest rates lower. The dollar, like all currencies, draws support from higher rates.
The dollar rose to 127.90 yen in New York yesterday from late Friday's 127.45. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar closed at 127.92 yen, down .03 yen from Friday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 128.05 yen.
The British pound gained ground against the dollar in New York, rising to $1.9315 from late Friday's $1.9295. Earlier in London, the pound fell to $1.9268 from $1.9290.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's quotes, included: 1.4630 German marks, down from 1.4680; 1.3130 Swiss francs, down from 1.3150.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Building Stocks Wither in Tokyo

BYLINE: By James Sterngold

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
WITH just about everything else failing, the Japanese Government is now pinning its hopes on the construction industry to winch the ailing economy and stock market out of their deepening ruts. The idea is to pour tens of billions of dollars into public works, like roads, sewage plants and bridges, on the theory that the employment and orders from construction companies will give the economy a sorely needed lift.
For a while, that had made various construction-related shares the darlings of the stock market. But in a sign of the depth of the market's malaise, even that sector is now looking worn out. Investors seem to find every piece of news just another excuse to run for the exits. 
 It is also a sign, some analysts say, that the market is not just out of steam, but out of ideas. None of the old tricks, like finding "theme stocks," seem to be working.
As of the end of last week, construction-industry stocks had fallen about 38 percent over the last 52 weeks, compared with a 34.6 percent decline for the overall market in the same period, according to John Baldwin, an analyst here with Jardine Fleming Securities.
But over the last 26 weeks, construction stocks have dropped 36 percent, while the market has fallen 27.4 percent. And over the last 13 weeks, construction stocks have tumbled 26.5 percent, while the market has lost 14 percent.
"If anything, these stocks have held up longer than I would have expected," said Hugh Conaway, an analyst who follows the Japanese construction industry at Baring Securities here. "These stocks may be near bottom, but they're not ready to be bought yet, not for another six months."
The Japanese Government's budget for the current fiscal year had already been fattened with a heavy load of public-works spending, in part to satisfy American trade negotiators. The hope was that with some stimulus to demand at home, Japanese exporters would be more inclined to sell their products domestically, thus moderating Japan's huge trade surplus.
Then, Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa had announced at the end of March that his Government would be front-loading this year's public-works spending by signing about 75 percent of the contracts in the first half, giving the economy a little extra jolt. The market continued to slump.
So two weeks ago, the Government said it was preparing a supplementary budget, to be formally announced in September, that would increase public-works spending by as much as $55 billion.
The market's response? Stock prices on Monday fell to their lowest levels since March 1986, with the Nikkei index of 225 issues temporarily cracking through the 15,000 level.
As Peter Sanborn, a construction industry analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities, noted, the decline in the construction stocks may be in defiance of Government plans, but it is not irrational. In a recent report, he wrote that investors were responding to the trend in Japanese public-works spending, which typically soars at first, only to drop off sharply once the economy recovers.
Profits decline with the loss of Government contracts. Investors, he said, are just getting out in front of an expected lowering of Government public-works spending in coming years, especially when the economy begins to perk up.
"There is a real danger that interest in public-works stocks will shift abruptly with mounting confidence in an economic turnaround," Mr. Sanborn wrote.
The economic signs these days augur ill, but most analysts expect an upturn sometime next year. And that has provided investors yet another excuse to shed the so-called counter-cyclical stocks that were supposed to hold up when everything else looked gloomy.
Shares in Kajima, for instance, a leading construction company, have fallen 12.6 percent since July 1, to 750 yen on Monday. Shimizu, another big construction concern, has tumbled 10.6 percent since July 1, to 805 yen.
Nippon Hodo, Japan's largest road builder, has seen its shares plummet 28.7 percent in the same period, to 1,790 yen on Monday.
Even Obayashi Road, another top road builder whose shares Mr. Sanborn recommends, has seen its stock price tumble more than 14 percent over the last six weeks, to 1,840 yen on Monday.
Mr. Conaway of Baring Securities attributed much of the misery in the construction sector to the fact that private orders have collapsed because of a plunge in corporate investment.
While Government contracts once made up half of the industry's orders, they now make up only about 30 percent. This shift is a result of the private construction boom over the last six years, he said. As a result, investors are looking at the promise of tens of billions of dollars more in Government public-works spending not as a boon, but as the minimum necessary to keep the industry from suffering an even deeper recession.
"The problem now is that if we don't get 6 or 7 trillion yen in extra public-works spending this year, you'll see a real drop," Mr. Conaway said. "That's the minimum we need just to keep the sector going really."

HEADLINE: Why Stop at a Flatter Tax?

 BODY:
Seven leading Republican conservatives, led by Housing Secretary Jack Kemp, are pushing President Bush to adopt a bold plan to slash taxes. In a memo they warn: "We can't keep promising the American people that patience will lead to prosperity. We must show them that we have a set of principles and a plan to dramatically expand economic growth, job creation and entrepreneurial capitalism."
To that end, the group proposes a "flatter, lower, simpler" tax code. Exciting rhetoric. But shopworn specifics. The seven would have been better off going all the way to Jerry Brown's flat tax proposal. The California Democrat's plan, though flawed, was at least bold. 
 The Republicans would lower marginal tax rates by 3 percentage points. That's hardly revolutionary, coming only a few years after Congress, prodded by Mr. Kemp, cut the top tax rate by more than 20 points. The memo signers also propose raising the personal exemption to $6,000, which alone wouldn't spur entrepreneurs or anyone else.
The memo becomes slightly more venturesome when it proposes to eliminate capital gains taxes on long-term investments and to insulate capital gains taxes, and some corporate deductions, against inflation. But the plan, illogically, stops short of applying the same correction to inflated deductions that investors are allowed for borrowing costs. Nor does the memo analyze costs. Under this Alice-in-Wonderland scenario, Congress would declare tax holidays without raising anyone else's tax or gutting Federal spending.
The plan's piecemeal tactics don't measure up to its lofty objectives. Imagine, for example, a tax code that would reward saving and investment, penalize consumption and protect the poor. A tax code that would integrate corporate and personal taxes to eliminate double taxation of investment income. A tax code that would wipe out nearly every deduction and exemption except those targeted for the poor. A tax code that would apply a single rate across the board.
Sound familiar? If the Republicans wanted boldness, all they had to do was adapt Mr. Brown's plan, correcting its glaring but remediable errors. That could produce a plan that's truly pro-growth. This memo is, by comparison, mere tinkering.

HEADLINE: African-Americans Can't Win Justice in the Two-Party System

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Black Demagogues and Pseudo-Scholars" (Op-Ed, July 20), Henry Louis Gates Jr., a professor of English and chairman of the Afro-American studies department at Harvard University, describes "anti-Semitism as a weapon in the raging battle of who will speak for black America." He is right: there is a power struggle going on over who will lead the black community. And anti-Semitism is being exploited by both sides: the nationalists who court the black community by showing how much they dislike Jews, and the assimilationists who like to show off their special relationship to Jews.
What Mr. Gates doesn't make clear is the vantage point from which he writes about this fight for leadership of the African-American community. He is very much in this struggle. 
 None of these would-be leaders dare to tell the truth: There can be no solution to poverty, police brutality, inadequate schools, drug-generated violence and indifferent health care within the existing political structure. Racism and the two-party system are married to each other.
The African-American people must lead the fight to change the system. That fight cannot be effectively waged or won without including the tens of millions of other people who have watched the American dream go down the tubes. (Ask the 30 million dissatisfied white folks who eagerly accepted Ross Perot's invitation to dump the major parties, and then got dumped themselves when he realized that with the center-right consolidation of the Democratic Party personified by Bill Clinton and Al Gore, he could safely retire from politics.)
Given the profoundly antipoor and explicitly antiblack posture of the major parties, the issue of who will lead the black community is indeed crucial. But the struggle between the nationalists and the assimilationists that Mr. Gates identifies turns out to be a competition over who will mislead the black community. The contenders are fighting over a small piece of the pie, a place in the Democratic Party sun, a congregation or an audience, a few bucks, a streetcorner, an article in The Times.
And that includes everyone from the Rev. Jesse Jackson to Representative Charles B. Rangel and his Congressional colleagues to Ron Brown, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, to Mayor David N. Dinkins, the independent Presidential candidate Ron D. Daniels, Prof. Henry Louis Gates Jr. and the most militant black nationalists. I know many in both camps. A lot are decent, and a few have even managed to accomplish something for the black community. But not one has a serious plan for empowering the black community to win social and economic justice.
As an independent black leader I have neither the need nor the inclination to exploit anti-Semitism in the black community. I deplore it. My life's work is to construct the tools of empowerment that will liberate my people from the chains of injustice and poverty, which keep so many others in bondage as well.
The two major parties and those to whom they are accountable (through the corporate political action committees that bankroll them) have failed to eradicate racism, which was inscribed in the Constitution and is woven into the American fabric.
That is why I have devoted so many hours -- pursuing lawsuits in the courts, lobbying in Congress, organizing in the streets. Only a fundamental political restructuring -- democratization -- can bring about the redistribution of wealth in our country that would allow every American to live a decent life. My message to the black community is that simple: As long as you continue to vote for the greater or the lesser of two evils, there will never be such a redistribution of wealth.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Democrats;
Clinton's Staff Sees Campaign As a Real War

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark.

 BODY:
James Carville is a whippet of a man, lean and balding and as tightly coiled as the innards of a baseball. In his calmest moment, the chief strategist for the Presidential campaign of Bill Clinton can scarcely sit still, and he does not so much speak as issue intermittent verbal explosions.
On a recent morning, yelling into his telephone receiver as if outraged to find it in his hand, he was almost hopping up and down in his anger. "Look! Don't give me that! I don't want to hear that! We're not messing around with these people, you hear me?! We haven't won this thing in 12 years. We're in a war here, you understand that?!" To be fair to Mr. Carville, this quotation in its original form was laced with expletives, running about two per sentence. 
 The events of the past few weeks have shown that the people who work with and for Mr. Carville -- and the candidate who employs them all -- do grasp this point. Constantly both on the attack and the defense, Mr. Clinton's campaign often seems more military than political, and has shown itself adept at the sort of warlike politics that are generally thought of as the specialty of Republican operations.
The argot of the campaign would make a pacifist shudder. The room where Mr. Carville works and shouts is the "war room." Betsey Wright, the longtime Clinton aide who oversees the research operation that investigates and answers accusations against the candidate, is, a campaign official said, "the Secretary of Defense." Describing the campaign's reaction to an attack by President Bush on Mr. Clinton's health care proposals, Mr. Carville estimates the level of response in Pentagon jargon as "Defcon-5," or highest alert.
Mr. Carville, although he doesn't say it about himself, has emerged as the campaign's field marshal.
 
'Incredible Sense of Urgency'
 "He is 100 percent in charge of the daily message and the daily counter-message," said Mark Gearan, the campaign official who oversees operations for Mr. Clinton's running mate, Senator Al Gore.
"He is the one setting the daily pace, and he is the driving force in the campaign," Mr. Gearan said. "He gives an incredible sense of urgency to the campaign. He understands that there are 88, 89 days left and that is all. That is very important because a lot of the people who are driving the day-to-day machinery of the campaign are 24, 25 years old. At that age, November seems like a lifetime away. Mr. Carville knows that in fact November is right around the corner."
Each day in the campaign is bracketed by War Room meetings, one at 7 A.M. and one at 7 P.M., led by Mr. Carville and attended by anywhere from 10 to 30 people, including the communications director, George Stephanopoulos; a media consultant, Mandy Grunwald; Ms. Wright and the scheduling director, Susan Thomases.
The members of the War Room inner circle share a notable trait: they are all experienced in the more brutal sort of politics.
Ms. Wright, a chain-smoking, tight-lipped woman who unsmilingly describes herself as "a very, very tough person," has worked more than 20 years in the battlefields of Southern local races.
Ms. Grunwald, a political consultant in Washington, worked for a North Carolina businessman named Harvey Gantt in his unsuccessful campaign against Senator Jesse Helms in 1990. Mr. Helms won the race after advertisements that depicted Mr. Gantt as a supporter of racial quotas and militant homosexual rights advocacy.
Mr. Stephanopoulos was the director of the rapid-response team for Michael S. Dukakis in 1988, a lesson in failure that taught him, he says wryly, "first of all, respond."
The manager of the War Room, hired several weeks ago, is Ricki Seidman. As research director for People for the American Way, the public interest group, Ms. Seidman helped coordinate an aggressive media campaign to discredit Robert H. Bork, the 1987 Supreme Court nominee. Early in the nomination battles over Clarence Thomas, Ms. Seidman was hired by Senator Edward M. Kennedy and was instrumental in encouraging Prof. Anita F. Hill to testify.
 
Personal, but Public
 The strategy and tactics that are plotted in the War Room meetings are two-sided. The Clinton campaign attacks President Bush, often harshly, and in a way that is quite personal. In recent weeks, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore have spoken of Mr. Bush as a man who has evaded responsibility for his actions, who is the willing tool of the rich and powerful, whose tenure has led America to be humiliated and mocked around the world, who has mishandled virtually every aspect of his Presidency.
But, at the same time, the campaign is careful to base the attacks largely on matters of Mr. Bush's public record. While the use of the material is selective and in some cases distorted, the Clinton campaign can always defend itself against charges of negative campaigning by saying that its criticisms, although personal in tone, are based on issues and actions that are public.
The lead player in this performance is Mr. Clinton himself. In speeches and press conferences, he takes the lead in putting out both the daily attack message and the daily defense.
The candidate and his lieutenants argue that there is no similarity between what they are trying to do to Mr. Bush and what the Republicans are trying to do to Mr. Clinton. In typical remarks, Mr. Clinton told reporters last week that there was "a very great difference" between what he was doing and the actions of the other side, which he described as "trying to convince the American people your opponent is some alien from outer space."
But much of what Mr. Clinton and his surrogates say about Mr. Bush neatly fits Mr. Clinton's description of the Bush campaign's attacks on him as "selective and personal and negative and often distorted."
 
An Incomplete Picture
 When Mr. Clinton speaks of America under the Reagan and Bush Administrations, he paints a picture of a country on hard times, where "Americans worked harder for less money," but does not mention that the decade also saw (as Republicans like to say) the nation's longest period of economic expansion. When Mr. Clinton talks of the war Mr. Bush led against Iraq, it is only to speak of the failures of diplomacy that occurred before the war, and the failures of the peace that followed it, almost never of the extraordinary success of the military operation itself.
A classic example of Mr. Clinton's approach can be found in his repeated contention about the Bush Administration's handling of the end of the Gulf war. Mr. Clinton argues that the Bush Administration propped up Saddam Hussein after the war. As he recently and typically put it, "They couldn't wait to keep him in power."
The charge imputes a grave and large moral failing on the part of his opponent, suggesting Mr. Bush is a man of utter dishonor. It is made without supporting evidence. And it is delivered lightly, almost parenthetically.
Often, Mr. Clinton manages to combine in one passage an accusation that his Republican opponents are attacking unfairly, a defense against that attack, and a sharp attack of his own. Speaking to a crowd in Minneapolis on Friday night, he demonstrated this technique in two short sentences: "They will say that you ought to trust them, and that you can't trust us. Well, I didn't tell you to read my lips."
The Clinton counter-charge operation uses a layered approach that incorporates daily comments by the candidate, statements by fellow Democrats and press releases that include pithy rebuttal remarks by Mr. Stephanopoulos and pages of facts, figures and newspaper articles to buttress those arguments, gathered by Ms. Wright's research operation.
The drill usually works. When, last week, Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. of South Carolina attacked Mr. Clinton's record on welfare reform, Ms. Wright produced a letter from Mr. Campbell dated years before praising Mr. Clinton for his work in this area.
 
Who's Mr. Negative?
 Mr. Clinton and his aides are also quick to dismiss virtually all criticisms by the other side as "negative campaigning," reminiscent of the sort used by the Bush campaign of 1988. The Republican campaign was widely criticized by Democrats, and by many in journalism. One result has been that any accusation of "negative campaigning" is seen as damaging.
The measure of the strategy's success to date became clear when the Bush campaign issued an extraordinary press release on Aug. 2 intended to show that it was the Clinton operation, not Mr. Bush's, that was taking the most negative approach. But the statement approved by the deputy campaign director, Mary Matalin, erred terribly on the side of incaution, lapsing into the language of an infuriated adolescent at times. It was so intemperate that the White House disavowed the statement.
At the Clinton campaign the morning the disavowal was announced, Mr. Carville, who has a personal relationship with Ms. Matalin, found himself in the emotionally complicated position of knowing that his tactics had goaded his romantic friend and political enemy into a first-class blunder.
"They're just getting so frustrated over there," he said. "This is the way it happens when you're running a campaign and things are really going against you. You feel like you've got to do something, even if it's something stupid. So they did something. And it was really stupid."

CORRECTION-DATE: August 13, 1992, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about the military style of Gov. Bill Clinton's campaign organization referred incorrectly to an exchange between the Clinton camp and Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. of South Carolina. Mr. Campbell's criticism, and the Clinton organization's response, dealt with an economic development plan that Mr. Clinton had created for Arkansas, not with welfare reform.

HEADLINE: On Poverty's Edge: a Welfare Mother In California Fears a Life With Less

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 10

 BODY:
When Sonja Blutgarten spent $20 for cake mix and party favors to celebrate her sons' birthdays, it meant she could not afford to do eight loads of wash. The fat sacks of dirty clothes crowded the corridor of her shabby apartment for months while she squirreled away a dollar here and a dollar there to finance a trip to the coin laundry.
For Ms. Blutgarten, a 29-year-old unemployed mother of two, such trade offs are a fact of life, part of the day-to-day calculus of supporting herself, 6-year-old TeAndre and 4-year-old Kehnan on a $663 monthly welfare check, plus $168 worth of food stamps. 
 That is California's grant for a family of three under the Aid To Families with Dependent Children program, which helps 2.4 million welfare recipients in the nation's most populous state. But with welfare caseloads soaring here, and the state's budget shortfall at $10.7 billion, those A.F.D.C. benefits will probably be cut soon -- and slashed even more deeply in the next few months if the voters approve an overhaul of the welfare system.
The first benefit cut, an estimated 4.5 percent, is expected in the new California budget, under negotiation in the capital, where the Governor and legislative leaders have yet to break a stalemate that has left the state without a spending plan for 41 days.
 
A 25 Percent Cut Possible
 A far larger cut, up to 25 percent of current benefits, could come in November, when voters consider a ballot initiative, sponsored by Gov. Pete Wilson, that would revamp California's welfare system. Under that plan, Ms. Blutgarten would wind up with a grant of $507 a month, although because of that smaller welfare benefit she could get more food stamps, $234 worth.
Even with the current benefits, the fourth most generous among all states, Ms. Blutgarten rarely reaches the end of the month in the black, despite careful budgeting and much juggling of priorities after she has paid her $400 rent and her $60 utility bill.
Some months she washes the dishes with shampoo, or her hair with detergent, because she has run out of one cleaner or the other.
She rides an hour and a half on the bus every couple of weeks to buy four-packs of toilet paper at 69 cents each, less than half what it costs at the local supermarket. She has been rationing an inch of window cleaner left behind by a previous tenant because there will be no more when that is gone.
And things are getting worse for Ms. Blutgarten, a high school dropout. State budget cuts are expected to reduce services by MediCal, the state health plan for the poor, which has been whittled in recent years. And city budget cuts in San Francisco forced up the price of a monthly transit pass to $40 from $35.
 
Suit Against the State
 Ms. Blutgarten is one of three welfare mothers who a few months sued the California Department of Social Services, accusing the department of failing to comply with Federal regulations requiring states to re-evaluate welfare benefits every three years. The suit, brought with the help of an advocacy group, is still pending.
The Wilson budget plan, Ms. Blutgarten said, would leave her with only $7 a month after she had paid for rent, utilities and transportation. That means no money for laundry, household or personal supplies. And it does not fully cover her monthly loan payment of $20 -- for dental work that was not covered by MediCal and for time payments on a set of children's encyclopedias that she bought a while ago and which were stolen while she was living in a shelter.
But under the terms of the Governor's ballot measure, Ms. Blutgarten and other women like her will have incentives to work that they do not have now because they will be entitled to earn considerably more money without losing their subsidy.
Amy Albright, a spokesman for the ballot initiative, said that "insane disincentives" in the current welfare system keep women like Ms. Blutgarten out of the work force because they literally cannot afford to take a job. "Our aim," Ms. Albright said, "is to change the system so that it pays to work and then expect a few hours of work a week, at a minimum, from our able-bodied welfare recipients."
The measure sets about doing that with a combination of sticks and carrots:
*It would cut grants immediately by 10 percent and then by an additional 15 percent in six months.
*Those who went to work to supplement their lowered grants would be able to earn larger sums without losing welfare eligibility, based on a byzantine formula under which some income could be disregarded.
*It would discourage migration of indigent people to California by limiting welfare payments to newcomers to what they were getting in their home states.
*It would discourage welfare mothers from having babies by eliminating increased benefits for additional children. (This provision, and a half-dozen others, required Federal waivers, which California last week received from the Bush Administration.)
In addition to reforming welfare, the ballot initiative, Proposition 165, would give the Governor expanded budgetary powers, including the ability to dock lawmakers their salaries and declare a fiscal emergency if the state was without a spending plan by the start of the fiscal year.
These fiscal provisions, originally considered a secondary part of the measure, could increase its popularity with voters in light of the current budget stalemate, many experts say.
Whether proposals like Proposition 165 succeed in reducing the welfare rolls depend in large measure on the response of women like Ms. Blutgarten, who describes herself as a former amphetamine addict, now "completely clean for two years so my kids can have a future."
 
Paying to Have to Work
 At the moment, according to calculations by state welfare officials, a person in Ms. Blutgarten's circumstances can earn up to $478 a month and still collect a full welfare grant. Ms. Blutgarten, after separating from the father of her children, earned more than that for a while working behind the counter at a pizza parlor. But, she quit upon discovering that the reduction of benefits and cost of child care left her poorer than she was before.
"I was paying to work," Ms. Blutgarten said.
Under the terms of Mr. Wilson's initiative, welfare grants for a woman in Ms. Blutgarten's circumstances would remain intact until monthly earnings reached $941. Would that inspire her to get a job?
She was not sure, she said, for a variety of reasons. Restaurant work is harder to come by these days. And she is leery about finding affordable, quality day care. But most worrisome, Ms. Blutgarten said, was being trapped in a low-wage job when what she wants to do is continue her own education once her children are in school all day.
Meanwhile, Ms. Blutgarten tries to expose her sons to some of the amenities of life. Her apartment on the edge of the Haight-Ashbury district is furnished with things scavanged from curbside, including a battered mahogony sidechair that she re-upholstered and "refinished" with a paste made from instant coffee. On the tables, there are doilies and bowls of potpourri, so old it is no longer scented.
She lines her eyes with year-old makeup because "it's important for my children to grow up seeing grooming habits." And she wishes she could afford paper table napkins because "at their high school graduation dinner I don't want them to see one and say, 'What's this?' "
With the first stage of benefit reductions a virtual certainty, Ms. Blutgarten is considering her options for making ends meet, the likeliest one squeezing another welfare mother and child into her one-bedroom apartment.
A happier question is what she would do if she woke up one day and found she had some money -- not a lot, but enough to indulge in a few fantasies.
"I'd buy a whole new wardrobe, nothing used for myself and the boys," Mrs. Blutgarten said. "I'd have garbage bags and napkins all the time. We'd all get barber shop haircuts. And I'd buy one of those disinfectant things you drop in the toilet."

Table: "When Ends Don't Meet"
 
Proposed changes under a ballot measure to the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program will decrease Sonja Blutgarten's monthly grant by $156, forcing her to eliminate essential items.

HEADLINE: FREE TRADE ACCORD FOR NORTH AMERICA IS EXPECTED TODAY

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 11

 BODY:
The United States, Canada and Mexico tentatively agreed today to create a free trade area covering all of North America, eliminating customs duties and other restrictions.
The agreement will allow companies to do business the length of the continent with few barriers. Several people involved in the negotiations and Administration officials said President Bush was virtually certain to announce the accord on Wednesday morning. 
 But the three trade ministers issued a statement tonight saying that they had not concluded a deal. "Contrary to press reports, negotiations on a North American Free Trade Agreement continue this evening with all three ministers meeting," the two-sentence statement said. "An announcement will be made when the negotiations are complete and a deal has been reached."
 
Sorting Out Details
 When a deal is concluded is not a cut-and-dried issue, however, because lawyers will be sorting out final details for weeks to come, as they do on all international agreements. What matters is whether enough of the issues have been resolved to announce an agreement.
An American official said tonight that the three trade ministers had resolved all of their differences and were preparing a final draft of the agreement's 75-page executive summary. It was possible, but not likely, that the ministers would come across some unsuspected difference of opinion as they summarized what they had accomplished, the official said.
The White House notified key Congressional committees this evening that it believed the final deal would be struck tonight, while warning them that some details of the pact were still being worked out. The agreement is subject to Congressional approval, which is expected next year, probably after a bitter battle.
 
The Clinton Factor
 The November Presidential elections add further uncertainty. If Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the Democratic nominee, is elected, he could call for substantial changes in the pact. [News analysis, page D5.]
The key elements of the free trade agreement are these:
*Eliminating customs duties over time on tens of thousands of products traded among the three countries, from car windshields to tomatoes.
*Setting up obstacles to prevent Asian and European companies from bypassing American tariffs by shipping goods through Mexico.
*Opening Mexico's closed banking, insurance and securities industries to American and Canadian competition and investments.
*Creating trilateral panels to resolve commercial disputes involving environmental standards.
Most economists say the pact will bring greater prosperity to all three countries, with each specializing in the industries in which it is relatively efficient. But American and Canadian labor unions contend that companies will move factories and jobs to Mexico, where wages are lower.
White House and Republican campaign officials, many of them from Western states expected to gain from the accord, see the agreement as a vote-winner for President Bush. They plan to emphasize it at the Republican National Convention in Houston next week.
These officials expect the pact to win support from Mexican-Americans and voters in border states, which stand to benefit the most from increased sales of goods and services to Mexico. They also see the agreement as a chance for Mr. Bush to stress that his foreign policy experience produces jobs and prosperity in the United States.
But the agreement has badly split the Republican Party, with lawmakers and activists from Northeastern states deeply worried that it will antagonize voters worried about the possible loss of jobs. Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, who faces a tough re-election fight in a region that stands to benefit less than the border states, has been leery. And even some polls in the Southwest have shown strong public doubts about the pact.
 
Criticism From Democrats
 Democrats are also becoming more critical of the agreement. Governor Clinton supported the opening of negotiations with Mexico last year. But he applauded recently when the House majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, criticized the Administration for not negotiating good enough agreement. Mr. Gephardt said more should be done to protect American workers from losing jobs and to protect the environment along the nation's southern border and in Mexico.
The White House, however, views the agreement as a political plus, and has tentatively scheduled a news conference for President Bush on Wednesday so as to announce the deal with maximum publicity.
People involved in the talks said that the trade ministers from all three countries struck the deal at 1 A.M. today after 14 months of negotiation.
The last issue resolved early this morning concerned the extent to which Mexico would open to American and Canadian competition its contracts from Government agencies and state-owned enterprises. Some issues, like apparel imports from Canada and local-content rules for automobiles, were resolved in substance late Monday night but were discussed in detail today.
In the United States, the biggest winners will be American industries that need low-wage labor. Many are high-technology businesses, like computer manufacturers, which employ white-collar workers in design and development work in the United States and blue-collar workers abroad to assemble the products.
Until now, much of the assembly work had been done in East Asia, in part because of the risks of dealing with Mexico's legal system. Under the agreement, factories in Mexico, closer to home and more reliant on United States technical expertise than those in East Asia, will be protected from arbitrary confiscations.
The losers, of course, include American blue-collar workers, who will face more competition from Mexicans. The agreement will make it possible for a Mexican trucker earning $7 a day to climb into an 18-wheeler in Monterrey and drive a load of auto parts to Detroit.
Today, that driver would have to climb out of his truck in southern Texas and the goods would be loaded onto an American truck.
 
Union Opposition
 For just such reasons, labor unions have campaigned hard against the pact, saying hundreds of thousands of American jobs could be lost because the accord would certify Mexico as a safe place to do business with easy access to the American and Canadian markets.
But proponents of the pact counter that jobs are moving anyway. They cite examples like the Smith Corona Corporation, which announced last month that it would move its typewriter manufacturing operations to Mexico from Cortland, N.Y.
In many ways, the agreement is a stark reminder of how far relations with Mexico have come in six years. In the summer of 1986, senior Administration officials warned Congress that corruption and drug trafficking were weakening the Mexican Government. The Central Intelligence Agency raised the prospect of chaos along the United States's southern border and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff circulated a report suggesting that Mexico was the nation's gravest foreign policy problem.
The rhetoric has cooled since then, and trade has tripled as companies set up operations on each side of the border to take advantage of each country's competitive advantages. Overall relations are now the warmest in decades.
And over all, the terms of the trade agreement lopsidedly favor the United States. The pact brings Mexico into the club of industrialized nations, and the many Mexican trade concessions are the initiation fee.
The biggest Mexican concessions involve banking, insurance and securities. But Mexico has also pledged to lower its barriers to politically touchy corn imports, allow in American and Canadian advertising companies and continue supplying the United States with oil during international crises.
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico has already dismantled many trade barriers to attract foreign investment and use foreign competition to force Mexican businesses to invest in modernization. As much as $20 billion in foreign investment has poured into Mexico in the last 18 months.
On the face of it, American concessions have been more modest, in part because the United States already has the fewest trade barriers of any large industrialized country.
This is not to say that the United States made no concessions. Indeed, some Democrats have charged that concessions hitting their constituencies were made to hasten a deal for President Bush to hail at the Republican convention.
Some cite the American negotiators' agreement to exempt Mexico quickly from the current 25 percent tariff on imported pickup trucks. Mexico currently produces few trucks. But reducing the tariff would make truck production there more attractive. Mexico's agreement to eliminate its byzantine controls on car imports is not a fair trade, they contend.
American consumers will most easily see the agreement's effects in lower prices for Mexican goods like drinking glasses, beer and oranges, as the accord gradually eliminates customs duties within North America. American officials believe that wiping out all duties will help United States exports to Mexico more than Mexican exports to the United States because of Mexico's higher tariffs.
Mexico collected $2.18 billion in duties on $33.28 billion of American exports last year. The United States collected only $950.9 million in duties on $30.44 billion of imports.
One sleeper issue is how to raise money to offset the loss of this revenue, along with the extra spending on environmental cleanup, worker retraining and highway construction programs that Congress is likely to demand with the agreement.
The Congressional review process for trade agreements takes too long for an agreement to be approved this year. But Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Finance Committee, will hold hearings on the agreement this autumn, an aide said tonight.
Congress will not vote on the agreement itself but rather on legislation, still to be drafted, that will put the agreement's provisions into law. And that legislation must meet Congressional rules requiring that losses of revenue be offset either by taxes or spending cuts.
Mr. Gephardt has proposed a tax on cross-border transactions to pay for the extra spending. But William K. Reilly, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, opposed such a tax in a speech this morning.

HEADLINE: WELFARE ROLLS HIT THE MILLION MARK IN NEW YORK CITY

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
In the most telling sign of the tremendous human damage New York City's economic woes have caused, the number of New Yorkers on welfare broke the one million mark last month for the first time since the city's fiscal crisis in the 1970's.
In July, the number of recipients climbed to 1,005,210, a 22 percent rise from the 823,691 recipients in January 1990. The increase means that almost one of every seven New Yorkers is on welfare. 
 Most of the newcomers to the welfare rolls were unskilled workers who have had trouble competing for jobs in the recession, economists and state officials said.
 
AIDS and Addicts
 But there were a variety of other factors contributing as well. A new wave of immigrants, a growing numbers of people with AIDS, and more addicts in drug treatment programs have lengthened the welfare lists, city officials said. And changes in state rules have also made about 1,000 more people eligible for welfare benefits in the city, a tiny though measurable portion of the rise, state officials said.
But the dominant reason for the steady rise in the number of welfare recipients is the sour economy, officials said. That surge, as well as a 15 percent increase in benefits that took effect in 1990, has raised welfare costs in the city from $1.76 billion in 1989 to $2.25 billion in 1991. These totals include benefits paid to families through Aid to Families With Dependent Children and to individuals through home relief. The figures have not been adjusted for inflation.
The most dramatic rises in the welfare caseloads occurred last summer, which not coincidentally was also the time when the decline in jobs was most severe, economists and state officials said.
In June 1991, the State Social Services Department surveyed a sample of welfare applicants in the city. Most had strong ties to the workplace.
Terrance McGrath, a spokesman for the Social Services Department, said the survey found that 57 percent of the welfare applicants had been employed in the preceding year, earning $280 a week on average. Only about a quarter of those who had lost their jobs had been received any unemployment compensation. An additional 11 percent of those who applied were working but earning very little.
"Almost 60 percent of the applicants reported that they tried to avoid welfare by getting help from family and friends," Mr. McGrath said. "But eventually they said they had to apply for assistance because the economy was pinching the people they were getting help from."
A minor factor was a change in state rules that made about 1,000 more people eligible for benefits in the city, he said. The state raised the amount of income a person or family could earn and still qualify for welfare by 15 percent in January 1990.
Mary Jo Bane, the State Commissioner of Social Services, said the rising number of welfare cases came as no surprise to the state or the city.
"It's not anything that should make people say that something terrible is going on and that welfare reform isn't working," Ms. Bane said. "Historically, welfare caseloads have followed the economy."
She said the enriched education and training now being offered to welfare recipients would pay off when the economy picks up. Those who have improved their skills will then be poised to enter the job market.
 
Reaching Out
 Sheila Jack, a spokeswoman for the city's Human Resources Administration, said the city has tried to make sure that everyone who qualifies for benefits receives them. The agency has reached out to the down and out in public schools and homeless shelters.
But she disputed any notion that the Dinkins administration was trying to recruit more people for welfare, in comparison to the administration of Mayor Edward I. Koch, which was often perceived as more tight-fisted in its distribution of welfare benefits.
"I don't think the increase has to do with the approach, but with economic realities we've had to deal with," Ms. Jack said.
Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional Commissioner for the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, said the recession, which began in the New York metropolitan area in April 1989 and has continued, has made it much more difficult for unskilled workers to land jobs.
At the same time, most workers do not qualify for unemployment insurance for a variety of reasons, including that they did not work enough weeks in the year. They have nowhere else to turn but to welfare, he said. Even some of those who do get unemployment compensation run out of benefits before they find work.
"Companies have more of a pool to draw on in hiring," he said. "They'll get the best qualified worders. Workers with the most modest qualifications will be especially disadvantaged in finding work during this kind of period."
Outside of a city welfare office at 260 West 30th Street yesterday, welfare recipients nonchalantly accepted the news that the welfare rolls exceeded one million; they only expressed surprise that the number was not larger still.
Angel Rivero, 29 years old, lost his job as a car mechanic earlier this year. He came with his 9-month-old son, Raymond, and his 9-year-old son, Angel Jr., to seek benefits. Without welfare, he had no idea where he was going to get money for food. He had been feeding his baby a bottle of water.
"I want to find work, but no one will hire me because I don't have any tools," he said. "This is the first time I haven't had a job. I don't want to go out there and stick anybody up. I just want some money so my kids can eat."
William Wilson, 37, said he lost his job as a carpenter about a month ago. "It's pretty rough out here," he said.
Mr. Wilson said he was released on parole from the Federal prison in Lexington, Ky., in 1989 after serving time on a drug charge. "The reason I'm on welfare is to keep from committing crimes," he said. "I've been looking for work everywhere. I've got to do something to get money."
At City Hall, Dinkins administration officials quickly blamed 12 years of Republican rule in Washington for the worsening plight of poor people. "We have not had a war on poverty for the last 12 years," said Leland T. Jones, chief spokesman for Mayor David N. Dinkins. "After so much bad news and so much bad public policy, it's not surprising that the numbers are increasing."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Issues -- Health Care;
Health-Care Policy: How Bush and Clinton Differ

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 11

 BODY:
Of all the many differences between Gov. Bill Clinton and President Bush, none are more profound than their disagreements over health-care policy.
President Bush says health care is "the Grand Canyon of philosophy" that separates him from Mr. Clinton, and many Democrats agree. 
 It would be hard to overstate the differences between the two men on the question of how to control soaring health costs and how to finance care for the 35 million Americans who have no health insurance.
Mr. Bush accuses the Democratic nominee of favoring a state-run system that would have Soviet-like elements. Mr. Clinton accuses the President of ignoring costs that are rising like "a patient's fever chart."
Since January 1989, when Mr. Bush took office, the price of medical care has risen 32 percent, or twice as much as the Consumer Price Index, which gauges the overall cost of living.
There is wide agreement that something must be done to slow the rise of health costs, with voices as diverse as the American Medical Association, Ralph Nader, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.and the United States Chamber of Commerce, calling for the nation to take stern action.
While both Presidential candidates want to curb costs and make insurance coverage more available, they favor very different methods, especially concerning the Government's role. But both candidates are vague about how they would pay for their proposals.
Contrary to Mr. Bush's assertions, Mr. Clinton does not espouse "a nationalized or a socialized plan." But the Arkansas Governor does favor imposing an overall limit on national health spending, public and private, as well as new responsibilities on employers to guarantee that all Americans are covered by some form of health insurance.
Saying the cost of care "must not be allowed to rise faster than the average American's income," Mr. Clinton would let states set prices for doctors and hospitals if health spending threatened to exceed the national limit, as established by a newly created panel, the "health standards board."
Governor Clinton also wants a Federal law that requires all employers to buy insurance for their workers: either private health insurance or coverage through a public program. Mr. Clinton has not specified how he would raise money for the public program, but payroll taxes on employers are one option. By this means, he says, he would achieve "universal coverage" of all Americans.
The President opposes such a Federal requirement, as well as the taxes to finance it, and says that overall limits on medical spending could lead to the rationing of health care.
 
Tax Credits and Deductions
 Mr. Bush would rely on the private market as much as possible. He would offer tax credits to poor people -- up to $3,750 a year for a family -- to help them buy private health insurance, and tax deductions, a less valuable form of assistance, to middle-income families.
Administration officials say $3,750 "would be sufficient to purchase a basic health insurance benefits package," including hospital care and doctors' services.
Mr. Clinton charged today that Mr. Bush's proposals would not get at what he said was the root of the health care crisis: runaway administrative costs.
Campaigning before a group of Southern state legislators, Mr. Clinton was responding to Republican accusations that his own plan would lead to a huge tax increase and more bureaucracy.
"When we ought to be engaged in a debate on a problem that's killing us, it's as if the President were saying, 'The only thing you have to fear is my opponent and new ideas,' " Mr. Clinton said.
The President says he would lower medical costs by asking Congress to limit damages in medical malpractice cases, reducing unnecessary paperwork, improving coordination of health services and providing consumers with information to help them choose doctors and hospitals offering the best value.
Governor Clinton says that he agrees with some of these ideas in principle but that he does not endorse all the details of Mr. Bush's proposals.
As for Mr. Clinton's universal coverage proposal, the Administration says it would actually lead to new Federal costs because employers would dump their workers into the Federal program rather than buy private insurance for them. Administration officials contend that millions of workers who now get private health insurance through their employers would have to switch to the Government program.
Gail R. Wilensky, deputy assistant to the President for policy development, says the Clinton proposal is "just back-door national health insurance," a charge that Mr. Clinton and other Democrats deny.
 
No Details on Financing
 Neither candidate offers a detailed idea of how he would finance his plan.
Mr. Bush says his would cost the Government $100 billion over five years. Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, wanted to impose a new tax on a portion of the health insurance benefits that affluent people get from their employers. The tax would help pay for the assistance given to poor and middle-income families, but the White House abandoned the idea in January after Republican members of Congress denounced it as politically stupid.
Mr. Clinton has not specified the overall cost of his plan. Administration officials say the Clinton plan would probably require a payroll tax of 7 percent on employers who did not provide insurance for their employees. Bush aides say such taxes would hinder economic growth and be a crushing burden for small businesses.
At a meeting with journalists last week, Mr. Clinton's health policy advisers were vague about details of his proposals. Atul Gawande, one of Mr. Clinton's advisers, said that given the current level of debate, in which Mr. Bush described the Clinton plan as combining "the efficiency of the House post office with the compassion of the K.G.B," there is no reason for the Democratic candidate to offer many more details at this time.
Many health economists say they doubt that Mr. Bush's plan would control health costs. His insistence on a limited role for the Government means that there would be no way to limit total spending on health care or the rate of increase in medical prices.
Mr. Clinton's plan also seems unrealistic in some ways, some experts say. He promises a package of basic health benefits for all Americans, including the 35 million who are uninsured, and he says it would include costly items like prescription drugs and mental health care. He also promises to "expand long-term care," including home care for the elderly.
But Mr. Clinton is reluctant to say that the additional benefits and coverage would cost money. There is no reason to consider a general tax increase "until every effort has been made to squeeze excess cost out of the system," he says.
Bruce Reed, the deputy campaign manager, said Mr. Clinton's proposals "would eventually remove $80 billion to $100 billion a year in excess costs" from the health-care system. Curtailing waste and fraud and unnecessary tests and procedures would save more than enough to finance expanded coverage, including long-term care, for all who need it, Mr. Reed said.
 
Drug Companies' Tax Breaks
 Mr. Clinton also says he will "eliminate drug price gouging" by eliminating tax breaks for drug companies that raise prices faster than Americans' incomes rise. The Bush Administration and drug companies fiercely resisted that proposal when it was offered in Congress earlier this year.
Lobbyists for prescription drug manufacturers and health insurance companies have met with the Clinton campaign to express their concerns.
Jeffrey C. Warren, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, said "punitive price controls" of the type favored by Mr. Clinton would hinder the research needed to develop new medicines. In any event, he said, prescription drug prices are "beginning to moderate" because the industry "has gotten the message about public concern over drug prices."
Mr. Clinton envisions a continued role for private health insurers in managing and coordinating care. But Carl J. Schramm, president of the Health Insurance Association of America, which represents more than 300 commercial insurers, said the Clinton proposals were "fundamentally threatening to the continuation of private health insurance."
"Employers would have an irresistible incentive to move their worst risks into the Government program," said Mr. Schramm. "The public program would lose money immediately, and would then try to draw healthier people into the program to offset the cost. That would cause a spiral that could eventually eliminate private insurance."
Brushing aside such criticism, Senator Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota, said: "The Bush health-care plan is really a metaphor for his entire Presidency. Lots of rhetoric, little substance."

HEADLINE: With Rabin Beside Him, Bush Praises the Israelis

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 11

 BODY:
After several years of cool relations between the Bush Administration and Israel, President Bush hailed Israel today as a "strategic partner" of the United States, as he and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin announced their agreement on a much-delayed package of $10 billion in loan guarantees.
With Mr. Rabin beside him outside the Bush home in Kennebunkport, Me., the President said they had agreed on the basic principles of the loan program, which would run five years. 
 He asked for swift action on the guarantees, which he had held up for more than a year because Mr. Rabin's predecessor, Yitzhak Shamir, had refused to impose a freeze on construction of settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
Then, returning to Washington, Mr. Bush told Congressional leaders that he would send them loan-guarantee legislation within two days. Prospects for passage appeared good.
 
Senator Expresses Optimism
 Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee on Foreign Operations, expressed delight at the announcement, particularly since the loan guarantees would be linked to Israeli economic reforms and to limits on further settlements. "I can get it through the Senate," he said, adding that his panel would take up foreign aid shortly after Labor Day.
Congressional officials predicted that the loan guarantees would have a somewhat more difficult time in the House, but that Democratic leaders there would push hard for approval.
It is not known if the legislation would require renewal every year or be in a form requiring once-only approval of the full amount for the five-year period.
As Mr. Bush and Mr. Rabin tried to inject a new tone of warmth and friendship into a relationship that had become severely strained, the Israeli called the President's decision "a significant step."
 
Limiting Cost to U.S.
 "We shall also carry as much as possible of the burden, of the financial burden, of the guarantees so as to lessen any cost to the American taxpayer," the Prime Minister said. "But your readiness to extend it following our discussions means a lot to me and to Israel, and again, thank you very much."
Israel wants to use the loan guarantees to help resettle immigrants from the former Soviet lands.
The United States will not be lending money to Israel, but guaranteeing that Israel will repay money it borrows. This will allow the Israelis to borrow from banks at favorable terms.
The cost to the United States will depend on what percentage of the loan amounts the Administration is required to set aside as a reserve to back the guarantees. This could be as low as $50 million or as high as $1.9 billion.
The appearance by the two leaders this morning ended a 24-hour stay at the President's home, which was intended to signal an end to the tensions in the American-Israeli relationship, and to present a warm, personal relationship in contrast to the tension between Mr. Bush and Mr. Shamir.
"It was a true pleasure for Barbara and me to spend this time" with the Prime Minister and Mrs. Rabin, Mr. Bush said. He added, "We could not be happier than to have them visit us here at Kennebunkport, this very special place for me and my family."
He added, "The meetings were also significant for the tone of the discussions. Our time together can best be described as a consultation between close friends and strategic partners."
Although Mr. Bush's advisers were hoping that the accord on loan guarantees and the improvement in relations would calm election-year criticism of Mr. Bush's policies on Israel, the President said he had no political motivation in reaching his decision.
"We're not talking here about domestic United States politics, nor are we talking about domestic Israeli politics," he said. "We're talking about principle, about doing what is right."
But Mr. Bush acknowledged that it "isn't easy" to separate his actions from the campaign and added, "I'm going to finesse that."
Offering the kind of reassuring language that American Jewish groups have complained was missing from his comments on Israel over the last three and a half years, the President spoke several times of Israel's "strategic importance" to the United States, signaled that he was ready to move forward with military cooperation between the two countries, and reaffirmed Washington's longstanding policy of assuring that Israel has a "qualitative military edge" over its Arab neighbors.
 
Ironing Out Semantics
 Before agreeing to support the loan guarantees, American officials said Mr. Bush had sought a personal explanation from Mr. Rabin about the distinction he was drawing between construction of "political" settlements and those his Government considers "security" settlements. The leaders gave no elaboration on this distinction.
Asked today if he agreed with Mr. Rabin's definitions, Mr. Bush said: "We understand the position and all I will say is that I salute this change. We salute what the Prime Minister is trying to do. We understand his position. He understands our position. And obviously, we would not be going forward with this loan guarantee if we did not salute the change."

HEADLINE: U.S., Britain and France Warn Baghdad on Shiites

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 11

 BODY:
The United States, Britain and France warned President Saddam Hussein today that they might come to the aid of the Shiite Muslims of Iraq's vast southern marshlands if he continued to oppress them, just as they aided Kurdish refugees fleeing his armies in the north last year.
The warnings came at a special Security Council meeting called to hear a report on human rights violations in Iraq by the former Dutch Foreign Minister, Max van der Stoel, who is investigating Iraq's human rights record on behalf of the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva. 
 The three countries that sent their armed forces to carve out safe havens for Kurdish refugees last year accused President Hussein of continuing to oppress both the northern Kurds and the southern Shiites in violation of Security Council Resolution 688, which demands an end to all internal repression in the country.
The United States representative, Edward J. Perkins, recalled that after the Council decided Baghdad's attacks on the Kurds were a threat to international peace last year, Washington agreed to "additional measures" to help prevent further Iraqi repression. "Now not only in the north but also in the south that situation still exists," he said.
 
Recalls 1991 Kurdish Exodus
 Britain's representative, Sir David Hannay, also recalled that his Government had felt that "last year's massive exodus of Kurds into Turkey and Iran" was so serious that "measures had to be taken" to stop the population from being further repressed.
"That situation now appears to exist in the south of Iraq as well as it did last year in the north," he added.
France's Deputy Representative, Jean-Marc Rochereau de La Sabliere, gave a similar veiled warning, recalling that his Government had helped set up the Kurdish safe havens last year and now feels that "today a situation just as serious exists in the south."
"The international community cannot remain indifferent to the situation of the population in the south," he added.
 
Systematic Campaign Cited
 All three countries accused President Hussein of conducting a systematic military campaign against Shiite Muslims living in the southern marshlands around the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.
They said they were being subjected to regular artillery barrages, armed attacks and bombing and strafing by fixed wing aircraft and helicopter gunships.
"One of the most serious new developments is the use of fixed-wing aircraft, including jet fighters, for the first time in bombing Shiite villages in the south," Mr. Perkins said.
 
Back on the Defensive
 The warnings come at a time when President Hussein has been boldly defying the Security Council's gulf war cease-fire terms, and diplomats say they intend to humiliate and push him back onto the defensive.
In recent weeks, Iraq has sought to obstruct United Nations arms inspectors seeking out its weapons of mass destruction. It has refused to renew an aid agreement with the United Nations, rejected the Security Council's offer to let it sell oil to feed its people and refused to accept a new boundary the Council demarcated with Kuwait.
The Shiites of the inaccessible southern marshlands have long been a center of opposition to Mr. Hussein's Government. They are believed to receive assistance from neighboring Iran and have provided refuge for many leaders of last year's unsuccessful Shiite uprising after the gulf war.
 
A Ban Is Considered
 The United States, Britain and France have been considering banning Iraq from flying planes over the southern marshes and demanding a withdrawal of its forces from the area, just as they are committed to shoot down Iraqi planes flying near the Kurdish safe havens and have forced Baghdad's army to withdraw a safe distance from them.
At today's meeting the three Western powers also demanded that Iraq renew a aid agreement with the United Nations that it is trying to cancel and accept the continued deployment of lightly-armed United Nations guards throughout its territory to protect relief workers.
And they informed Baghdad that it remained in clear violation of Resolution 688 by continuing its economic blockade of the Kurdish north as well as of the southern Shiites.
In his report to the Council, Mr. van der Stoel also severely criticized Iraq for failing to renew the aid agreement at a time when public health conditions are deteriorating in the country and the blockaded Kurds and Shiites face increasing difficulties.
He accused Baghdad of seeking to drive the Shiites out of their traditional lands by resettling them in Government-controlled villages just as it brought the Kurds down from the northern mountains by force in the 1980's and resettled them in areas under its control.
He said the Government was draining areas of these marshlands in order to deprive the Shiites of their distinctive, 3,000-year old culture. And he criticized a vast new irrigation project President Hussein has recently begun in the south of the country as threatening ecological disaster in the marshlands.
In what may prove a conciliatory move, Iraq has invited Jan Eliason of Sweden, the top United Nations official in charge of aid, to visit Baghdad next week to discuss the future of the organization's relief program there.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Republican Platform;
Drafters Soften Stand on Taxes To Placate Bush

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Aug. 11

 BODY:
To avoid embarrassing President Bush, the drafters of the Republican Party's platform today moderated sections they had approved on Monday that called the 1990 budget agreement the President signed a "mistake" and that promised to try to repeal the tax increases that were part of that agreement.
Instead, the platform will call the tax increases that were part of the budget agreement with Congress "recessionary," blame Congressional Democrats for them and call only for their "ultimate" reversal. 
 The changes were made at the request of Charles Black, a senior campaign adviser who is monitoring the platform drafting for the Bush camp.
 
Underlying Tensions
 The changes are cosmetic and the dispute, by itself, seemed a tempest in a teapot. But it illustrated the underlying tension between the President and some diehard Republican conservatives who are upset that Mr. Bush broke his no-new-taxes pledge and want him now to be more aggressive on cutting taxes.
Mr. Bush himself has characterized the budget agreement as a mistake, but he has couched it mainly as a political error rather than as a substantive one.
John Taylor, a Stanford economics professor who served for two years on Mr. Bush's Counsel of Economic Advisers and is now on the campaign staff, said in an interview today that the tax increases by themselves had hindered economic growth but that the budget agreement altogether had been good for the economy, especially because it led the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates.
Mr. Black told reporters that the Bush campaign wanted to keep the platform "a positive vehicle."
The two conservative Congressmen who had sponsored the "mistake" language Monday, Vin Weber of Minnesota and Robert S. Walker of Pennsylvania, said they were amenable to the changes the Bush campaign requested.
"The mistake was that it caused a recession," Mr. Walker said of the budget measure. Mr. Weber said the Bush camp feared that if the platform accused Mr. Bush of a "mistake," Democrats would use it out of context in campaign advertisements.
Mostly, the drafters spent today going through the platform language line by line and adding more rigidly conservative planks. For example, an amendment was approved specifying that passing out condoms and needles would not cure AIDS.
When a delegate from South Dakota tried to add a plank saying that the party opposed using the image of American Indians to sell products, she was defeated.
The delegate, Mary Wiese, said the Sioux in her state were offended by the advertisements for Crazy Horse Malt Liquor. But an overwhelming majority of delegates said the party had no business violating a company's First Amendment right to advertise the way it wished.

HEADLINE: Late Bond Rally Trims Dow's Loss to 6.48

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
A late rally in bonds helped blue-chip stocks recover from their lows yesterday, but share prices still ended the day with mild losses.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which had hit a low of around 3,304 during the day, closed down 6.48 points, at 3,331.10. Volume recovered to 173.9 million shares, from 142.5 million on Monday, and losing issues led gainers 941 to 796. 
 Special situations at some companies, including United States Surgical and Commonwealth Edison, drew heavy interest. But traders said they found few engrossing themes in the market as a whole.
Declines in overseas stock markets yesterday, including a 1.62 percent slide in Tokyo stocks, contributed to morning losses.
"It was a pretty sloppy day over all," said Robert Walberg, an analyst at MMS International. "We got a boost from what happened in the bond market."
After being virtually unchanged in the aftermath of a $15 billion auction of three-year notes, Treasury bonds shot up on news that sales at department and chain stores fell 2.7 percent in the first week of August from July.
The yield on the Treasury's 30-year benchmark bond dropped to 7.31 percent, the lowest since January 1987, from 7.36 percent on Monday.
The sales data, in a survey by the Johnson Redbook Service, raised the possibility of economic weakness that could lead to another interest rate cut, which caused traders to buy to lock in current rates.
The stock market is awaiting July producer price data, due today, which are estimated to show a one-tenth percent rise in wholesale inflation and a two-tenths percent increase excluding food and energy.
"There is a bit of wait-and-see on the political front," said Ron Hill, an investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, noting that there might be some hesitation ahead of the Republican National Convention next week. "It's pretty tame in here. It's the old backing and filling. I don't see any real drive to sell off here."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
Babies Do the Soft-Selling In New Charmin Campaign

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
PROCTER & GAMBLE is using a bunch of babies to do a pitchman's job.
The consumer-products giant is introducing animated television commercials for Charmin, the country's best-selling bathroom tissue, that use cloyingly adorable cartoon infants in an effort to recapture the success the brand enjoyed with Mr. Whipple, its annoying, though effective, advertising character. 
 Since 1985, when Mr. Whipple was dispatched to that retirement home inhabited by P.& G. ad characters like the busybody housewife Mrs. Olson (Folgers coffee), the cheerful plumber Josephine (Comet cleanser) and the helpful washing-machine repairman Charley (Dash detergent), Charmin has unrolled a spate of forgettable campaigns. The most recent commercials, which carry the theme "Everybody loves a little squeeze," feature vignettes of playful children.
Consumers may have winced during the 21 years that Mr. Whipple, a supermarket manager portrayed by the actor Dick Wilson, accosted unsuspecting shoppers who were fondling his favorite product and beseeched them: "Please, don't squeeze the Charmin." But the mnemonic device helped created an identity for the brand as "squeezably soft," an attribute highly prized in the intensely competitive battle for supremacy among bathroom-tissue makers.
"The quest of any client/agency partnership in selling a product is for a 'big idea,' " said Barnet Silver, a senior vice president and associate creative director at D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, the longtime Charmin agency in New York. "You have a big idea that lasts for a period of time, and when the consensus is that it's worn out, you search for another.
"Sometimes you're lucky, and you hit it, one, two," he added. "Sometimes you have to flounder a little while."
The new national Charmin campaign comes as the Procter & Gamble Company is struggling to overcome a slowdown in consumer spending for its pantry staples, like paper products, toothpastes, detergents and soaps, as shoppers defect to lower-priced brands.
Charmin continues to outsell the brands of rivals like the Scott Paper Company, with its Scott brand, and the James River Corporation, with Northern. But data from Information Resources Inc. in Chicago, which tracks product sales in supermarkets, suggest that Charmin's lead in the estimated $3 billion bathroom tissue market is being fueled primarily by sharp cuts in prices.
In the first quarter of this year, Information Resources reported, the number of rolls of Charmin sold climbed 30 percent, to 311 million, but revenues rose a much less robust 11.6 percent, to $76 million. So if the new ads find favor, they could help bolster Charmin's brand image, leading consumers to buy it at regular -- more profitable -- prices.
The three commercials in the campaign, which carry the theme "Charmin's so pleasable because it's so squeezable," are set in a factory that manufactures Charmin. The location is based on an actual plant in Mehoopany, Pa., near Scranton, which D.M.B.& B. executives visited.
"It was very motivating," said Eddie Binder, a vice president and management supervisor at the agency. "We came back here and started to think, 'Maybe there's an idea there.' "
Of course, the spots present no grimy, untelegenic factory. They take place in "Charmin Land," an impossibly enchanting place found only in ads, where an animated smokestack emits cute puffs of white, cloud-like smoke and the production line is run by babies who speak in squeaky voices. In the first commercial, for instance, a baby on his first day on the job fixes a fundamental piece of equipment called a "fluffer."
"We never thought of treating it literally," Mr. Binder said. "What led us to the technique of animation was that people are willing to believe a lot more when they see it in that format."
Mr. Silver interjected, "If you talk about toilet tissue in kind of a fun way, you'll endear the product to people a little more."
Mr. Binder agreed. "When I tell people I work on toilet paper," he said, "that elicits a chuckle right away.
"Fun is a good thing," he added, "but it must be done around what the brand stands for."
A most intriguing aspect of the campaign is the use of the babies, who are based on the babies appearing on Charmin packages as symbols of softness. Obviously, bathroom tissue is a product that babies do not use.
"The notion of a baby touching toilet paper is more charming than to have anybody else's hands on it," said George Rosenbaum, chief executive at Leo J. Shapiro & Associates, a Chicago market survey and consumer research company.
After all, he added, "one of the problems is, what can you say about toilet paper?"
"It's hard to talk about," he continued. "And even if you were to say everything you can't say, there isn't an awful lot to say."

HEADLINE: Next Comes the Political Review of the Free Trade Agreement

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

 BODY:
A trade agreement by Canada, Mexico and the United States cannot go into effect until it is approved by Congress. And before Congress votes next year, an important event will intervene: the election in November.
If Bill Clinton is elected President, he will certainly want to put his own stamp on the deal. That might mean reopening negotiations with the Canadians and Mexicans. Or it might mean recasting the legislation put forward by the Bush Administration to set the pact into effect. 
 If President Bush is re-elected, he will face relentless demands from Congress for more money to retrain workers who lose their jobs because of the agreement and for new assurances on environmental protection.
Most of this has almost nothing to do with trade policy and almost everything to do with politics.
 
Clinton as a Free- Trader
 At heart, Mr. Clinton is a free trader, his economic advisers report. But he has been campaigning around the country saying he could get a better trade deal for Americans than Mr. Bush has.
"I believe we could have a free trade agreement with Mexico that would be good for the country," Mr. Clinton said in Davenport, Iowa, last week, "but I don't know if it would be the kind Mr. Bush would sign."
So once in office, Mr. Clinton could hardly accept the agreement the Bush Administration has struck, without adding his own twist to it.
What is more, Mr. Clinton is a Democrat. And while labor unions, the chief opponents of the trade pact, do not have the strength in his party they once did, they do provide Democrats with essential organization, enthusiasm and money. So Mr. Clinton cannot turn his back on them.
 
Bush and the Republican Faithful
 For his own political reasons, Mr. Bush was eager to get the trade negotiations completed before the Republican convention begins next week.
First, he and his advisers want to use the convention to drive home the point that there are domestic benefits to Mr. Bush's skills in foreign affairs, and the trade pact helps the argument. Second, the Bush camp relishes the idea of using the convention as a forum for portraying Mr. Clinton as a mouthpiece for organized labor, a constituency that to the Republican faithful is tantamount to the devil.
As for Congress, countless members have promised during their own election campaigns that the trade agreement will be accompanied by ample job retraining and environmental protection measures.
Whatever Mr. Bush proposes in this regard, the lawmakers will almost certainly find insufficient, if for no other reason than to generate an issue so that they can show how they keep their campaign promises.
More than perhaps any other issue, trade causes dissonance between scholars and politicians.
Most economists have been trained that unfettered trade is the best policy, and they teach that to their students. On paper, it is the best policy. When all the economic benefits from free trade and all the benefits from protection are tallied, free trade almost always comes out ahead.
 
Votes vs. Theories
 But politics runs on votes, not theories, and most politicians at one time or another have sought protection from international competition for their constituents. That is because while many people gain a little bit from free trade, a few people are often hurt a great deal.
Not surprisingly, the ones who are really hurt are the ones who cry the loudest -- and the ones politicians tend to listen to.
In the case of the agreement with Mexico, the evidence is that it would promote economic growth, jobs and wealth throughout the continent, allow consumers to buy a greater variety of goods at lower prices and help solve the problem of illegal immigration into the United States from Mexico.
To take one small example of how ordinary people and the overall economy would benefit, almost all families in the United States would pay a few cents less for frozen, concentrated orange juice if more of it was imported from Mexico. They would have that money to save, invest or spend elsewhere, money that probably adds up to millions of dollars throughout the country.
But rare are the politicians who would take a strong stand to save their constituents a few pennies on orange juice. On the other hand, most lawmakers would go to the mat to block the plan if it put citrus growers or producers in their states out of business or cost their districts jobs.
Gary Hufbauer and Jeffrey Schott of the Institute for International Economics have calculated that by 1995, the North American Free Trade Agreement would result in about 325,000 new jobs in the United States, while costing about 150,000 jobs. That sounds favorable. But it would probably not be apparent exactly which new jobs were the consequence of the trade agreement, while it would be absolutely clear which were the ones that were lost.
The strongest supporters of the pact tend to be in states along the Mexican border. A free trade arrangement would allow businesses there to offer more goods and services to the Mexican market. And growth in the Mexican economy would mean that fewer immigrants would try to cross the border illegally.
The most vocal opponents are in the Midwest. Workers there in the automobile industry and other manufacturing industries fear companies will move their plants to Mexico to take advantage of its lower wages.
So whoever is elected in November, political blood is likely to be lost next year over the trade agreement.
Once they are in the White House, Presidents tend to be free traders, whatever their party and whatever they said during their election campaigns, and Mr. Clinton would almost certainly be no exception.
 
Presidents Take the Broad View
 On balance, every President since the Great Depression has opposed trade restrictions. Stuart E. Eizenstat, who was President Jimmy Carter's chief domestic affairs adviser, explained why.
"Unlike congressmen or senators who represent narrower interests," he said in an interview, "Presidents must represent the broader economic interests of the country and must look at trade with a foreign policy perspective."
But Presidents have not always gotten their way with Congress. Whether Mr. Bush or Mr. Clinton could is an open question.

HEADLINE: U.S. Accused of Easing Pursuit of S.& L. Cases

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 11

 BODY:
Government lawyers told a Senate panel today that Federal attempts to sue and recover money from former officials of defunct savings and loan associations had been mismanaged and relaxed in recent months. They suggested that political influence played a role in weakened Government efforts.
A lawyer with the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency responsible for cleaning up collapsed savings and loan institutions, said the agency dropped plans to sue officials of an institution around the time one of them visited with President Bush. The lawyer, Jacqueline P. Taylor, criticized the decision to resolve the matter out of court rather than to file a lawsuit as "an inappropriate settlement because of political reasons." 
 The panel, the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, also heard Ms. Taylor, two other agency lawyers and a top official of the General Accounting Office, a Congressional investigative body, tell about organizational disruptions in the Resolution Trust program to recover money from those who helped cause the collapse of hundreds of savings and loan associations.
Any reduction in recoveries by the Government from accused savings and loan wrongdoers would increase the scandal's total cost to taxpayers, now estimated at more than $200 billion.
 
An Official's Defense
 Albert V. Casey, the president of the Resolution Trust, defended his agency's efforts, including a recent organizational restructuring. He repeated his commitment that the corporation would "vigorously and effectively pursue its claims against those whose wrongdoing caused losses to the American public in connection with the widespread failures in the savings and loan industry."
Mr. Casey did not comment on the testimony of Ms. Taylor or the other attorneys, but promised the committee a reply later this month. He also acknowledged that the reorganization of the legal program involved some mistakes but denied that the mistakes had been caused by any desire to prevent aggressive investigations.
At the hearing, the committee made public a Resolution Trust personnel policy implemented earlier this year that in effect set up special hiring preferences for well-connected attorneys seeking jobs at the corporation.
At today's hearing Senator Timothy E. Wirth, Democrat of Colorado, criticized that policy, saying it suggested improper political influence. Mr. Casey, who responded that he would "take it out of effect" immediately, said that today's hearing was the first time the policy had been brought to his attention.
In pursuing those responsible for savings and loan failures, Mr. Casey said, the agency must find wrongdoing as well as determine that it is economically efficient to bring a case. About one third of all failures lead to cases, he said. He added that recent changes in the legal program were part of an effort to streamline the Resolution Trust as it moved toward completion of its business next year.
But the lawyers, supported by the Senate committee's chairman, Donald W. Riegle, a Michigan Democrat, said the most experienced lawyers were being replaced or punished, allowing potential defendants off the hook. Two other agency attorneys who today told the panel there had been mismanagement in the legal program, Bruce Pederson and Bradley Smolkin, were recently reassigned and demoted from their positions as managers.
The three lawyers also criticized a draft memorandum prepared last month as part of a Bush Administration review of proposed Government guidelines for suing officers and directors of banks and savings and loans. The guidelines, the lawyers said, would make it harder to sue directors who were not full-time employees of an institution.
Mr. Casey, in a letter earlier this month to Senator Riegel that was released at today's hearing, said he had expressed concerns to other regulators that "issuing guidelines would not be advisable, because some defendants might attempt to use such a statement for defensive purposes."
The lawyers told the committee that the question of who is sued is a sensitive issue because a number of prominent people served on the boards of savings and loan associations that failed.
A pending case in Arizona has already prompted charges of political influence. It involves a failed Phoenix savings institution, one of whose former directors is the Governor of Arizona, Fife Symington, a Republican, who is contesting charges of negligence.
According to Government records, other prominent former directors of defunct institutions include political fund-raisers; two Cabinet members, Edward Madigan, the Secretary of Agriculture and Edward J. Derwinski, the Veteran Affairs Secretary, and Neil Bush, the President's son.
 
Bush Meeting in Salt Lake City
 Ms. Taylor, until recently a section chief based in Denver, would not identify the case that was being settled coincidental with the meeting with President Bush.
But other officials, who asked not to be identified, said the institution was Deseret Federal Savings and Loan, based in Salt Lake City before it failed and was taken over by the Government in 1989. Some of Deseret's directors, officials said, had close ties to the Mormon Church, whose leaders met with President Bush last month in Salt Lake City.
A longtime outside director of the savings and loan, Howard W. Hunter, is the president of the Council of the Twelve Apostles, a high post in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints -- the church's formal name. Don LeFevre, a Mormon Church spokesman, said Mr. Hunter was one of the church officials who met with Mr. Bush but that savings and loan litigation was not discussed during the session. Asked about a possible lawsuit, Mr. LeFevre said Mr. Hunter would "see what happens when and if a lawsuit is filed."
 
Negotiations Over Deseret
 In her testimony, Ms. Taylor said agency officials dropped plans to file a lawsuit around the time of the visit with President Bush and were in the process of settling the case. Stephen Katsanos, an agency spokesman, said tonight that settlement discussions were under way over Deseret Federal, but he declined to discuss the matter further.
An associate of Mr. Hunter's, who insisted on not being identified, said he was unaware of any political influence being brought to bear on the case and added that Mr. Hunter had gone out of his way not to involve the church in the private negotiations.
In a written statement to the committee, Ms. Taylor mentioned political pressures not to pursue outside directors aggressively, violations of corporate policy and negotiations involving settlements for only small amounts of money, but she did not identify the cases at issue.

HEADLINE: China Report Sees Prison as One Big, Happy Jail

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Aug. 11

 BODY:
The Government sought today to rebut Western criticisms by issuing a major report on conditions in Chinese prisons. But it painted such a glowing portrait of prison life that skeptics are unlikely to be convinced.
The white paper, "Criminal Reform in China," is part of a broad effort by the authorities to counter allegations of torture, hunger and slave labor in what critics call China's "gulag." The report includes numerous statistics, but its tone is so far removed from what former prisoners have said that it is unclear how reliable the figures are. 
 "After the founding of the People's Republic, the people's government established a new kind of socialist prison, where the prisoners are regarded as human beings, where their dignity is respected, their personal safety is insured and they receive fully humane treatment," the report declared.
It contrasted these conditions with prisons before the 1949 revolution. In those days, it said, Americans and Chinese agents together "savagely tortured and secretly murdered revolutionaries."
China's huge prison network is one of the country's great mysteries. There is little comprehensive information and foreigners are allowed to visit only model institutions, like Beijing No. 1 Prison. In such visits, some prisoners try so hard to please the authorities that they insist to reporters that they do not want to leave when their sentences expire.
In fact, former prisoners interviewed privately have almost unanimously reported that conditions are brutal, with beatings and other torture a way of life. Almost all have said that food is awful and insufficient, and that some favorite felons known as "cell bosses" are allowed to abuse others in any way they want.
Prison conditions have become an issue in Chinese-American relations, both because of United States concerns about human rights violations of political prisoners and because of evidence that products made by Chinese prisoners are being illegally exported to the United States.
 
Prison Labor
 The report issued today said that 90 percent of the prison population participates in labor, while the rest are excused because they are old, disabled or otherwise unfit to work. But it said the total value of prison goods in 1990 was about $500 million, less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the nation's total economic output.
"Some news reports are very distorted and turn black into white," said Zhao Shaohua, an official of the State Council Information Office, which edited the 26-page white paper. "We want to use this report so that the world can understand our legal work."
The State Council issued a similar white paper, on human rights, a year ago. Most diplomats regard such materials as important less in the arguments they make than in the implication that such issues are now open for discussion and that China will debate and defend its human rights record.
The human rights report at least acknowledged lapses in some areas, while the report on prisons today moved from one glowing high note to the next.
One of the few indications that anything goes wrong is the statement that in 1990 and 1991 a total of 24 wardens and guards were themselves imprisoned for beating up detainees.
In another public relations gesture, a Chinese-backed magazine in Hong Kong recently published photos of prominent dissidents smiling in their prison cells.
 
Photos of Political Prisoner
 The most important among them were two photos of Wei Jingsheng, China's best-known political prisoner, who is now serving the 14th year of a 15-year prison sentence.
The photos of Mr. Wei were the first to emerge of him since his trial, and they show him looking relaxed, cheerful and apparently healthy.
One photo shows him smiling, displaying his teeth, apparently to counter reports in the West that a poor diet caused his teeth to fall out. It is impossible to tell from the photo if his teeth are real.

WELFARE ROLLS KEEP CLIMBING
In the most telling sign of the tremendous human damage the city's economic woes have caused, the number of New Yorkers on welfare broke the one million mark last month for the first time since the city's fiscal crisis in the 1970's. Most of the newcomers are unskilled workers who have had trouble competing for jobs in the recession, many economists and state officials said. A1.
 
FLAWS FOUND IN BRIDGE INSPECTIONS 
 New York City bridge inspectors have grossly overstated the amount of time they spend checking the city's smaller bridges to determine whether they are safe, an 18-month investigation by the City Council and the City Comptroller shows. The investigators blamed the Dinkins administration for failing to adequately supervise the city's bridge inspectors in determining whether they do their jobs. But they would not say who specifically was at fault or whether the bridges were unsafe as a result. B3.

To black residents, however, the proposal for a K-9 patrol conjured images of a time when police used dogs to dissolve peaceful civil rights demonstrations. Debate over the issue laid open long-standing hostilities in the city, and most people are glad it did. B5.
 
SIGNATURES HAUNT ROCKEFELLER
Larry Rockefeller, the environmental lawyer seeking to challenge Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato in the Republican primary on Sept. 15, appeared to have lost his place on the ballot when too many of the signatures he had collected were declared invalid by the State Board of Elections, his lawyer said.

NO INDICTMENT IN A BUS CRASH
The families of Long Island schoolchildren involved in a bus accident in upstate New York last spring reacted with shock and disappointment to the news that the driver of the bus would not face criminal charges. An Essex County grand jury decided not to indict the driver on two counts of criminally negligent homicide in the accident that killed two children and injured many others. But he still faces civil suits. B4.

HEADLINE: Using Art as Creative Teaching Force

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d

 BODY:
The art lesson in a recent workshop was no ordinary one: the students were teachers. They were asked to empty their purses and pockets and, on a white sheet of paper, create a face using as few of the items as possible. .
One face was simply a pair of sunglasses. Another was single earring representing a mouth. A third was a profile created by a necklace forming a forehead, a nose and a chin. 
 "This shows you that art can be anything," said Donald Olsen, a band and orchestra teacher at Eastchester High School in Eastchester, N.Y., and one of 30 teachers participating in the workshop at the Lincoln Center Institute for the Arts in Education. "It gives you a different way of looking at things."
It was also an example of a teaching concept known as esthetic education, which aims not only to promote a broader understanding of the arts but to encourage teachers to think differently and more creatively in everything they do. Another aim is to foster the recognition that the arts are a positive experience to which all people should be exposed.
 
Promoting Art for 17 Years
 The institute, the education arm of the Lincoln Center for Performing Arts, has been promoting esthetic education since it was founded 17 years ago. The program includes the workshop for teachers, and it takes plays, concerts and dance performances to students during the academic year or brings the students to Lincoln Center to see the performances.
The teacher education component is something virtually no other program has. Schools from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut pay $2,500 to $5,000 to participate.
Practitioners say esthetic education, championed early in this century by the educator and philosopher John Dewey, produces ripple effects far beyond expanding understanding of the arts.
Teachers say esthetic education training can accomplish three other goals: it helps them integrate the arts into courses like history, literature and even mathematics and science; it helps insure that even in times of recession the arts are not entirely eliminated through budget cuts, and it helps a child's self-esteem, because in the arts there is no single "correct" approach.
 
Beyond 'Assembly Lines'
 "Most of our schools are G.M. assembly lines," said Michael Moore, the director of Arts Unlimited in Bowling Green, Ohio, a program modeled after the one at the Lincoln Center Institute. "They do the same thing over and over. This is one of the reasons our schools are in trouble.
"Esthetic education is a lot messier. Esthetic education keeps asking, 'What if?' and 'Why not?' Esthetic education says there isn't one right answer."
For these reasons, the concept is also sometimes difficult for many teachers to grasp, accustomed as they are to the structured atmosphere of a public school. But teachers exposed to esthetic education at the Lincoln Center Institute workshops say the experience helped break down traditional thought processes and encouraged them to think more expansively.
One participant, Eddie Maldonado, for instance, a special education teacher at Salk Middle School in Old Bridge, N.J., said that when she now teaches history, she introduces the music of the era, and in her literature class the paintings of the period are discussed.
For science and math teachers, the application of the arts is more of a stretch. But several teachers said that art, in fact, could help them make the hard-core disciplines more accessible to students.
In another workshop exercise, teachers carved four potatoes into various shapes and sizes. From the exercise, Francine Kaalund, who teaches science to students in grades 6 through 9 at Middle School 158 in Bayside, Queens, had an idea to let her students supplement textbook lessons in the development of the frog by carving potatoes to show its growth from tadpole to adult.
Some educators say there is little research data to support the notion that the arts can help in the instruction of subjects like math and science. "The evidence that a good arts program can improve performance in non-arts areas is thin," said Howard Gardner, a Harvard University psychologist.
Educators and some policy makers lament that the arts are still regarded as an enrichment rather than a staple. Others argue that at a time when many schools are having trouble paying for and maintaining the basics, the arts should be viewed as enrichment.
"I don't see it as a budget trade off," said Ernest L. Boyer, the president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching in Princeton, N.J., who was recently named chairman of the Lincoln Center Institute's Board of Directors.
Mr. Boyer said incorporating the arts into literature and history, for example, requires only a teacher who can do so. "The arts have been pushed to the edges, as a frill, and considered something we can come back to when everything else is covered," he said. "It's been one of the real tragedies in the American education philosophy."

HEADLINE: Cutback in Military Spending: No Help for Ailing Economy

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Not since the 1950's has the United States recovered from recession while military spending was falling sharply. But now that the cold war is over, America is struggling to do just that, and finding it difficult.
The precipitous drop in military spending in the last 18 months has eroded an important pillar of the economy, and many economists say that is a big reason that the United States is now having such trouble pulling out of recession. 
 While critics of military spending have long argued that the money and manpower could be better employed in the civilian sector, virtually no one questions that military spending has served as a powerful source of economic demand.
"There has not been a time when a rise in defense spending would mean more for the economy than now," said Alicia Munnell, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. "We are growing so slowly that defense spending can make the difference between a rising unemployment rate and a falling one."
The military budget authorization -- $286.7 billion in the current fiscal year, adjusted for inflation -- has been falling at more than 5 percent a year since 1990, notwithstanding the fighting in Kuwait. That is twice as steep as the rate of decline in the late 1980's.
But among all categories of military spending, the greatest damage to the economy has come from the cutback in procurement spending: orders placed with factories. It has been falling by more than 12 percent a year since 1990. And under President Bush's budget proposal now before Congress, the sum will drop another 13 percent in fiscal 1993. Procurement has a multiplier effect, creating jobs not only at military contractors but also at the companies that make the consumer goods the well-paid military workers buy.
DRI/McGraw-Hill, an economic consulting service, estimates that this lower level of military spending "probably cuts one-quarter of a percentage point off economic growth," said David Wyss, DRI's chief economist. "That is a considerable drag in a nearly stagnant economy growing at less than 1.5 percent a year."
Nor has the drain ended. Continued cutbacks by military contractors sliced 17,000 jobs in July, the biggest single-month decline in military contractor employment since the recession began in July 1990. Certain areas, like Southern California, are being hit especially hard. And industry executives suggest considerable shrinkage is still to come.
For four decades, military spending has accounted for an average of more than 7 percent of the nation's annual output of goods and services, seldom falling below 5 percent even during earlier cutbacks. Today that level has shrunk to just about 5.5 percent of the gross domestic product, and most projections see it sinking below 4 percent by 1997.
"The impact is bigger than you can see by just looking at the numbers," said Herbert Stein, a senior economist at the American Enterprise Institute.
Two other big cutbacks in military spending have occurred since the cold war began in 1950, after the Korean War and after Vietnam. But neither hit the economy with as much force as the current reduction in military spending.
Soaring consumer demand, very much absent today, helped to offset the military cutback in the early 1950's. "It was only after the Korean War that Americans finally decided that we would not go back to the Great Depression, and they let go and spent," said Robert Gordon, a Northwestern University economist.
The continuing Government outlays for Lyndon Johnson's Great Society programs -- economic stimulus also absent today -- helped to counteract the Vietnam military cutback, which began in 1968. Even so, both cutbacks contributed to brief recessions, in 1957-1958 and in 1970.
This time, military spending actually peaked as far back as the fiscal year 1985, and has been falling ever since. But much of the damage to the economy -- and particularly to jobs -- did not hit until more recently. As long as the cold war held out the promise of renewed weapons making, military contractors waited out the lean years -- as they did in the 1950's and 1960's -- keeping their operations largely intact. But with the abrupt dissolution of the Soviet Union, that promise is gone.
Now leading military companies like General Dynamics, Hughes Aircraft, Raytheon and General Electric are shrinking their operations in anticipation of permanently lower sales, and their actions will ripple through the economy as workers lose jobs.
"We don't see the traditional rebound that has characterized downturns in defense spending in the past, and we are preparing ourselves on that basis," said James Cunnane, a senior vice president at General Dynamics, which makes warplanes, armored vehicles and submarines.
In just 19 months, General Dynamics has eliminated 17,000 jobs, shrinking its work force by nearly 20 percent. And there have been similar rapid layoffs across the industry, as military contractors increasingly find themselves behaving as any other company forced to compete for shrinking business would.
"There used to be more contracts and the revenue base was bigger so you could support more costs, but those days are gone," said Sheldon Rutstein, chief financial officer at Raytheon, maker of the Patriot Missile and other military hardware. Raytheon, which held employment in its military operations above 75,000 through 1990, has now reduced its work force to 68,200.
"We are well aware that our competitors are taking similar steps," Mr. Rutstein said, "so we have to be one step better to be in a position to pull in the next contract."
 
Employment
Timing of Layoffs Couldn't Be Worse
 Nowhere is the effect of the more vigorous cutbacks in the military supply industry more evident than in the Labor Department's monthly employment statistics.
Until the summer of 1990, employment at military contractors -- the hundreds of companies that receive 50 percent or more of their revenues from sales to the military -- hardly fell. The job rolls at these companies, which reached a high of 1.44 million in 1987, declined by only 33,000 in the following three years.
"For a long time, people in the industry thought they would get well, that orders would rise, but the orders clearly were not coming," said Gordon Adams, director of the Defense Budget Project at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington research group.
When the Berlin wall fell and the Soviet Union collapsed, the reductions began in earnest. Beginning in the middle of 1990, employment at military contractors plunged by more than 100,000 a year, falling to 1.19 million last month. That decline -- of some 225,000 people -- represents 15 percent of the 1.47 million jobs that have disappeared during the current recession, which began in July 1990.
"The timing for such steps could not have been worse," said John E. Bregger, an economist at the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. "Just when we need a boost from defense, we get a negative."
Many jobs are being lost in California and the Northeast, but hundreds of communities elsewhere are also affected as the contractors slice orders to their suppliers. General Electric's Aerospace division, for example, is shrinking its network of about 2,000 suppliers by 50 percent -- using the best supplier of, say, wire harnesses to sell to all of G.E.'s 13 aerospace plants, instead of having each plant buy from a different company.
Compounding the problem, military workers earn among the highest hourly wages in the nation, usually well above the national average of $10.58 an hour. When their jobs disappear, consumer spending, on which a recovery depends, suffers more than if a lower-paid retail store clerk or office worker is laid off.
What's more, the armed forces have shed 160,000 people since 1990, and now stand at just over two million men and women. That is only 1.6 percent of the total labor force -- the lowest percentage since World War II. The cutback has been particularly painful for high school graduates, especially minorities, for whom the armed services have been an important source of jobs. Blacks account for 20.6 percent of the men and women in the military.
 
Remedies
Conversion Proves To Be Difficult
 Despite the bounty of military spending, critics like Robert M. Solow, the Nobel laureate in economic science, and Albert T. Sommers, senior economist at the Conference Board, have argued that the same money used to develop civilian technologies could have made the United States more competitive with other nations, not less competitive. The same dollars invested in rapid transit or housing or fiber-optic networks, they say, might have created more jobs and more national wealth than the investment in weaponry.
"It is crazy that we should need to have defense lead the way in public spending," said Paul Krugman, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
But the question now is whether, as military spending shrinks, any other source of spending or investment will take its place. The cold war persuaded Americans to support big Government outlays for weapons, even running up big budget deficits in the process. But now that the Soviet Union has disappeared as an enemy, there appears to be little national resolve to divert such huge sums into other public spending -- even spending that is thought to lay the foundation for a stronger economy and greater productivity later.
The Bush Administration and the military contractors themselves are trying various remedies. Some $7 billion in Federal money has been earmarked to promote conversion to civilian production, through grants for job training and communities dependent on military contractors. In St. Louis, for instance, McDonnell-Douglas has laid off 10,000 workers in the last 18 months.
But conversion is difficult in a recession, when existing manufacturers of consumer goods or machinery cannot sell what they already produce. Even small companies like Essex Industries in St. Louis, which has switched from making breathing devices for pilots to oxygen equipment for patients, do not make an immediate contribution to the economy. Employment at Essex has shrunk from 500 to 400 and raises are scarce for workers whose average pay is $12 an hour. "We were in a position to grant a 4 percent raise in February, and we hope we can grant another in the future, but only if the company performs well enough," said Eugene Corn, a vice president. "To put it simplistically, there is a dry period between the time you develop a product and the time you can sell it, and we are in that valley now."
Rather than convert, the leading military contractors are turning to exports for relief. Raytheon, for example, hopes that by 1996, it can export 40 percent of its radars, missiles and tactical weapons, up from 20 percent today.
But with the end of the cold war, there is a lot of competition abroad. The former Soviet Union is also trying to sell its military hardware, as the FMC Corporation's Ground Systems division in San Jose, Calif., discovered. The company lined up a sale of armored personnel carriers to the United Arab Emirates, only to learn that the Emirates decided to buy used equipment from Russia instead.

HEADLINE: Proposal To Double Park Area On the Shore

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
The Dinkins administration announced a long-range plan for New York City's waterfront yesterday that would eventually double the area for parks, esplanades and walkways while preventing gargantuan developments that wall off the shoreline.
The ambitious proposals foresee an esplanade that would virtually encircle Manhattan. Waterside pathways would also be built along the shore in Long Island City, Queens; next to the Harlem River in the Bronx, and rimming most of Brooklyn's south shore and Staten Island's north shore. 
 The heart of the administration's plan is a proposal to revamp the zoning laws to force developers to build smaller, lower buildings and provide the public access to the shore.
The zoning changes would forbid using underwater land when figuring the permissible size of a building. It would also require builders to let streets continue through to the water so that the rivers and harbors are not blocked from view. Developers would be required to leave a fifth of the land on which they build for park space.
"We're trying to change building that seals off the waterfront from the rest of the city and creates a wall," said Rosina K. Abramson, the executive director of the City Planning Department.
Anticipated for years, the plan knits together dozens of unconnected designs by public and private groups into a cohesive and unified vision, public officials and environmentalists said. The weighty document marks the first time since New York enacted its initial zoning law in 1916 that the city will have special requirements for waterfront developments to include open space.
 
Hearings in the Fall
 Every facet of the plan will take months or years to complete and must eventually be approved by the City Council. This fall, the City Planning Commission will hold hearings on the plan and make changes. The Council is expected to take up the zoning changes next spring.
The plan was immediately praised by neighborhood groups, politicians and environmentalists, who have long argued that the city could reap economic benefits from more recreational and commercial amenities on its waterways. Such development has spurred growth in cities such as Baltimore, Boston, Toronto, Seattle and San Francisco.
"It really portrays a vision for the use of the waterfront in Manhattan and the rest of the city that is right on target," said Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President. "City Hall has moved the waterfront to the forefront."
But developers questioned the wisdom of the proposed zoning changes. Building on the water is expensive, they said, since it often requires new sewers, roads and pilings. By reducing the size of projects and the number of apartments with water views, they said, the city could end up making most new projects unprofitable.
"If you are going to overly restrict development from a design and a density point of view, our question is, 'Will there be viable opportunities along the waterfront?' " said Michael Slattery, senior vice president of the Real Estate Board of New York. "Collectively these regulations may be a discouragement for development."
The plan recommends hundreds of projects, including these:
*In Manhattan, the plan envisions a 270-acre park with esplanades and public piers on the West Side from Battery Park City to 59th Street. It would also construct dozens of esplanades to close gaps at various points, including the riverfront between Donald Trump's proposed Riverside South development and 72d Street and gaps in lower Manhattan at Pier A, the Whitehall Ferry Terminal, the Battery Maritime Building and north of the South Street Seaport.
*In the Bronx, the plan proposes a new park at the Hunts Point Marine Transfer Station Site, once the Sanitation Department shuts down its operation there. It would also build a new esplanade along the Bronx River from West 165th Street to 225th Street that would be connected to the Harlem Beach park over one of the bridges in the area. In addition, it recommends a series of esplanades, boat launches and fishing piers in Soundview, Ferry Point and Pugsley Creek Parks in the eastern Bronx.
*In Brooklyn, the city proposes developing the six piers in Brooklyn Heights in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge to allow the public greater access. It also proposes linking the Shore Parkway bike path to Coney Island.
*On Staten Island, the plan recommends completing the North Shore Esplanade that would run from the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to the Ferry Terminal and then along the northern shore to Snug Harbor. It also recommends creating a new beach at Cedar Grove Avenue on the southern shore.
*In Queens, the administration has proposed redeveloping most of the Long Island City waterfront to increase public access and link existing parks. It also would limit public access to the natural areas around Jamaica Bay.
The plan proposes establishing nature preserves along about a third of the city's shoreline, including Jamaica Bay, the Harbor Herons Complex on the eastern shore of Staten Island, and parts of Long Island Sound and the upper East River.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Central Banks' Intervention Helps to Prop Up the Dollar

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve Bank coordinated a dollar-buying spree yesterday with a dozen European central banks to keep the dollar from drifting any closer to its all-time low against the German mark. But the action lifted the dollar only slightly.
The Fed's intervention, its third in three weeks, was apparently aimed at keeping the dollar from going down so far that it bred panic in currency and stock markets. The buying was also intended, traders said, to prevent the dollar from hitting a record low that could be politically embarassing to President Bush during an election year.
The dollar closed at 1.4669 German marks, up from Monday's close at 1.4630 marks, and a cut above the all-time low of 1.4475, set on Feb. 11, 1991. The Fed began buying when the dollar fell to 1.4620, traders said, and waded into the market repeatedly during the day. 
 The dollar rose to 128.00 Japanese yen in late New York trading from Monday's 127.90. In Tokyo overnight, before trading began in Europe, the dollar closed at 127.91 yen, down 0.01 yen from Monday's close. In afternoon trading in London, the dollar was quoted at 128.05 yen.
Chris Bourdain, manager of foreign exchange sales at Credit Suisse New York, said the Fed and other central banks wanted to assure traders that they would set a floor to the dollar's price and they wanted to demonstrate a coordinated policy.
"But that glosses over the very big differences in interest rate policy," he said. "Europe is anti-inflation, and the U.S. is pro-growth, and that's about as opposite as you can get."
The dollar's sharp drop in recent months has followed a yawning discrepancy between short-term interest rates in the United States and Germany: the former are at their lowest point in 30 years; the latter at their highest in 50 years. A higher payoff in interest rates lures investors from the United States to Germany, and from dollars to marks.
As usual, Fed officials declined comment. A spokesman for the Bundesbank, which participated in the buying, said that the action was taken at the initiative of the Fed, Reuters reported.
The Fed and the Bank of Canada bought dollars last Friday, traders said, but yesterday's concert of central bank buying was the first since July 20, when the dollar fell to 1.4473 marks and then lifted to 1.4937 marks.
Despite yesterday's mixed results, foreign exchange traders said they expected the Fed to re-enter the market again, and as often as necessary to keep the dollar from falling sharply. One trader estimated that the Fed bought between $600 million and $800 million in dollars yesterday.
"They are most concerned about confidence in the dollar," said a foreign exchange manager, citing both the economic and political concerns of Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. "The last thing Brady needs is a record low."

HEADLINE: Increase in Labor Costs Is Slowest in 17 Years

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 11

 BODY:
American labor costs, held back by the weak economy, have risen this year at the slowest pace in 17 years, while productivity posted a healthy gain in the spring, the Government said Tuesday.
The Labor Department said that unit labor costs for nonfarm businesses inched up at an annual rate of three-tenths of 1 percent in the April-June quarter, following a barely perceptible rate of advance of one-tenth of 1 percent from January through March. 
 As for productivity, defined as output per hour of work, it posted a third consecutive healthy gain of 2.3 percent, annualized, in the spring. That followed rates of 2.5 percent in last year's fourth quarter and a giant 3.8 percent advance from January through March, the best productivity showing in five years.
 
Increases in Productivity
 For the second quarter, the productivity increase was led by a big 4.7 percent rate of advance in manufacturing, reflecting strong gains in production of durable goods, which are long-lasting items like cars.
Economists were encouraged by both the pickup in productivity gains and the extremely low increases in unit labor costs, saying the figures should translate into better profits for American companies and continued good news on inflation.
The gains, however, are a direct reflection of the stagnant economy, which has caused widespread layoffs, driven unemployment up to a current level of 7.7 percent and put severe downward pressure on wages.
"Four years of a moribund economy have played a large role in breaking the back of inflation," said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Company. "We have set the stage for the lowest rates of inflation in 30 years."
Mr. Sinai said that instead of consumer prices rising at an annual rate of 4 percent to 5 percent, he was looking for the underlying rate of inflation to be between 2 percent and 3 percent.
"We have had a full year of markedly lower rises in unit labor costs and that historically has signaled a sea change in the underlying rate of inflation," he said. "A beneficial side effect of this dismal economy should be lower rates of inflation for a long, long time."
The Government was scheduled to report on Wednesday the performance of wholesale prices in July followed by the consumer price report on Thursday. Analysts were looking for small increases in both reports of around two-tenths or three-tenths of a percent.
Economists were also encouraged by the gains in productivity this year although they cautioned that much of this strength could be related to the fact that productivity normally increases in the early stages of an economic recovery as businesses are cautious about hiring back laid-off workers and instead get more output from a reduced work force.
For all of last year, productivity barely budged, rising just one-tenth of 1 percent as both output and employment plunged.
Productivity growth averaged just above 1 percent in both the 1970's and the 1980's, far worse than the 2.5 percent annual gains posted from 1947 to 1967.
Economists said that until the United States finds a way to reverse the long-term slide in productivity, American standards of living will continue under severe downward pressure.
David Wyss, an economist at DRI-McGraw Hill Inc. of Lexington, Mass., said he was hopeful that the United States would be able to post better gains in productivity in the 1990's than it did in the last decade because the labor force will be older and more experienced.
But he said significant improvement in United States productivity would not come until government and private investment levels increased substantially.
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the Democratic Presidential candidate, has made investment a central part of his economic program and the Bush Administration is also searching for ways to bolster long-term investment.
"We are still suffering from a lack of investment that got worse in the 1980's," Mr. Wyss said. "It is hard to get productivity growth without investment."

HEADLINE: 7 Black Hospitals Struggle to Find A Modern Role

BYLINE: By MARIA ODUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 11

 BODY:
Not long after the turn of the century, the nation had about 200 hospitals built primarily to serve blacks. For black health-care professionals, they were meccas. For black patients, they were welcome alternatives to being treated in neglected corners of segregated hospitals.
Today, long after the tight fist of lawful segregation loosened its grip, only seven historically black hospitals remain, and health-care experts say some of them have only a faint pulse. While historically black colleges, newspapers and other businesses found their niches in the post-segregation era, black hospitals seem to have had trouble redefining their role. 
 "Black hospitals are in very dire straits right now," said Dr. Vanessa Gamble, an assistant professor of the history of medicine and preventive medicine at the University of Wisconsin Medical School. "For most of them, I don't think the future is very bright."
The hospitals serve large numbers of patients who are poor and underinsured. They include Howard University Hospital in Washington; Norfolk Community Hospital, Richmond Community Hospital and Newport News General Hospital in Virginia; Southeast Specialty Hospital in Greensboro, N.C.; Meharry/Hubbard Hospital in Nashville, and Riverside General in Houston. In some cases, 50 percent of emergency-room patients cannot pay for services.
That financial drain was a leading factor in the hospitals' decline, some health experts say. But others blame desegregation for the decline because the end of segregation fostered an exodus of blacks to white-run businesses, as blacks exercised their right of choice, rather than bringing whites to black-run institutions.
A group called the Coalition to Save the Black Hospital plans to ask the Federal Department of Health and Human Services for financial assistance. The group is made up of representatives of black health-care organizations, other black health-care professionals and the administrators of eight historically black hospitals, including one that recently closed, and four hospitals that became predominantly controlled by blacks after shifts in population.
 
Request for $500 Million
 The coalition's chairman, Dr. Bernard Bridges, said the hospitals needed about $500 million, an amount "comparable to the cost of a Stealth bomber," over five years to pay for replacing equipment, hiring new staff members, expanding facilities and paying off debts.
"We want to be able to demonstrate to H.H.S. that if they are serious about treating poor, disabled and elderly people, then we have a core population that is situated in proximity to these hospitals that can get services there with sensitivity and dignity," said Dr. Bridges, a medical consultant for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. He added that the coalition had begun negotiating with H.H.S. but had not submitted a final proposal.
Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, said in an interview that Federal funds for private, black-run hospitals would be possible "if there are special situations" in which individual hospitals may need "short-term support for a special problem or to launch a special program."
Citing studies that show blacks receive less medical care than whites and have a higher infant-mortality rate, health-care experts and civil rights leaders say there is still a need for black hospitals, many of which have a small percentage of white patients. "These hospitals continue to serve a very vital purpose in the black community," said the Rev. Joseph E. Lowery, president of the S.C.L.C. "Adequate and affordable health care continues to move farther and farther away from those who need it most."
Historically, the hospitals were important community resources, said Dr. James A. Goodman Sr., president of the Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta. "They provided mentoring opportunities and were an economic force in the community," he said. "The role has diminished because of marketplace forces."
The first black-run hospital was Provident Hospital in Chicago, founded in 1891 by Dr. Daniel Hale Williams, who performed one of the first successful open-heart surgeries there in 1893. By 1920 there were about 200 of them, but about 56 black hospitals closed between 1961 and 1988, and 15 were either merged or consolidated with other hospitals or changed into institutions no longer controlled by blacks.
Reflecting on the time he worked for Provident Hospital, from 1984 to 1986, Craig May, now a senior public-information officer for the American Medical Association, said: "There was a sense of pride that I felt, a kind of swelling inside of me, when I saw all these black men and women wearing stethoscopes around their necks or carrying test tubes. We used to let black kids have tours to let them know that the medical profession is one where they could excel."
He said that on weekends, the hospital treated a succession of patients after assaults, drug overdoses or alcohol-related accidents. "And a lot of people would come because it was cold outside and they didn't have anywhere else to go," he said. "They'd say their stomach hurt or their head hurt, just to have a place to sleep. Everybody knew Provident was not going to ask if you could pay for your service. The hospital viewed its mission as caring for black people, and to its dying day, it stayed true to its mission."
Provident Hospital closed in September 1987, in the face of climbing debt and a decline in patients.
Dr. David Satcher, president of Meharry Medical College in Nashville, which is affiliated with Meharry/ Hubbard Hospital, described a special role for that hospital and Howard University Hospital. "Howard and Meharry provide leadership in African-American health care and are on the forefront of researching diseases that affect African-Americans, like sickle cell and cancer," he said.
Meharry/Hubbard Hospital appears to be likely to merge with a white-dominated public hospital, Metropolitan Nashville General Hospital, a measure that challenges Meharry/ Hubbard's status as a black hospital. The Nashville Metropolitan City Council will take a final vote on the merger proposal on Tuesday. Under the agreement, the city's hospital will eventually move its services to Meharry/Hubbard Hospital, which it will lease for 30 years. The merger is intended to help the city avoid having to rebuild or completely renovate its antiquated hospital and would allow the city to free Meharry from the financial drain created by serving so many people who cannot pay.
The largest historically black hospital is Howard University Hospital, which is 140 years old and has 479 beds. It lost $38 million in the last three years and was only able to pull itself out of the red after taking measures like laying off 218 employees last year, said Kevin Lofton, the hospital's administrator. Other black hospitals, like Newport News General Hospital, have had to seek bankruptcy protection.
Despite their financial problems, black hospitals perform a service by training black physicians, officials of the hospitals say.
"When you get into specialty categories like neurosurgery, ophthalmology and plastic surgery, then a large number of blacks are trained at black schools," Mr. Lofton said. "It is still difficult for black physicians to get into training programs in these high-specialty areas."
To shore up their financial base, black hospitals are trying to woo the black middle class with everything from friendlier faces to community outreach programs.
"The remaining institutions really must find a common thread that would tie them together in some way that will let them find a niche and that would let them develop a special, viable approach to helping the black community," said Nathaniel Wesley Jr., director of planning at Howard University Hospital, who has been doing research on black hospitals for 15 years. "We can't be all things to all people. We need to find out what our remaining institutions need to do best and then strike out and do that."

HEADLINE: Fixed-Price Lessons, At $19.92 a Customer

BYLINE: By TRISH HALL

 BODY:
SAN DOMENICO, an elegant Italian restaurant on Central Park South with leather chairs and ocher walls, is often sparsely populated at lunch time. But this month, San Domenico is packed. So, too, is the Gotham Bar and Grill, Le Perigord, the Sign of the Dove and other restaurants with reputations for good food but images of being too expensive or too forbidding for most New Yorkers.
It took a bargain to bring restaurant madness back to New York. 
 Since the Democratic National Convention was held here in mid-July, about 50 restaurants have been offering a three-course lunch for $19.92, not including tax or tip. While that is hardly a cheap lunch, it is less than the restaurants otherwise charge for three courses. The promotion has attracted so many people to the restaurants that some owners, already committed to continuing the bargain until Labor Day, are thinking of prolonging it into the fall. Many hope a similar promotion will be organized next summer.
The surge has brought an energy to the business that is reminiscent of the mid-1980's, when going to restaurants rather than the theater or opera became the definition of an exciting time out. "I had somebody walk in who said they had gone to every restaurant that was doing this," said Anne Rosenzweig, the chef and co-owner of Arcadia, at 21 East 62nd Street. "It's become a New York thing to do."
Although profits are lower on the $19.92 lunches, owners said that the sight of bustling restaurants, and the possibility of drawing new customers, has been beneficial. "We have to concentrate on getting the restaurant busy, on creating a sense of excitement about going out again," said Tony May, the owner of San Domenico, where the promotion has more than doubled weekday lunch business, from about 30 a day to 70. "Of course, I don't make money on it. But right now, I am losing money anyway. We want to get people in the restaurant."
The promotion was originally organized by Tim Zagat, the restaurant-guide publisher, and Joseph Baum, the restaurateur, as a nice extra for delegates and New Yorkers during the convention. They did not expect that some of the 100 or so restaurants that originally participated would suddenly get thousands of calls a day.
"The reaction surprised all of us," Mr. Zagat said. Although the passion for a bargain has subsided, it has not stopped. Diners who had been looking for the best deal on a grilled chicken in a takeout shop are roaming from top restaurant to top restaurant, trying their $19.92 specials.
These lunchers are like an army of reviewers, rating restaurants on whether they offer too little choice, or too small portions. Esther Frankel, who ate lunch last week at the Sign of the Dove, at 1110 Third Avenue at East 65th Street, with Nina Shulman, her daughter, said there was not much crab in her pasta. "And the coffee wasn't hot," she said. "We sent it back."
A critical approach is not surprising in a demanding populace that can find the downside in anything, from a drop in subway crime to falling housing prices. Some of the complaints have been legitimate. Some restaurants have reduced portions; some have offered the cheapest dishes from their menus. Restaurant owners, too, have had plenty to say, off the record, about those who do not deliver the goods. But there has also been a lot of praise, and much goodwill created by certain restaurants.
Maureen Quinn, who was eating lunch last week at Le Perigord on East 52nd Street with two friends from work, Addy Zeni and Barbara Levy, praised the formal French restaurant, usually a haunt for United Nations diplomats. "They don't make you feel like you're less because you're only paying $19.92," she said.
She and her friends have been to Le Perigord twice to sample the bargain lunch, which for the entree includes a choice of veal in a light mustard sauce, boneless quail with shredded vegetables, or salmon in a white wine, tomato and herb sauce. (They were also offered on the usual lunch menu, which costs $29 for three courses but offers many more choices.) Without publicity on the promotion, "we would never have come here," Ms. Zeni said. "We had a perception that it was too much money."
Restaurant owners like the promotion because it draws customers without devaluing image, mainly because prestigious restaurants have joined in. A single restaurant, cutting prices, would not necessarily have benefited.
"If I would go out on my own, I would look as if I were discounting the restaurant," said George Briguet, the owner of Le Perigord, where weekday lunch business has increased to 150 diners a day from 40.
About a dozen restaurant owners who were interviewed said that they make little money on the $19.92 lunches because food costs take up a larger-than-usual portion of the price ultimately charged. Many restaurant owners aim to cover their food costs with 25 percent of the total bill, knowing they will profit because the balance of the price will be more than enough to cover costs for labor, rent, fuel, flowers and the like. In the bargain lunches, food costs often are as high as 40 percent of the check, leaving less to cover other expenses.
To keep food costs down, some chefs are trying new techniques. David Bouley, the chef and owner of Bouley, at 165 Duane Street, has already sold out the $19.92 lunch, which he is offering weekdays through August, using all organic ingredients and promoting the farms that provide them. He uses expensive ingredients like chanterelles on his regular menus, but the lower-priced menus rely more on things like celery. Using those ingredients but still meeting his usual standards, he said, requires cooking with "more love and effort."
Does the lower-priced lunch mean that restaurants could emerge from their doldrums if they simply lowered prices? The owners are trying to figure that out. Generally, they said that they make so little on the lunches that they need large volume to compensate, and that they are not sure the volume would continue if the lower prices were to become permanent.
Some restaurants stopped the promotion after the first week. "We were afraid we were going to alienate a lot of our regular guests who were finding it difficult to get reservations for lunch," said Danny Meyer, the owner of the Union Square Cafeat 21 East 16th Street, which was deluged with calls during the promotion.
The lower prices have prompted some to get out of the office and eat well. A group of editors from Dell Puzzle Magazine, after a lunch at the Sign of the Dove, said they would not have eaten there at regular prices. "We would have gotten a pizza," Stacey Peltz said.
William Barr, who was meeting friends from Florida at the Dove, said that they would have eaten there anyway, but that the price was an extra incentive. "With the economy the way it is, you look for things like this," said Mr. Barr, a retired banker.
To some extent, owners risk providing food at less profit to customers who would have eaten out anyway. When Randy Hynote decided to organize a business lunch last week at the Gotham Bar and Grill at 12 East 12th Street, he did not know it was offering the special. "I came here because it's excellent food," he said.
Sometimes, the bargain does not mean a lower check. Romita Shetty said she ate the special lunch at TriBeCa Grill and ended up with a higher-than-usual tab, because ordinarily she would not order three courses.
Indeed, belief in the bargain may be more important for some people than the actual saving of money. Some restaurants said the average check was only a dollar or two below the nonbargain average. Henny Santo, a co-owner of Sign of the Dove, said the restaurant usually has a lower-priced menu in its cafe, where a two-course lunch costs less than $19.92. But because of the promotion, which has forced a temporary suspension of the cafe lunch menu, business has grown substantially.
The pricier a restaurant, the more its business has tended to grow with the promotion. Gotham, which usually serves 70 people at weekday lunches, is serving 110. Le Madri, at 168 West 18th Street, which used to serve 70, is seating 150. Coco Pazzo, at 23 East 74th Street, which had served 35 to 50, is now serving 100. Montrachet, which used to serve 35 to 50 at lunch on Friday, the only day it opens for lunch, now does more than 140.
By the end of the month, the restaurants will figure out exactly what they have made in profits and whether they will continue the promotion. "We think we're making a little money, but we don't know," said Jerry Kretchmer, an owner of Gotham Bar and Grill. "Most important, it put a smile on everybody's face."

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS;
Break Up the Unifieds? It's Now History

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Aug. 11

 BODY:
The athletes of what is almost certainly the last Unified Team have returned after a triumphal Olympics, with their future no more certain than that of their varied homelands.
The supremacy of the Unified Team in Barcelona had a bittersweet feeling to many, as the last hollow victory of an intensive sports system and the totalitarian empire that spawned and funded such excellence. The huge governmental investment in socialist sport stemmed not from any love of athletic competition, but from the Cold War, and now it is gone. 
This was the first team from the former empire to train and perform with minimal government money, and the sudden commercialization that made the airline flights to Barcelona possible will not be enough to preserve the foundations of such superb performances: the local coaches and clubs, the centralized institutes of physical sport and science, the expensive central training centers for gymnasts, wrestlers and so many other specialist athletes.
For instance, Smirnoff, the American vodka company, which spent so much Western cash to sponsor the team, and whose repetitive advertisements on Russian television put so many local teeth on edge, is unlikely to support these teams in non-Olympic years. And except for large states like Russia and Ukraine, it is extremely doubtful that the other republics, like Kazakhstan or Kyrgyzstan, will spend much tax money on keeping up their superb, inherited sports facilities, or that Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, where so many of the good weight lifters and wrestlers seem to come from, will worry much about them in the midst of ethnic warfare and economic chaos.
 
Going for Money
 Vitaly Shcherbo, the extraordinary Belarussian gymnast who won a record six gold medals in Barcelona and wore an old Soviet emblem on his jersey, summed up the new, commercial "one for one and all for one" spirit when he spoke of his plans in the West: "I'll go for the most money," he said. "We all will."
It is not that too many of the citizens of the former Soviet Union would blame him in the current economic climate, but it is yet one more measure of how empty the socialist ideal has become, and how confused people are about their patriotism, both topics for some sadness and irony here.
Commentators on the lengthy and much-watched Olympics television broadcasts had their favorites, speaking of "nashi komanda," or "our team," even when the Unified basketball team was playing Lithuania. One said, with some irony: "I wish our weight lifter will win. I want so much to hear the Moldovan national anthem."
Today's Sovetskaya Rossiya, under the headline, "Olympians of the Former U.S.S.R. Leave Undefeated," asked why the Unified Team was "the best" in Barcelona. "How could it happen that the athletes of the Unified Team, representing countries which are experiencing such political storms and economic difficulties, managed to perform better than the teams of the prosperous West?"
 
'The System Survived'
 The answer, the paper suggested, was not that the team found sponsors and solved its financial problems, or that there was some "new splash of patriotism." What really counted was that "in sports, counter to many other aspects of life, the system survived." This time, at least.
Pravda, the longtime organ of the Communist Party and now a mouthpiece for the conservative reaction here, had an extraordinary headline today: "The Cause of the New U.S.S.R. Combined Team Is Alive and Victorious." It was extraordinary because, after all, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is dead, however much mourned by Pravda, and this was not the U.S.S.R. Combined Team at all, since the Baltics are long gone. It was not even the Commonwealth of Independent States Team, since Georgia and Azerbaijan have not joined the Commonwealth but participated in the Unified Team.
Pravda went on to use the Unified Team's success as "a good example" for Commonwealth politicians. The athletes "really turned their team into a commonwealth without borders and differences, and proved that the cause of the U.S.S.R. Combined Team lives on victoriously," a hackneyed phrase normally used in olden days about the "cause" of the Communist Party.
 
Rivalries and Problems
 Beyond the obvious reservation that the people of Ukraine and the other independent states want to keep their new borders and even accentuate their differences, the team had its own rivalries and problems, though more among the sports bosses of the various states than among the athletes themselves.
Even before the Games began, Vitaly Smirnov, president of the Unified Team's Olympic committee, complained bitterly about nationalist politics interfering with the selection of team athletes, with some Ukrainian rhythmic gymnasts (one of whom won the gold) being chosen ahead of a Russian woman. In Barcelona, he finally said: "To the very last, let us be polite to each other."
Smirnov, before the Games, predicted flatly that the Unified Team would win 43 gold medals and win the medals table. In fact, the athletes of this great, dying institution of superb athletics and totalitarian politics won 45.
 
Celebration Becomes Disaster
 MOSCOW, Aug. 11 (AP) One spectator was killed and nine seriously injured when scaffolding collapsed during a welcoming ceremony for Estonia's Olympic team in its capital, Tallinn, according to reports from ITAR-Tass and Eta news agencies.
Dozens of people had climbed the scaffolding around a four-story building under renovation. They were seeking a good vantage point from which to cheer the return of the Olympic athletes from Barcelona.
Most of those injured in the accident Monday night were teen-agers.

HEADLINE: Back on Track

 BODY:
Good for President Bush and Israel's new Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin. Their cordial meeting in Kennebunkport opens the way to quick approval of $10 billion in U.S. loan guarantees for Israel and to real bargaining at regional peace talks, to resume on Aug. 24 in Washington. Every bit as important, civility has supplanted sour contention in an old, valued alliance.
The new mood was as evident as the smile on George Bush's face, and in his hospitable embrace of the plain-spoken hero of Israel's great victory in the 1967 war. 
 The President angered many American Jews last fall by refusing to approve the loan guarantees while Israel persisted in widespread expansion of Jewish settlements in disputed Arab territories. But in a June election fought on peace issues, Israelis punished the pro-settlement Likud Government and turned to Mr. Rabin's Labor party. Thus Washington and Jerusalem are on parallel tracks heading into a sixth round of Arab-Israeli peace talks.
Confirming the new mood was a welcome decision by Mr. Rabin's Government to seek the repeal of a law prohibiting people under its jurisdiction from making contact with the Palestine Liberation Organization. So objectionable is this vague law that even former Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir drew back from imposing criminal penalties on West Bank Palestinians who met openly with the P.L.O. chairman, Yasir Arafat.
Lifting that ban is the kind of conciliatory gesture long urged by Palestinians. So is the curtailment of new settlements by the Rabin Government. This means that the Arab side can no longer dwell interminably on Israeli inflexibility. The burden is now on Arabs to come up with serious, achievable proposals, beginning with interim autonomy arrangements for the West Bank and Gaza.
While parallel, American and Israeli purposes are not identical. There's plenty of room for differences about, say, "security" settlements, which Mr. Rabin strongly favors. But on two huge matters there is agreement: Israel's new Government accepts the idea of making genuine compromises for real peace, and it gives priority to investing in jobs and houses for Jewish immigrants from Russia and Ethiopia.
That has also been Mr. Bush's hope, for which he has been unfairly attacked. It was, after all, the Bush Administration that airlifted Jews from Ethiopia and changed U.S. immigration policies to encourage Soviet Jews to go directly to Israel. And Washington also orchestrated the successful campaign to rescind the detestable Zionism-is-racism resolution at the United Nations.
In all this, good politics and human decency have gone together; Mr. Bush has earned the right to take a bow.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Vice President;
Quayle Attacks Bar Association for Honoring Hill

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., Aug. 11

 BODY:
A year after declaring war on the country's civil justice system, Vice President Dan Quayle renewed his assault on the American Bar Association today by criticizing the group for honoring Anita F. Hill, the Oklahoma law professor who accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment.
Mr. Quayle also used two public appearances here to assert that the Democrats remained beholden to special interests, specifically contending that Gov. Bill Clinton was "in the pocket" of the country's trial lawyers. As exhibit A in his case, Mr. Quayle, who is himself a lawyer, pointed to Hillary Clinton's speech on Sunday at the American Bar Association convention in nearby San Francisco, where Professor Hill was given an award. 
 "Most Americans, black and white, male and female, young and old, believed Clarence Thomas and not Anita Hill," Mr. Quayle said in a speech to the California chapter of the Christian Coalition. "That doesn't matter to the A.B.A. To them she is a heroine, because she led the attack against a man who happened to be conservative and black -- a combination that makes liberals fly into a rage.
"And who did they choose to present this award to liberalism's heroine for the 1990's? None other than her fellow lawyer, Mrs. Hillary Clinton," he added. Hisses swept through the hotel meeting room at the mention of Mrs. Clinton.
 
Kind Words for Hill
 "Well, it is very clear that the American bar leadership is just one more special interest group of the Democratic Party," Mr. Quayle continued. "We now know why Bill Clinton can never support legal reform."
Mr. Quayle was inaccurate in saying that Mrs. Clinton presented the award to Professor Hill. The wife of the Democratic Presidential nominee merely spoke at the luncheon, where the bar association presented six women with its Women Lawyers of Achievement Award.
But Mrs. Clinton, who is the immediate past chairwoman of association's commission on women, did have kind words for the professor. She said in her speech that Ms. Hill "transformed consciousness and changed history with her courageous testimony" about Judge Thomas during the hearings on his nomination to be a Supreme Court Justice.
Professor Hill was chosen for the award by the 12-member Commission on Women in the Profession. The award recognizes women lawyers who contribute to career opportunities for other women lawyers.
Ms. Hill was honored for her "impact on American society in general and on women lawyers in particular." A statement issued by the association when the award was presented did not take a position on whether Ms. Hill's accusations were true, but lauded her for speaking "eloquently and persuasively on behalf of millions of women who have been harassed in the workplace."
 
Revisiting an Old Issue
 A year ago, when the American Bar Association met in Atlanta, Mr. Quayle gave one of the most memorable speeches of his Vice Presidency, calling for significant changes in the civil litigation system. His proposals formed the foundation of a new policy direction for the Bush Administration.
In revisiting the issue today, Mr. Quayle made his fight with the bar association purely political, and he used Professor Hill and Mrs. Clinton as the vehicles for his attack.
"Obviously, if Hillary Clinton wants to be associated with Anita Hill, that's fine, that's her choice," Mr. Quayle said at a news conference after his speech. "But what it does show is that the Clinton Presidential campaign is clearly in the pocket of the American Bar Association leadership."
The Clinton campaign quickly responded to Mr. Quayle's comments.
"Everyone says stupid things sometimes, but Dan Quayle just does it more of the time than most," said George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's communications director. "The President has no economic plan. All he can do is send Dan Quayle out to be his attack puppy."
In recent weeks, Mr. Quayle has asserted that the Democratic ticket of Mr. Clinton and Senator Al Gore would not be able to deliver the changes they promise because of ties to special interest groups like the National Education Association. Republicans have used that portrayal of the Democrats in past campaigns.
He also used self-deprecation to raise doubts about the Democrats' political views. "During that Democratic convention you probably heard it said 100 times that Bill Clinton and Al Gore are moderate," he said. "Ladies and gentlemen, if they're moderates, I'm a world champion speller."
Mr. Quayle turned down an invitation to speak to the bar association on Monday, even though he was close by, saying timing and conditions for a speech could not be worked out. But he derided the association's leadership from a distance not only for honoring Ms. Hill and opposing his proposals for overhauls, but also for failing to support a recent crime-fighting plan by Attorney General William P. Barr.
Last month, Mr. Barr issued a report calling on states to combat violent crimes with a variety of tough measures. The association's president, Talbot D'Alemberte, wrote to President Bush that the recommendations "ignore the broad societal context for violent crime."
In a statement today, Mr. D'Alemberte said "there seems to be a fundamental difference" between the association and the Bush Administration.
"The Vice President believes that the business of our justice system is business," he said. "We believe the business of our justice system is justice and we believe that justice should be available not just to the rich but to all Americans, and see nothing in the Vice President's proposals to accomplish that end."

HEADLINE: U.S. Knew of Possible Survivors In Indochina, Reagan Aides Say

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 12

 BODY:
Three top Reagan Administration officials responsible for tracking the cases of United States servicemen missing in Vietnam said today that the Government had known for nearly 20 years that some American prisoners of war may have been alive in Indochina when troops were withdrawn in 1973.
But in testimony to the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs the three officials expressed doubts that any prisoners remained alive in captivity now.
 
U.S. Lost Its Chance
 The officials, part of an Administration that sought to focus new attention on the issue in the 1980's, testified that they had always assumed that there were American prisoners of war alive in Indochina in 1973. They also charged that the United States lost its best chance of finding out what happened to all unaccounted-for Americans by not pressing the issue forcefully in the years immediately after its withdrawal from Indochina. 
 "In the period when the trail was hot, when there should have been a full-court press, the effort was less, not more," Lieut. Gen. Leonard H. Perroots, head of the Defense Intelligence Agency from 1985 to 1988, told the committee. He was referring to the Administrations of Richard M. Nixon, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter.
The others who testified today were Richard T. Childress, a staff member on President Reagan's National Security Council, and Richard Armitage, a former Assistant Defense Secretary.
But officials of previous Administrations insist they did all they could to ascertain the status of American servicemen missing in Vietnam in the early 1970's, and they deny they were negligent in any way. [Page A6.]
In recent weeks, in many hours of testimony and through the declassification of more than a million Pentagon and White House documents now making their way into the public domain, the Senate committee has been developing a fuller account of the Government's handling of the missing servicemen.
But the picture still remains incomplete, and there is contradictory evidence. Despite the contradictions, what is gradually emerging, in the view of many members of the committee, are new details on nearly two decades of United States and Vietnamese actions and contacts giving greater credence to the claims of the families of missing Americans.
The United States lists 2,266 Americans as unaccounted for from the Vietnam War. About half of these are known to have died, but their remains have not been recovered. Of the rest, 130 to 135 fall into the category of prisoners who may have been alive in captivity in 1973, according to Defense Department officials and investigations by the Senate committee drawing on information about these servicemen's last known whereabouts.
It is this group that has become the focus of a new investigation into the issue of the missing. The status of the others is unknown, and they are listed as missing in action.
Over the years, many officials have suggested that there were American servicemen unaccounted for in Indochina, many of them pilots shot down during the war. But the statements today represented an unusual public confirmation at a time when the issue has re-emerged.
The issue of the missing has now been split effectively into two questions: how many people where unaccounted for in 1973, when American troops came home, and how many of this number might be living Americans who survived in captivity after that.
Several officials involved in accounting in the Nixon years have testified that while they knew prisoners had not returned as expected, they assumed virtually all had died at some point in captivity, although Vietnamese, Laotian and Cambodian officials never explained why they were not returned. Other officials disagree, saying that they believed prisoners did survive, though only one, Robert Garwood, a Marine, later came home.
 
Allusion to Vietnam Offer
 Mr. Childress raised the possibility in testimony today that Americans may have survived into the 1980's when he alluded to an offer said to have been made by Vietnam through a third country for the release of Americans in return for development aid. Mr. Childress said that the offer was "followed back to Vietnam" in the mid-1980's, but that there were no prisoners.
The committee chairman, Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, cut off further discussion of Mr. Childress's assertions and said the panel would hear the details in closed session.
This was the second report the committee had received of purported approaches by Vietnam in the 1980's through intermediary countries, suggesting the exchange of prisoners for money or pledges of aid.
A former State Department official close to the issue said in an interview today that offers like these have been appearing since the 1960's. All of them have been proved fraudulent, he said.
 
Hanoi Says All Returned
 Vietnam has always insisted it returned all prisoners in 1973. It has returned several hundred sets of remains since then.
In a summing up of recent testimony on Government actions on the P.O.W.-M.I.A. issue and the private interventions of Ross Perot, who made several trips to Indochina in search of information on the missing, Senator Kerry said that "there is really no mystery about where this cry of conspiracy comes from."
"This issue that has haunted America for 20 years has not haunted it falsely," he said, after General Perroots, Mr. Childress and Mr. Armitage, who now heads the relief program for the ex-Soviet republics, all said that there had been no full accounting for servicemen in 1973 and that there has still been no full accounting today.
In a key exchange, Senator Kerry said, "So if it's true that we do not have a full accounting as we sit here today in 1992, it has to be equally as true that we did not have a full accounting in 1973 when we left Vietnam; is that true?" All three officials agreed.
They added that they had been saying this for years, in meetings and speeches to family groups. They welcomed the declassification of documents, saying that secrecy had only contributed to allegations of cover-ups from the P.O.W.-M.I.A. lobby and accusations from others that the issue of the missing was a political campaign without foundation in fact.
Henry A. Kissinger, who was President Nixon's national security adviser in 1973, said Tuesday on the ABC News program "Nightline" that he had never been satisfied with Vietnam's accounting for the missing, although President Nixon announced on March 29 of that year that all prisoners were home. In "Years of Upheaval," his memoirs covering that period, Mr. Kissinger wrote of taking 80 names of missing Americans to Indochina in the the summer of 1973 to ask officials to account for them.
In several months of testimony and extensive investigation, the Senate Select Committee has produced a list of 133 names of people who were reliably reported to be in captivity in Vietnam or Laos in 1973, but who did not come home in prisoner exchanges.
The Defense Department has a similar list of 135 "discrepancy cases," where there is enough information about the last known location of apparently live Americans to suggest that Hanoi knows what happened to them.
"Vietnam can easily account for hundreds of Americans," Mr. Childress, who made a number of trips to Hanoi in the 1980's, told the committee today. He added that he believed there were "elements in the politburo" who had decided not to cooperate more.
Mr. Armitage, a fluent Vietnamese speaker who spent four years in South Vietnam during the war and also led delegations to Hanoi, said that to make headway on the resolution of cases believed to be soluble, "the Governments of Vietnam and Laos, and what passes for the Government of Cambodia, will have to open up and give us full access to their records."
Unanswered questions about the missing are the chief reason Washington has not normalized relations with Vietnam or lifted an economic embargo against Hanoi.
The three Reagan Administration officials said they had no hard evidence that Americans remained alive in Indochina now, but all added that they believed it was possible. They said some servicemen might have stayed behind of their own volition and could account for some if not all of the live sightings of people identified as Americans in recent years.
"I don't think there's an organized, institutionalized effort to hold a lot of people," said General Perroots.
Mr. Armitage said: "There are Americans in Indochina. I don't know the circumstances. They may be living freely."
The officials said there had been no conspiracy by the Government to cover up evidence of living Americans. But General Perroots said there were times when the Government should have worked harder to resolve the question of the missing.
The Reagan Administration years were critical to the P.O.W.-M.I.A. issue because the White House gave considerable encouragement to family groups and other lobbyists who sought to give the problem a high political profile.
Critics of the policy say that the Reagan Administration raised false hopes, while actually doing little to solve the problem.
As the committee's work has clarified some questions, it has also produced new conflicting accounts. On Tuesday, for example, Mr. Perot and McMurtrie Godley, a former United States Ambassador to Laos, presented diametrically opposed accounts of a briefing for Mr. Perot at the United States Embassy in Vientiane in 1970. Both were under oath. Today in closed session, the Central Intelligence Agency station chief in Laos at the time was reported to have supported the Ambassador's recollections.
Though Mr. Armitage and Mr. Perot both say they believe that prisoners remained in Indochina when the United States withdrew its troops, they have disagreed over whether Americans are still in captivity. Mr. Perot, who takes the position that many Americans are still prisoners, has waged a campaign to discredit Mr. Armitage and his handling of the issue during the Reagan years.

HEADLINE: The Trade Accord;
ECONOMIC ACCORD REACHED BY U.S., MEXICO AND CANADA TO LOWER TRADE BARRIERS

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 12

 BODY:
The United States, Canada and Mexico today formally announced a comprehensive plan for free trade across North America and portrayed it as an opportunity for greater economic growth for all three nations.
The agreement was greeted enthusiastically by business groups generally, although some American executives complained about last-minute concessions by American negotiators. 
 But American labor unions, which have long opposed opening the Southern border, continued to contend that the accord would send jobs to Mexico.
President Bush said the agreement -- which is subject to legislative approval in all three countries -- protects America's place in the world by creating jobs and economic growth.
 
Challenge for the U.S.
 "The cold war is over," he said at a news conference today. "The principal challenge now facing the United States is to compete in a rapidly changing, expanding global marketplace."
The key elements of the free trade agreement are these:
*Eliminating customs duties on tens of thousands of products.
*Setting up obstacles to prevent Asian and European companies from bypassing American tariffs by shipping goods through Mexico.
*Opening Mexico's banking, insurance and securities industries.
*Creating panels to resolve commercial environmental disputes.
 
Enlarging the Markets
 The accord is meant to give consumers of all three nations a wider variety of goods at lower prices and to make American industry more competitive by enlarging its markets. It is also intended to enrich the Mexican economy and to give greater access to Mexican markets to Canada while protecting its 1988 free trade agreement with the United States.
Mexico saw the agreement as a symbolic stride in its march away from decades of protectionism and poverty. It has prepared an elaborate lobbying campaign in the United States to work for its passage. [Page D4.]
In Canada, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney began his campaign to sell closer North American ties to a skeptical Canadian public. [Page D5.]
The accord, reached after 14 months of negotiation, will create a regional trading bloc of 370 million people producing $6 trillion worth of goods and services each year, more than the European Community. The success of the 12-nation European Community in lowering customs duties and stimulating regional trade partly inspired the negotiations that led to the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The agreement immediately became an issue in the United States Presidential and Congressional campaigns. Minutes after the President's news conference, one of his campaign officials criticized Gov. Bill Clinton, the Democratic Presidential candidate, for disparaging the agreement in recent weeks.
"He waffles and wiggles all over on a North American Free Trade Agreement -- he's in the pocket of labor," said Torie Clarke, the campaign's chief spokeswoman.
Mr. Clinton said today that he would review how the agreement affected labor and environmental standards before taking a position.
"We do need a new agreement with Mexico; we need to do that," he said while leaving a meeting of the American Federation of Teachers in Detroit. "I want to see whether this meets those standards or whether there's some suggestions we ought to make for other things that need to be done either within or outside the agreement."
 
Review by Lawyers
 Administration officials said today that lawyers were still going over the accord and that they would not be able to release a full text for several weeks. This logistical difficulty meant that Administration officials were able to announce American gains from the agreement without allowing opponents to pore over the document for clauses that would hurt specific industries.
Senator Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas, said late Tuesday that the Finance Committee, which he heads, would hold hearings on the agreement this fall. Republicans and Democrats expect the hearings to produce a bruising debate over the nation's economic future in the middle of an election campaign.
Congress is expected to approve the agreement next year if President Bush is re-elected, but only after a lengthy legislative battle. If Mr. Clinton is elected, the battle could be longer if he adds his own provisions, but approval is still considered likely.
The legislation putting the agreement's provisions into law is likely to include new programs to retrain workers who lose their jobs because of imports, as well as new programs to clean up environmental hazards and build highways and bridges along the border with Mexico.
The Administration has not said how it proposes to pay for these programs. Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the Missouri Democrat and House majority leader, has proposed a tax on cross-border transactions, but the Administration opposes the idea as likely to inhibit trade.
Mr. Clinton has not said whether he would try to reopen the negotiations if he won the election. But he has suggested that the agreement should do more to protect American workers and the environment.
 
Endorsements From Business
 Many business executives and their lobbyists were quick to endorse the accord today. M. Peter McPherson, the Bank of America's executive vice president for Latin America and Canada, welcomed the agreement as allowing American banks to begin competing in Mexico after decades of restrictions. "This gives us the authority to open new banks in Mexico that can borrow pesos and lend pesos," he said.
Kay R. Whitmore, the chairman of the Eastman Kodak Company, said, "It could unleash a surge of trading activity with Mexico, already our third-largest trading partner and fastest-growing export market."
John F. Akers, chairman of the International Business Machines Corporation, said the pact "holds great promise for the development and growth" of North America.
 
Complaints on Autos
 But Harold A. Poling, chairman of the Ford Motor Company, said the plan made it too easy for Japanese and European competitors to bypass American customs duties by manufacturing cars and trucks in Mexico.
And oilfield equipment makers like the LTV Corporation were dismayed that American negotiators allowed Mexico's giant state-owned oil and electricity monopolies to move slowly in buying more from American and Canadian companies.
Labor unions contended that the agreement could encourage American businesses to move factories and jobs to Mexico. Thomas R. Donohue, the secretary-treasurer of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., told a news conference this morning that the accord would lead more American companies to set up factories in northern Mexico to take advantage of low wages there.
"There are 600,000 jobs along the Mexican border that used to be U.S.-based jobs," Mr. Donohue said.
 
A Long Wait for Benefits
 The benefits of the agreement will not become apparent to consumers for years. Under an existing American program, nearly half of all imports from Mexico enter duty-free, and this will barely change when the agreement goes into effect, most likely on Jan. 1, 1994. The main exception lies in apparel, for which tariffs will be eliminated immediately on a few garments -- like T-shirts -- that are scarcely produced in the United States and are currently imported from East Asia.
The highly protected textile and apparel industries were divided on the agreement. Some companies condemned it as leading to more low-wage competition while others praised it as an alternative to a worldwide reduction in protection for these industries under the auspices of the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Roger Milliken, the chairman of Milliken & Company, a large textile producer based in Spartanburg, S.C., criticized the agreement for "seeking to make us more competitive by forcing the shift of the higher-paying jobs of American workers to other countries where wages, and therefore costs, are far less."
The Mexican products facing the highest American tariffs are agricultural commodities, and the tariffs on them will fall very slowly. Farm goods account for all but 3 of the 14 products put into the category for slowest removal of American tariffs, with duties not disappearing entirely for 15 years. Many of these duties now approach 100 percent.
 
More in the Supermarket
 Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, said American consumers would have more choices in supermarkets as the tariffs fell. "It means that if you want to get a cantaloupe a couple of months later than you can get one down at your Safeway this morning, that will be an opportunity afforded to you," she said.
The American tariff on cantaloupes, which averaged 43.4 percent last year, will be among the few duties eliminated over 15 years because of lobbying by American producers.
The biggest surprise today concerned rules for determining which cars and light trucks would qualify for duty-free treatment under the agreement. Mexico and Canada wanted to require that only 50 percent of the value of a car be produced in North America, to encourage Japanese and European companies to set up factories in those countries to supply the United States market.
The United States sought a requirement of 70 percent, but settled for a gradual increase over eight years, to 62.5 percent from 50 percent. Julius Katz, a deputy United States trade representative, said that the figure was acceptable because it came with stringent rules for counting which parts are made in North America.
The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association nonetheless criticized the same provision of the agreement for being too restrictive.

Chart: "Provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement"
 The free trade agreement negotioated by the United States, Canada and Mexico will bind their economies together in a regional trading bloc with more people and more economic output than the European Community. Here are the accord's principle provisions:
 
Advertising
 Each country's laws and regulations will treat all advertising agencies in North America equally. Mexico will allow American and Canadian companies to do business without setting up local offices and hiring local staff.
 
Agriculture
 Duties on all farm products will be phased out, some quickly, some over 15 years.
 
Autos
 Over 10 years, Mexico's complicated system for requiring a rough balance in the import and export of cars and car parts will be phased out. So will tariffs on cars and trucks. But at least half the value of a car, rising to 62.5 percent over eight years, must be built in North America for it to qualify for duty-free treatment.
 
Banking
 U.S. and Canadian banks will immediately be allowed to acquire Mexican banks accounting for as much as 8 percent of the industry's capital. All limits on bank ownership will be removed by Jan. 1, 2000.
 
Disputes
 Special judges will be empaneled to resolve disagreements on matters like fishing rights, government subsidies, environmental regulations and other trade laws.
 
Energy
 Mexico will pay performance bonuses to successful oil exploration companies, but will still bar foreign ownership of oilfields.
 
Environment
 Dispute panels on most environmental issues will have precedence over international panels. Suggestions by environmentalists for a tax on trade to pay for cleanup along the Mexican border were not incorporated in the agreement.
 
Food Safety
 Countries will be allowed to challenge each others' safety standards if they can prove that the standaards discriminate against a country's products.
 
Government Contracts
 Mexico's many state-owned enterprises and Government agencies currently reserve virtually all their contracts for Mexican companies. The pact will limit this reserve to half the contracts at first, falling to 30 percent over 8 years, and zero after 10 years.
 
Insurance
 U.S. and Canadian companies will be allowed to take over insurance companies in which they already hold minority stakes. All limits will be removed on Jan. 1, 2000.
 
Jobs
 The agreement makes no provisions for job assurance, ignoring demands from some labor unions and Congressional Democrats for changes in Mexican minimum wage and worker safety laws. The Bush Administration is crafting a separate program to help workers who lose their jobs because of the pact.
 
Securities Firms
 U.S. and Canadian firms will be able to buy companies accounting for as much as 10 percent of the Mexican industry's capital. All limits will be removed on Jan, 1, 2000.
 
Tariffs
 Customs duties on nearly 10,000 products will be elimated, either immediately or in stages over as long as 15 years.
 
Temporary Work Visas
 Corporate executives and some professionals from all three countries will be able to live and work anywhere in North America with fewer bureaucratic formalities. The rules are narrowly written to prevent large-scale immigration to the United States from Mexico.
 
Textiles
 Garments will qualify for duty-free treatment only in the yarn is made, the cloth is woven, and all cutting and sewing are done in North America. Canada has won a partial exemption from the rule.
 
Trucking
 U.S., Mexican and Canadian trucking companies will be allowed to do business on cross-border routes that are now forbidden.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: News Analysis;
As Simple as Life Itself

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 12

 BODY:
The Republican Party has staked out "family values" as a principal theme this year, a way of reconnecting with voters who are no longer enamored of the Republicans' handling of the economy.
But the issue is not as simple as party strategists might have expected. It is playing out in the political debate, and in the culture at large, in complicated and unpredictable ways. And the Democrats, who watched Republicans run away with the politics of values in the 1980's, are determined not to let it happen again. 
 President Bush ran into the dangerous intersection of the personal and the political in an NBC interview broadcast Tuesday night. The staunchly anti-abortion President was presented with a hypothetical test of his "family values": a pregnant granddaughter who came to him and insisted on having an abortion.
Some who watched Mr. Bush's response, in which he said he would try to dissuade her but would ultimately "stand by my child," saw a loving paterfamilias with strong political principles but also a heart.
Others, however, saw a man committed to outlawing abortion for other men's daughters and granddaughters but not willing to foreclose it for his own. Advocates of abortion rights heard Mr. Bush's statement that in the end it would be the woman's decision ("Well, whose else's -- who else's -- could it be?") and replied, exactly so.
James Carville, a top strategist for Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the Democratic Presidential nominee, asserted: "I think when voters read that they think: 'Well, of course if George Bush's granddaughter needed an abortion, she could get it. But what about me?' "
Perhaps. No one quite knows how voters will react to hypothetical situations that cut so close to home, that test both their ideals of what family life should be and their messier realities. They are sharply divided on whether Washington should even be in the business of "upholding traditional family values," according to a New York Times/CBS News Poll in June; 52 percent said it should, 41 percent said it should not.
Sam Popkin, a professor at the University of California at San Diego, who is advising the Clinton campaign, argues that most Americans fall into the "ambivalent middle" on these issues. They want abortion to be legal, he says, but they do not want it presented as as a "good." (Thus Mr. Clinton's assertion, "I am not pro-abortion; I am pro-choice.")
 
The Two-Parent Ideal
 They feel two-parent families are the ideal, but "recognize life doesn't always work out that way." They felt some empathy for Murphy Brown, the television character who recently became an unwed mother and drew Vice President Dan Quayle's fire.
The Republicans counter that the Democrats are only using middle-of-the-road oratory to mask a hard left agenda. That was the message coming today from Richard N. Bond, chairman of the Republican National Committee. As the Republicans prepared for their Aug. 17-20 convention in Houston, Mr. Bond assailed Hillary Clinton, a lawyer who has long worked and written on children's legal issues, as someone who "has likened marriage and the family to slavery."
At the same time, the Republicans were working on a draft of their platform that extols "the fine example of family values and family virtue as lived by the President and the First Lady." And the Republicans were preparing for an unusual address to the convention Wednesday night by Barbara Bush -- on the subject of family values, of course.
 
Of Hearth and Home
 Mrs. Bush, whose poll ratings far exceed her husband's, has become an icon of traditional wife and motherhood, and Republicans clearly see her as an enormous asset, a kind of super-endorsement of her husband's emotional and home life. They also like the contrast with Mrs. Clinton, a partner in a major Little Rock law firm who spent weeks last spring trying to recover from an offhand, dismissive remark in defense of her legal career: "I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas."
Will attacks on Mrs. Clinton highlight her vulnerabilities, or offend voters' sense of another family value -- that a candidate's spouse ought to be out of the line of fire? Mr. Clinton seemed to be appealing to that sense today, asserting, "For them to try to take her life and career and twist it around, it's sort of sad."
The principal risk for the Republican leaders over the next 10 days, however, is that they extol "family values" in a way that pleases their party's right flank, but leaves the middle unmoved. The convention features a lineup of staunch conservatives like the Rev. Pat Robertson, who will speak on family night, and the party's platform is taking a tough line on such social issues as abortion.
Still, Mr. Bush himself may be reaching for the "ambivalent middle."
The Republican platform writers were putting the party on record this week against laws that recognize same-sex marriage and attempts to "include sexual preference as a protected minority receiving preferential status." But Mr. Bush was taking a more personal and conciliatory line with Stone Phillips, the reporter for NBC News, Tuesday night, in response to another hypothetical occurrence: a grandchild who came home and informed him that he or she was gay.
"I would love that child," he said. Mr. Bush went on to say that he would hope that the child would not advocate that life style, or propose that "same-sex marriage is a normal way of life." But he reiterated, "I would love that person."
He was picking his way carefully through the minefield between the personal and the political.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Convention City;
In No Mood to Party, Houston Awaits the G.O.P.

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Aug. 12

 BODY:
The official poster for the Republican National Convention features a rodeo cowboy atop a huge bull with the Houston skyline in the background. A safe choice? Not in a city that has struggled with its identity for a decade and now, grappling with a series of setbacks, is in a grumpy mood as it prepares to host the President and his party.
The poster caused a tiff over whether the Wild West image was the right one for a major city of the 1990's that is trying to lift its flat economy by promoting itself as a sophisticated international business center. 
 Like much of the nation, Houston has been vexed by a stubborn recession, but the downturn struck here just as the city was beginning to recover from the devastating collapse of oil prices in the 1980's. Now large-scale layoffs by major employers regularly make headlines. The Houstonian Hotel, President Bush's nominal Texas residence, is in bankruptcy.
After several startling murders last year, the city dumped a 10-year incumbent mayor, Kathryn J. Whitmire, in favor of Bob Lanier, a businessman who campaigned almost exclusively on a promise to put more police on the streets.
Even the weather has been demanding: record-setting rainfalls have caused extensive flooding since winter.
"The Republican convention is coming to Houston at a time of greater pessimism than at any time in the city's recent history, including the depths of the oil bust," said Stephen L. Klineberg, a professor of sociology at Rice University, "and that's bound to color not only how the convention is received but also how the city votes in November."
There are few signs that the general public is getting excited about the convention. Certainly there is little of the stir that accompanied the July 1990 Economic Summit here, an event that turned into a civic celebration of the city's emergence from the oil bust.
"Folks are so distracted with their own concerns that what appears to be a very predictable convention is virtually irrelevant," said John Mixon, a law professor at the University of Houston. "I plan simply to avoid the traffic."
Long known for the overriding optimism of its wildcatting spirit, Houston is grappling with anxieties that began with short-term economic problems and extended into a general uneasiness about the future.
 
Identity Problem
 "Before it cratered, the petroleum industry drove this city, defined it, for such a long time that it'll be years before something else comes along to take its place as the thing that makes Houston unique," said Michel Halbouty, 83 years old and the city's senior independent oilman.
"Getting hit by a recession right when we were climbing out of a hole has undoubtedly diminished Houston's can-do spirit," Mr. Halbouty said. "It's by no means gone, but it has been challenged."
Arguments over what image to project are almost inevitable in a city uncertain about its prospects. "There's lots of talk about the poster because plenty of Houstonians think the cowboy thing can be overplayed when we really need to be promoting ourselves as a sophisticated, international city," said Dancie Perugini Ware, a prominent public relations executive.
The poster hubbub was elevated to the level of public debate last Sunday when the lead editorial in The Houston Chronicle derided "all the cringing" over the poster, and argued, "We aren't cowboys, but to say we have not inherited a strong Texas tradition is nonsense."
 
Charting a City's Mood
 In what may be the most extensive tracking of any city's moods, Mr. Klineberg has conducted a public opinion survey in the Houston metropolitan area every year since 1982, through boom and bust, recovery and recession. This year's Houston Area Survey produced a statement of profound apprehension about an unpredictable future.
The surveys have involved samples of 412 to 679 people and have a margin of sampling error of four percentage points.
In March 1982, just before a series of oil price cuts sent Houston into a tailspin, 76 percent of the respondents to the survey rated job opportunities as excellent or good. By 1987, with the city in the depths of the oil market collapse, 87 percent said the opportunities were fair or poor. In 1990, with the recovery well under way, opinions were almost evenly split between optimists and pessimists. But evidence of gloom returning showed up in the survey taken last February, when 65 percent said job opportunities were fair or poor and only 29 percent judged them favorable.
"Coming back from disaster, Houston had one of the fastest-growing economies in the country from 1989 through most of 1991," said Ray Perryman, an economic consultant and forecaster based in Waco, Tex. "But along the way the Houston economy became a lot more like the national economy, and so it became vulnerable to national recessions."
The oil industry, especially the exploration and production sectors, never completely rebounded from the bust. Domestic drilling is now at a 30-year low. Instead, Houston has developed new industries, especially in health care and high technology, and has expanded production of chemicals and plastics. Energy accounted for more than 60 percent of the Houston economy during the boom, but its share is now less than 30 percent, Mr. Perryman said.
Houston, which in 1989 added 97,000 jobs to its economy, will add 4,000 jobs this year, Mr. Perryman predicted.
"Houston is experiencing a flat economy, not the severe downturns you see on both coasts, and in many ways it is well positioned to come out of the recession stronger than other cities," he said. "I don't hear the optimism that was quite striking a couple of years ago. There were high expectations that the bad times were past and a new era of growth had begun. Now people are disappointed."

HEADLINE: Selling Jets to Saudis a Tough Issue for Bush

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 12

 BODY:
President Bush is facing a decision to sell advanced F-15 fighter planes to Saudi Arabia, an issue fraught with election-year politics as well as sensitive foreign policy considerations.
The question of whether to proceed with the $5 billion sale of 72 of the warplanes has been percolating for months. But it was brought to the fore on Tuesday after Senator Christopher (Kit) Bond, a Missouri Republican, urged Mr. Bush during a White House meeting to move quickly on the sale. 
 Congressional supporters of the sale quickly spread the word that Mr. Bush had responded that the sale was under serious consideration. Administration officials said later, however, that no decision had been made.
What is clear is that proponents of the sale believe that the coming Presidential election, as well as the Administration's decision to grant loan guarantees to the Israelis, make this the moment to move. Defense companies, union officials and Congressional proponents of the sale have mounted a major lobbying effort.
Mr. Bush and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel announced on Tuesday that they had agreed on a long-delayed package of $10 billion in loan guarantees to help the Israelis resettle immigrants from the former Soviet Union.
Administration officials said today that in their discussions in Maine on Monday, Mr. Rabin persuaded Mr. Bush that "he had set new priorities of national interests that shift the settlement policy significantly."
Mr. Rabin also met today with Gov. Bill Clinton, the Democratic Presidential nominee. Mr. Clinton told Mr. Rabin that he supported the agreement on loan guarantees to Israel and he stressed that his election would not mean that the continuity of the relationship between the two countries would be harmed.
"I conveyed to the Prime Minister my intense desire not to let the partisan difficulties of the election here in the United States to in any way impede the peace process," Mr. Clinton said after the meeting.
Under the agreement worked out with Israel on the loan guarantees, the United States can deduct whatever money Israel spends on settlements from that year's guarantees. Officials said Mr. Bush and Mr. Rabin agreed that this "deductibility" would not begin until after the first year.
They also agreed that the "deductibility" would not apply to certain kinds of construction, which are to be defined in a side agreement between the two governments and could include settlements that Israel can demonstrate are needed for its security, settlements in East Jerusalem, and things like roads that can be used by both Arabs and Jews.
The roots of the debate over the possible sale of new F-15 aircraft to Saudi Arabia go back to early this year when Saudi Arabia formally asked to buy 48 F-15E and 24 F-15H planes.
The F-15E is an advanced air-to-ground attack configuration of the F-15, which the Air Force used during the gulf war. The F-15H is a two-seat version of the air-to-air version of the fighter.
If the Administration decides that the sale should be made, it could involve the sale of a somewhat less capable versions of the aircraft to try to mollify critics.
McDonnell Douglas, the Missouri-based defense company that builds the F-15, has been eager to see the sale go through. The company has no new orders for F-15's and unless foreign sales are made it will have to shut its production line. Already, 1,000 of its workers have been laid off as the production of F-15 fighters has decreased and as the sale of commercial airliners has declined, company officials say.
McDonnell Douglas officials assert that subcontractors will be hit harder. Company officials claim that 20,000 aerospace jobs could be lost by next year, if the Administration does not approve the F-15 sale this summer. Richard Gephardt, the Missouri Democrat who serves as House majority leader, and 25 other lawmakers sent Mr. Bush an letter on Aug. 5 urging the President to proceed expeditiously with the sale to avert "thousands of lay-offs" and warning that the Saudis may buy British Tornadoes if the United States refuses to sell F-15's.
In recent weeks, it appeared as if the Administration would wait until after the election to approve the sale, which McDonnell Douglas insists would come too late to avert some lay-offs. But proponents of the sale have seen the Administration's decision to approve loan guarantees to Israel as an opportunity to seek a quick White House endorsement of the sale.
The loan guarantees, proponents insist, will insulate the Bush Administration from criticism from pro-Israel lawmakers, if the White House proceeds with the sale. And the election-year focus on the economy, they say, will raise the political cost of not approving the sale.

HEADLINE: Saving a Silver Screen in Jersey City

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY, Aug. 7

 BODY:
In 1939 moviegoers sat mesmerized before the 50-foot screen at the Loew's Jersey theater as Atlanta burned nightly in "Gone With the Wind." In 1967, thousands lined up beneath the theater's glittering marquee for tickets to "Dr. Zhivago."
Today a new generation of viewers gathered in the lobby of the now-closed Loew's Jersey movie palace, where a $4 million fund-raising effort is under way to save the 63-year-old theater. The city hopes a first-run "big screen" theater and performing arts center will open here in 1994. 
 "This is going to become, we expect, one of the better-known major entertainment venues in the metropolitan area," said Colin Egan, a member of the recently formed board of the Jersey City Center for the Performing Arts. "This is the ultimate in the entertainment experience. There's nothing like it anymore in this area. The building itself is a marketing tool."
 
A Mere Glimmer
 Seated just beyond the usually boarded front doors, visitors to a limited schedule of exhibition showings caught a mere glimmer of the Loew's majesty. Beyond its gilded promenade-ringed lobby, the theater itself sits in baroque splendor, with a universe of plaster cherubs and gold-leaf foliage climbing 90 feet to the chandeliers in its domed ceiling.
In 1973, Loew's was divided with unadorned sheetrock into three viewing rooms, which operated until 1986. Filthy, unlighted and uncarpeted, the cavernous auditorium sits neglected, suspended in time like a cathedral in a war zone.
The Loew's is one of three "movie palaces" standing within sight of one another on Jersey City's Journal Square, symbols of an era of glamour and bustle in a city that once came alive at night. Today, only Loew's stands a chance of returning to its former glory: the Stanley theater now belongs to the Jehovah's Witnesses and the State was gutted and modernized before it closed several years ago.
Despite its obvious need for restoration, the 3,300-seat Loew's is well preserved.
"It's probably the finest surviving movie palace not only in the state but in the whole New York-New Jersey area," said Bob Furmanek, an archivist involved in the restoration.
Saving the Loew's actually is as much an economic crusade as it is a nostalgic one. In 1986 Hartz Mountain Industries, a major local developer, bought the theater, which it planned to tear down as part of a full-scale redevelopment of Journal Square. The plan included condemning neighboring properties, which touched off opposition from merchants.
Theater activists joined the fight against Hartz and ultimately were successful when the changing economy stalled new building. In 1988, Hartz agreed to give up the theater in exchange for substantial tax abatements if $4 million could be raised for its restoration by December 1992.
Jersey City pledged $1 million to the project and is expected to offer an additional $2 million at its Aug. 19 council meeting. A state historic preservation grant provided another $1 million.
While many in the city agreed that the Loew's should be saved as a landmark, some questioned whether the troubled city should be in the business of bailing out such a speculative project.
"It's such a tricky thing, revitalizing an area that has turned into a strip of junk stores," said Sebastian D'Elia, an aide to Acting Mayor Joseph Rakowski. "I think this could be a step in the right direction. It's a good thing, but definitely not the only thing we need."
 
Business Isn't Enough
 Theater proponents say business development alone will not revitalize the blighted local economy. They say entertainment and night life are critical now, just as they were in 1929 when Loew's was built and Journal Square was a commercial and transportation hub.
"The thought of saving Journal Square by tearing down this and putting up an office complex just isn't going to work," said Mr. Egan of the arts center board. "It's not enough. We have to re-evaluate what it takes to revive an area and if everyone who comes here only stays from 9 to 5, that won't do it."
Mr. Egan, a public relations consultant and historian who has become a full-time volunteer for the theater project, said the loss of the Loew's would leave a deep scar on Journal Square, as well as on the psyche of Jersey City.
"You could never do this again today," he said. "The guys who did this got paid cents an hour for their work. They did not reap monetary rewards for their labor."
"If you destroy all of this, take it away," he said, "then it's as if they never lived at all."

HEADLINE: THE TRADE ACCORD;
An Outsider Nation at Last Arrived, Mexico Is Embracing the Agreement

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Aug. 12

 BODY:
Mexico celebrated its negotiation of a free-trade agreement with the United States and Canada today as a great symbolic stride in its march from decades of protectionism and poverty to a future in the developed world.
Then, Government officials turned to what they described as the larger challenge of selling the agreement to a divided and skeptical nation. They meant the United States. 
 Although freer trade promises more drastic changes for Mexico than for either of its new partners, wide public support for the accord and President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's overwhelming political control make its approval a formality here. Only the Mexican Senate will vote on the treaty, and members of Mr. Salinas's Institutional Revolutionary Party hold 61 of its 64 seats.
North of the border, however, Mexican officials foresee intense political struggle that may turn on their ability to convey the image of a poor neighbor transformed: a country brimming with economic opportunities and environmental concern, and determined to leave behind its corrupt and authoritarian past.
 
Lobbying on a Huge Scale
 And though no one expects this to be an easy sell, the Salinas administration and its many lobbyists in Washington have fashioned what appears likely to be one of the most elaborate efforts at political persuasion ever undertaken in America by a foreign country.
"There is going to be a very big campaign in the United States," said a Mexican official who, like several others, would discuss the effort only on the condition that he not be identified. "We have the plans, the strategies, the tactics. We have only been waiting for the product."
Long before trade negotiations ended, Mexican officials said they were already breaking down the draft agreement in terms of the business opportunities it might offer to each American state and Congressional district. The constituents of American lawmakers who sit on committees involved in trade legislation will get more attention from Mexican diplomats and delegations; those of incumbents expected to lose their seats in November will get less.
Already, callers to the Mexican Embassy in Washington can ask for 76 academic studies forecasting the effects of the treaty on jobs, wages, trade, immigration and the environment in the three countries.
American businessmen who have worked in Mexico have been enlisted to tell their success stories. Tours of the United States are being set up for Mexican politicians, entrepreneurs and union leaders in the modern (and English-speaking) mold. Mexican-American business groups are being wooed, and Mexican Jews are being recruited to lobby Jewish groups in the United States.
The scale of the effort reflects what the Government sees as its enormous potential gain.
 
Jobs and Growth
 Other variables being equal, Mexican economic officials calculate that the flow of foreign investment into the country with a North American Free Trade Agreement would increase economic growth by at least 1 percent a year.
Some trade experts believe the pact would create more than a million Mexican jobs by the end of the decade, while narrowing the gap between what workers are paid in this country and the eight or nine times as much they can earn in Canada or the United States. Over a decade or two -- but not initially -- the rise in wages is expected to stem the migration of Mexican laborers north.
Opinion surveys and interviews suggest that only a small minority of Mexicans understand any more about free trade than its most general promises. Yet at 6:30 this morning, Mr. Salinas was triumphantly waving a thick copy of the agreement before television audiences. His message was actually less about treaty provisions and tariff barriers than about national catharsis.
"We Mexicans have demonstrated that we can do things well and assure our position in the world," he said. "We have shown with deeds that we achieve what we set out to do.
"Two years ago, when we began promoting the treaty with the United States and Canada, some considered it an impossible aim," the President went on. "Now, having concluded the negotiation of the treaty, restored growth and lowered inflation, we are showing that we achieve our goals and that renews our self-confidence. That is why Mexico is respected abroad and seen as a nation united, determined to progress and to have a great role in the next century."
 
Critical Voices
 Some other Mexicans were less exuberant.
"As far as I'm concerned, the treaty is just going to hurt us," said Victor Pacheco, a 28-year-old carpenter who was dismissed two years ago by the state oil monopoly, Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex.
"The Government goes around other countries saying we live in peace and everything is great, but we here are not the only ones with problems," said Mr. Pacheco, who camped out with scores of other former Pemex workers in Mexico City's central plaza, protesting their dismissal as part of the huge enterprise's push to become more efficient. "Many factories are on strike and many factories have closed," he said. "Our industry is being dismantled because of the treaty."
The appearance of consensus remains an important political value in Mexico, and several officials said that people like Mr. Pacheco would not be ignored. Answering complaints that Mexican negotiators had made most of the big concessions in reaching the treaty, officials have begun to describe heroic efforts to keep the country's oil resources from greedy foreign hands, to protect Mexican farmers, and to lower tariffs more quickly abroad than at home.
"There is going to be a very big barrage of information here," said an aide to the President. "We want the information to be out there because it is the principal antidote to any partisan account of the treaty."
The official noted that even most of the political parties and business groups that have criticized aspects of the trade agreement, or its negotiation, had not opposed an agreement outright. Reflecting the perception of many of the critics, another official said, "their voices are louder in Washington than they are here."
In the United States, however, Mexican critics of the accord may have to struggle to be heard over their Government.
The Mexican Trade and Foreign Ministries -- since their successful push last year for approval in the United States of the "fast track" legislation that authorizes the Bush Administration to negotiate an agreement that Congress cannot amend -- have built one of the biggest and most expensive teams of lobbyists, consultants and public relations agents of any foreign mission in Washington. Among them are Charls E. Walker Associates Inc.; Burson-Marsteller; Charles Black Associates, and Joseph O'Neal, a former aide to Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas.
Capitol Hill has become an inevitable stop for visiting Mexican officials, and free trade speeches by Mexican consular officials are commonplace in states that have previously had little to do with Mexico.
But despite this groundwork, an official said, "what remains is much more important than what we have finished."
"We are going to be launching a strategy of being in almost the entire United States, meeting with the editorial boards of local newspapers, meeting with business chambers and talking other people," the official continued. "The intensity of our campaign will be much greater than it was with the 'fast track.' "
Mexican aides say the effort will be somewhat easier because they will be able to cite the specific advantages of a completed treaty. The imagery of a new Mexico, with a booming economy and reliable, American-educated leaders, will remain central to the pitch, these officials said. But several American lobbyists and Congressional aides said the selling of Mexico was also likely to be easier because Congressional concerns had narrowed since the fast-track debate.
Then, American critics attacked the trade agreement using issues ranging from the loss of jobs to Mexico's respect for human rights, its political system, its drug-enforcement programs and the possibility that freer trade would make it a haven for industries fleeing American environmental regulation.
"Over the past year, everything but the labor issue and the environmental issue have fallen by the wayside," said B. Timothy Bennett, a trade lobbyist for Mexico's main business chamber. He argued that while some of those issues might reappear in Washington debate next year, the Mexican Government's success would depend less on how well it lobbied than on what new environmental safeguards it imposed.
As in Canada and the United States, environmentalists and other critics of the agreement lodged new complaints today in response to the news of the agreement.
"In the United States Congress and the Canadian Parliament, there is going to be a real discussion," said Ricardo Valero, a Mexican Congressman and the foreign affairs secretary of the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party. "Here we've already discounted that. Of the three countries, Mexico is the only one that has a real fast track."

HEADLINE: Police Detail Why Gunmen Came to Club

BYLINE: By MICHEL MARRIOTT

 BODY:
The gunmen whose botched robbery at the Corona Social Club in Queens left two men dead and one critically wounded were trying to steal money from two illegal gambling machines, the police said yesterday.
Officers were still searching last night for as many as two other suspects who might have slipped away from the club at 101-17 43d Avenue in the uproar that followed a wild shootout between two of the gunmen and police officers. 
 "The club contained Joker Poker, illegal gambling machines," Sgt. Nick Vreeland said. The two gambling machines, which can hold thousands of dollars in cash, contained only $70 total, said another police spokesman, Lieut. Raymond O'Donnell.
The gambling machines have been a major source of income for organized crime in recent years, police officials have said.
The robbery went awry, witnesses and the police said, when the gunmen, lying in wait to rob the man expected to come to empty the machines, were instead surprised by a cleaning crew that entered the drab, unmarked two-story building in the heavily Hispanic neighborhood.
 
Shots and More ShotsTwo Now Charged
 "They rolled up the gates and opened the door and they were confronted by as many as five males inside the club," Lieutenant O'Donnell said.
One of the members of the cleaning crew, who Lieutenant O'Donnell said were people "affiliated with the club," escaped and flagged down a police car. The police soon entered a building adjoining the social club and went to the club's basement while the rest of the cleaning crew and the gunmen were inside.
"As the officers were coming up the stairs, there were two shots fired on the stairs of the social club," Lieutenant O'Donnell said. "The officers retreated, slammed the door at the bottom of the stairs and called for assistance."
Police said some of the suspects fled to the club's roof, firing at least four shots from there toward 43d Avenue. Two of the suspects left the roof and broke into the basement apartment of a Pakistani immigrant, Saeed Ahmad, taking him hostage and then shooting him to death as the police tried to stop them, Lieutenant O'Donnell said.
One of the gunmen, Raphael Mendez, 21 years old, of Jackson Heights, Queens, was killed in the resulting shootout with officers. Another, Victor Rodriquez, 26, of Richmond Hill, Queens, was critically wounded, the police said.
A third suspect, Joseph Vidal, 23, of Jackson Heights, was arrested Tuesday night. Mr. Rodriguez and Mr. Vidal were charged with second-degree murder, burglary, robbery and criminal weapons possession, Sergeant Vreeland said.
The police removed the two illegal coin-operated electronic gambling machines from the social club yesterday.
Despite the presence of the machines, the police said the club was legal and they had received only one complaint against it in the three years it had been open. Last year, neighbors told officers that they believed drugs were being sold inside. The police said they investigated but found nothing.
After the police barricades were taken down in front of the club yesterday afternoon, Jochy Alvarez, 44, an unemployed truck driver who had walked inside and poured himself a shot of Remy Martin cognac, said, "It was a nice place, believe me."
"For the area," said Mr. Alvarez, who described himself as a frequent patron, "this is one of the places where you don't see people doing drugs, because there are no kids here."
Those in the know would ring a bell and enter a foyer where they could be watched through a long window, Mr. Alvarez said. They would be frisked for weapons, he said, and let into a dark, spartan room, with a pool table at its center, illuminated by red, green and blue lights.
Farther back in a black-painted room, three red bar stools stood in front of a small bar, which had a bottle of vodka, the bottle of Remy and club soda and beer. Down a rickety staircase, in a white basement, cartons of Heineken stood stacked to the ceiling. Two gaming tables were next to the beer.
Mr. Alvarez said 40 to 60 people would gather at the club at night to play pool and drink beer, a mixed crowd of Dominicans, Ecuadorans, Colombians and Puerto Ricans who live in the neighborhood. "It's one of the few clubs in Queens that was all right," he said. "They searched you. If they found you with weapons they wouldn't let you in."
Maximo Bentre, 33, who said he once worked as a security man in the club, said there had never been problems there. "Nothing ever happened," said Mr. Bentre, a slender man in a black shirt who now acts at a bouncer at a nearby club.
 
No Praise From Neighbors
 But some neighbors described the club as one of the hidden drinking and gambling joints and houses of prostitution that had changed what had once been a quiet residential neighborhood.
"This used to be a nice neighborhood. It's got to the point you can't walk on the streets anymore," said Jose Grullon, 35, a maintenance worker from nearby Jackson Heights. "Every time they open up one of these places, it's trouble for the neighborhood," he said. "I'd love to move, but I can't afford to move. I pay $400 for a nice apartment."

U.S. Panel Asks More For Science

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
A Federal panel said yesterday that scientific research by American business was in a perilous state of stagnation and recommended tough steps to strengthen industry against foreign rivals, including a series of actions by the Federal Government.
While many experts have issued such calls to action, this one is unusual for its breadth and authority. Its author, the National Science Board, is the policy-making arm of the National Science Foundation, a Federal agency that supports general science research in the United States and is responsible for monitoring the nation's overall scientific health. 
 Without saying so explicitly, the panel's report seems to repudiate the laissez-faire approach of the Reagan and Bush Administrations, which disdained Government involvement in industry research in favor of reliance on market forces. Lately the Bush Administration has softened its stance on this issue, and Gov. Bill Clinton has strongly backed new Federal policies to increase industrial innovation.
The National Science Board in its report, released yesterday in Washington, detailed American declines in research spending by business and setbacks in high-technology markets and called for a plan in which Government would play a leading role in riding to industry's rescue.
 
Art of Fostering Innovation
 Among the proposed Federal steps were increasing the money for industrial research; changing tax, fiscal and monetary policies to promote scientific investment, and creating Federal education programs to train future corporate leaders in the art of fostering innovation.
The report "paints a grim picture," Dr. Roland W. Schmitt, the president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, in Troy, N.Y., and co-chairman of the report panel, said in a statement, adding that stronger Federal leadership was needed. "Implementation of a national technology policy, establishing a rationale and guidelines for Federal action, should receive the highest priority," he said.
The situation was especially dangerous, he said at a news conference, because the erosion of America's industrial edge was steady rather than precipitous, leading to insufficient alarm being given to the issues and markets at stake.
"We're waving a warning flag," he said. "There's an emerging risk" that the United States is losing its inventive and competitive edge, threatening a series of significant losses and setbacks.
The report, "The Competitive Strength of U.S. Industrial Science and Technology: Strategic Issues," was done by the National Science Board's five-member committee on industrial support for research and development. Besides Dr. Schmitt, a former head of corporate research for General Electric, the committee's co-chairmen are Dr. Arden L. Bement Jr., director of science and technology at TRW Inc., a leading high-technology company engaged in civilian and military work.
Reaction to the report was swift and appeared to be overwhelmingly positive. Daniel F. Burton, executive vice president of the Council on Competitiveness, a private-sector group, said the report was important because it came from a nonpolitical arm of the Federal Government.
Charles F. Larson, executive director of the Industrial Research Institute, a trade group based in Washington, praised the report and said it codified an emerging consensus. "Whoever is in the White House is eventually going to see the light and realize that industry and government have to work together on this as a team," he said.
 
From Teflon to Transistors
 Traditionally, America's main source of innovation and technological leadership has been scientific research by private industry. People in corporate research invented nylon, Teflon, the transistor, the computer chip, fiber optics and instant color film. But now industry faces rising competition from abroad. In 1991, top honors in the award of sheer numbers of United States patents went to three Japanese companies: Toshiba, Mitsubishi and Hitachi.
In its report, the National Science Board panel, echoing past alarms, found that American spending on industrial research and development had stagnated in the 1980's and early 1990's, even as foreign rivals increased their investments.
In the last three years, it said, six competitors -- Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Sweden and Britain -- significantly increased their support of civilian research so that it cumulatively rose from being 25 percent larger than similar work in the United States to being 34 percent greater.
The report noted that American spending on industrial research slowed from an annual average growth of 7.5 percent in constant dollars from 1980 to 1985, to only four-tenths of 1 percent from 1985 to 1991.
 
At Risk of Decline
 As a result, it said, many American industries were at risk of decline, including computers, factory automation, motor vehicles, metals and electronics.
The report, citing a survey of 139 leading high-technology companies, said the main cause of the financial pullback was not Federal policy, technology management or the changing global economy. It was, the report found, general management practices and external financial pressures.
Corporate laboratories, it said, were under severe financial stress and were being forced to shift to shorter-term research for existing markets. It found that the mountain of corporate debt accumulated during the takeovers, mergers and acquisitions in the 1980's had squeezed research to some extent, but that the top financial pressure was the "growing dominance of institutional investors in equity markets and their demand for short-term returns on their investments."
It added that many top corporate managers lacked the skills and insights to tie technology into business strategy. In summary, the report said the United States "spends too few dollars" on industrial research and makes poor use of the ones it does.
It called for a tax credit for research and development to be made permanent and a moratorium on a Treasury regulation that induces American corporations to move research overseas.
Perhaps most important, it called for a sharp reversal of priorities in the overall Federal research budget, shifting the focus from the military to the commercial. Currently, some 60 percent of the $70 billion or so Washington is spending this year on science research goes to the Defense Department and other agencies engaged in military research.
Industry research sponsored by the Federal Government should be a team effort with business that focuses on generic, precompetitive technologies that have a broad range of commercial applications, the report said.
In a recommendation likely to provoke controversy, the report also called for Federal efforts to improve how industry performs its own research. For instance, it called on the National Science Foundation, the Government's main sponsor of general scientific research and education programs, to consider broadening its mission to include "the education of future corporate leaders of both high-technology and traditional industries."
Copies of the report can be obtained from the National Science Board, 1800 G Street N.W., Washington, D.C. 20550.

HEADLINE: Amid the Gentility of the East End, A Town Confronts Domestic Abuse

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST HAMPTON, L.I.

 BODY:
For a moment, Martha E. seems far from the cushioned chair and calm office where she speaks. In her eyes, it is 1990, and her husband is shouting at her, his anger building. Suddenly, he strikes.
Pregnant, she closes herself like a shell over the baby, protecting it from the kicks that rack her from skull to knees. Afterward, she picks herself up and limps out with the couple's 2-year-old son. 
 They stumble half a mile in the rain to a friend's house, casualties of domestic battles not commonly associated with this wealthy resort. Though wife beating seems improbable amid the beachfront mansions of the scions and stars who live here, it is serious enough that East Hampton has taken the highly unusual step of financing a private shelter for battered women, one of only three shelters for all of Long Island.
"Sometimes I think it's harder for people who have money," said Martha. "It's humiliating, because nobody expects it. When I tell people about what happened to me, they're surprised. And I can't understand why."
This is the tale of Martha's journey through a menacing marriage punctuated with episodes of domestic abuse, a form of violence that claims a new victim every 15 seconds and that was responsible for the deaths of three out of four women killed in America last year, according to the State Office for the Prevention of Domestic Violence.
It is also the story of a town's decision to help women escape abusive homes, and of police officers, judges, voters and volunteers who are building and furnishing a shelter in this summer resort, a pocket of Long Island's deepest poverty and grandest wealth.
 
Filling Hidden Needs
 The Rev. Frederick Schulz had no illusions about domestic violence sidestepping either the residents of the East End's fine mansions, its farmers or its workers. As minister of the First Presbyterian Church, he was getting calls to see bruised wives and children more and more often throughout the 1980's.
When it was his turn to organize an evening at the Rotary Club, he invited Mary Bromley, a psychotherapist the Police Department had hired to help victims of rape and domestic abuse. Her work had convinced her that domestic abuse was a major social problem on the East End. She suggested the Rotarians contribute the money they had raised at their Sunday morning pancake breakfasts to build a shelter for battered women.
"We don't really need that, do we?" club members asked Mr. Schulz.
"You should see the steady stream that's coming into my office," Mr. Schulz replied.
Around the same time, Patrick G. Halpin took over as Suffolk County Executive, and began a tough new policy favoring the arrest of men who beat their wives. Mary Bromley and Mr. Schulz went to some members of the East Hampton Town Council, police and judges, opening talks on the problems of battered women.
"At first, people don't believe this can be the case out in the Hamptons," Mr. Schulz says. "But all you have to do is look at the statistics. And then people begin to think, and they realize they all know somebody who is a victim, or who they think is a victim."
The East End itself -- where Long Island narrows to a slender strip of land ending at Montauk Point -- seems to feed the isolation common to abusive homes. "We've been told that the farther you go east, the higher the incidence of alcoholism and domestic abuse," Mr. Schulz says.
Obsession Turned Violent
When Martha met her husband, she was a 21-year-old waitress who was new to New York from California. Her husband was 19 years older, the owner of several restaurants. He was forceful, charming and seductive. He was also a heavy drinker.
"We'd have a fun life style," Martha says now. "We'd go to restaurants, do things, go out a lot, and spend a lot of money."
The older man was obsessed with her, wanting to know where she was at all times, what she was doing, who she was seeing. His personality seemed to crowd the space between them, eclipsing Martha's own will at times.
On some level, his certainty may have reassured the young woman starting out in a strange and daunting city. And his mercurial temper was not foreign to her. Martha's father had the same overbearing, explosive ways.
She remembers now the first time her husband hit her. They had been together less than a year, when she stayed out late with a girlfriend.
When she returned home, her husband said nothing, but she could sense anger crouching like a mugger inside him. Then she accidentally knocked over a can of soda he was drinking, and he pounced.
Without being asked, Martha answers the obvious: Why did she stay?
"It's typical," she says in embarrassment, "but I thought when I had our first child it would somehow change things, that he would calm down." She now realizes that it was during her three pregnancies, when she was at her most vulnerable, that the violence was the most intense.
 
More Monitoring of Abuse
 In 1987, the Retreat was a couple of women with great connections and a modest plan: they would educate judges, police officers, social workers and women themselves about domestic violence. They would also find a network of people willing to welcome battered women in an emergency and, eventually, build a cottage to shelter them.
At their urging, Police Chief Tom Scott began training officers to recognize abuse and arrest batterers, and began sending the Retreat daily copies of all abuse complaints so the group could offer to help the victims. The number of abuse complaints from women shot up from 119 last year to 300 in the first seven months of 1992 -- a good sign, Captain Sarris said, of the growing awareness among women.
At Criminal Court, Judge James R. Ketcham wrote orders of protection for women who had been abused, abandoning the traditional reluctance among judges to throw a man out of his own house.
The town council paid for investigators to prepare independent reports on cases of abuse, so that courts would not rely exclusively on the statements of husbands and wives to determine whether it was safe for a man to return home. When children acted strangely in school, teachers began asking questions.
But building a shelter would require land and money, neither of which the Retreat had. Enter Tony Bullock, the East Hampton Town Supervisor.
At 34, with a shock of sandy blond hair, Mr. Bullock has the kind of prep school confidence that allows him to wear jeans to work and get away with it. He also had a sense that he could finesse a few legal technicalities to help the Retreat build a shelter.
He gave the Retreat town-owned land, liberally interpreting statutes defining "public purpose." East Hampton voters approved a $650,000 bond to finance construction of an 18-bed shelter. The Retreat will pay the bond's costs over 30 years, and then have the option to buy the building.
"Frankly, we're probably two steps on the wrong side of the law," Mr. Bullock acknowledged. "But if anyone wants to call us on this, we'd be surprised."
 
Accepting the Abhorrent
 Martha suspected her marriage was not normal, but her husband disagreed. After all, the turmoil had marked every relationship he had ever had with women, he said. Their friends tolerated the abuse; on a plane once, they told her to "loosen up" after watching Martha's husband give her a black eye in the airport.
"People didn't ask that much," she said. "They don't want to know, so they don't see."
But gradually, even as she denied she was abused, a part of Martha sought the means to survive: she took a job, and with the money went to see a therapist, who turned out to be Mary Bromley.
Martha stopped therapy, however, because she could not handle Dr. Bromley's open declarations that she was being abused.
And then her husband hit Martha for the last time. He knocked her down in the bathtub and held a bathroom scale over her head. "This is the time he kills me," Martha thought. "I'm dead."
By the time he backed off, Martha had broken free, and made the final decision to leave.
"I can't live my life wondering when is the next time I'm going to be afraid that I'm going to be killed," she decided. "It had gotten to the point where I knew I couldn't go home to face that anymore."
Now, Martha looks at a chart the Retreat uses that breaks abusive relations into components, terrible in their precision: isolation, intimidation, threats, using children, sexual, economic and emotional abuse.
"I didn't understand that this was a pattern," Martha said, the glint of revelation in her eyes. "He did all of this to me."
Sherry Wolfe, a former battered wife who chairs the Retreat's board of directors, said that without a place to go women will inevitably return to a dangerous home. "That's why it's so important to be there," she said.
Martha feels certain she would not have had the strength to leave without the Retreat's help. It was here she found the first glimmers of compassion and reassurance. "When I was totally devastated, they would pick me up and help me," she said.
"It's hard for somebody else to understand how tough it is to pull yourself out of it when somebody is totally overwhelming of your whole life," she said. "I really had to start everything from scratch. That was terrifying -- not just the fear of physical violence, but starting your whole life over."
Last week, a truck visited the East End's wealthy homes and businesses, collecting furniture, pictures and appliances that people here had donated. With the opening of the Retreat's new shelter, there will be 52 beds for battered women on Long Island, population 3 million. Last year, 12,433 battered women and children were turned away from shelters in New York State for lack of space.
But what surprises Ms. Wolfe, Tony Bullock, Mr. Schulz and others in this community is not how difficult it was to find solutions for battered women, but how simple, once they'd tapped the common will.

HEADLINE: THE TRADE ACCOUNT;
Mulroney's Task: Selling Trade Pact to Canadians

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, Aug. 12

 BODY:
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney today opened his campaign to sell closer North American trade ties to a skeptical Canadian public. Business leaders generally endorsed the free trade pact just concluded by the North American partners, while the political opposition, including organized labor, tried to tear it to pieces.
An indication of the likely intensity of the coming storm was an exchange between Mr. Mulroney and Bob Rae, Premier of Ontario and a member of the Socialist-leaning New Democratic Party that opposes the Prime Minister's Progressive Conservatives. 
 Alluding to American Presidential politics, Mr. Rae charged that the pact had "everything to do with the Republican convention next week and nothing to do with the interests of the Canadian economy or Canadian workers."
Mr. Mulroney dismissed the Rae remark as "beneath requiring any comment" and went on to laud the accord as a "significant achievement for Canada" that would "create new wealth for citizens of all three nations." He said Canada had achieved its main objectives, which were to gain greater access to the Mexican market and protect its 1988 free trade agreement with the United States.
 
Canada's Motives
 Ottawa had entered the three-way talks late and defensively, after Washington and Mexico had already begun negotiating. The Canadians feared that market opportunities hard won in their 1988 pact with Washington could be undercut.
In welcoming the accord, many business people pointed to budding relationships between Canadian and Mexican enterprises. One illustration: SHL Systemhouse Inc. of Ottawa, which has just won a $500 million contract from the Mexican Government to provide computer communications systems to support more efficient Mexican tax collection.
"The Mexicans are very interested in Canada and seem somewhat less intimidated by Canadians than Americans," noted Tim Page, senior vice president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in Ottawa. The 170,000-member chamber has an increasingly active affiliate in Mexico.
Among other likely winners are Northern Telecom Canada Ltd. of Toronto, which could benefit from the huge telecommunciations investments expected to be made by Mexico; Bombardier Inc. of Montreal, which could get business in urban transportation systems, and the Royal Bank of Canada and other big Canadian banks through expanded financial service demand from Mexico.
 
Mexico's Surplus Is Eroding
 Canadian-Mexican trade is relatively modest -- only $3 billion in two-way business last year, compared with $200 billion worth of Canadian-United States trade. And thanks to exports of cars and fruits and vegetables to Canada, Mexico enjoyed a huge surplus of $2 billion.
But this year that surplus is being whittled down. Canada's exports to Mexico in the first five months of 1992 more than doubled, with automotive parts scoring the biggest gain. Imports from Mexico were up only 12 percent.
Reaction in the business community was not universally positive. Daniel Schwanen, senior policy analyst at the C. D. How Institute, a Toronto-based policy research group, said that in general the agreement would "put more of a squeeze on the labor-intensive and relatively low-wage sectors in Canada." But, he added, "All of high technology should gain."
Canadian furniture makers, for their part, are worried about more competition from both Mexico and the United States.
"U.S. manufacturers and retailers will be drawn to Mexico to access a pool of cheap labor, thus cheaper product," said George Sinclair, executive vice president of the Ontario Furniture Manufacturers Association.
Apparel makers won small increases in quotas for shipments to the United States, but one executive, Alvin Segal, owner of Peerless Clothing Inc. of Montreal, which exports wool suits, said he detected "no joy in the industry."
"The question," Mr. Segal said, "is how we survive against lower wages from Mexico."
 
A Broadside From Labor
 Organized labor, in the form of the 2.3-million-member Canadian Labor Congress, fired a broadside, calling the pact part of an economic agenda that is destroying jobs and the country.
"The federal Government is showing nothing but contempt for Canadians," said Bob White, president of the powerful labor group, which he said was "gearing for an ambitious action plan, involving coalitions of Canadians from all walks of life" to torpedo the agreement.
Mr. Mulroney said today that he would seek ratification as soon as possible. But in view of the degree of opposition, he is unlikely to railroad the enabling legislation through the House of Commons. Instead, there will probably be a debate lasting several months. Most analysts think the earliest that the pact will be voted on will be next winter.
 
A Likely Campaign Issue
 Like President Bush, Mr. Mulroney is expected to use positive features of the trade agreement in his own bid for relection. The Canadian leader, who will probably seek a third term, must call elections by the fall of 1993. Many analysts expect a spring election.
Opponents of free trade, still smarting from Mr. Mulroney's victory in the 1988 election, in which free trade was also the major issue, plan to hammer away at potential job losses under a North American pact.
The New Democrats like Mr. Rae and the party leader Audrey McLaughlin have promised to abrogate the deal if they come to power in the next election.
Meanwhile, Jean Chretien, the leader of the Liberal Party, which among the three parties currently has the highest backing in the polls, said he wanted to study the terms before deciding whether Canada should sign on.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "What Happens Next"
 
After top officials from the United States, Mexico and Canada initial the free trade agreement in the next few weeks, it still faces formal approval in all three countries.
 
UNITED STATES
 
The pact cannot be signed until 90 days after it has been initialed and submitted to Congress, during which time formal legislation is drafted to turn the pact into law. Congress then has 90 working days to approve it by a majority vote of each house. Congress may not reverse any provisions, though it may supplement them with various programs, like those to retrain workers.
 
PROSPECTS: Expected to pass no matter who is the next President. But if Bill Clinton is elected President, he might want to reopen negotiations to put his own stamp on the accord, and that could cause problems.
 
CANADA
 
Parliament is expected to vote this year, though the process for turning trade pacts into law may be affected by continuing revisions in Canada's Constitution.
 
PROSPECTS: Likely to pass so long as Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Conservative Party maintains its hold. But general elections, possibly as early as next spring, could put its passage in question.
 
MEXICO
 
Approval requires only a majority vote of the Senate, which could take place ina scheduled session this winter or next spring, or in an extraordinary session.
 
PROSPECTS: Approval almost certain, as the President's party holds 61 of the 64 Senate seats.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Slight Easing in Treasury Prices

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The bond market took a breather yesterday. After two days of a strong rally right into the teeth of the Treasury's big August auctions, prices eased slightly across the board and some yields rose.
The 10-year auction saw adequate demand, although some dealers were apparently spooked by some last-minute rumors of aggressive bidding. 
 But the average yield of 6.49 percent for the new note was the lowest since the 10-year note was first offered in May 1976. And the decline in the price of the 30-year bond, which was down nearly 3/8 of a point early in the day, narrowed in later trading, leaving the yield at 7.31 percent -- the five-and-a-half-year low reached on Tuesday.
And although some other yields rose yesterday, there were several reports that gave additional support to one of the main factors aiding the market -- declining inflation.
The Producer Price Index for July rose only one-tenth of 1 percent, after a two-tenths of 1 percent increase in June. For the year through July, the index is up just 1.8 percent. And the core inflation rate, which excludes food and energy, was up just two-tenths of 1 percent.
In another anti-inflation signal, gold dropped sharply. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, the October futures contract was down $8.90, to $340.10 an ounce. And the Commodity Research Bureau index dropped further below the 200 level to 198.38, its lowest close since 1986.
 
Downward Price Pressure Seen
 Traders said there would be some downward pressure on prices today, because traders would be trying to raise yields before the final leg of this week's auction -- the 30-year bond. But referring to the economic data released yesterday, one trader said, "After that, then the economic data will tell the story."
Many traders think the market is ahead of itself and ready for a correction. But they also say that the data reflecting slow economic growth and low inflation is still basically good. At worst, this means the Treasury rally could stall. But unless there is some unexpected bad news, traders do not think that yields are going to rise sharply any time soon.
In the secondary market, the bond due in 2021 was offered at 1085/32 , down 3/32 to yield 7.31 percent, the same as the day before. In the pre-auction, or when-issued, market, where trading occurs ahead of the sale of the new 30-year bond, the yield was 7.26 percent, up from 7.25 percent Tuesday.
The new three-year note, which was auctioned Tuesday, was offered yesterday in late trading in the secondary market at 9913/16 , down 3/32 to yield 4.69 percent, which was the average for the auction. But that was above the close of 4.66 percent in the when-issued market on Tuesday.
The coupon on the new 10-year note is 6.375 percent. The average yield of 6.49 percent was flanked by a high yield of 6.50 percent and a low of 6.47 percent. The bid cover, which is the ratio of the $11 billion in notes auctioned to the total bid, was 2.28 -- below the average for the last 12 auctions.
Even though the auction did not meet overwhelming demand, there were indications, one trader said, that by later in the afternoon a lot of the securities had been sold by the dealers. One sign was the yield in the pre-auction market falling from the 4.69 percent just after the auction to 4.67 percent. The yield decline means the demand for the 10-year note was up.
 
Some Traders Guessed Wrong
 Going into the auction of the 10-year notes, traders and dealers had said they expected decent demand. The talk just before the 1 P.M. deadline for bids was of yields of 6.48 to 6.49 percent, which is where the yield was for the new 10-year note in the when-issued market.
Right after the deadline -- but before the results were announced -- the yield in the when-issued market began to decline, signaling that there might have been more demand than they expected. Some dealers apparently decided that their bids in the 6.48 percent and 6.49 range would not be aggressive enough and apparently went buying in the pre-auction market, pushing the yield lower. About a half-hour after the bid deadline, the yield had dropped to 6.46 percent.
But when the bids were announced, the average was 6.49 percent. The highest yield was 6.50 percent. This meant that the dealers who had been worried about not bidding at a low enough yield had been wrong -- a mistake that resulted in some immediate selling.
Following are the results of the Treasury's 10-year note auction yesterday:

HEADLINE: G.E. to Issue Credit Cards, Possibly Tied to Discounts

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Aug. 12

 BODY:
The General Electric Company is planning to move into the fiercely competitive credit card business and may try to entice consumers with discounts on G.E. appliances.
The company's financial subsidiary, the GE Capital Corporation, plans to begin test marketing the card later this year, a spokesman, Anthony Zehnder, said today from General Electric's headquarters in Fairfield, Conn. 
 Mr. Zehnder said G.E. was considering trying to attract new card holders by offering them discounts on G.E. appliances for using the card.
 
A Crowded Market
 Analysts said G.E. would have to offer such incentives and devise an innovative marketing plan or it would have a tough time attracting customers in a saturated market.
"It's really tough now for any new player to come in," said Robert B. McKinley of the RAM Research Corporation, which tracks credit card rates. "They are going to have to stand on their heads for people to notice."
The card would also put G.E. in direct competition with banks and other nonbank credit card issuers. The General Motors Corporation is said to be planning a credit card that would provide discounts on its cars, and the American Telephone and Telegraph Company is already a major issuer of credit cards.
 
Choices for Consumers
 "I think it's bad news for traditional big banks that have gotten away with high interest rates and fees," said Elgie Holstein, president of Bankcard Holders of America, a consumer group in Herndon, Va. "It gives consumers more choices."
GE Capital has the potential to become one of the top credit card issuers if it taps the 40 million card holders in credit card portfolios it manages for American retailers. But the company said it had no plans to do that.
"We have no intention of converting our private-label clients," Mr. Zehnder said. "These will be all new card holders."
He said the card would be tested in local markets but declined to name them.

HEADLINE: FINANCE/NEW ISSUES;
$1.2 Billion Bond Offering Is Priced by New York City

 BODY:
Amid an active week for municipal bond issues, New York City made yesterday's biggest deal, pricing $1.2 billion of general obligation bonds through underwriters led by Lehman Brothers.
The proceeds from the bonds, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the city, will be used to refund earlier issues that carry higher interest rates. Among the new bonds that were tentatively offered, the maximum yield was 6.60 percent for a 6 1/4 percent debt security due in 2021. The rest of the serial bond issue was priced to yield from 3 percent in 1993 to 5.3 percent in 1997, 6.2 percent in 2002, 5.9 percent in 2007 and 6.60 percent in 2010 through 2020, the underwriters said. 
 The general obligation issue is rated Baa-1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and A- by the Standard & Poor's Corporation, with the exception of the bonds due in 2007 through 2009, which are insured by the Financial Guaranty Insurance Company and rated triple-A by Moody's, S.& P. and Fitch Investors Service.

HEADLINE: Senate Opposes a Cut In Capital Gains Taxes

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 12

 BODY:
The Senate rejected an effort by Republicans to cut capital gains taxes today, as it quit for three weeks without completing action on enterprise zone legislation that was originally proposed in response to the rioting in Los Angeles four months ago.
The Senate vote was not unexpected, and it appeared to reflect strong Democratic opposition to even a narrower capital gains cut that would provide the tax benefit to businesses investing in selected inner-city neighborhoods, impoverished rural communities and Indian reservations. 
 The amendment provoked a sometimes vehement debate. Republicans argued that the capital gains cut was needed to spur the economy, while Democrats said it would do little more than spur larger budget deficits.
As the Senate slogged through scores of amendments to a wide-ranging $31 billion tax bill with provisions applying to crack babies, retirees and purchasers of expensive jewelry in addition to 125 enterprise zones, Democratic leaders saw no choice but to drop their plans to pass the legislation before the August recess began tonight.
 
Action on I.R.A.'s
 The Senate approved by voice vote a compromise on individual retirement accounts, expanding them to all but the wealthiest citizens by limiting deductibility for deposits to individuals earning under $80,000 and couples earning under $120,000. The amendment also reinstates a first-time home buyer tax credit worth $2,500 over two years, a provision that had been taken out of the legislation on Tuesday.
Senator Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon and a proponent of the home-buyer tax credit, said the provision would generate up to 125,000 new housing starts and 400,000 home sales.
By a vote of 80 to 14, the Senate rejected an amendment offered by Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, that would have reordered the legislation to cut $2.7 billion in tax benefits offered to corporations and directing those savings to an expansion of the Job Corps program, community policing and repairs of public housing and schools.
"This bill started as a response to the crisis in our inner cities," Mr. Bradley said in the debate on his amendment. "But instead of squarely facing the cycle of despair that we have created in our inner cities, this bill has become the engine for the extenders, passive losses, minimum tax relief and the President's marginal proposals to kick-start the economy."
 
House Legislation
 The House has already passed somewhat similar tax legislation, which would establish 25 enterprise zones in inner cities and 25 more in rural areas. The House version includes modest capital gains benefits for businesses that invest in impoverished neighborhoods for at least five years.
Senator Connie Mack, Republican of Florida, introduced an amendment that would have reduced the corporation and individual capital gains rates to a maximum of 15 percent and prevented capital gains taxes from being paid on gains because of inflation. He said his measure was necessary "if we are truly serious about getting America moving again."
Opposing the measure, Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, said: "A vote for this amendment is a vote to increase the budget deficit by more than $47 billion. Let's be realistic."
The amendment was defeated on a parliamentary motion by a vote of 57 to 37.

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Rise 0.1% As Inflation Stays in Check

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 12

 BODY:
Prices received by American producers for finished goods rose a skimpy one-tenth of 1 percent in July, as the economy's weak recovery kept a tight rein on inflation, Labor Department figures showed today.
The price of energy fell for the first time in six months, and peaches and other fresh fruits slid by the biggest amount in more than two decades to help food prices remain steady. 
 Nor was there anything disturbing at earlier stages of processing where there had been some hefty price increases in preceding months. The Labor Department found that prices for both intermediate goods and crude goods were unchanged in July.
 
Low Inflation Estimate
 "There is very little inflation pressure," said Ben K. Han, an economist for Philadelphia-based Corestates Financial Corporation. He said that his bank had now pared its estimate of 1992 inflation to below 3 percent, and that it saw the possibility of the inflation rate approaching 2 percent in a year from now.
Although it was not unexpected, the latest evidence of subdued inflation raised hopes in some quarters that the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates yet again in support of the sluggish economy. The Fed's main policy-making body, which is to meet next Tuesday to set a monetary course for the following seven weeks, will also have figures on consumer prices for July by then. They are scheduled to be released Thursday.
Among the voices urging further easing of monetary policy was Charles Schultze, a Brookings Institution economist and former Government official, who appeared today before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress. Dr. Schultze said the Fed should ease rates, calling 3 percent inflation "perfectly livable." He noted that short-term interest rates had yet to turn negative when adjusted for inflation; typically that occurs during business downturns.
 
Down From Prior Months
 The one-tenth of 1 percent rise in prices of finished goods last month followed advances averaging three-tenths of 1 percent for May and June and brought the rise for the latest 12 months down to 1.7 percent.
When food and energy are excluded, however, this so-called core rate of producer inflation rose two-tenths of 1 percent for July after slipping one-tenth of 1 percent in June.
Unlike the Consumer Price Index, the producer indexes do not include services or imported goods.
The price of passenger cars climbed seven-tenths of 1 percent last month, possibly reflecting temporary plant shutdowns that kept inventories in check, while tobacco products fell much less than in June. Prices of soaps and detergents rose substantially.
On the other hand, gasoline and home heating oil turned down after a sharp June rise, and increases for fresh vegetables, fish, beef, veal and milk products were offset by lower prices for fruit, poultry, shellfish, fats and oils, pork and roasted coffee.
Among the huge swings in fruits and vegetables were plunges of 44.5 percent for peaches, 41.2 percent for strawberries and 32.6 percent for melons. But prices of vegetables rose 19.7 percent, the most since February, as increases for potatoes and carrots approached 80 percent.
Prices were unchanged for intermediate goods, like bolts of cloth. Prices turned down for energy and food, while nondurable products used in manufacturing, like chemicals, rose less than in June.
Materials for durable manufacturing rose six-tenths of 1 percent, however, with increases accelerating for primary copper, copper and brass mill shapes, cold rolled steel sheets and hardwood lumber. Lead prices, which had been flat, jumped sharply.
But prices turned down for plywood, zinc and semifinished steel mill products, and hot rolled steel sheet and strip fell faster than in June.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Mostly Mixed Amid Mood of Uncertainty

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar finished mixed against most major currencies yesterday despite heavy buying a day earlier by central banks hoping to bolster the sagging dollar.
Figures released yesterday on wholesale inflation had little effect on the dollar, said Mike Faust, senior currency strategist with MMS International. 
 The Labor Department reported a rise of one-tenth of 1 percent for July in the Producer Price Index, which measures inflationary pressures before they reach the consumer. The figure was in line with expectations.
Although Tuesday's intervention by 14 central banks braked the dollar's rapid decline, it drifted lower on some markets. The coordinated effort failed to stir any interest in buying or holding dollars, traders said.
It was the second time in less than a week that central banks entered the market to support the tumbling currency. Traders yesterday were "trying to get a handle on the levels at which the central banks would enter the market again," Mr. Faust said.
 
Deterrences to Buyers
 Intervention was the only factor supporting the dollar, he said. Low interest rates and fears that the Federal Reserve might ease again, as well as the sluggish economy and the uncertain political situation ahead of the Presidential election, were unsettling potential dollar-buyers, Mr. Faust said.
Lower interest rates make dollar-denominated securities less valuable to investors, thereby decreasing the need for dollars.
Mr. Faust said those factors have meant the intervention in the dollar's favor is having less effect than it might. "Intervention is more successful when the underlying fundamentals are working in favor of the dollar," Mr. Faust said.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 127.87 yen, down 0.04 from Tuesday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 127.75 yen. In New York, the dollar was quoted at 127.30 yen, down from 128 yen late Tuesday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.9285, from $1.9225 late Tuesday. In New York, the pound was quoted at $1.9305, up from $1.9275 Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Dow Declines 10.27 After Bonds Weaken

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Wall Street's blue-chip stocks ended weaker yesterday, pressured by a late decline in bonds that followed an $11 billion auction of new 10-year Treasury notes.
The Dow Jones industrial average shed 10.27 points to end at 3,320.83. Decliners narrowly outpaced gainers 933 to 757 on the New York Stock Exchange, while volume rose to 177 million shares from 173.9 million on Tuesday. 
 Few factors seemed to sway investors. The market showed scant reaction to the morning announcement of the North American Free Trade Agreement involving the United States, Canada and Mexico.
 "A lot of players are missing here," said Ron Doran of C. L. King & Associates. "We're in the middle of the summer doldrums."
 The Treasury's 30-year benchmark bond lost 5/32 of a point, or $1.56 for every $1,000 face amount, to end at a price of 108 after rebounding from its lows.
The rises of one-tenth of 1 percent in the July Producer Price Index and two-tenths of 1 percent, excluding food and energy, were within estimates.
"Inflation seems to be very much under control," a trader said.
Steve Poling, an executive vice president at Fortis Advisers, said: "The market is shrugging everything off these days. Interest rates seem to be the only glue keeping things together."
The long-anticipated free trade pact was viewed as a positive sign for the stock market. But analysts said they saw little immediate reaction from Wall Street.
"It's a minor plus," said Hersh Cohen, president at Shearson Asset Management.
But, noting that there were few factors behind trading, he said: "It's just a dawdling day in August. We're completely beholden to the bond market."
 Mr. Doran said while stocks may be stuck in a range for the near term, "long term, I think there's still a good buying opportunity," adding, "the downside is limited."
Among individual issues, the Limited and the Gap were heavily traded. Paine Webber cut its rating on Limited and Merrill Lynch lowered estimates on both companies. The Limited eased1/4, to 19 7/8, while the Gap lost 7/8, to 31 1/2.
Shares of Applied Materials added 3 1/4, to 25 1/4 after reporting strong third-quarter results.
Parametric jumped 3, to 42 1/4, after it received the largest contract in its history. It will provide Caterpillar with at least 2,000 work stations using its software.
Parametric said it expected at least $10 million from the contract within the next four quarters.
Gold stocks were pounded because of plunging gold prices and waning inflation. Newmont Gold slipped 2 7/8, to 40 7/8; Pegasus Gold eased 1 1/8, to 14 5/8, and Newmont Mining fell 3 3/4, to 44 3/4.
Shares of Dataram slumped 6 7/8, to 7 7/8, after it reported lower first-quarter profit margins, reflecting its price cuts in the computer work station market.
The Nasdaq market index slipped 0.75, to 570.85, while the Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks lost 1.12, to 417.78.
The American Stock Exchange index eased by 1.62 points, to 386.46. The N.Y.S.E. composite index of all listed common stocks was off 0.62, at 229.99. The average price per share lost 9 cents.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Metals Prices Drop Sharply Over Fears About Economy

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The prices of precious metal futures plunged yesterday as persistent weakness in the prices of raw materials raised renewed fears that the economy was again slipping into recession.
On the other commodity markets, grain and soybean futures were lower, cotton futures rose, oil futures advanced and livestock and meat futures were mixed. 
 Platinum led the collapse in metals. Platinum for delivery in October dropped $13.40, to $354.30 an ounce, on the Mercantile Exchange in New York. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for August fell $8.70, to $338.60 an ounce; September silver tumbled 12 cents, to $3.775 an ounce.
Analysts said the stage was set for the selloff on Tuesday, when the Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 agricultural and industrial commodities fell below 200 for the first time in six years. Weak commodities prices indicate a lack of demand for raw materials by manufacturers, which bodes ill for the economy.
Precious metals reacted because a slowing economy means less industrial demand for platinum and silver and low inflation means less investment demand for precious metals, which are historically viewed as a hedge against rising prices.
"The whole atmosphere of the commodities has shifted from one of modest optimism into one of economic malaise, slow growth, low inflation -- the kind of psychology that existed in 1991," said William O'Neill, senior futures strategist for Merrill Lynch Futures.
Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst with Paine Webber, said the falling Japanese stock market was adding to fears of global economic weakness.
Grain and soybean futures prices fell on the Chicago Board of Trade ahead of a Government crop report that, as expected, predicted near-record corn production and a huge soybean crop.
In the report after the close of trading, the Agriculture Department estimated 1992 corn production at 8.76 billion bushels compared with last year's harvest of 7.47 billion bushels and the record of 8.88 billion set in 1985.
 
Energy Mostly Higher
 Oil futures ended modestly higher, retaining some of the gains posted early in the session on rumors, denied by the Pentagon, that Iraqi troops were massing near the Kuwait border.
Light crude oil for September delivery rose 17 cents, to $21.08 a barrel; September heating oil rose 0.32 cent, to 57.87 cents a gallon; September unleaded gasoline rose 0.80 cent, to 60.63 cents a gallon, and September natural gas fell 1.1 cents, to $1.911 for 1,000 cubic feet.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Money Market Fund Yields Take a Slight Downturn

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields offered by money market funds took a slight downturn in the latest week after appearing to stablize the week before, according to IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report.
The seven-day compounded and simple average yields for tax-exempt funds were both down 4 basis points, to 2.18 percent and 2.16 percent, respectively. With the 30-day average compound and simple yields at 2.17 percent and 2.19 percent, respectively, both averages were down a basis point from last week's computation. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. 
 IBC/Donoghue's said assets of tax-exempt money funds showed a $2 billion outflow, leaving $96.7 billion in the funds. Analysts said the outflow of cash from the funds, much of it coming from the early refunding of many tax-exempt issues, had begun to move back out of the money market funds and into new issues now being generated from a heavy calender of tax-exempt borrowings.
 
Longer Maturities Popular
 Investors are also moving from the money market funds into the longer maturities of municipal bond funds.
Walter S. Frank, IBC/Donoghue's chief economist, expects the pattern to continue as long as the yield curve remains fairly steep and longer maturities continue to offer higher yields.
The average number of days remaining until maturity of tax-exempt securities held in fund portfolios fell by a day, to 63, still a long time, according to analysts. A good percentage of portfolio managers remain confident that interest rates will not sudddenly back up on them.
For investors in the 28 percent tax bracket, the taxable equivalent of the current seven-day tax-free yield is 3.02 percent, while the equivalent for investors in the 31 percent tax bracket is 3.15 percent.
In its weekly survey of tax-exempt funds with assets greater than $100 million, Donoghue's said the Strong Municipal Money Market funds, distributed by Strong/Corneliuson in Milwaukee, ran its streak to two months as the fund with the best return, 2.96 percent, or 3 basis points lighter than last week.
Yields in taxable money market funds also fell, as assets rose by $3.9 billion, to $500.7 billion. Of the total, institutional assets rose $2.5 billion, to $179.8 billion, with retail accounting for the rest of the increase as assets gained $1.4 billion, to $320.9 billion.
Mr. Frank noted that these funds gained cash as yields fell, explaining that money market yields plunged last week and that may have led investors to go back into money market funds, since yield movement usually lags the market.
The average seven-day compounded yield for taxable money market funds was 3.13 percent, down 2 basis points, while the simple yield fell 3 basis points, to 3.08 percent. Over a 30-day period, the compounded and simple average yields were both down 4 basis points, to 3.19 percent and 3.14 percent, respectively.
Analysts said the average days left to maturity of securities in portfolios for the week was unchanged at 64.
The Standby Reserve Fund, distributed by Cowen & Company in New York, had the best return among general purpose funds for the second consecutive week, posting a return of 3.92 percent.
By comparison, the average yield of a bank money market account was 3.04 percent for the week.

Clinton's Luck . . . Or His Albatross?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
"YOU can help by putting a nice, positive interpretation on the fact that there are 200,000 more jobs created," President Bush told reporters assembled last Friday to hear the White House's spin on the July employment figures.
But economists seem more inclined to view the small decline in joblessness, to 7.7 percent, as just the puddle at the bottom of a nearly empty glass. Many are hunkering down for a long, dry season in the labor market -- one in which the growth in national output is barely sufficient to absorb the natural growth in the work force. 
 That, of course, is wretched news for Mr. Bush, who seems fated to face the voters with the unemployment monkey firmly attached to his back. But slow recovery could also prove to be a political trap for a victorious Bill Clinton, who would enter office with a big jobs problem and few weapons to fight it.
As President Bush reminds Americans, the recession is over. Why, then, are so many still feeling the pain? Why is unemployment close to the levels endured at this stage of recovery from the far more ferocious recession of 1981-82?
Robert J. Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University, looks to the late 1980's for the answer. While the recent recession was relatively shallow -- output fell less than 2 percent -- the upturn has been achingly gradual.
And the whole cycle came on the heels of wo years of economic wobble. As a result, output is hardly greater today than it was in the last months of Ronald Reagan's reign.
Mr. Gordon notes that in the postwar decades the economy has had to grow at about 2 1/2 percent annually to stay ahead of the employment curve -- 1 percent to absorb the growing numbers of workers, the rest to offset long-term gains in labor productivity. Thus by historical benchmarks, joblessness might have been expected to be approaching double digits by 1992. "The real mystery," Mr. Gordon concluded, "is why unemployment isn't even higher."
But now Mr. Bush's chickens are apparently coming home to roost. While the White House is predicting a full percentage point decline in unemployment by the end of 1993, Walter Cadette, an economist at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, is among those who are far less sanguine.
Mr. Cadette invokes Okun's Law, the economists' rule of thumb that in the short run it takes an extra two percentage points' worth of growth to reduce unemployment by 1 percent. Factoring in the expected additions to the work force, plus ongoing productivity improvements driven by technology, the Morgan Guaranty economist figures that the economy will have to grow at a 4.5 percent rate simply to drive unemployment below 7 percent by the end of 1993. And hardly anybody -- not even the current resident of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue -- is forecasting a growth rate above 4 percent.
When it rains, it pours. While unemployment will presumably return someday to the tolerable 5 percent rate last enjoyed in 1990, the work generated in the recovery may not be all that job seekers have in mind.
James Medoff, an economist at Harvard, points out that compared with previous recessions relatively few jobs lost during the 1990-92 downturn were temporary layoffs. Just one unemployed worker in six (compared to two of five in recessions past) can reasonably expect to return to the same employer. And new hires are very unlikely to earn as much as they took home from their previous jobs.
Mr. Medoff notes, moreover, that since the 1970's, employers have become far less willing to provide fringe benefits to new employees. In 1979, 23 percent of new jobs included health benefits; a decade later, the figure had fallen to 15 percent. Over the same period, new hires with pension coverage fell from 43 percent to 38.
With hindsight, it is obvious that Mr. Bush's economists overdosed on happy pills. They expected a brief recession, a soft landing from the speculative boom of the Reagan years.
Instead, they got a crisis in slow motion that has left millions who believed it was morning in America either out of work or in fear of losing the jobs that support their middle-class living standards.
Candidate Clinton's luck, however, could prove to be President Clinton's daunting challenge. If the next President is inclined to put the recession behind him by giving the economy a quick fiscal kick, he will have plenty of support from the left-center. "Hang the deficit," Mr. Gordon said. "Full speed ahead on spending with a long-term growth payoff."
But there is no guarantee that traditional fiscal policy would work. The spectacle of a Democratic President and Congress undoing the deficit-reduction agreement could spook investors, driving up long-term capital costs. And it could lead to a run on the dollar, forcing the Federal Reserve to shore up confidence with higher short-term interest rates.
This policy web, tangled by a decade of what-me-worry economics, could prove very difficult to unweave.

HEADLINE: Don't Be Fooled: These Objects Are Useful

BYLINE: By ELAINE LOUIE

 BODY:
SIMPLE baskets woven from the wild grasses of the Savannah River, asymmetrical salad bowls made of celadon porcelain, and Isamu Noguchi-inspired tables made of plywood are some of the 200 or so objects in "More Than One: Contemporary Studio Production" at the American Craft Museum. The exhibit, which includes works by 21 artists, opens today at the museum, 40 West 53d Street in Manhattan, and runs through Nov. 8.
"Studio production means that more than one object is produced, and that the artist has either hands-on contact with the object from start to finish, or complete supervision or approval of the final object," said John Perreault, the museum's senior curator. "Artists make multiples both from economic necessity and from an idealistic ideology that it's important to make beautiful handmade objects for everyday use that ordinary people can afford." 
 Objects by 11 of the 21 artists in the exhibit are sold in the museum's shop; these small home accessories range in price from $38 for a porcelain plate by Marek Cecula to $425 for a porcelain teapot by Dorothy Hafner.
Chris Lehrecke of Brooklyn makes curvy tables, which he admits are inspired by Noguchi, out of simple materials like plywood.
"I began making these shapes from solid pieces of wood, and I thought it would be interesting to accomplish the same thing with more industrial materials like plywood and fiberboard, to make something beautiful out of something ordinary," Mr. Lehrecke said. For an egg-shaped table, he cuts 97 thin strips of fiberboard, lays them side by side, molds and laminates them to form the surface of the table and then sands them to a satin finish. The steel base is minimal.
Another minimalist working in wood laminate is Skip Abelson of Manhattan, whose bentwood chairs feature two kinds of wood. One chair might have a seat and underside of maple, while the rest is cherry. A slit runs a few inches down the back of the chair.
"The crack is to relieve the tension," Mr. Abelson said, "and it's kind of sexy."
James Makins, a Manhattan artist, makes goblets, bowls and plates of palest porcelain. "I wanted to work with a clay body that would allow me to edit everything down to the essence of the material," he said. "I was also attracted to porcelain for its incredible sensuality."
Mary Jackson of Charleston, S.C., has reworked the basket. Using grasses from the low country near Charleston, she weaves the fibers into contemporary designs based on traditional African patterns.
For all the artistry of these crafts, the objects are intended to be used. "As opposed to art that hangs on the wall and doesn't do anything," Mr. Perreault said, "these objects are art that you can sit on, eat off or wear."

HEADLINE: Getting More Camp for Less Money

BYLINE: By MARGOT SLADE

 BODY:
DESPITE a straitened economy, children all over the country went to summer camp this year. But to pay for it, many families had to be more resourceful than they had been in the past.
Some parents sent their children to less-expensive camps run by schools or nonprofit groups, or to camps offering financial assistance and gradual-payment plans. Some even worked at camps their children attended, in exchange for reduced fees. 
 Paula Pacicco of Morris Plains, N.J., sent her 5-year-old daughter, Danielle, to a day camp run by the Morristown-Beard School in Morristown, N.J., for six weeks this summer. The cost, $640, was lower than at many other camps because the buildings of the private school for children 11 to 18 were used and because some of the school's older students and alumni were hired as counselors and supervisors.
"The camp's administrators are not interested in making a million dollars," Mrs. Pacicco said. "They want to keep their students' parents happy by giving the kids supervised employment, showing them how to be responsible. Meanwhile, families like mine benefit."
Other camps have low fees because they are financed by a parent's employer, the college a parent attended or a group a parent belongs to. Camps sponsored by organizations like the Y.M.C.A., Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts and those that are affiliated with a religious group or owned by a municipality are also in demand because they often offer financial assistance and subsidize part of a camper's fee, said Gary W. Abell, a spokesman for the American Camping Association, a nonprofit educational association that represents 5,000 day and resident camps nationwide. Fees at such camps, he said, range from $15 to $55 a day. By contrast, independently owned camps range from $35 to $80 a day.
"More families are seeking inexpensive camps, especially parents who work and need all-day child care when school is out," said John G. Snowden, vice president for camps and conference services for the Y.M.C.A. of Greater New York. "We've also seen an increase in the number of families needing assistance to attend our camps, especially middle-income families."
Still other parents sought arrangements the whole family could enjoy, like Deerkill Day Camp in Suffern, N.Y., whose recreational facilities are open to campers' families on weekends. "For the price of joining a beach club in Westchester, you can send your kids to day camp during the week and the whole family to a kind of country club on weekends," said Robert I. Rhodes, an owner of Deerkill.
The camp's fees vary with the length of stay, from $2,620 for eight weeks to $1,375 for August only, Mr. Rhodes said. On weekends, the pool, tennis courts and indoor basketball court can be used by families.
Mr. Abell said parents pursued "all sorts of options, like day camp, which is very popular now and being offered by all sorts of agencies and religious institutions, instead of the more expensive resident camps."
To make camp affordable and keep enrollment high, camp owners "are more accommodating of parents than ever before," he added, "offering shorter sessions, for example, or allowing parents to extend their children's stay" as circumstances allow.
Jim Eagan, director of the Morristown-Beard Day Camp, said the camp instituted a payment plan "partly as a response to the economy." Parents, he explained, pay $160 the first week of camp, and $100 a week until the entire bill is paid. "About 30 to 40 percent of our parents are on the plan," he said, "and we have between 100 and 150 kids ages 4 to 12 in any one week."
At some camps, a number of parents worked as counselors in exchange for some salary and lower camp fees. "I thought, what could I do, in what way could I make a difference?" said Terry Kalayjian, a graphic designer. "My answer was to teach swimming" at Trinity Day Camp in Manhattan.
The arrangement, Ms. Kalayjian said, offered surprising benefits. "It's a way to spend unpressured time with Lara and Sevan," she said, referring to her daughters, who are 10 and 7. "And it connects me to when I went to camp, which was a very positive experience. "More important, it teaches my kids to see Mom in a different light: being resourceful, using different skills. And it tells them that we all have hidden resources on which we can draw."
Those hidden resources are in high demand, said Dr. Arthur I. Pober, an education consultant. "Camp puts a dent in almost every family budget," Dr. Pober said. "After all, many parents consider camp an experience that their children can ill afford to miss, but it is often one for which they cannot readily afford to pay. So this year, the scramble was on to get more camp for less."
He described how some city parents send their children on long bus rides to day camps in the country "so that they can have a sleep-away camp experience without the sleep-away camp expense." Or, he said, they opt for "short but sweet" camp stays -- say, two weeks at a tennis, math or chess camp.
Many parents say such abbreviated camp sessions force them to rediscover local amenities, like the beach or municipal pool.
"In the process, they are rediscovering the joys of not having kids programmed all the time," Mrs. Pacicco said. "You know, there is something to be said for letting kids goof around in the morning, while parents do errands. Then in the afternoon, you can pack them up and go for a swim."

HEADLINE: PARENT & CHILD

BYLINE: By Lawrence Kutner

 BODY:
MATHEMATICS may be the most anxiety-provoking subject taught. For many adults, especially those who avoided math in school, facing a column of numbers, a graph or a set of fractions still makes the palms sweat and the heart race. And they, like the children now grappling with math, probably learned their fear from parents or elementary-school teachers who felt incompetent, too.
"Math anxiety is not genetic, but it's highly contagious," said Elisabeth Ruedy, a math teacher at the Trinity School in Manhattan who wrote "Where Do I Put the Decimal Point?" (Henry Holt, $19.95). "I have never found a toddler who didn't love numbers. It gives them a feeling of power. The problems arise when they start kindergarten." 
 Elementary and preschool teachers usually receive far less training in how to teach mathematics than how to teach reading and writing. In fact, many selected their profession partly because they felt uncomfortable with advanced math and science. They are more likely to view mathematical ability as something they cannot expect from all children -- a strikingly different attitude than the one they hold toward such subjects as reading.
The misconception that basic mathematical ability is innate often leads children and their parents to respond more passively to mathematics than to other subjects, waiting to discover whether they have a natural talent for it. There is less incentive to work hard at it because it feels out of their control. This leads some children and teachers to interpret initial difficulty understanding something as an inability to master it.
"Mathematical ability, at normal levels, is no more innate than any other form of general intelligence," said Sheila Tobias, the author of "Succeed With Math: Every Student's Guide to Conquering Math Anxiety" (College Board, $12.95). "Confidence, risk-taking and feeling in control are important in doing well in math or any other subject."
The issue of math anxiety is significant for both children and parents. Comfort with and competence at mathematics are increasingly important for success in adulthood. Avoiding math courses severely restricts the fields a student can study and the jobs a new graduate can find.
Although it is sometimes assumed that girls are more anxious about math than boys, and that students who do poorly in the subject are more anxious than those who do well, research has shown that's not the case. Many students who do well in math are still anxious, attributing their success to luck instead of knowledge and effort.
"I get very concerned about the stereotyping of girls as not being able to do math," said Dr. Susan F. Chipman, a psychologist in the Office of Naval Research in Arlington, Va., who has studied math anxiety. "Even though there are minor differences in confidence, we can't really say that math anxiety is a female problem."
As with most fears, avoiding mathematics doesn't get rid of the anxiety, and may even make it worse. The feeling of failure becomes part of the person's self-concept well into adulthood, often despite evidence to the contrary.
"Women will tell me that they shop for a family of five and figure out the bill in their heads, or they'll deal with fractions when they bake, but they'll claim that they can't handle mathematics," said Dr. Irene Deitch, an associate professor of psychology at the College of Staten Island who conducts workshops on math anxiety. "They don't see the connection with their everyday lives."
When pressed, many adults can date their fear to a time when they were absent from school because of an illness or a family move. Others say it followed a crisis: a death in the family, perhaps, or their parents' divorce. Often they missed understanding a critical concept, and everything that followed and built on that concept made no sense.
Teachers of math-anxiety courses for adults routinely describe students who are managers, even bankers. Many feel overwhelmed when faced with increasing responsibility involving things like budgets or financial projections. The students report having the same feelings of doubt and shame that they had decades ago in the classroom.
Ms. Ruedy said that, time and again, adults in her class hid their hands under the desk when she asked them to do a problem out loud. "It seems that some of the nuns in old parochial schools would rap them on the knuckles when they didn't know the answer," she said. "A lot of my adult students remember being hit at home or at school when they didn't do well in math. That's 100 percent counterproductive."
 
How a Parent Can Add, Not Subtract
CHILDREN look to their parents for cues as to how they should respond when they're frustrated by a math problem. The parent's attitude is often much more important than the ability to "crunch numbers."
A parent who pauses to ponder the question, draws a diagram or two to clarify it, approximates the answer and then does the calculations will help the children more than one who instantly gives the solution. While it takes longer, the first approach teaches persistence and other skills that can be applied to any math problem.
If your child is anxious about mathematics, there are some things you can do:
Pay attention to your own feelings about mathematics.
Are you anxious? Do you treat your child's math homework differently than other subjects? Children sense your attitudes, and quickly learn whether they are expected to succeed or fail.
"Learn the mathematics your child is learning," advised Sheila Tobias, who has written books on math anxiety. "Demonstrate your own confidence, problem solving and willingness to take risks."
And don't try to tutor your own child if you're anxious about the subject yourself. "Get someone who's comfortable with math," said Elisabeth Ruedy, a math teacher in Manhattan who works with children and adults. "It has to be somebody whose stomach isn't in a tight knot."
Relate the mathematics the child is learning to the real world.
All too often, the math problems children are asked to solve in school seem irrelevant. Have you ever really needed to know how far apart two trains are an hour and a half after they leave the station? When was the last time you wanted to know how many rods there were in the perimeter of a field?
"Show your child how mathematics is embedded in the stories in the newspaper," Ms. Tobias said. "Rates of inflation, sports records, reading graphs."
Remember that success is critical.
Children who are frustrated tend to avoid math. "Any success you can give your child is great," Ms. Ruedy said. "If you insist on using a workbook, buy one that's too easy instead of too hard for your child."

San Francisco Turns To a Top Sports Agent

BYLINE: By MICHAEL MARTINEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 12

 BODY:
In America's sports pages, Leigh Steinberg is considered among the most influential and successful player agents in the country. So what is he doing trying to keep the Giants in San Francisco?
It is like this, Steinberg said today: If the Giants take flight for Florida next season, San Francisco will lose one of its civic treasures. And his 6-year-old son, Jonathan, will lose his favorite baseball team. 
 Steinberg is suddenly the central figure in attempts to find a group of investors willing to purchase the Giants from Bob Lurie and prevent their move to the Sundome in St. Petersburg, Fla. Without a buyer, it is likely that National and American league owners will approve the sale of the club, perhaps next month.
 
Deserving of Franchise
 "I don't think I'd feel very good watching the team leave without fighting vociferously to save it," Steinberg said by phone from New York. "The litmus test is finding out how sincere the interest is in keeping the Giants in the area. Tampa-St. Pete is gorgeous, and they deserve a franchise, just not ours."
The decision Tuesday of potential investor H. Irving Grousbeck to pull out of a bid for the team undeniably set back hopes, but Steinberg said he is continuing to pursue other investors. He met with one today in New York, who will step forward within a week to make an offer. Steinberg would not identify the person.
Grousbeck projected losses of up to $10 million annually starting in 1994, but Steinberg said it was possible to increase revenues in several ways.
He said one method would be for the fans to make a bigger commitment to the team -- a broader fan base that would, he said, increase season tickets by 15,000 a year, giving the team an average attendance of about 35,000 per game and more than 2.8 million a year. He has also said that a new stadium would help attendance.
 
Request From the Mayor
 Steinberg said he was pulled into the search for a buyer by Mayor Frank Jordan of San Francisco. He said that Jordan, whom he has known for some time, called him after Jordan was elected to office in June and asked if Steinberg would help identify and contact possible investors.
Steinberg said that of the 40 people he initially reached, 20 had some interest and 10 were seriously interested. But with four weeks left before owners convene for meetings in St. Louis -- and with the Giants' owner, Bob Lurie, having already accepted an offer of a reported $111 million from a Tampa group -- even Steinberg conceded, "The amount of time is possibly too short, and the amount of money is a large one."
He is trying, though. But why?
Steinberg, 43 years old, said he would not be a part of any ownership group and that he will not receive a finder's fee for locating a buyer. But because he lives part-time in Berkeley, across the San Francisco Bay, he has an interest in the economic vitality and health of the area.
"It would be devastating to have a business like the Giants desert the city," he said. "The symbolism would send a very discouraging message to people who are trying to get California out of the recession."
He also said that his son was vividly distressed after learning that the Giants might leave.
 
Insists on Community Service
 "There's something magical about the connection of baseball and kids," Steinberg said. "The Bay Area wouldn't understand what it lost until it lost it."
Steinberg represents some 100 professional athletes, including about 70 football players, among them Warren Moon, Troy Aikman and Jets quarterback Browning Nagle. He is known for accepting only clients who give back to their communities -- some, for instance, have provided scholarships to their former universities -- and said that his interest in keeping the Giants is similar.
"I don't know how I'd answer the question, 'Why did we let the Giants get away?' " he said.
 
Marlin Owner Raises Money
 FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., Aug. 12 (AP) -- The chairman of the Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation, Wayne Huizenga, sold 1.5 million shares of his stock in the company to help pay for his Florida Marlins, Blockbuster announced today.
The shares amounted to about 9 percent of his Blockbuster holdings. He still holds about 14.7 million shares, according to a company statement. Officials did not provide further details of the stock sale.
During Blockbuster's annual meeting last year, Huizenga said he would probably sell two million shares to help pay for the Marlins, which cost an estimated $135 million.
The National League team is to begin play next season.
The video rental company has approximately 18.5 million shares outstanding. It closed today up 12 1/2 cents to $12.625 on the New York Stock Exchange.

UNITED AIRLINES IS OFFERING AROUND-THE-WORLD FLIGHTS

BYLINE: AP

 BODY:
United Airlines is offering around-the-world flights that will link its Atlantic and Pacific networks with new service through New Delhi, beginning Feb. 10. Some analysts dismissed the plan as a marketing ploy based on an outdated image of the romanticism of air travel. "What's the point?" asked James C. Halstead, a securities analyst at Hoare Govett. "The last time we really saw this was Pan Am as they expanded their network. It's now irrelevant." Passengers will pay $2,241 for economy seats and $4,159 for first class if they leave from the United States, a United spokesman said. He said the prices would probably fall later. Passengers leaving from London pay more, from $2,944 to $7,033.

HEADLINE: For America's Common Wealth

 BODY:
Millions will save a few cents every time they buy orange juice, a few dollars on shirts and sweaters and a few hundred dollars on automobiles because of the North American Free Trade Agreement concluded in Washington yesterday. All told, if Congress approves, consumers will save billions. But none of the savings will come labeled "Courtesy of the Trade Agreement" and few consumers will know to be grateful.
On the other side of the ledger, however, the losers, though few, will be highly visible -- and vocal. Some factories in the textile, glass and automobile industries will shut down, throwing workers onto unemployment lines. 
 They'll surely express angry opposition when the agreement arrives in Congress for approval. It comes as no surprise that Senator Donald Riegle and Representative David Bonior, both from auto-dependent Michigan, are already leading protectionist opposition.
The danger is that Congress will bend to the will of these few visible losers, in the process trashing the common wealth, the huge cumulative gains for everyone else.
The better way to proceed -- the way President Bush has promised -- is to embrace the agreement, embrace the benefits of free trade but also help dislocated workers. Now it's squarely up to Congress to do both: protect the many winners and the few losers alike.
The agreement would link the U.S., Mexico and Canada in a $6 trillion trading bloc, the world's largest. It would gradually eliminate tariffs and other trade barriers. The agreement would open Mexico's markets to U.S. exports of banking and investment services, petrochemicals, transportation and telecommunications equipment, insurance and other goods and services now blocked by Mexican tariffs or quotas. Mr. Bush delivered on his promise to build in safeguards for U.S. environmental and health standards.
Because U.S. tariffs are already low, the agreement would do more to increase U.S. exports to Mexico than vice versa. By one estimate, the agreement would create about 300,000 jobs in U.S. export industries, while eliminating about 100,000 in industries displaced by imports.
But such numbers can be misleading. The trade agreement won't affect the total number of jobs in the U.S., only their allocation. There will be more in banking and petrochemicals, fewer in textiles and glass. That means production will take place where it's cheapest, with the savings passed along to North American consumers.
Dislocated workers, many in low-paid occupations, will meanwhile need relocation assistance, retraining allowances, tuition assistance and guaranteed medical insurance. The next question is who pays, and the best answer would be for Congress to do so out of general revenues. But if that's politically impossible, Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader, has come up with a useful alternative: a tax on Mexican-U.S. trade.
At first glance, it might seem contradictory to tax trade in order to free trade, especially given Mr. Gephardt's reputation as a protectionist. If the cross-border tax is kept small and temporary, however, his idea makes sense. Asking traders to pay some of the costs of the trade agreement is a tolerable price for Congressional approval.
The trick will be to keep a good idea from being turned into a protectionist weapon. The minority of losers deserves protection from harm, but not at the expense of the common wealth.

HEADLINE: Health Care Market Has Failed Consumers;
Oregon Plan Misfires

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"A Bold Medical Plan, Derailed" (editorial, Aug. 6) shows woeful misunderstanding of the issues involved in Secretary of Health and Human Services Louis Sullivan's rejection of Oregon's misdirected attempt to ration health care. There are more reasons than the few you attempt to rebut to reject this basic change in the state's Medicaid program.
Oregon lawmakers like me who opposed the rationing plan have been frustrated by the news media's inability to look behind the scheme's fashionable attractiveness and to examine the fundamental issues it presents. The Oregon plan ignores, and perhaps exacerbates, the most pressing necessity for health care reform in America: cost control and reduction. Instead of restricting the profits of care providers, the Oregon proposal allows payments to increase by 30 percent. 
 The Oregon plan is an attempt by the medical establishment to avoid what you call "real comprehensive medical reform." Do you seriously think a proposal supported by every medical professional group and association could constitute real reform? Economic self-interest is at the heart of this controversy.
The American medical establishment is desperate to find an alternative to the Canadian model, which has become, despite its faults, the most attractive solution to the problems of our own unworkable system. Why? Under the Canadian approach the incomes of physicians will go down. Under the Oregon plan the incomes of providers increase. In Canada medical expenditures are limited by real cost controls; the Oregon approach places the entire burden of reform on needy patients.

HEADLINE: Two Regulators Say Testimony Led to Demotions

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 12

 BODY:
Two Government lawyers who raised questions about the Federal commitment to recover money from officials of failed savings and loans said today that their efforts had placed them in a professional twilight zone.
Jacqueline P. Taylor and Bruce Pederson had harshly criticized their employer, the Resolution Trust Corporation, in a Senate hearing on Tuesday, lamenting what they regarded as the political influence that is weakening their agency's efforts to recover money from wrongdoers in the savings and loan industry. 
 "I'm a licensed attorney practicing for eight years in Colorado and practicing for seven years in Minnesota; this is all in jeopardy," Ms. Taylor said today in an interview at her lawyer's office, a short distance from the Senate hearing room where she testified on Tuesday. She has been demoted and reassigned from her position in Denver overseeing Resolution Trust cases against former savings and loan officials.
Mr. Pederson, a manager in the Denver office, said he had also been demoted.
 
Pledge of No Reprisals
 Albert V. Casey, the president of Resolution Trust, assured Senators on Tuesday that there would be no reprisals against the lawyers for their testimony, in which they talked of political pressures not to pursue certain cases aggressively.
Appearing more relaxed than she did on Tuesday, but still frustrated, Ms. Taylor said: "For me personally, it's been hurtful. Is it worth it? If it stops the damage."
Ms. Taylor and Mr. Pederson filed a class-action grievance with Resolution Trust in what they called an attempt to restore the independence and effectiveness of the unit where they worked.
They said they were motivated in part by the recent death of another lawyer in the Denver office who also aggressively pursued cases against former savings and loan officials and was under tremendous pressure.
Mr. Pederson said part of the reason he came forward to criticize his own agency was purely emotional. "A former colleague died recently of a heart attack at 36; it has an effect on you," he said.
The unit where they worked is called professional liability. This once obscure legal and regulatory backwater has increasingly taken on political coloration, the two lawyers say, as the unit's staff and policies are diluted.
 
Change in Guidelines Weighed
 Mr. Casey insists in public statements that the corporation intends to pursue vigorously any and all wrongdoers. But more quietly, as part of the Bush Administration's election year deregulatory efforts, top Administration and White House officials have been involved in discussions over whether the Government should change its guidelines for suing former officers and directors of failed banks and savings and loans, according to documents and officials.
A recent draft guideline circulating among Federal agencies would make it harder to sue some directors, the lawyers say. Even if that guideline is not adopted, they said they detected a subtle relaxation of the standard in practice.
The people who stand to gain from softer guidelines are the thousands of former directors of failed savings and loans and banks. Some of them are politically influential, including two Cabinet members -- Edward R. Madigan, the Secretary of Agriculture, and Edward J. Derwinski, the Veterans Affairs Secretary. Others are prominent citizens and many have never been accused of wrongdoing before. They often complain that they are simply innocent victims of a bad economy and should not be sued by the Federal Government.
In her testimony, Ms. Taylor said the agency recently dropped plans to sue officials of an unnamed institution around the time one of the officials visited with President Bush. She criticized the decision to resolve the case out of court as "an inappropriate settlement because of political reasons."
Officials who asked not to be identified said the institution at issue was Deseret Federal Savings and Loan, based in Salt Lake City, before it was taken over by the Government in 1989. A longtime outside director of the savings and loan, Howard W. Hunter, is a senior Mormon Church official, and was one of a number of church officials who met with President Bush last month in Salt Lake City.
A church spokesman, Don LeFevre, said the savings and loan litigation was not discussed at the meeting.
Ms. Taylor said she had tried to be careful and balanced in deciding whom to sue. She worked mainly for private financial institutions before joining Resolution Trust last year.
"There were many times we received exculpatory information that certain targets had not done anything negligent and we dropped them" as potential defendants, she said.
Mr. Pederson, in contrast to Ms. Taylor, has spent much of his legal career in the Federal Government, including a stint at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's professional liability unit.
Because the Government insures savings and loan deposits it must pay for the cost of bailing out failed institutions. The less money the Government recovers from wrongdoers the more taxpayers have to contribute to the cost of the rescue, now estimated at more than $300 billion.

 CORRECTION:
A headline and a picture caption in Business Day yesterday about Government lawyers who raised questions about the recovery of money from savings and loan officials misstated the sequence of events. The lawyers were demoted before their Senate testimony, not after it.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Republicans;
BAKER LEAVING STATE DEPT. TO HEAD WHITE HOUSE STAFF AND GUIDE BUSH'S CAMPAIGN

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 13

 BODY:
President Bush today appointed Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d to run the White House and direct his campaign, and both men vowed to salvage the President's re-election by putting domestic issues at the top of their agenda.
In a surprisingly direct admission that the Administration had dwelled on foreign affairs at the expense of economic and social concerns, Mr. Baker declared that from now on, "President Bush targets America." 
 With the appointment of his closest friend as chief of staff and senior counselor, the President gutted the top ranks of the State Department and swept through the upper echelon of the White House.
 
Seeking Another Mandate
 "We must insure that the United States is unquestionably safe and strong at home and abroad," Mr. Bush said in a White House appearance. "And I also want his counsel and assistance as I seek a mandate from the American people to put this program into action."
Mr. Baker resigned as Secretary of State effective Aug. 23, after the Republican National Convention, but he clearly left the door open to resume the job if Mr. Bush wins in November. Deputy Secretary Lawrence S. Eagleburger will serve as Acting Secretary.
By replacing Samuel K. Skinner as chief of staff and taking on the new counselor's title, Mr. Baker assumes what Mr. Skinner described today as "unprecedented" power: combining control of the White House, the campaign and foreign policy into one office.
Another senior official said, "It's the closest thing we've had to a deputy President in modern history."
 
Holding the Reins
 Mr. Baker has always run the State Department with the help of a small inner circle. A senior department official said today that Mr. Baker would use his contacts and his broad responsibilities as chief of staff to remain involved in foreign policy.
Pushing aside Mr. Skinner and significantly reducing the influence of his campaign manager, Robert M. Teeter, Mr. Bush moved Mr. Baker and his circle of close aides into jobs that the White House made clear will be directed as much at winning Mr. Bush a second term as at running the executive branch.
Mr. Teeter "will continue to run the campaign under the direction of the President and the chief of staff," said Mr. Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater.
"The campaign leadership and Secretary Baker have had long experiences with working together." he added, explaining a move that sent a wave of relief through White House and campaign officials but drew immediate fire from Democrats.
They accused Mr. Bush of sacrificing national security to political ambition at a time when the Middle East peace talks have not concluded and the Balkan war threatens the "new world order" Mr. Bush has tried to establish.
Mr. Fitzwater countered: "We want the best team we can get. We want the best players here, and we've got them and we're moving forward."
 
Stand on Ethics Reassessed
 Mr. Fitzwater said the political activities of Mr. Baker and his principal aides would not violate a 1991 directive by C. Boyden Gray, the White House counsel, forbidding campaign work by the White House staff. The memo noted that Federal law made it illegal to use White House money or equipment for campaign purposes and that "certain restrictions" were imposed on political work, even by Mr. Bush's senior appointees.
Mr. Fitzwater said the counsel, who was designated by President Bush as his ethics policeman, had now reviewed his earlier position with the help of Justice Department lawyers and decided that these appointments did not violate it.
Mr. Gray and Justice Department officials said today that previous White House chiefs of staff, including Mr. Skinner, had played important campaign roles. The chief of staff position is not covered by the Hatch Act, the Federal law barring Government workers from political activities.
Mr. Bush was described by aides as relieved but a bit vexed, perhaps because a campaign that he had expected to be a virtual coronation had deteriorated to the point where he had to turn once again to Mr. Baker, who rescued his campaign in 1988.
During a day of announcements, news conferences and speeches, Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker signalled a new turn in the President's efforts to bolster his dismal poll ratings. He and Mr. Baker acknowledged that Mr. Bush's domestic policies had disappointed many Americans, but said he had been consumed by pressing world affairs.
"I recognize that many Americans today are anxious, many have genuine concerns and others have doubts," Mr. Bush said at the White House. "But over the past four years Americans have accomplished results that once seemed beyond possibility."
 
'No Apologies for That'
 His words were amplified by Mr. Baker in a speech at the State Department. "Some will ask why President Bush spent so much time on foreign policy during his first term, and here is my reply," Mr. Baker said.
"The President saw a chance to take on the two central problems of our age -- the struggle for freedom and the threat of nuclear war -- and he seized it," Mr. Baker said. "No apologies for that. It's time now to turn to new challenges."
The Democrats wasted no time attacking the President over the shift. Gov. Bill Clinton, the Democratic nominee, said in California that he worried that the move would hurt the Middle East peace process and make the Republican campaign "cleverly negative" instead of "clumsily negative."
"He's one of the best politicians, deal makers and political handlers they've got," the Arkansas Governor said of Mr. Baker.
Mr. Clinton also sought to brush aside the new argument that Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker were trying to make. "I think this argument that we had to take care of the world in our first term, and now we'll get around to America if you'll give us another term, I don't think the American people are going to find that too persuasive," he said.
 
Gore Sees a 'Panic'
 His running mate, Senator Al Gore of Tennessee, called the move "a sign of extraordinary political panic to take a sitting Secretary of State out of the Mideast talks and the other negotiations that are under way to concentrate purely on political activities."
Democratic reaction from Capitol Hill was negative. "Jim Baker was doing such an excellent job as Secretary of State that I believe this move is a mistake and not in the national interest," said Senator Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
White House aides gritted their teeth against the criticism. "I am sure that Secretary Baker is pleased and proud of this newfound respect that he's getting from Democrats," Mr. Fitzwater said. "Eat your heart out, folks."
In replacing Mr. Skinner, the President gave the former Transportation Secretary a consolation prize: naming him "general chairman" of the Republican National Committee, which was been largely an honorary post.
 
Recruiting the Old Team
 Mr. Baker, meanwhile, essentially reassembled the team that helped him run Mr. Bush's 1988 campaign, removing them from the powerful State Department posts in which they have helped Mr. Baker run foreign policy in a tight circle based on personal loyalties and longstanding relationships.
Bringing those aides with him was apparently part of the deal that Mr. Baker struck with Mr. Bush, beginning with a conversation the two men had on a fishing trip to Wyoming last month.
Margaret D. Tutwiler, Mr. Baker's close aide and spokeswoman, will become White House communications chief. Mr. Fitzwater, who held that job briefly, returns -- "happily" as he put it -- to his spokesman's role.
Robert B. Zoellick, Under Secretary of State for Economic and Agricultural Affairs, will become deputy chief of staff; Dennis B. Ross, the State Department director of policy planning, will take on that same post -- a new one -- at the White House; and Janet Mullins, who was Mr. Baker's Congressional liaison, will be the White House political director and campaign liaison.
 
Some Familiar Faces
 There was widespread speculation that Mr. Baker would bring back Republican strategists who had been excluded from the campaign by Mr. Teeter, including Roger Ailes, Mr. Bush's 1988 advertising consultant; Kenneth Duberstein, who was Mr. Reagan's last chief of staff; and perhaps even Edward J. Rollins, who briefly worked for the Ross Perot campaign.
Clayton K. Yeutter, the White House domestic policy coordinator, is expected to leave the Bush Administration and return to his private life in Illinois.
Mr. Skinner's deputy, W. Henson Moore, will be put in charge of White House relations with state and local governments.
In an interview, Mr. Skinner, whom Mr. Bush praised lavishly, put the best face on his removal, saying he had gone to Mr. Bush two or three months ago and suggested that Mr. Baker needed to be brought back. "We knew we were in a fight for our life," Mr. Skinner said.
Mr. Baker was White House chief of staff in 1984, during Ronald Reagan's re-election campaign, and ran campaigns for Mr. Bush in 1980 and again in 1988, when he came in to help revive the Vice President's fortunes as he trailed Gov. Michael S. Dukakis after the Democratic National Convention.
 
Even More Powerful
 But Mr. Baker in 1984 did not have undisputed sway over either the White House, where other powerful figures challenged his authority, or over the campaign.
Today, campaign and White House aides talked happily about a new phase in the campaign. But for the two men at the top, it may in some ways be a return to an old one.
In 1989, when Mr. Bush took office, he had to deflate Mr. Baker after suggestions that Mr. Baker's deputies did little to quash talk that the new Secretary of State was a deputy president.
No sooner had Mr. Bush announced today's move than the talk started again, and Mr. Fitzwater found himself having to stress reassure the press corps that Mr. Bush, not Mr. Baker, was in charge.
"He's been chief of staff before, and he knows the position," Mr. Fitzwater said.
"The President maintains all of the policy prerogatives that he always has. There's no change."

HEADLINE: Friend in a Time of Need

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 13

 BODY:
James A. Baker 3d is a formidable political operator, and he should have no trouble in imposing order upon the disarray that he inherits as impresario of President Bush's re-election campaign. He has Mr. Bush's ear, and he tells him what he thinks in an uninhibited, fraternal way. His new role will do wonders for Republican morale in the days ahead.
But Mr. Baker is subject to the same limitations as all campaign managers. A shrewd tactician can give an edge to a candidate, but at the Presidential level he cannot do the candidate's job, nor can he often change the direction the political winds blow. 
 James A. Farley in the 1930's and Lawrence F. O'Brien in the 1960's were considered master manipulators, but their candidates, Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy, were their own biggest electoral assets. Farley, O'Brien and Svengali together could not have elected Adlai E. Stevenson or Barry Goldwater or Michael S. Dukakis.
 
Baker's Strategy
 It is Mr. Bush, not Mr. Baker, who must be the medium for whatever message the new chief of staff may come up with; it is he who must make the speeches, he who must debate Mr. Clinton and he who will be pictured in the television advertising. What message and what means of delivering it will convert the President from a symbol of what has gone wrong to a symbol for its cure?
Mr. Baker will give it a good try. He provided a clue to his strategy when he said in his farewell remarks at the State Department that Mr. Bush had been obliged to concentrate on foreign policy in his first term because of a momentous series of upheavals in the world, but was now ready to turn to the domestic concerns -- jobs, schools, health care -- that preoccupy Americans.
But Mr. Bush has been trying to sell that line since the New Hampshire primary this year, when he traveled to that economically squeezed state and told voters tired of foreign policy speeches, "Message: we care."
Representative Vin Weber of Minnesota, a leader among his party's conservatives, was as happy as any other Republican to hear that Mr. Baker was taking over. He warned, though, that "there's no magic bullet, no miracle to be worked" in the campaign.
It will be harder this time than it was in 1988, when Mr. Baker stepped in to rescue Mr. Bush at the nadir of another Presidential campaign. Then Mr. Bush, however indifferent a campaigner he had proved, was the heir-apparent to an immensely popular President, the economy was booming and he had a clean slate on which to write his pledges and portray his virtues. Now he is an unpopular incumbent, well known to the voters, burdened with a limp economy.
It may be harder even than in 1976, when Mr. Baker almost piloted Gerald R. Ford to victory over Jimmy Carter, despite Mr. Ford's pardon of his disgraced predecessor, Richard M. Nixon.
 
Setting Goals
 Defining the task is simple enough. Almost all senior politicians in both parties agree that the President's biggest problem -- bigger than his broken promise not to raise taxes, bigger than the recession -- has been his failure to articulate a series of goals for the United States in the decades ahead and the means of achieving them. As a Senator who sees Mr. Bush regularly put it, "He hasn't yet, at this late date, given the country a reason for voting him a second term, and if he can't do that, then he will not be re-elected."
It is widely believed that Mr. Carter failed to provide the voters with a picture of what his second term might be like, and he was denied one.
Mr. Baker's main job is developing such a message, setting priorities, and finding a way for Mr. Bush to sell them to a dubious electorate. Yet Mr. Baker has never been any more expert in the conception of sweeping themes than the President himself. He is the Republicans' supreme pragmatist, ever suspicious of ideology.
There is also the inherent contradiction that faces the incumbents in a year when even they concede the national craving for change. Mr. Bush said this morning of Mr. Baker, "He knows about change, how to distinguish wise moves from foolish ones." Mr. Baker sought to portray the first Bush term as showing how to master change.
Mickey Kantor, a member of Mr. Clinton's inner circle, put the point with partisan acerbity. Mr. Baker will be very hard put, he said, to "give the President a vision transplant."
Mr. Baker is not to take over his new job until after the Republican National Convention, which opens on Monday in Houston, but he will have to go to work sooner than that.
His first task is to banish defeatism, and he made a start on that in his State Department talk. The critics said the United States could not put together and sustain a coalition in the Persian Gulf war, and it did, he reminded his co-workers. They said this country could not produce meaningful Middle East peace talks, and it did.
The message was plain: Despite the polls, despite the quiet desperation in Republican ranks, despite voters' confusion about what the Administration stands for, George Bush and Jim Baker, the dynamic duo, together again, will once more silence the skeptics and put Bill Clinton and Al Gore to rout.
In the three weeks since the Democratic convention, Mr. Bush has been unable to make a significant dent in the Democrats' lead. By past standards, he should have cut it in half, at least, by this stage. Now the goal is to do so by Labor Day, which is three weeks away, and that may prove to be impossible unless the convention and Mr. Bush's speech next Thursday are big hits.
But then, Mr. Bush would not have proposed the switch, and Mr. Baker would not have agreed to make it, unless things were pretty desperate. The Secretary of State is only very reluctantly moving back to precisely the job he held before moving to the Treasury and then on to the State Department, and he is not helping his own prospects of running for President in four years.
 
What About the Balkans?
 Furthermore, the President has opened himself to criticism on several grounds. A European ambassador said today that the President, by nearly cleaning out the upper echelons of the State Department, "makes it look as if he puts a higher priority on his own survival than on any world problem -- Somalia, Bosnia, the Middle East peace talks, the Iraq crisis, you name it."
Mr. Bush's old friend and counsel, C. Boyden Gray, had only recently issued a memorandum arguing that, from an ethical point of view, campaign tasks should not be undertaken by members of the White House staff, which of course is exactly what Mr. Baker plans to do. So the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, had to go through a lot of contortions about the essentially inseparable nature of policy and politics to cope with that embarrassment.
Finally, from a purely political perspective, Mr. Bush looks like a weak leader, a candidate who can find only one man with whom he is truly comfortable and upon whom he can rely for advice and support in extremis. That puts Mr. Baker in a strikingly powerful position. Washington was talking of him today as a Deputy President, and some voters may find that an excessive role for someone nobody voted for.
None of that will matter if Mr. Baker can turn the campaign around, of course, and many things could happen between now and November that would make his job easier, like a major crisis abroad or some deeply damaging new revelation about Mr. Clinton's past. But at the moment this looks as if it may be one of those years, like 1912, 1932 and 1952, when the tide runs so strongly against the "ins" that it is difficult for the most accomplished campaign strategists to divert it.

Chrysler asked Alan Greenspan for help on its $6.8 billion loan package. The company asked the Fed chairman to intercede with Germany's central bank on its behalf, because a few banks in the 152-member worldwide consortium, including a German institution, are refusing to renew their loans. The company and analysts view the loan package as vital to its revitalization. [Page D1.]
Kirk Kerkorian's apprehensions about Chrylser management were quelled. Two top executives and an outside director of the anto maker held a peace conference with the investor, who owns 9.9 percent of the company's stock. [D4.] 
 G.M. raised its prices on 1993 models by 1.6 percent on average, less than Ford and Chrysler. Some prices were lowered. [D4.]
Equitable Companies lost $17.6 million from continuing operations in the second quarter, considerably lower than its $212.6 million loss a year earlier. It went public in July. [D3.]

HEADLINE: Latest Economic Data Show More Listlessness

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 13

 BODY:
In a flurry of mixed but essentially uninspiring economic statistics, the Government reported today that retail sales climbed five-tenths of 1 percent in July while workers' buying power fell, even though consumer inflation was very modest.
Another report showed that first-time claims for unemployment insurance dropped 66,000 in the week that ended on Aug. 1, reversing an increase in the preceding week related to a temporary companywide shutdown by the General Motors Corporation. 
 Today's figures, which included a rise in the Consumer Price Index of just one-tenth of 1 percent, might have been regarded more favorably if not for a downward revision in June's retail sales that transformed an advance of five-tenths of 1 percent into a decline of three-tenths of 1 percent.
Retail sales, which account for about a third of economic activity, were thus considered something of a disappointment, and analysts said they still did not see any significant pickup in an economy so sluggish that five straight quarters of growth have yet to convince many Americans that the recession is over.
"It just doesn't have any verve, vim or get-up-and-go," Paul W. Boltz of T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore said of the economy.
The Commerce Department's initial tally, based on a small sample of its retail respondents, showed July sales at $159.5 billion, up five-tenths of 1 percent for the month and 3 percent above the level of July 1991.
Although the figures are adjusted for seasonal, holiday and trading-day differences, price changes are ignored. With consumer inflation at 3.2 percent the last 12 months, this means the volume of goods moving across retail counters the last year has been almost unchanged.
Sales of nondurable goods rose six-tenths of 1 percent last month, with increases posted for nearly all categories. Receipts were up 2.3 percent for department stores and others selling general merchandise, while the gains were nine-tenths of 1 percent for restaurants and bars, eight-tenths of 1 percent for apparel and accessory stores, two-tenths of 1 percent for gasoline stations and one-tenth of 1 percent for food stores.
The only decline was at drug and proprietary stores, which slumped two-tenths of 1 percent.
All big categories of durable goods contributed to an overall advance of four-tenths of 1 percent. Stores selling furniture, home furnishings and equipment did best, posting a 1.3 percent gain; automotive dealers eked out a one-tenth of 1 percent increase.
Most analysts remained unimpressed. "There is nothing in these figures that suggests the economy is even close to emerging from the slow growth pattern," said Gordon Richards, economist for the National Association of Manufacturers.
 
Prices Remain Stable
 The report by the Labor Department that the Consumer Price Index rose just one-tenth of 1 percent in July was seen as reflecting a weak economy as well as providing reassurance that inflation remained firmly under control.
Of the seven principal groups, only transportation and medical care -- both of which rose five-tenths of 1 percent last month -- had sizable increases. And even the rising cost of medical care has moderated of late; it was up at an annual rate of 6.1 percent over the latest three months, compared with 7.8 percent for the quarter that ended in April.
The cost of housing slowed to a one-tenth of 1 percent advance last month from four-tenths of 1 percent in June, while food prices declined slightly with the aid of a 3.6 percent drop for fresh fruit.
Airline fares, which had dropped nearly 10 percent in the preceding two months, rose 3.2 percent in July. The so-called core inflation rate, with food and energy excluded, was up two-tenths of 1 percent in July, the third straight month at this pace.
For the five metropolitan areas for which July data were published today, there were increases of three-tenths of 1 percent for New York and Los Angeles, lesser increases for San Francisco and Chicago and a one-tenth of 1 percent decline for Philadelphia.
The one-tenth of 1 percent rise in the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers pushed it to 140.5, meaning that a basket of goods and services that cost $10 in the 1982-84 base period now costs $14.05.
Services, which account for 55 percent of the index, rose three-tenths of 1 percent for the second straight month while commodities, accounting for 45 percent, rose one-tenth of 1 percent, less than in May or June.
The companion Consumer Price Index covering urban wage earners and clerical workers rose two-tenths of 1 percent last month, to 138.4.
The Labor Department also calculated today that real average weekly earnings fell two-tenths of 1 percent in July, reflecting hourly earnings and weekly hours worked that were both unchanged as prices rose two-tenths of 1 percent.
The decline of 66,000 in initial jobless claims, the biggest in 13 years, put the total at 403,000 for the week ended Aug. 1, returning it to near the 400,000 level of July 18.

NEW YORK CITY
 
ESCOBAR INDICTED IN BROOKLYN
Pablo Escobar, who is said to run the Medellin cocaine cartel, and the man described as the cartel's top assassin, Dandeny Munoz-Mosquera, were indicted in Brooklyn on Federal charges of blowing up an Avianca airliner in 1989, killing all 110 people on the plane. When Mr. Munoz-Mosquera was arrested in Queens last year, Federal agents were unable to charge him with anything more serious than making false statements about his identity although they said they believed that he had murdered many people in Colombia. B3.
 
A DEADLINE LOOMS FOR DAILY NEWS
With a deadline looming from the bankruptcy court, the issue of which prospective buyer will be able to acquire The Daily News will probably be settled soon. Then again, maybe not. B3. 

STRANDS OF EVIDENCE PRESENTED
Prosecutors in the case against Alejandro Henriquez presented their strongest pieces of evidence to a Bronx jury: hair and fiber samples they say link the defendant to all three young victims he is accused of strangling to death. B2.
 
WOODY ALLEN SUES FOR CUSTODY
Woody Allen, the prolific film maker who once confessed, "I like to spend my time with work and only a limited time with kids," filed suit against his longtime companion, Mia Farrow, for custody of their three children. B3.
 
REGION
 
A LOT OF PEOPLE, A FEW POLICE
While a special state commission examines the disturbances that erupted June 14 along the boardwalk in Belmar, N.J., the man leading the investigation said he was surprised that trouble had not occurred elsewhere where small police departments have to deal with big crowds. B4.
 
OPENING UP THE PORT AUTHORITY
Amid widespread allegations of excessive spending, and under pressure from lawmakers in Trenton and Albany, the commissioners of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey voted to end a decades-old procedure of using executive sessions to conduct business outside the public eye. B4.
 
WATER USE ON THE RISE
Despite year-round conservation measures, water use in Nassau County is on the rise, raising new concerns about the potential contamination of the county's underground water supply in the coming decades, Assemblyman Thomas DiNapoli said. He called for a tightening of state restrictions on water pumping in the 51 water districts in the county, even if it means further limits on water use. B4.
 
A HOLE IN THE NEW JERSEY BUDGET
Saying that New Jersey is "paying the price for the static national economy," Treasurer Samuel F. Crane announced that the state finished the latest budget year $37.6 million in the hole, largely because it collected less sales tax than expected. The gap represents about three-tenths of 1 percent of the $11.5 billion budget for the fiscal year that ended June 30. B5.
 
SUING TO SAVE THEIR JOBS
The state's largest public employee union filed a lawsuit in state court to block the layoffs of 1,200 of its members. The defendants are Governor Florio, Personnel Commissioner Anthony J. Cimino and Treasurer Samuel F. Crane. B5.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
Excerpts From Clinton's Speech on Foreign Policy Leadership

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 13

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a speech today by Gov. Bill Clinton to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council.
The world remains a place of peril. While the Soviet Union is gone, a President must still be ready to defy and to defeat those who threaten us. Whatever else we expect of our Presidents, we still need a resolute leader who will wield America's might, and marshal all our resources and the resources of our allies to defend our most fundamental interests. 
 And yet today there are new tests of leadership as well. The first is to grasp how the world we live in has changed. The second is to assert a new vision for our role in this dynamic world. The third is to summon all of our strength, our economic power, our values, and, when necessary, our military might in the service of our new vision.
I do not believe that Mr. Bush has met these tests. Despite his clear effectiveness in organizing the allies against Iraq's aggression. Too often this Administration has held on to old assumptions and old policies, trying to prop up yesterday's status quo, failing to confront our new challenges.
I have agreed with President Bush on a number of foreign policy issues, but I do not believe he has a complete vision of this new era. In a world of change, security flows from initiative, not from inertia.
Next week, the Republicans will gather in Houston to nominate Mr. Bush and to praise his record. Will they paint a partisan portrait of the past? Or render a vision of the future that we Americans can build together?
 
Credit for Communism's Fall
 In their campaign, the Republicans have already tried to claim sole credit for the victory of freedom, in the United States, and in the cold war. And they suggest that in their second term they will finally bring to domestic policy the same energy and expertise marked by foreign policy in their first term.
This argument misreads both history and current events. The notion that the Republicans won the cold war alone reminds me of the rooster who took credit for the dawn.
The truth is that from Truman to Kennedy to Carter, Democrats as well as Republican Presidents have held firm against the expansion of communism. From Richard Russell to Scoop Jackson to Sam Nunn and Les Aspin, Democratic leaders in Congress have helped build the finest defense forces in the history of the world.
More important, we must never forget that in the end, communism rotted from the inside out, with heroes both famous and unknown leading the way.
Even more flawed is the Republican claim that just as they changed the world in their first term they can now change America in their second, or fourth.
We must understand that foreign and domestic policy are now two sides of the same coin. If we're not strong at home, we cannot be strong abroad. And if we can't compete in the global economy, we will surely pay for it here at home.
The same President who refused to make changes, as American wages fell from 1st to 13th in the world, as our productivity lagged badly behind other nations, was slow to recognize changes in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
The same Administration that has so far done nothing for 10 million Americans unemployed, and more than two-thirds of our work force whose wages are now lower in real terms than they were 10 years ago, stood by as courageous Chinese students were attacked by tanks in Tienanmen Square.
A preference for the established order over constructive change gives an enormous advantage in the world in which we live to the high-wage, high-investment, high-growth nations, in Europe and Asia, with which we must inevitably compete for the futures of every man and woman, every boy and girl, in the United States of America.
Global change is inexorable, and can work to our advantage or to our disadvantage, depending on what we do.

 	 	 		. . .	 	The currency of national strength in this new era will be denominated not only in ships and tanks and planes, but in diplomas and patents and paychecks. My first foreign policy priority will be to restore America's economic vitality.
I have laid out a strategy to raise our people's skill levels, boost productivity, spur innovation and investment, reduce the national debt and make us the world's strongest trading partner.
I will elevate economics in foreign policy, create an economic security council similar to the National Security Council and change the culture in the State Department so that economics is no longer a poor cousin to old school diplomacy.
In a Clinton-Gore administration, Presidential leadership will mean mobilizing our country for the global economic competition that is the hallmark of this new age. It will mean securing commitments from American business and American labor to take on new cooperative responsibilities.
For there can be no growth without increased productivity in the private sector. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	Imagine where we would be today in California if before the big defense cuts started in 1988 we had a plan to reinvest every dollar of those defense cuts in retraining the work force, in giving companies time to retool, in reinvesting in new technologies like high speed rail, recycling, waste reduction, new systems of transportation and communication, all of which are consistent with a new approach to energy and the environment.
It would have made a big difference in California, and you wouldn't be in the fix you're in today if we'd had that plan then. It is not too late, but we must begin to pursue that course.
The second imperative of Presidential leadership in this new era is to reinforce the powerful global movement toward democracy and market economies. Our strategic interest and our moral values are both rooted in this goal.
As we helped democracy expand, we make ourselves and our allies safer. Democracies rarely go to war with each other, or traffick in terrorism. They make more reliable partners in trade and diplomacy.
Growing market economies expand individual opportunity and social tolerance.
Yet Mr. Bush has been oddly reluctant to commit America's prestige to the side of the people inspired by America's own example. When democratic reformers sought to break up the Soviet empire, this Administration at first snubbed Boris Yeltsin, sided with the crumbling Soviet center and failed to lead the call for aid to Russia until the President was pushed into it by Richard Nixon and others.
When 50 million Ukrainians sought emancipation from the dying Communist empire, this Administration withheld moral support, and instead, in Kiev itself, the President publicly chided Ukraine's voices of independence for seeking, I quote, a suicidal nationalism.
When China cracked down on pro-democracy demonstrators, exported advanced weapons to radical regimes, and suppressed Tibet, this Administration and this President failed to stand up for our values. Instead he sent secret emissaries to China signaling that we would do business as usual with those who murdered freedom in Tienanmen Square.
And when it was clear to all that Yugoslavia was inexorably breaking apart, Mr. Bush and his secretary of state gave short shrift to the yearnings of those seeking freedom, in Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia; and ignored the warning signs that Milosevic was emerging as one of Europe's bloodiest tyrants.
 
Standing for Democracy
 From the Baltics to Beijing, from Sarajevo to South Africa, time after time this President has sided with the status quo against democratic change, with familiar tyrants rather than those who would overthrow them, and with the old geography of repression rather than a new map of freedom. . . .
My administration will stand up for democracy. We will offer international assistance to emerging fragile democracies in the former Soviet Union, and Eastern Europe, and create a democracy core to help them develop free institutions.
We will keep the pressure on South Africa until the day of true democracy has dawned. 

 	 	 		. ..	 	We can never forget this essential fact: power is the basis for successful diplomacy. And military power has always been fundamental in international relationships. So a President must provide the American people with a clear explanation of our enduring security interests, and a new estimate of the threats we are likely to face in the post cold war era.
So far, in my judgment, this Administration has failed to supply that rationale; failed to give a clear strategy for a new national security; and that is fueling isolationism here at home from both the left and the right.
Today there are two wrong-headed and dangerous approaches to adjusting our defenses for this new era. One is the administration. It talks of strategic change, but basically, simply shrinks the existing cold war force structure.
Continuation of this policy runs the risk of weakening the two elements that were absolutely critical to our victory in the Gulf: our superbly trained and motivated personnel and our world class weapons technology.
At the same time, there are those, some in my party, who see defense cuts as largely a piggybank to fund domestic wish lists. With our defense structures and missions as a mere afterthought rather than a starting premise.
This policy would also weaken our technological superiority, and the quality and morale of our superb personnel.
Leadership demands more than a cold war minus or domestic spending plus approach to the defense of this nation.
A President must identify the new threats to our security, define military missions to meet those threats, adapt the forces to carry out the missions, and back up the forces with the training, technology and intelligence necessary to prevail.
We must start with a fresh assessment of the new dangers that could threaten our interests and potentially require the use of force, including the risk of new threats from former Soviet republics should democracy fail, especially before all the nuclear weapons had been dismantled.
The spread of weapons of mass destruction, historic tensions in various regions, especially the Korean peninsula and the Middle East. And the related risks of terrorist attacks. And the growing intensity of ethnic, fundamentalist, and separatist violence, as we have seen in Yugoslavia and elsewhere, that can spill across borders and engulf other nations.
The mission of containing an expansionist Soviet Union has disappeared, but an enduring mission remains. To maintain nuclear deterrence even as we reduce nuclear arsenals. To reassure our friends and allies and discourage potential adversaries. To pursue our interests when possible through strengthened institutions of collective security. To preserve freedom on the high seas and protect our global economic interest.
And to provide the superior technology and forces that are the ultimate guarantor of liberty. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	 My administration will make security and savings compatible. It will reduce forces, but maintain a credible presence in Europe and Asia. We will stand up for our interests, but we will share burdens, where possible, through multilateral efforts to secure the peace, such as NATO, and a new voluntary U.N. rapid deployment force.
In Bosnia, Somalia, Cambodia, and other torn areas of the world, multilateral action holds promise as never before, and the U.N. deserves full and appropriate contributions from all the major powers.
It is time for our friends to bear more of the burden.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Democrats;
Clinton Says Bush Failed Leaderships Tests Abroad

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 13

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton challenged George Bush today in the area the President boasts as his greatest strength, the conduct of foreign policy, and pronounced the White House approach "flawed" because it ignored domestic economic problems.
Mr. Clinton, who has more often stressed his agreement with the President on the handling of policy matters in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, abandoned that approach today to try to prove that the Governor of a small state can handle international concerns. 
 "Whatever else we expect of our President, we still need a resolute leader who will wield America's might and marshal all our resources and the resources of our allies to defend our most fundamental interests," Mr. Clinton said in a speech to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council.
"And yet today there are new tests of leadership as well," he said. "The first is to grasp how the world we live in has changed. The second is to assert a new vision for our role in this dynamic world. The third is to summon all of our strengths, our economic power, our values and, when necessary, our military might in the service of our new vision.
"I do not believe Mr. Bush has met these tests."
 
More Aggressive Approach
 The Democratic nominee has stepped onto foreign policy turf before, delivering speeches at Georgetown University in December and to the Foreign Policy Association in New York last spring. Both were intended to demonstrate that he had firm opinions on international issues.
But as the Bush Administration has challenged Mr. Clinton in recent weeks by suggesting that he could not be trusted to handle such serious matters and would be "reckless" in formulating American policy, Mr. Clinton has grown more aggressive as well.
The Arkansas Governor said his plans to revive the nation's economy would be his "first foreign policy priority." He also said his administration would offer foreign aid to emerging democracies, support the peace process in the Middle East, support the creation of a Radio Free Asia and act in concert with other nations to support democratic forces throughout the world.
"We will make the United States the catalyst for a collective stand against aggression, the action I have urged for some time in response to Serbian aggression in Bosnia, one with which the Bush Administration now agrees after the President's press secretary first called it reckless."
Mr. Clinton supports increased financing of some new military technology, including the C-17 aircraft, the V-22 Osprey aircraft, which takes off like a helicopter and flies like a conventional plane, and the Seawolf submarine. He also said the United States should be prepared to make increased use of National Guard and Reserve forces "so that our use of force will be considered with utmost seriousness, maintained affordably and supported broadly at home."
He said shifting the emphasis to more mobile forces would result in military budget savings of about $60 billion more than President Bush has proposed over the next five years.
"My administration will make security and savings compatible," Mr. Clinton said. He said he would accomplish this in part by forcing other American allies to share more of the burden for maintaining peacekeeping forces in Europe and elsewhere.
"In Bosnia, Somalia, Cambodia and other torn areas of the world, multilateral action holds promise as never before, and the U.N. deserves full and appropriate contributions from all the major powers," he said. "It is time for our friends to bear more of the burden."
In his remarks today, he stressed the link between a robust American economy and strength abroad, saying that "foreign and domestic policy are now two sides of the same coin."
Mr. Bush, he said, "abdicated leadership" on global environmental issues at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June, has tried to "prop up yesterday's status quo," and has allowed a debt-laden economy to become his Administration's "most glaring foreign policy failure."
"In a world of change, security flows from initiative, not from inertia," Mr. Clinton said. His remarks seemed designed to be a pointed response to Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d's assertion today that the Bush Administration has scored impressive foreign policy victories.
"The notion that the Republicans won the cold war reminds me of the rooster who took credit for the dawn," Mr. Clinton said.
"We must never forget that in the end, communism rotted from the inside out, with heroes both famous and unknown leading the way," he said.
Mr. Clinton particularly criticized the White House as being slow to come to the aid of democracy protesters in China, tardy in recognizing the impending changes in the former Soviet Union and negligent in supporting human rights elsewhere.
"From the Baltics to Beijing, from Sarajevo to South Africa, time after time, this President has sided with the status quo instead of democratic change, with familiar tyrants rather than those who would overthrow them, and with the old geography of repression rather than a new map of freedom," Mr. Clinton said.
In every discussion he has held about foreign policy, Mr. Clinton has been asked how he would be able to handle international concerns when his experience has been largely domestic and political. Today was no exception.
He said that he would not relish the prospect of sending citizens into combat, "but neither do I flinch from it." He stressed his support -- although it was late in coming -- for President Bush's decision to use force in Kuwait. And he stated categorically that his administration would punish American companies that sold nuclear technology to "outlaw states like Iraq."
Before he delivered today's speech, Mr. Clinton told reporters: "The issue on foreign policy is, How much do you understand about the world? What are your values? What is your judgment? Do you have the personal strength to make the right decisions? The two great wars we fought in this century were led by presidents who came to the White House from the governorships."
The tougher talk about his own resolve and experience reflected a new direction for Mr. Clinton as he seeks to capitalize on the combined strengths that he has said he and Senator Al Gore, his running mate, bring to foreign policy.

HEADLINE: Rabin Hailed by Jewish Officials, Relieved Over Improved Relations

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

 BODY:
Fresh from securing President Bush's support for $10 billion in United States loan guarantees, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel received a warm reception in Manhattan yesterday from officials of American Jewish groups, many of whom expressed relief that several years of cool relations between the Bush Administration and Israel had come to an end.
Mr. Rabin, in his first major meeting with officials of American Jewish groups since he led the Labor Party to an election victory in June, pledged a "new order of national security policies" in Israel that focused on jobs and education. He outlined his Government's program to the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, an umbrella group of 50 national Jewish organizations. 
 Speaking at the Plaza Hotel, Mr. Rabin said that only in a revived economy could Israel successfully absorb the 400,000 Jews who have come to Israel from the former Soviet Union over the last few years.
"This is what is important to Israel, more than three settlements or 10,000 units in the territories," he said to applause from the American Jewish officials and referring to his decision to freeze construction of new settlements in the occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Mr. Rabin also attended a fund-raising dinner with prominent Jewish philanthropists, among them Leslie Wexner, the president and chairman of The Limited Inc., and Charles R. Bronfman, co-chairman of the Seagram Company.
As a sign of the mood that one figure described as "controlled euphoria," officials of the United Jewish Appeal said they raised $67.3 million at the dinner, making it the most successful fund-raising event in their history. They said the money would be used to help Israel resettle Jews from the former Soviet Union.
Joel D. Tauber, the national chairman of the United Jewish Appeal, said donors were encouraged both by Mr. Rabin's plans to emphasize Israel's economic redevelopment and by the repaired relationship with Mr. Bush.
"We're Americans and we're all pleased that our country is cooperating with Israel," he said. "It just makes you feel better."
Several people who attended the meeting predicted that the agreement on loan guarantees would help Mr. Bush recover some of the Jewish support that he had lost when he blocked the loan quarantees more than a year ago. The United States had insisted Israel halt building settlements in the occupied territories as a condition to receiving the loan guarantees, a condition former Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir had refused to meet.
"I think both Mr. Rabin and Mr. Bush had a domestic need to repair the relationship and especially to put the loan guarantee controversy behind them and they have suceeded in that," said Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith.
But others said that the accord came too late and feelings were too bitter for Mr. Bush to gain significant Jewish support in the November election.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Platform;
Party Takes More Conservative Stance Than Bush

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Aug. 13

 BODY:
Republicans today adopted a party platform embracing a degree of social and religious conservatism that at times goes beyond the stands taken by President Bush.
The most obvious example is support for a Constitutional amendment that would outlaw abortion. Although Mr. Bush would permit legal abortions when pregnancies were the result of rape or incest, the platform calls for prohibiting such exceptions. 
 The platform also repudiates the tax increases Mr. Bush signed two years ago. And it calls for building a fence along the Mexican border to keep out illegal aliens, a step that offends many Mexicans, just when Mr. Bush is trying to expand trade with Mexico.
After approving the platform today, the delegates tried to reach out to the people who disagree with some of the conservative planks, particularly those who advocate a right to abortion. The resolution, offered by Representative Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, an ardent foe of abortion and the dominant voice on the platform committee, states:
"We respect the honest differences of opinion of those Republicans who debate our positions on important issues and look forward to working with them toward Republican victories in November. Most importantly, we invite all Americans to join our party, to support our candidate and consider our platform, which represents the views of mainstream Americans."
While the conservatives clearly controlled the reins here this week, a few Republicans said they feared that the party was risking victory in the election by being so rigid. Richard M. Rosenbaum, the national committeeman from New York, said in an interview that he was "deeply troubled" because he thought some of the conservative planks would cost Mr. Bush votes in New York and elsewhere.
During the four days of drafting, some proposals were rejected on the ground that they ran counter to Mr. Bush's policies. Such was the case when the delegates defeated an attempt today to have the platform oppose favorable trade status for China.
 
Conservatives on Top
 But the defeats for the conservatives were few and far between.
In the area of education, for example, the platform opposes birth-control counseling and the distribution of condoms in schools, and it advocates voluntary prayer and the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in classrooms. The document supports access to school property for Bible clubs, home schooling and Government tuition subsidies for students in private and parochial schools.
On other issues, the platform opposes same-sex marriages and adoptions by same-sex couples, and it favors the ban on homosexuals in the military. It supports a law making the deliberate spread of the AIDS virus a crime, and it states explicitly that the use of condoms and needle exchanges do not prevent AIDS.
For a political document, the Republican platform has an unusually strong religious content. It states the party's belief in the Judeo-Christian tradition and declares that "faith in God" along with "hard work, service to others and limited Government" made the nation prosperous. The third paragraph after the preamble has a quotation from the Book of Proverbs: "Train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it."
The preamble has this passage: "In choosing hope over fear, Americans raised a beacon, reminding the world that we are a shining city on a hill; the last best hope for man on earth."
A few female delegates tried to delete the phrase after the semicolon or to change the word "man" to "humankind." They got little support. But there was signficant support for several delegates who thought the same phrase should be eliminated because it suggested that Jesus Christ was not the last best hope. In the end, the entire passage was retained.
The economic section advocates a wide variety of tax cuts favored by President Bush, like a tax credit for first-time home buyers and a reduction in the capital-gains tax. But it also goes beyond any tax break proposed by the Bush Administration by calling for an eventual increase in the personal exemption, the deduction a taxpayer can take for each family member, to about $5,000, more than twice what it is now.

HEADLINE: Slow Growth Foreseen By Congressional Office

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 13

 BODY:
The Congressional Budget Office said today that the United States economy was on "the verge of a sustained recovery," but would not grow enough to reduce unemployment significantly before Election Day in November.
The agency's forecast for economic growth over the next 18 months was summed up in three adjectives: tepid, torpid and anemic. 
 The report offers little solace or encouragement to President Bush as he faces an election campaign in which economic conditions are expected to be the most important issue.
 
2.5% Growth Predicted for 1992
 The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the economy will grow 2.5 percent from the final quarter of 1991 to the final quarter of 1992. "Such anemic growth will not permit a rapid drop in unemployment," the report said.
In July, 9.8 million Americans -- 7.7 percent of the work force -- were jobless.
"Although many new jobs will be created as economic growth picks up, this recovery is also expected to see an unusually large number of job losses," the Congressional Budget Office said, because of cuts in military spending and layoffs by large corporations trying to reduce costs and increase productivity.
The budget office said that the military cutbacks would, by 1995, eliminate more than 800,000 jobs in the armed forces and companies that do military-related work for the Government. In 1991, six million people were working in such jobs, about half in the Government and half in private industry.
The forecast by the Congressional Budget Office is less optimistic than that of the Bush Administration, which sees economic growth of 2.7 percent in 1992. The economy grew only three-tenths of 1 percent in 1991. The budget office forecast is generally in line with projections by private economists.
The budget office sketches an exceedingly grim picture as it scans the coming decade, from 1992 to 2002. Based on current trends and policies, it said, the Federal budget deficit will soar to $514 billion, from $314 billion, its revised estimate for the current year. The figure for this year is up from $269 billion last year and is a record, but it is well below the $352 billion projected by the budget office in January.
Federal spending for Medicare and Medicaid, the health programs for the elderly and the poor, will triple, to $605 billion from the current $198 billion, it estimated.
The Federal debt, which represents the accumulated total of all Federal borrowing, will more than double, to $6.5 trillion in the year 2002, from the current $3 trillion, the budget office said, forcing the Government to double the amount it pays in interest on the debt, to $410 billion in 2002, from the current $200 billion.
By 2002, the report says, the Federal debt will be equivalent to 66 percent of the gross domestic product, the highest such proportion since 1951, when the Government still owed huge amounts from World War II. The Government's current debt is equivalent to 51 percent of the gross domestic product, the total output of goods and services.
The Congressional Budget Office said the pace of economic growth projected for 1992 and 1993 was "only half the rate that normally occurs in the first two years of an economic recovery."
The decline in this year's deficit forecast results mainly from a delay by Congress in approving money needed to bail out savings and loan associations and to protect depositors. Once approval is given, spending of that money will increase the Federal budget deficit in the future, the report said.
The economy has been so sluggish in the last year that it "hardly seems like a recovery," the report said. Moreover, it said, the recovery is not progressing under its own power, but has been sustained in recent months by the repeated lowering of interest rates by the Federal Reserve.
The report estimates that the jobless rate will average 7.5 percent this year. In January, the Congressional Budget Office and the Bush Administration predicted that the jobless rate for this year would be 6.9 percent.

HEADLINE: Japan Reacts Cautiously to North American Trade Accord

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 13

 BODY:
Japan reacted cautiously and nervously today to the new agreement to spur free trade in North America, fearing that the accord could hurt its export-driven economy and leave it the only major economic power not part of a trading bloc.
Some Japanese officials said the North American Free Trade Agreement, if it turns out to be exclusionary, could cause Japan to reconsider the idea of an Asian trading region, something the nation has opposed. "There will be more intense discussion about the idea of Asian integration," said a Foreign Ministry official involved in economic matters. 
 The United States has been opposed to an Asian trading bloc, fearful that it would be excluded from the world's fastest-growing economic region. Malaysia has made a proposal for a trading bloc that would exclude the United States and be led by Japan.
 
Preference for Free Trade
 So far, Japan has sided with the United States in opposing the Asian bloc, saying it prefers free trade worldwide. Indeed, any gains to the United States from the opening of the Mexican market by the North American trade agreement could be more than offset if it ends up provoking measures that close off the Asian market.
Japan, which has a lot to lose if other nations protect their markets from imports, has been worried about both the North American Free Trade Agreement and plans for an economically unified European Community. And while Japan has often been accused by other nations of being an unfair trader, it has recently become more vocal in criticizing what it sees as the unfair trade practices of other nations.
Officially, Japan said today that it "in principle welcomes" the conclusion of the North American agreement, which would gradually eliminate tariffs and barriers to trade among the United States, Canada and Mexico.
But it said it would seek assurances that the agreement would not act as a barrier to Japan in the North American market and that it would conform to the worldwide trading principles known as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
"Looking at the agreement, there seem to be certain elements negative to third countries, including Japan," Yasuo Tanabe, director of North American trade policy planning for the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, said in an interview today.
Foremost among them, he said, was a provision that would gradually raise the percentage of North American content that would be required in a car for it to be moved from one North American nation to another without duties. The new rule would be 62.5 percent compared to 50 percent under the existing United States-Canada trading agreement.
 
Japanese Plants in Canada
 Three Japanese companies now have plants in Canada that export to the United States without paying tariffs -- Toyota, Honda and a joint venture of Suzuki and the General Motors Corporation. The United States has charged that the Honda cars do not meet the 50 percent requirement, although that dispute is now apparently being settled in Honda's favor, Mr. Tanabe said.

HEADLINE: Fewer Ties Are Bonding Workers to Corporations

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Robert Hempstead and Lawrence Gundrum represent two sides of the new economy, where fewer and fewer people work full time for big companies. They are part of the growing ranks of American workers who operate outside the corporate fold that had been the ideal of work life throughout the postwar years. Some are thriving; some are struggling.
The 48-year-old Mr. Hempstead of Los Gatos, Calif., is an expert in the intricacies of disk drives, the storage boxes in computers that hold vast amounts of data. After 11 years at I.B.M., he worked for a few Silicon Valley start-up ventures before setting himself up in 1989 as a one-man contractor available to companies for special projects. 
 Since then, the work has come to Mr. Hempstead. He has never lifted a phone or sent out a resume to hunt for a job. He makes up to $200,000 a year. "I'm free to do what I want and work for people I like," he said. "I love this."
Mr. Gundrum, a 49-year-old from Rowley, Mass., has not fared as well. A senior engineer and project manager at the General Electric Company's aerospace operations in Massachusetts, he was laid off at the end of 1988 in one of the company's many rounds of job cuts. At first, the electrical engineer, who also has an M.B.A. degree, was able to get good jobs with smaller firms.
But the moribund New England economy and the decline in the aerospace industry led him to switch fields, after three stints on unemployment that ate up his life savings of $60,000. Mr. Gundrum is now a loan officer for a Boston bank who gets no salary but a commission on each mortgage loan he lands.
 
'Humbling Experience'
 This year, he expects to make less than a third of the $80,000 a year he made in his best years. He is hopeful about his new career, optimistic that his income will rise considerably in time, but he admitted, "The past few years have been a devastating, humbling experience."
Mr. Hempstead and Mr. Gundrum live a continent apart in starkly contrasting circumstances and work in different industries, but they are both part of the fast-changing relationship between corporate America and the nation's workers.
Straining to become more nimble and entrepreneurial, big companies are paring down to a smaller, core work force, while increasingly farming out all sorts of Fewer Ties Are Bonding
Workers to Companies
tasks once handled in-house like corporate travel, payroll, even product design. The workers supplying these services go by various labels -- contingent workers, contractors, consultants, freelancers, temporaries -- and the satellite firms that employ some of them are said to be in the "outsourcing" industry.
 
The Companies
Headquarters Staff Will Be Shrinking
 An economy with slimmed-down companies that buy most services from outside suppliers could be more flexible and competitive. But economists warn there is also the danger that the losers, like Mr. Gundrum, may far outnumber the winners, like Mr. Hempstead.
"The worry is that this will tend to create a dual economy in America," said Michael Piore, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "Some people will do very well, but many more could end up without medical care, training opportunities or job security."
The phenomenon is difficult to measure precisely, but the trend is evident. The total employment at the Fortune 500 companies fell by 2 million, to 12 million, from 1985 to the end of last year. Workplace Trends, a bimonthly newsletter, reports that the number of people who lost jobs in cutbacks jumped from 110,000 in 1989 to 550,000 -- or more than 2,000 every workday -- last year among American companies that publicly reported staff reductions.
For the first seven months of this year, Workplace Trends says, permanent staff cuts are running 2.3 percent ahead of last year's pace.
Experts insist that few of these jobs will return when the economy improves because most companies are changing the way they operate rather than merely reacting to the recession. "There's a revolution going on in corporate America: companies getting lean, faster moving and more flexible," said William Morin, chief executive of Drake Beam Morin Inc., which finds jobs for laid-off managers and professionals. "It's never going to be the same again."
The idea of farming out work to others is certainly not new. But what is happening now takes it much further. Companies are looking closely at virtually everything they do and applying the market test: can it be done at least as well and cheaper by an outside supplier?
So things like legal work, data processing, travel, accounting, marketing research, product design, warehouses and cafeterias are being contracted out to individuals or specialist firms that provide a certain service to a handful of larger companies. What remains within the walls of a big company is, in managerial parlance, its core -- its essential skills handled by full-time employees.
In the future, that core may be surprisingly small. The current model of a big glass-and-steel corporate headquarters on landscaped grounds, directing a worldwide army of tens or hundreds of thousands may soon be a thing of the past. The corporation of the future, says Charles Handy of the London Business School, will be a core of a couple hundred people overseeing lots of related businesses, from factories to laboratories, that can range from wholly owned subsidiaries to independent subcontractors.
 
The Employees
Many Will Become Contract Workers
 Most workers, some experts predict, will have tailored employment contracts, and portable pension funds, roving from company to company to suit the needs of businesses and their own preferences. "We'll have extraordinarily sophisticated employer-worker relationships, so that almost everyone will be a contract worker," said William Davidson, a professor at the University of Southern California business school.
The process, they say, will move well beyond big companies, and to some degree it already has. Today's service subcontractors often pay outsiders to do chores for the same reasons that big companies do: to curb costs and keep their in-house experts focused on their specialties.
Wendy Liebmann, a former Revlon marketing executive, founded a New York marketing research consulting firm in 1986. Since then, the client list has grown to include Revlon, Colgate Palmolive, Conde Nast and others, but the firm still operates with a core of three professionals. Tasks like field research are farmed out to others. "We believe in hiring outside specialists just as our clients hire us as specialists," Ms. Liebmann said.
Analysts predict that temporary-help companies are poised for strong growth, once the economy recovers, because companies will hire crews of outsiders instead of adding permanent people.
And Manpower Inc., the nation's largest temporary-help company, expects to see further growth in its business of supplying clients with teams of people to handle entire service functions. Today, about 20 percent of its $1.5 billion-a-year business comes from managed services, meaning Manpower comes into a company with people and runs services like mailrooms, copy centers or telephone-marketing operations. Two years ago, contract services accounted for only 8 percent of the business, estimates Mitchell Fromstein, the company's president. John Poland, vice president for managed services, said his customers "are pushing us in this direction as fast as we can go."
In Cary, N.C., the Knowledge Systems Corporation is a high-tech subcontractor. The 35-person company is a specialist in an advanced computer software method known as object-oriented technology, which allows programs to be written in modules that can be linked together in different combinations. Its clients include Hewlett-Packard, Texas Instruments and I.B.M., and its employees are typically rented out as consultants or team leaders to product development groups in the big companies.
"Ours is a niche business with highly talented people in a specific domain," explained Reed Phillips, chief executive of Knowledge Systems.
John Mason, a 36-year-old computer scientist for Knowledge Systems, has just finished a two-year assignment as a player-coach working with a development team at a nearby I.B.M. programming lab. "Because I know the technology, I can speed up their work by pointing out shortcuts and how to avoid problems," he said.
Yet I.B.M. is a supplier of contract services as well as a buyer. A services subsidiary, Integrated Systems Solutions Corporation, runs much of the data processing under contract for companies like Eastman Kodak, United Technologies, Continental Bank and Supermarkets General.
In the first half of this year, I.B.M.'s revenue from services, including Integrated Systems, jumped 42 percent. "This kind of outsourcing is a real growth business," said Lane Jorgensen, manager for market support and planning.
 
The Bottom Line
A Boom for Some; A Bust for Others
 The people who work outside the big-company fold as contractors, consultants and freelancers are as varied as the work they do. Some speak with disdain of full-time employment with a large company as "going captive," while others hope to use contract work as a bridge to a permanent job. Contract workers, especially skilled engineers, can often make better money in the open market. They also prefer to sidestep big-company politics, often like to travel, and say that moving from project to project gives them a steady diet of technological challenges.
A 45-year-old engineer, Terry Arthur is a established contract worker. His expertise is in designing aerospace parts to withstand the stress of supersonic flight. Over the years, he has crossed the country working on the C5-A cargo plane, the Lockheed L-1011 passenger jet and Grumman's F-14 fighter, among others. Today, he is working on modifications to the Gulfstream G-4 executive jet in Savannah, Ga., under contract from Butler International Inc., a temporary-help concern that supplies engineers and technical workers.
He makes over $100,000 a year, working 50-hour weeks, leading a design team of 31 people. Through Butler, he has good medical and dental coverage, for which he pays $520 a month. His wife, Chris, and his 17-year-old son, Joseph, live in Marietta, Ga., a four-hour drive he makes on weekends. His 20-year-old daughter, Katie, attends Auburn University.
"I take a risk as a contract worker, and my family took a risk," he said. "But it's allowed me to work on a lot of new projects, and that's the exciting part of engineering."
The risk proved to be greater for Norman Johnson Sr., an electrical engineer who started as a contract worker in 1980, at age 50, after a series of regular jobs at big companies, including Raytheon and I.B.M. He admits that the shift to contract work was not entirely voluntary. "Most big companies won't hire people in the sciences at that age," he said. "Their attitude is that your skills are outdated."
For years, Mr. Norman did well, earning nearly $100,000 annually in his best years. The contract work also gave him free time to work on a passion and possible second career, as a clown. But when the economy soured, the parts-testing contract job he had disappeared at the end of 1990, when Pitney Bowes shut down the operation to which he was assigned. He could not find work elsewhere, his income plummeted, he was forced to sell his three-bedroom house in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and filed for personal bankruptcy last year.

HEADLINE: It's the 90's, Counselor: 'Superfluous' Fees Denied

BYLINE: By DAVID MARGOLICK

 BODY:
"Even a Michelangelo should not charge Sistine Chapel rates for painting a farmer's barn," Judge Joseph Weis of the United States Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit in Philadelphia wrote a decade ago. Now, another Federal Judge, Gene Carter of Portland, Me., has gone one step further: when 47 lawyers from 16 law firms apply a bit of superfluous trim to barn freshly painted by others, they should not receive a dime.
Judge Carter's decision flowed from one of the last great hostile takeovers of the 1980's, the Georgia-Pacific Corporation's 1989 acquisition of a smaller pulp and paper manufacturer, the Great Northern Nekoosa Corporation. And his blistering 61-page ruling, with Judge Weis's Michelangelo remark on the cover, signaled the end, for these plaintiffs' lawyers at least, of an era in which money flowed freely and giant fees were forked over with few questions asked. 
 The unfortunate 47 -- from 16 different law firms, largely in New York but also from Philadelphia and Chicago -- represented some Great Northern shareholders who sued company management for resisting the takeover attempt. After the $6 billion deal was struck in February 1990, the lawyers submitted a $2 million bill to Georgia-Pacific, charging $641.85 for each of the 3,121.25 hours that they said they had worked on the case.
 
Raising the Price per Share
 To justify their fee, the lawyers contended that their efforts had helped persuade Georgia-Pacific to increase its offer from $3.18 billion to the $3.74 billion it eventually paid, or from $58 to $63 per share. They had initially demanded $10 million. And with Georgia-Pacific agreeing to pay, the fix appeared to be in, subject to the judge's approval.
But as things turned out, they made their request in the wrong case at the wrong time in the wrong place before the wrong judge. On July 30 Judge Carter, egged on by a "friend of the court" brief from the State of Maine, stepped in and not only denied them the fees but lambasted them as well.
For all their apparent activity, Judge Carter ruled, the lawyers for the shareholders did little more than piggyback on the work already being done by Shearman & Sterling, counsel for Georgia-Pacific. Though the shareholders' interests and those of Georgia-Pacific clearly differed -- the former sought sale at the highest possible price, the latter at the lowest -- both pushed for a deal. And to Judge Carter, it was Shearman & Sterling that was doing all the heavy lifting, while the shareholders' counsel went along for the ride.
"The vast amounts of time and expense" the shareholders' lawyers had had generated in the case, he wrote, were "both frivolous and parasitic."
Judge Carter peppered his opinion with words like "superfluous," "duplicative," "excessive," "egregious," "exorbitant" and "extravagant." Moreover, he acerbically reviewed the lawyers' working, reading, faxing, phoning and even their eating habits -- all of which, he maintained, made their unproductive efforts still more costly.
 
Return to Frugality
 "This case is, in a way, a fin-de-siecle event," said Stuart J. Baskin of Shearman & Sterling. "These lawyers were forced to defend an 80's-era fee in a region where 90's-era frugality has been a way of life since the 1690's.
Stephen D. Oestreich of Wolf, Popper, Ross, Wolf & Jones of New York, who led the plaintiffs' lawyers group, called the ruling "just dead wrong" and said charges that he and his colleagues ran up bills on make-work were "unwarranted." He contended that Judge Carter had not understood the case, that he had misperceived their role and that he had applied a double standard in which corporations could hire lawyers to their hearts' delight while shareholders had to economize mercilessly.
But John C. Coffee, a securities law expert at Columbia Law School, said Judge Carter had simply called attention to a truism in corporate takeovers: that shareholders' lawyers routinely exaggerated their contributions, and that companies involved in acquisitions, eager to avoid nuisance suits, routinely pay them to go away.
"This court just rebelled at the notion of lawyers claiming they were the cause of something that was clearly driven by other market factors," he said. "When you have a law firm with all the resources of Shearman & Sterling, the plaintiffs' lawyers are at best a fifth wheel and probably a free rider."
 
'No Coercion, No Duress'
 The best indication that the shareholders' lawyers had helped, Mr. Oestreich said, was that Georgia-Pacific had agreed to pay them. "There was no coercion, no duress," he said. Appearing before Judge Carter, however, Mr. Baskin of Shearman & Sterling described the lawyers' role more diplomatically. "They were trying to be helpful and trying to assist," he said.
Great Northern's lawyer, Bernard J. Nussbaum of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz of New York was still more cryptic, calling the shareholder litigation "a factor" in Great Northern's handling of the case.
In addition to Wolf, Popper, the firms affected include Milberg, Weiss, Bershad, Specthrie & Lerach; Kaufman, Malchman, Kaufmann & Kirby; Stull, Stull & Brody; and the offices of Curtis V. Trinko and Joseph H. Weiss, all of New York; Kahn, Robinson, Curley & Clayton and the law office of Frederic F. Brace Jr., both in Chicago; and Berger & Montague of Philadelphia.
Even if the lawyers had affected the outcome of the case, Judge Carter wrote, they did not deserve anything close to what they were asking. He accused them of documenting their charges inadequately, padding their bills, racking up hours to produce documents that were already available from other cases, duplicating one another's efforts, charging rates for work that was performed by partners but that could easily have been assigned to secretaries, and billing to attend depositions where their presence was unnecessary and they sat mute.
He noted that lawyers from Berger & Montague in Philadelphia, for instance, attended five depositions in New York without asking a single question. He further noted that the lawyers collectively billed $8,583.11 for reading newspaper coverage of the takeover. He pointed out, too, that Steven Schulman, a lawyer at Milberg, Weiss, submitted bills for four meals in a single day.
"He may have worked up an enormous appetite recording the vast numbers of hours that he billed in this litigation, but the Court will not allow his meals to be subsidized," Judge Carter wrote. Mr. Schulman did not return a phone call seeking comment.
The visiting lawyers, particularly Mr. Oestreich of New York, clearly aroused Judge Carter's dander. He seemed especially annoyed by claims that the out-of-towners had expertise that local lawyers lacked.
"Despite Mr. Oestreich's fulsome testimony in praise of the highly refined legal acumen of himself and his confreres and his condescending assessment of the local bar," the judge wrote, "there is no showing in the record of such luminous skills in pursuit of the shareholders' interest."
 
Efficiency Questioned
 In fact, Judge Carter wrote, the very length of time the outside lawyers poured into one particular motion -- 20 lawyers from 11 firms spent 900 hours -- "casts grave doubt on the proposition that Mr. Oestreich and company from outside the district are, in fact, the superior lions of specialized art and proficiency that he has proclaimed them to be."
Mr. Oestrich said he could think of nothing he had said or done in Maine to have aroused Judge Carter's ire. "We held the lawyers in Maine in the highest esteem," he said. He added his group had not yet decided whether to appeal Judge Carter's decision.
Many of the examples the judge cited were culled from the lengthy "friend of the court" brief that the state of Maine filed in the case. As a frequent defendant in civil rights and constitutional cases in which lawyers' fees are assessed, the state had a vital interest in how courts access legal fees, said Peter J. Brann, the assistant attorney general who wrote the brief.
"The lawyers in this case treated themselves like the national touring company of the Broadway show, 'Anything Goes.' ," Mr. Brann said. "But these costs are all passed on, and eventually someone, whether it's shareholders or consumers, has to pay the piper."
"Up to now it's been easier for people to look the other way," Mr. Brann said. "Maybe the 80's are finally over."

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Gold Drops to a 6-Year Low

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON

 BODY:
Gold prices plunged yesterday to their lowest level in six years, provoked by a spiral of selling by investors and speculators worried that this month's low inflation figures spell the end of a recent rally in gold.
The price of gold for delivery this month dropped $4.50 an ounce yesterday, to $334.10 on the Commodity Exchange in New York. In the last three days, August gold on the exchange has dropped $16.30 an ounce, or 5 percent. In London, gold slumped $9.50 an ounce yesterday, to $337.30. 
 The sudden drop wiped out weeks of incremental advances, which many traders and analysts had heralded as the long-awaited comeback in the gold market after years of moribund trading.
Yesterday's New York close was the lowest since Jan. 1986, when gold bottomed at $326.30, according to Daphne Bloore of the World Gold Council, an association of gold-producing companies.
This week's fall came as speculators, betting heavily on a rising gold price, were surprised by a convergence of economic factors that were minor when viewed independently but scared traders into selling.
"It was like a snowball effect," said Warren Myers, vice president of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. "Commodity funds were liquidating their positions, and fear began feeding on itself."
Oddly, one of the factors that initiated the selling panic was a rise in gold prices in Australia, which kicked off a flurry of sales by major Australian gold producers. At the same time, a trio of economic indicators in the United States signaled that inflation was remaining low. Gold is a favored hedge against inflation.
When platinum prices suddenly dropped, the selling panic was on. Managers of large commodity funds, many of whom had accumulated large gold positions as the price rose in recent months, became afraid of further price drops and began selling. Speculators in heavily traded gold futures contracts joined the retreat.
"There has been a lot of hype recently about how well the fundamentals were doing," said Raymond Schenk, head of precious metals trading at Credit Suisse. "But when people realized that the bullish sentiment was exaggerated, it started a whole chain reaction of selling. Everybody is suddenly running for the exits."
Mr. Schenk explained that many gold traders plan to sell once the price falls to a specific level; this week's fall accelerated after the price of gold fell below $342 an ounce on Wednesday. Now that gold is under $335, Mr. Schenk said, it could fall even more precipitously.
But most precious metals analysts agree that an eventual and gradual rebound is likely because many of the speculators who sold gold short in anticipation of its fall will eventually have to buy into the market.
Mr. Myers of Merrill Lynch also noted that once the price of gold falls much below $350 an ounce, it becomes unprofitable for many gold producers to keep mining operations at full capacity. In South Africa, which produces more than 20 percent of the world's gold, producers are likely to cut production, which will nudge prices upward again as supplies are affected, he said.
"Although the momentum is distinctly downside, I think we're near the bottom," he said.
At the same time, he warned that prices were unlikely to rebound fast, unless some extraordinary event, like civil strife in South Africa, affected the world's gold output unexpectedly.

HEADLINE: Baker Plans Active Foreign Policy Role From the White House

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 13

 BODY:
Although he is resigning as Secretary of State and moving to the White House, James A. Baker 3d and his aides plan to continue playing an active role in shaping American foreign policy from their new perch, particularly on the Middle East.
A senior official, briefing reporters immediately after Mr. Baker's farewell speech to State Department employees, said, "The fact that we are going to the White House does not mean that we are in any way precluded from being actively involved to the extent that we have time to be or want to be." 
 As a result, Lawrence S. Eagleburger, who will move from Deputy Secretary to Acting Secretary, seems likely to serve as a caretaker, a role underscored today by the clear message from the White House that the door is open for Mr. Baker to return to the State Department, if Mr. Bush is re-elected. To the extent that Mr. Eagleburger is allowed to leave his own imprint in the last months of the Administration, it is not seen as likely to differ much from Mr. Baker's, since he comes from the same pragmatic school of American foreign policy as the other senior Bush advisers.
Although Mr. Baker is stepping down as Secretary at a time when there is no overriding foreign policy crisis facing the United States, there are several significant opportunities and regional problems that demand immediate attention, as well as a growing need to define a new framework for American foreign policy at a time when the old Cold War framework has disappeared.
 
Several Cases Unresolved
 Apparently in an effort to fend off criticism that he is walking away from American foreign policy at a time when Bosnia is aflame, when the situation in Haiti is unresolved and when the Arab-Israeli peace talks seem finally ripe for some progress, Mr. Baker is letting it be known that he and his principal foreign policy adviser, Dennis B. Ross, plan to continue influencing foreign affairs from the White House.
The mixing of foreign policy and campaign politics implicit in Mr. Baker's new role would not be new in Washington, although this may be a particularly visible case. The connection between foreign policy and domestic politics is often most acute during Presidential campaigns.
President Nixon's 1972 re-election effort, for instance, was clearly enhanced by his trip to China that year, the first by an American President. And President Carter's 1980 re-election campaign was badly wounded by decisions that he made on the Iran hostage crisis and the failed American rescue mission.
As a man steeped in politics, Mr. Baker has worked under the widespread assumption in Washington that politics and diplomacy were inseparable during his stewardship at the State Department. He reinforced that impression early in his tenure when he took a partisan shot at the Democrats from the State Department podium. But after being roundly criticized for that, he tended to keep his public distance from campaign politics and insisted that his recommendations and actions as Secretary of State were not distorted by political considerations.
 
His Farewell Speech
 But between now and the election, Mr. Baker, and the Administration, will be hard-pressed to sustain the view that campaign politics will not strongly influence Administration foreign policy. That was evident today in Mr. Baker's farewell speech at the State Department, which began as a review of what had been accomplished by the department in the last three and a half tumultuous years, and ended in a highly partisan re-election appeal for the President. Although Mr. Baker was given a standing ovation by the Department employees, many agreed with one official's assessment that "he should have stopped after the first 10 minutes."
Another question raised by the Baker appointment is how the lines of authority and communication on foreign policy will work now. Only hours after a senior State Department official said Mr. Baker and his aides would be keeping a hand in foreign affairs, particularly on the Middle East, a senior White House official briefing reporters said Mr. Baker would have no policymaking role on the Middle East and would only be an adviser.
Senior State Department officials speak of Mr. Eagleburger, as "managing" the department, but seem to suggest that the big decisions will be made by the President and Mr. Baker from the White House. The senior State Department official told reporters that Mr. Baker intended to remain "actively involved" in foreign policy, noting that the White House Chief of Staff job "has very very broad responsibilities." He said Mr. Baker, either personally or through Mr. Ross, would step in "as the need arises," and reminded reporters that Mr. Baker "will be next door."
 
How to Replace Traveling
 When the senior State Department official was challenged as to how Mr. Baker, who made 15 trips to the Middle East to get the Arab-Israeli peace talks to the point they are now at, intends to still play a role in those negotiations, he said, "Who says the parties can't come to the White House?"
Such comments, besides being intended to deflect criticism about Mr. Baker's abandoning diplomacy for politics, also seem intended to put at ease allies abroad who have longstanding working relationships with Mr. Baker and are now worried about a sudden shift in his absence.
This is particularly true of the Arab leaders -- Saudis, Egyptians, Syrians and Palestinians -- who appreciated what they felt was Mr. Baker's even-handed approach to the Middle East problems, who have been expressing anxiety about his departure and who view Mr. Eagleburger as overly sympathetic to the Israelis.
Mr. Eagleburger is not in the best of physical health. He showed up at the State Department today with his left arm in a sling, because of some medical tests, a cane by his side and an inhaler for his asthma in his hand.
When asked what happened with his arm, the ever-jovial Mr. Eagleburger simply responded, "You should have seen the other guy."
 
A Small Inner Circle
 Mr. Baker always ran the State Department through a small inner circle of advisers, whom he placed as a layer on top of the traditional foreign policy apparatus, and used them as the team with whom he focused his strategies for dealing with everything from arms control to the Middle East. They were Mr. Ross, the Policy Planning Director; Margaret D. Tutwiler, his spokeswoman; Robert Zoellick, Under Secretary for Economic Affairs, and Janet Mullins, Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs. Mr. Eagleburger managed the day-to-day operations of the department.
Mr. Eagleburger may be best known for a prophetic speech he gave just as the Berlin Wall was wall crumbling in which he warned that while it was good that the cold war was over, ironically it one day may be missed because of all of the ethnic animosities in Europe that were artificially suppressed by the weight of Soviet occupation. A former Ambassador to Belgrade, Mr. Eagleburger also played a major role in shaping American foreign policy toward the Yugoslav problem, and admits that he in some ways misjudged the venom and intentions of the Serbs.
Mr. Baker's tenure as Secretary of State may well be remembered for the problems he solved and the problems he ignored. He and Mr. Bush were far ahead of the other allies in pushing for, and helping to structure, German unification. His knitting together of the coalition to fight the Persian Gulf war has been hailed as a highly skillful act of diplomacy. He negotiated both conventional and nuclear arms control treaties with Moscow that were praised even by the Democrats as very advantageous deals for the United States. And maybe most creatively, Mr. Baker managed to cajole, press and persuade Israel and all of its Arab neighbors to sit down together for face-to-face negotiations.
 
Deficiencies Listed
 But at the same time, he maintained a Reagan Administration policy of building up Iraq's President, Saddam Hussein, long after the Iran-Iraq war had ended; he never challenged Mr. Bush's failed policy of constructive engagement with China's dictatorial leaders; he virtually ignored United States-Japan relations and was not even on Mr. Bush's disastrous trip to Tokyo last year; he was very slow in dealing with the crisis in Bosnia, and he has done little to really shape a post-cold war framework for American foreign policy.
"I think you have to give him immense credit for presiding over the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the cold war," said Michael R. Beschloss, an historian of American foreign policy. The initiative came from Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Mr. Beschloss added, but it was Mr. Baker's skill and his close relationship with Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze that helped Washington exploit these opportunities, and helped the Soviets make some unpalatable concessions.
On the down side, Mr. Beschloss said, historians will probably focus on the fact that Mr. Baker ran the department with such a small group that he often could not deal with more than one issue at a time. For instance, he said, while focused on the collapse of the Soviet Union, they may have ignored or sent some very wrong signals to President Hussein, and they had little time or energy to think about a future vision of American foreign policy at this very confusing moment.
"Bottom line, though," Mr. Beschloss concluded, "I think historians will look back and say the most important thing that occurred during these years was the end of the cold war, and they will say that Baker helped it happen faster, more smoothly and on terms more favorable to the United States."

HEADLINE: Brazil Chief's Free Spending Imperils Debt Accord

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Aug. 13

 BODY:
Trying to avoid impeachment, President Fernando Collor de Mello has begun a political spending campaign that bankers fear could unhinge an accord on Brazil's foreign debt.
A congressional panel that is investigating corruption charges is expected to issue a report in two weeks recommending Mr. Collor's impeachment. With the Chamber of Deputies likely to vote on impeachment in September, members of the President's Cabinet quoted Mr. Collor as vowing in closed meetings last week to spend billions of dollars on projects intended to guarantee the loyalty of 168 legislators needed to defeat the motion. 
 Bankers here are apprehensive about the effects a surge in public-works spending could have on the deal to reschedule Brazil's $44 billion debt to commercial banks, which calls for a tightening of inflation.
"If Collor has to buy his presidency, inflation goes out the window," the representative here of a foreign bank that negotiated the deal said on Tuesday.
 
Spending Lists Drawn Up
 He said there was a good chance that the deal, which was agreed upon in principle on July 9, would not go through because Brazil would be unable to meet the conditions set by the International Monetary Fund.
Last week, the President released $2 billion in new spending on social projects and farm credits, and ministers drew up spending lists totaling almost $5 billion, press reports here said.
Brazil is the developing world's largest debtor. In addition to the $44 billion it owes commercial banks, it has $72 billion of debt to foreign governments and other lenders.
Brazil and the International Monetary Fund, which partly guarantees the rescheduling agreement, have agreed on a monthly inflation goal of 2 percent by December. Inflation is currently running at 22 percent a month. With the surge in spending, economists predict a December inflation rate of 30 to 40 percent.
On Wednesday, an economic team flew to Washington with the latest numbers: Brazil's nominal deficit in the second quarter of 1992 exceeded an I.M.F. target by 30 percent, or $7 billion.
"The market is skeptical of this accord ever being implemented," Alden Brewster, president of Tisbury Capital Inc., a New York-based trader in third world debt, said on Tuesday.
 
Minister Is 'Resisting'
 Mr. Brewster said the price of Brazilian debt fell on the secondary market after the debt accord, in contrast to the responses to other Latin American debt deals. Reflecting market uncertainty, the price of Brazilian debt fell from 39 percent of face value in mid-June to 30 percent today.
But two negotiators of the accord retained their optimism this week.
"As far as the debt agreement goes we are moving ahead and we expect to start negotiation on the term sheet with the Brazilian side on Monday," said William R. Rhodes, a Citicorp vice chairman who supervises Latin American debt negotiations.
Mr. Rhodes said he had been assured by Brazil's leading economic officials last week that they "will stick to economic reform program and will not be deviated by political pressures."
Brazil's Economy Minister, Marcilio Marques Moreira, said in an interview this week that negotiations on the final details of the accord were progressing and that he was "resisting" pressure for increased Government spending.
But spending pressure mounts daily.
During two months of congressional testimony that ended on Wednesday, a picture emerged of Mr. Collor's turning a blind eye to an influence-peddling ring that paid millions of dollars worth of bills run up by the President's personal household. Mr. Collor's former campaign manager was said to have extorted millions of dollars in bribes and skimmed millions more through fixed bidding practices.
Today, the congressional panel voted to request the preventive detention of the ring's reputed leader, Paulo Cesar Farias, Mr. Collor's former campaign treasurer. and the freezing of his assets. Panel members said that in an 18-month period ending last April Rosane Collor de Mello, the President's wife, received $506,700 in checks drawn on accounts controlled by Mr. Farias.
The panel's report is due Aug. 26 and congressional leaders say that motions to impeach will be inevitable in September. To block impeachment proceeedings, the President needs favorable votes from 168 legislators in the 503-member Chamber of Deputies, or one-third.
To win this support, Mr. Collor, head of a small conservative party, entered into an alliance last week with the Liberal Front Party, a right-wing party strong in Brazil's impoverished northeast, where it has long been a political tradition to trade votes for public works projects.
 
Collor 'Underworld' Noted
 Last week, Jose Goldemberg, a respected former dean of Sao Paulo University, resigned as Education Minister, citing "an underworld" in the Collor administration. His replacement, Eraldo Tinoco, a Liberal Front member from the northeast, immediately announced that his "door will be permanently open to politicians."
Also last week, another Liberal Front member, Ricardo Fiuza, the Social Action Minister, broke with any austerity policies and asked members of Congress to send written requests for development projects to his ministry "as soon as possible."
This week, Isto E, a Sao Paulo newsweekly, predicted that President Collor would try to funnel $5 billion in development money to projects controlled by important members of Congress between now and Nov. 15, the end of a two-round mayoral voting process.
"The President is throwing everything that he has got to make sure that impeachment does not go through," said Amaury de Souza, a Sao Paulo political scientist.
 
Tax Receipts Are Down
 The problem is to find the money.
Tax receipts fell by 16 percent in the first half of this year, but the Government has promised not to print cash or to float bonds. Deep divisions in Congress appear to rule out approval of new laws to increase tax collection.
The Liberal Front president, Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, a northeastern state Governor, emerged last week as Brazil's de facto Prime Minister. Mr. Magalhaes all but demanded the resignation of Mr. Moreira, the Economy Minister, a former banker and Ambassador to the United States who is widely credited with restoring local and international business confidence in the Collor Government.
Mr. Magalhaes said of Mr. Moreira: "This talk that Marcilio is well known overseas is nonsense. The Varig manager in New York is better known than he is." Varig is Brazil's largest international airline.
In contrast, an American banker in New York said, "As long as Marcilio can keep his job and run economic policy, people in Washington will be eager to bend over backward."
 
Opposition Plans Rallies
 Mr. Moreira said on Tuesday: "It's not the moment for the captain of the economic team to leave. The country needs tranquillity."
With the Liberal Front committed to guaranteeing the survival of Mr. Collor for the second half of his term opposition politicians plan to organize rallies in September demanding his resignation.
"Presidents don't leave their palaces in handcuffs -- they leave before," said Ibsen Pinheiro, an opposition congressman who is president of the Chamber of Deputies.

HEADLINE: 3 Exchanges Agree to Stay, and New York City to Pay Half

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
At least three of the city's five commodities exchanges will stay in New York under an agreement announced yesterday to build a new trading headquarters in lower Manhattan. The agreement, announced by the exchanges, the city and the state, is intended to preserve 9,000 jobs and $50 million in tax revenues and calls on the city and state to finance half the cost of the new center.
The three exchanges -- the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange; the New York Cotton Exchange and the Commodity Exchange -- said the new trading center would cost about $150 million and would be considerably smaller than the center that was initially planned to house all five commodities exchanges, which had threatened last year to move to New Jersey. 
 The New York Mercantile Exchange, the largest of the five exchanges, withdrew from a plan to build a joint headquarters with the four other exchanges in January, citing unresolved differences over the scope of the project. It is looking for other space in Manhattan. The last and smallest of the five exchanges, the New York Futures Exchange, has not formally signed the agreement announced yesterday, but city and state officials said that they expected that it would.
Many city and state officials had all but given up on the project when the Mercantile Exchange pulled out. The agreement announced yesterday represented a last-ditch effort by the city and state to save the project by providing half the financing for the new commodities center, an usually high percentage of financing.
The New York State Urban Development Corporation will invest $27 million in the project and the city will provide a $26 million grant and $22 million in capital construction money. The remaining $75 million will come from private financing arranged by the exchanges.
 
Cuomo Calls News 'Exciting'
 Gov. Mario M. Cuomo praised the agreement yesterday, saying in a statement: "The decision by the commodities exchanges to establish a new headquarters in New York City comes at a crucial time for the state and nation. With almost 2 million New Yorkers and 17 million people nationwide either unemployed or underemployed, this project is a rare bit of exciting economic news."
The new commodities headquarters will be built on a city-owned lot at Murray Street between West and Greenwich Streets, four blocks north of the World Trade Center, where the exchanges are currently situated.
The seven-story building will accommodate the trading, support and administrative staffs of the three exchanges. It will have a 51,000-square-foot trading floor with more than twice the size of the exchanges' current trading space. The building was originally proposed as a 47-story tower with two trading floors.
Planning for the new center began more than a year and a half ago when the five exchanges announced that they were unhappy with their cramped trading floor in the World Trade Center and would relocate to northern New Jersey, taking about $100 million in tax revenues and 11,700 jobs with them.
The five exchanges, which serve as marketplaces for trading futures and options contracts, have a history of squabbling. The Mercantile Exchange, which has about 3,500 employees and accounts for about half the $100 million in city and state tax revenues from the commodities industry, has said that a major reason it withdrew from the joint project was the inability of the exchanges to agree on a new joint system for computer tracking of trades, which was expected to save the exchanges $8 million a year. Telephone calls to officials of the Mercantile Exchange were not returned yesterday.
Barry Sullivan, Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, said yesterday that the agreement insured that the scaled-back project would go forward, but he added that some minor details had yet to be agreed on. "I am just delighted that we have reached an effective deal that will keep vital jobs in our city." he said. "And we are hopeful, very hopeful that we can reach a deal with the other two exchanges as well."
 
City Plans to Recoup
 Carl Weisbrod, president of the City Economic Development Corporation, said that the city would provide the project with $22 million in capital construction money that has already been included in the city's budget. The city plans to recoup that money through a combination of higher rental fees at the new center and payments from the commodity exchanges in lieu of taxes.
The project, which was approved by the New York City Council and the New York City Planning Commission in March, also requires the approval of the Mayor and the State Urban Development Corporation; both have indicated their support. Construction of the project is expected to begin in the spring of 1993 and to be completed by the end of 1994.
Alan Hanson, a spokesman for the Commodity Exchange, said that officials of the three exchanges and state and city officials had worked hard in the past month to streamline the building so that it would be affordable while meeting the exchanges' needs.
One remaining barrier to the project is opposition from nearby residents, who have been pressing the developers for park space to be included in the plan, and have filed a lawsuit to block the project.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond and Gold Markets Jolted

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Word of James A. Baker's imminent return to the White House to help President Bush's flagging re-election campaign played an unexpected role yesterday in a sharp selloff of the bond market.
Traders said remarks by Mr. Baker, as reported by a news agency early in the afternoon, helped send the market reeling, just as it was digesting the auction of $10 billion in new 30-year bonds, the third tier of the Treasury's big quarterly sale this week. Some traders interpreted the remarks to mean that a new Bush Administration would be more interested in stimulating the economy than in reducing the Federal deficit. 
 Until the selloff, the 30-year bond auction had gone well, maybe even a little better than the auctions of 3- and 10-year notes this week. Like the others, yesterday's auction set a record, with the average yield of 7.29 percent being the lowest since 30-year bonds were first regularly auctioned in February 1977.
 
Giving Up a Week's Gains
 In late trading in the secondary market, the bond due in 2021 was off almost 1 1/4 points and the yield had jumped back to over 7.41 percent, giving up all the gains of the last week that took the yield to a 5 1/2-year low. The yield on Wednesday was 7.31 percent.
In the when-issued market before the auction for the new 30-year bond, the yield was 7.36 percent, up from 7.26 percent the day before. The 10-year note auctioned on Wednesday was also off sharply, falling 5/8 of a point, to yield 6.56 percent, compared with 6.47 percent the day before.
Some traders attributed the entire selloff to the report of Mr. Baker's remarks as he resigned as Secretary of State to become Mr. Bush's Chief of Staff. But other traders said different forces, including profit-taking and the current lofty level of the market, set off the decline. They said Mr. Baker's remarks as reported added to the sharpness of the fall.
"This is the kind of knee-jerk reaction we get because a lot of the market was overbought." said Matthew Alexy, a government trading strategist at the First Boston Corporation, explaining that a correction should be expected. All that was needed was something to set it off.
"But the Baker stuff did have something to do with it," he added.
 
Forces Behind the Rally
 Mr. Alexy was quick to point out that even with the decline in price of the long bond and the resulting jump in the yield, the market had lost only what it gained in the last week. And he said the forces that had been propelling the rally -- continued slow economic growth and declining inflation -- were still in place.
In fact, economic data released yesterday before the auction just seemed to reinforce this view. The Consumer Price Index was up just one-tenth of 1 percent in July and retail sales gained only five-tenths of 1 percent last month. And although initial claims for unemployment compensation dropped 66,000, the largest fall since 1979, the fall was just to 403,000, which has been the recent level of claimants.
In a short article carried on the Dow Jones News Service, Mr. Baker was reported to have said lower tax rates should be a key to President Bush's re-election campaign.
Although there were no direct quotes confirming this sentiment, several traders said investors seemed to conclude that a new Bush Administration would put less emphasis on cutting spending and lowering the record Federal deficit.
 
'Negative for the Market'
 "The balanced budget would take a back seat on the Administration agenda to lower taxes," said Greg Erardi, head government securities trader at Salomon Brothers in New York, giving his interpretation of the report.
"If this turns out to be true this would be quite a negative for the market," he added. An effort to simulate economic growth with tax cuts would worry investors because faster growth could rekindle inflation and lead to a rise in short-term interest rates. And adding to the Government deficit in the process would just multiply the impact.
According to the text of his speech, Mr. Baker said, "We should build on the fundamentals of lower taxes, limits on Government spending, greater competition, less economic regulation and more open trade that can unleash tremendous private initiative and growth."
Mr. Baker and Mr. Bush clearly hope that the former Secretary of State and Secretary of the Treasury can bring some political stability back to the Bush campaign. But even if his comments were not well interpreted by investors, traders said yesterday that he brought political risk back into the bond market, especially if the tone of his comments as reported was true.
 
Reason for Sluggishness
 "The additional political uncertainty of a Presidential election year is something that the market has not been noticing for some time," a government securities trader.
A rise in bond yields is clearly something neither Mr. Baker or Mr. Bush would like. High long-term interest rates are one of the reasons that the economic recovery is so sluggish. And the weak economy is a reason why Mr. Bush's re-election outlook is cloudy and one of the reasons he brought his longtime friend, Mr. Baker, back to the White House.
Several traders said that going into the auction, dealers had thought the yields bid would be 7.29 percent, 7.30 percent or even 7.31 percent. After the bidding deadline of 1 P.M., prices for the new bond began to decline, with yields rising. This apparently encouraged some dealers, who thought their bids of 7.30 percent would win, to sell off bonds in the when-issued markets to secure their expected profits on the bonds they would win in the auction.
But the average and high yields in the auction were both 7.29 percent, meaning that some dealers who had sold bonds before the results were not going to get them in the auction if they bid 7.30 percent. Now they had to scramble to cover the sales they had already made.
 
Market Feeds on Itself
 This buying sent the market prices higher and yields lower. Then, some investors decided to take profits and the yield began to rise again and the entire market began to fall sharply.
As the decline of prices and the rising of yields was continuing, Mr. Baker's comments were reported and the market dropped even further. "The market began to feed on itself," one trader said.
The coupon on the new 30-year bond is 7.25 percent, the lowest coupon since the May 1986 auction.

HEADLINE: Truck Sales Up 32.2% in Early August as Car Sales Slid 1%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 13

 BODY:
Sales of domestically built trucks soared 32.2 percent in early August in response to new buyer incentives, but passenger car sales, reflecting the uncertain economy, slid 1 percent, according to figures released today by the auto makers. Combined, vehicle sales rose 11.4 percent.
The Ford Motor Company reported a 34.3 increase in truck sales from a year earlier, while the General Motors Corporation said it had a 23.5 percent gain. The Chrysler Corporation's truck sales rose 34.3 percent, according to an estimate. 
 Despite the 11.4 percent increase in total vehicle sales for the 10 major domestic auto makers from Aug. 1 to 10, the projected annual rate for new- car sales slipped to 5.8 million in the period, the lowest since early May.
The Government said today that consumer purchasing power had fallen in July for the second straight month, leaving Americans with less money for new cars.
And worries over the nation's high unemployment rate may have scared some would-be new-car buyers back into hiding. Surveys have said consumer confidence in the economy also fell in July after six consecutive months of improvement.
"The auto industry cannot outgrow the economy," said Doug Laughlin, an auto analyst with Bear, Stearns & Company in New York. "This is an atypical recovery. Everybody gives lip service to it, but people make too much out of it when it's better than expected and too much out of it when it's worse than expected."
The strength in truck sales, often apparent at the end of a recession, has led the domestic industry's modest recovery all year. Some of those sales have come from car buyers' crossing over to mini-vans, sport trucks and inexpensive pickups.
End of model year incentives on trucks like Chevrolet's S-10 Blazer lifted G.M.'s truck sales in the latest sales period.
Chrysler truck sales, estimated by Ward's Automotive Reports, reflected mini-van incentives and surging demand for its new Jeep Grand Cherokee.
Ford's car sales rose 8.2 percent while G.M.'s car sales dipped 1.3 percent. As estimated by Ward's, Chrysler's car sales fell 24.5 percent.
There were eight selling days in this year's Aug. 1-10 period, compared with nine last year.
American Honda said its early August car sales had fallen 9.7 percent. Several weeks ago, the Japanese company decided to slow production of its Accord mid-size car for the rest of the year.
Toyota and Mitsubishi car sales also fell during the period, by 8.6 percent and 54.2 percent respectively.
Nissan car sales surged 108.2 percent on the strength of a lease promotion on its Sentra compact sedan, which got a new design in June.
Mazda car sales rose 21.7 percent in response to recently introduced 1993 models. Subaru reported 30.2 percent higher sales.
Wide swings in sales percentages are possible among Japanese companies that build vehicles in the United States because their share of the overall market is so small compared with the American Big Three.

HEADLINE: G.M.'s '93 Price Increases Trail Ford's and Chrysler's

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 13

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation said today that it would raise prices on its 1993 models an average of 1.6 percent, below the tentative increases announced by the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation.
At the same time G.M. also said it would lower some prices for 1993. Its Chevrolet division rolled back the price on its base models of the Cavalier and Geo Metro and kept the 1992 price on its Lumina sedan. 
 The three models have accounted for 52 percent of Chevrolet sales so far this model year, a division spokesman, Dave Hudgens, said.
Some near-luxury full-size models for 1993 -- including the Oldsmobile 88, Buick LeSabre and Pontiac Bonneville -- will go up 2.5 percent to 3 percent, in part because of making anti-lock brakes standard.
One industry analyst said G.M.'s move may prompt Ford and Chrysler to rethink their 1993 price increases, which range between 2.6 percent and 3 percent.
"This is interesting for G.M. because this is a company that in a sense should be going with a profit, not a market share, strategy," said Joe Phillippi, an analyst with Lehman Brothers Inc. in New York. "Yet they are wrestling with realities out there that the customer thinks the product is too expensive."
G.M. lost an industry record $7 billion making cars and trucks in North America last year.
Michael Grimaldi, G.M.'s director of finance for marketing in North American operations, said the price increases are less than the auto maker needs to cover the costs of inflation and safety equipment improvements to many models. Cost-cutting and downsizing will make up for money G.M. will not collect from consumers, he said.
Mr. Grimaldi said G.M. is holding the line on price increases in hopes of weaning customers off incentives as a regular part of buying a car.
"If we could, we would like not to have incentives," Mr. Grimaldi said. "It would reduce the complexity that customers are facing out there in purchasing an automobile."
Mr. Grimaldi said some incentives will still be used, for example, to match a competitor or move a slow-selling model.
Saturn, G.M.'s import-fighting small-car subsidiary, set an industry example of prosperity without incentives. The cars have been so successful that dozens of dealerships have sold out of 1992 models and have weeks to wait before they will get any 1993's.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Mortgage Banks Scrape For Profits

BYLINE: By Michael Quint

 BODY:
WITH interest rates at their lowest level in 20 years, the opportunity for millions of homeowners to refinance their houses has created a boom for the mortgage banking companies that serve as middlemen between borrowers and lenders.
Recognizing that the surge in refinancing cannot last forever, and could end quickly if Treasury bond yields turned upward, many mortgage companies and their Wall Street advisers are taking this opportunity to sell new stock. Much of the selling has been by large corporate parents that are not willing to say the market for mortgage banking companies is overvalued, but which probably would not have sold shares if they expected prices of those companies to continue rising rapidly. 
 Major sellers include Primerica Corporation, which earlier this year sold Margaretten Financial of Perth Amboy, N.J., to the public for $300 million; Fleet Financial Group, Providence, R.I., which received $191 million for a 17 percent share of Fleet Mortgage Corporation, the second-largest mortgage banker in the country, and the Bank of New York Company, which plans to sell slightly less than half of ARCS Mortgage Holdings for about $60 million.
In total, at least five mortgage banking companies have made their debut with new stock offerings this year, and another five have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but have not yet offered new shares.
If so many have decided that this is a good time to sell, does that mean investors are buying at the top of a market? The slowdown in the rate of creation of new households -- to about 1.14 million annually in the 1990's from 1.33 million in the 1980's and 1.74 million in the 1970's -- will limit demand for new housing. And until the economy shows signs of mounting a brisk recovery, housing activity will be dampened further.
For now, such concerns seem to be more widespread among economists than mortgage bankers, who are prospering as the volume of new mortgages increased to an estiamted $690 billion this year from $453 billion in 1990. The weakness of the savings and loan industry has allowed mortgage bankers to increase their share of the market to about 50 percent this year from only 16 percent in the 1970's.
Bruce Harting, an analyst at Salomon Brothers predicts that once the boom in refinancing is past, it will become more clear that the best mortgage banking companies are those with strong revenues from mortgage servicing as well as the more volatile revenues that come from making new loans.
Servicing is the record keeping and the handling of monthly payments that occurs after a mortgage is issued, for which the servicer receives an annual fee, usually about quarter of 1 percent of the mortgage's unpaid principal.
Although selling a mortgage's servicing to a third party has traditionally been an important source of revenues for most mortgage bankers, many are now changing their strategy and trying to accumulate more servicing.
Margaretten Financial, for example, has sold the servicing for most of its new loans in recent years, and the revenues from those sales have been crucial to the company's profitability. But in late 1990, according to the prospectus of its recent stock sale, Margaretten shifted course and is now trying to expand its servicing operation by acquiring such business from other lenders while keeping the servicing of the mortgages it originates.
Countrywide Credit Industries, a Pasadena, Calif., concern that is the largest independent mortgage banker in the country and the most widely recommended stock in the industry, has long followed a policy of keeping the servicing of the loans it originates and then sells.
But some other companies rely on servicing sales, which produce a big immediate gain, but rob the company of future revenues. The North American Mortgage Company, for example, which issued new stock in July, has consistently sold the servicing of more than half the mortgages it has orginated since 1989, and the revenues from those sales have been an integral part of the company's profit in each of the last three years.
Edward D. Lagarde, president of Farragut Mortgage Company, a Mansfield, Mass., unit of the Merchants Bank of Boston says that improved productivity in the origination of loans is the key to providing companies with enough revenue that they are not obliged to sell mortgage servicing in order to earn a respectable profit, or in some cases, any profit at all. Amazingly enough to anybody who has paid closing costs, most mortgage bankers actually lose money in the origination of a loan.
The leader of the pack in efficiency is Countrywide Credit. Jonathon E. Gray, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said that in 1990 Countrywide's cost of originating new loans was 2.02 percent of the loan amount; that was offset by fees and profits on the sale of the loan totaling 1.83 percent, for a net loss of 19-hundredths of 1 percent.
For the average mortage banking firm, the average cost was 2.59 percent of the loan amount, and the net loss was 1.11 percent. In 1991, thanks to productivity gains, Countrywide's cost fell to 1.55 percent, and it managed to eke out a profit of nine-hundredths of a percentage point.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Drops as Traders Test For Moves by Central Banks

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell against most major currencies yesterday as traders tested the waters to see whether central banks would intervene again to prop up the currency.
Data on the economy provided no surprises and had little impact on the dollar market, said Mike Faust, senior currency strategist with MMS International. 
 The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index edged up by just one-tenth of 1 percent in July. The Commerce Department, meanwhile, said retail sales managed only a modest five-tenths of 1 percent rebound in July.
The Government also reported weekly filings for unemployment benefits dropped by 66,000 in the week ending Aug. 1. In a fourth report, the Labor Department said Americans' purchasing power declined two-tenths of 1 percent in July.
Traders focused yesterday on what central banks would do to stop the dollar's slide, said Kevin Lawrie, director of foreign exchange with the Bank of Boston.
On Tuesday, 14 central banks bought dollars to shore up the currency, but the coordinated effort failed to generate any interest in buying or holding dollars. It was the second time in less than a week that central banks entered the market to support the tumbling dollar.
"Basically, the underlying fundamentals don't favor holding dollars," Mr. Lawrie said.
Already-low interest rates and fears the Federal Reserve might ease again, as well as the sluggish economy and the uncertain political situation ahead of the Presidential election were unsettling potential dollar-buyers, Mr. Faust said.
Lower interest rates make dollar-denominated securities less valuable to investors, thereby decreasing the need for dollars.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 127.37 Japanese yen, down from 127.87 yen at Wednesday's close. Later, in London, it fell to 127.08 yen. In New York, the dollar closed at 126.50 yen, down from 127.30 late Wednesday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.9315 from $1.9285 late Wednesday. In New York, the pound rose to $1.9340 from $1.9305 on Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York compared with late Wednesday: 1.4555 German marks, down from 1.4630; 1.3075 Swiss francs, down from 1.3205; 4.9375 French francs, down from 4.9585; 1,106.00 Italian lire, down from 1,108.00, and 1.19375 Canadian dollars, up from 1.19225.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Coors Files Suit Over Ads by Anheuser-Busch

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
Coors adds Virginia water to its beer.
Some people think this is a big deal.
The Anheuser-Busch Companies for one, which recently attacked Coors in an advertising campaign for mixing "local water" from Virginia with its vaunted Rocky Mountain spring water -- on which Coors built its reputation -- to make beer for East Coast guzzlers. Coors responded by suing Anheuser-Busch. 
 The fight, analysts say, isn't really about water. Rather it reflects the brutal marketing climate in the beer industry. Indeed, Bud Light and Coors Light are locked in a fight over third place on the list of the country's best-selling beers, which is led by Budweiser and Miller Lite. Coors Light has been gaining popularity in the Northeast, and Anheuser-Busch is fighting back with the new campaign. But it is using its Natural Light brand, currently ranked 10th, to throw the punches rather than Bud Light.
 
'Water Is the Franchise"
 Whether the campaign will hurt sales of Coors is naturally a matter of opinion. Some experts contend that Coors drinkers do not care about the source of their beer's water, and that the ads are little more than Anheuser-Busch tweaking Coors's nose. But others say that because Coors has built so much of its reputation on its Rocky Mountain water, the ads will put Coors in a bad light.
"Water is the franchise," said Tom Pirko, president of Bevmark Inc., Los Angeles beverage consultants.
The Adolph Coors Company certainly is taking the attack seriously. Last week, it sued Anheuser-Busch in Federal District Court in Manhattan, demanding that the big St. Louis brewer stop running the ads. Coors got a temporary injunction barring the ads, which Coors contends have false and misleading statements. In the action, Coors seeks at least $10 million in damages.
A court hearing scheduled for today is sure to add to the ruckus over the advertising campaign, which industry watchers say is extraordinary for the pointedness of its attack.
"It is the most significant fight ever between Coors and Anheuser- Busch," said Jerry Steinman, publisher of Beer Marketer's Insights, an industry newsletter based in West Nyack, N.Y.
The advertisements are also undoubtedly an issue for some hard-core Coors drinkers who helped elevate the beer to near-Holy Grail status in the early 1970's, a time when demand far outstripped supply. Available in only 11 Western states, Coors was smuggled by car, truck and plane east of the Mississippi and sold at a premium.
Legend has it that President Gerald R. Ford loaded Coors onto Air Force One and Henry A. Kissinger hauled cases back to Washington after trips west. Clint Eastwood and Paul Newman drank it on movie sets. Only Corona Extra, the Mexican beer that grew almost overnight in 1987 to become the nation's second-best-selling imported beer, came close to matching the Coors magic.
 
Hard Choices
 Central to that mystique was the Rocky Mountain water flowing through Golden, Colo., where Coors built the world's largest brewery. To be sure, it is the yeast, barley malt and hops that make a beer distinct, not the water. And water became an issue only after 1985, when Coors decided to risk extending the franchise eastward, a preferable alternative to being drowned out by the heavy advertising of its larger competitors, Anheuser-Busch and Miller, produced by the Philip Morris Companies.
It built the packaging plant in Virginia because the capacity for bottling and canning beer at its Golden plant was reaching its limits. It ships the Colorado-brewed beer to Virginia in railroad tank cars. In keeping with industry practices, Coors brews a higher-alcohol beer, then adds water before packaging. It does this in Virginia to reduce shipping costs.
The move symbolized the Coors quandary that exists to this day. The brewer had no choice but to try to become a national force. But with advertisements showcasing partying twentysomethings, its image has blurred with the others. At the same time, it continued to use traditional Rocky Mountain images.
The combination, industry watchers say, opened Coors to almost inevitable criticism, ignited by Coors Light's popularity in the Northeast at the expense of its main rival, Anheuser-Busch's Bud Light. "They've left themselves exposed," said Mr. Pirko.
Or have they?
 
Flagship Brands Less Important
 Some beer industry analysts wave off the potential damage of the Anheuser-Busch ad campaign, arguing that the spring water is no longer the reason many people buy Coors, especially Coors Light. The beer industry is changing rapidly, after all, with growth driven by product introductions in categories like light beer, rather than by pumping up Budweiser's and Coors's original flagship brands.
Coors Light, for example, is already the driving brand of Coors, representing 63 percent of the company's beer sales last year, up from 47 percent in 1986. (Coors introduced the Light version in 1978.) Coors also rolled out its new budget-priced Keystone and Keystone Light in 1989, and it is reportedly testing Zima (pronounced ZEE-ma), a clear, carbonated malt beverage. "The key to success is really the introduction of new products," said Robert S. Weinberg, a beverage industry consultant in St. Louis.
And Coors Light conjures up advertising images of "The Silver Bullet" rocketing through a gaggle of firm bodies, not the beer's storied past. "Today's beer drinkers don't have any knowledge of what its reputation used to be," said Ray Schramm, general manager and bartender of the Hi Life Bar & Grill on Manhattan's Upper West Side, who sells about 15 cases of Coors Light a week.
After the froth of this legal spat subsides, the Anheuser-Busch advertisement will probably warrant only a page in the already rich history of controversy that Coors has survived during its 119-year history.
In 1977, a clash with union workers, who struck the plant, prompted an A.F.L.-C.I.O. boycott that helped to wear down Coors's share of the California market to about 14 percent in 1984, from more than 40 percent in 1977. The boycott lasted 10 years.
Through the years, blunt language from Coors's patriarch, William K. Coors, has angered minority groups. In 1984, for example, The Rocky Mountain News in Denver quoted Mr. Coors as saying that blacks "lack the intellectual capacity to succeed." The company has since spent hundreds of millions of dollars supporting various projects in black and Hispanic communities.
A Coors television ad was dropped in 1989 after it was criticized by Polish-Americans. The commercial was set in a rock-and-roll bar, where an actor passes on a tip for patrons having trouble reaching the bar to get another Coors Extra Gold: He goes to the jukebox and plays a polka, and the bar empties out.
These and other skirmishes, however, will pale if and when Coors tries to achieve economies of scale by brewing Coors-brand beer outside Colorado and uses water not from the Rocky Mountain springs. Mr. Pirko believes that Coors, with a 10 percent share of the industry, needs to reach a 15 to 18 percent share to start taking advantage of economies of scale. Its advertising costs, for example, are more than $14 a barrel, twice those of Anheuser-Busch, according to Beer Marketer's Insights.
Far-flung packaging plants are viewed as only a short-term solution, as shipping beer by railcar eliminates many of the savings Coors reaps at its huge brewery in Golden. By comparison, Anheuser-Busch's strategy of building breweries spread around the country helps it, to a small degree, earn more than five times the operating profits of Coors per barrel of beer.
Anheuser-Busch will no doubt apply some of that muscle to more advertising aimed at Coors if the Colorado brewer ever starts using anything but Rocky Mountain water as the main ingredient in Coors. "This is just a donnybrook compared to the war that will ensue," Mr. Pirko said. "These guys play mean and tough."

HEADLINE: Sluggish Tax Collections Contribute to $37.6 Million Budget Gap

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: TRENTON, Aug. 13

 BODY:
Saying that New Jersey is "paying the price for the static national economy," Treasurer Samuel F. Crane today announced that the state finished the latest budget year $37.6 million in the hole, largely because it collected less sales tax than expected.
The gap represents about three-tenths of 1 percent of the $11.5 billion budget for the fiscal year that ended June 30. 
 Mr. Crane said sales-tax collections, which provide nearly 35 percent of all state revenue, were "anemic," coming in $26.5 million under expectations. The revenue figures reflect tax collections on the previous month and year through July 31.
"The abysmal pace of the sales tax is a telling sign of the lack of disposable income and the absence of consumer confidence," he said. "The momentum in retail activity that was grudgingly starting to build earlier in the year has greatly diminished."
 
Taxes Under Expectations
 During the third quarter, January to March, sales-tax collections increased 3.9 percent, but the growth tapered off to a year-ending rate of just four-tenths of 1 percent, despite inflation of 3 percent to 4 percent.
Corporation taxes were under expectations by $29.2 million, and 15.8 percent below the 1991-92 budget year.
Income taxes came in $26 million ahead of expectations, but those targets were lowered during the budget year, Mr. Crane said. Collections were 22 percent above the previous year because the income tax was raised starting in January 1991.
Legally, the state cannot finish a budget year with a deficit, but Mr. Crane said the books are not completely closed.
The $37.6 million gap will be made up with fees collected by state agencies, interest earnings and other sources, such as reimbursements from the Federal Government for benefits provided to state workers who do federally financed work.
"The most dire economic figures both statistically and personally are the unemployment and payroll numbers," Mr. Crane said, noting that unemployment rose from 6.6 percent to 9.8 percent during the fiscal year.
"These numbers translate directly into human hardship and sacrifice that is not easily calculated," he said. "Higher unemployment not only means more people facing hardship, it results in lost revenue for the state through lower income tax and sales tax collections."
The state collected $574 million from the lottery, $4 million more than expected and $46.1 million more than in 1990-91. Taxes on horse racing brought in nearly $1 million more than expected, but $208,000 less than 1990-91.
Casino taxes, which are separate from the overall budget because they are dedicated to specific programs, came in $1.9 million under expectations, but $9.7 million ahead of 1990-91.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
Change In Israel

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

 BODY:
In a column last March I told the story of a Palestinian professor, Dr. Khalil Shikaki, whom Israel had forbidden to return from the United States to his home and family in the West Bank. The story has now taken an encouraging turn.
Dr. Shikaki, who got his Ph.D. in America, came here in 1989 because Israel had closed his university, al-Najah in Nablus. He taught political science in Wisconsin and Florida. When Israel allowed West Bank universities to reopen, he tried to go back. But he was excluded at the border last January by Israeli military authorities. 
 He was given no reason. But when American academic colleagues asked Israel to reconsider, saying that Dr. Shikaki was a fair-minded scholar, Israeli officials said he was a security risk because his brother was a founder of Islamic Jihad, a terrorist organization.
After the case was publicized, authorities in the occupied territories took another look at it. In May, Dr. Shikaki was informed that he would be given a visitor's permit to teach at al-Najah for six months.
Last month Dr. Shikaki returned to the West Bank. His movements are restricted. He is not allowed to go to Gaza, where his father lives. He was refused permission to go to Tel Aviv to hear a lecture by Dennis Ross, a top aide to Secretary of State James Baker.
"But I am not complaining," Dr. Shikaki said in a letter. "I am finally home with my wife and children. I am back at my university doing what I know how to do best, teaching history. I'm really very happy."
When he wrote me, Dr. Shikaki had been called twice to meet with Israeli security officials. He was not asked about his brother.
There the story rests for the moment: not exactly a happy ending, because Dr. Shikaki has the right to stay only until the end of this year, but a great improvement over his previous Kafkaesque status.
The story has wider implications. It suggests, as I have always believed, that the rigidities and inhumanities of occupation do not represent the true character of Israel. It shows how much Israel has to gain if it can now negotiate an interim self-governing arrangement for the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza.
Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's new Prime Minister, plainly sees the advantage of such an agreement. It would get Israel out of the burdensome and corrupting business of ordering the daily lives of 1.5 million Palestinians -- of saying who may live where, who may build a house and so on.
The previous Prime Minister, Yitzhak Shamir, was never an enthusiast for the autonomy idea set out in the Camp David agreement. He went into the present negotiations reluctantly and offered a strangulated version of "autonomy."
Mr. Rabin campaigned, and won, on the theme that Israel's main priorities should be economic growth and reform to create jobs for new immigrants. That means reducing the emphasis of recent years on the occupied territories -- the ideological obsession with them.
The essential aim of an interim agreement on the occupied territories -- essential for both sides -- must be that Palestinians have the sense of controlling their own lives. Only then can there be the psychological conditions for the two peoples to try living together in peace.
Mr. Rabin understands that. Accordingly, he is ready to carry out crucial terms of the Camp David agreement that call on Israel to end its civil administration of the West Bank and Gaza, and withdraw its troops to specified security locations there. And by all signs the mood of his people is also turning from ideology toward political and economic realism.
Dr. Shikaki said he had found Palestinians, who have so much ineffectual political romance in their history, also in a realistic mood. He was impressed when al-Najah students, often susceptible to radical movements, gave 57 percent of their votes in student elections to candidates supporting the peace process.
As for his own hopes, he said: "I intend to write soon to Gen. Danny Rothschild, the Coordinator of Government Activities in the West Bank and Gaza, to discuss an application for family reunification. That is the only route through which someone like me can regain permanent residency."

HEADLINE: We Gain. Mexico Gains. Canada Gains.

BYLINE: By Michael Boskin; Michael Boskin is chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The United States, Mexico and Canada, by completing the groundwork for the North American Free Trade Agreement, have taken a significant step toward defining a new world order of expanded trade and brisk competition. The pact, eliminating all tariffs on North American goods over 15 years, would create the world's largest free-trade area, with 360 million consumers and total annual output exceeding $6 trillion.
Critics say the pact would inspire U.S. companies to relocate plants in Mexico and encourage polluters to slip into Mexico and establish operations. Neither assertion holds up. 
 The accord offers tremendous advantages for U.S. workers, consumers and businesses. Mexico is our No. 3 trading partner (Canada is No. 1) and fastest growing export market. The pact would help President Carlos Salinas de Gortari push forward his aggressive program of environmental protection and economic reform.
Recent history tantalizingly hints at what the accord can do for U.S. workers. Since Mexico began reducing import tariffs in 1986, U.S. exports have leaped to $33.3 billion from $12.4 billion. This expansion has affected virtually every U.S. industry, and, since 1987, 47 out of our 50 states have increased exports to Mexico.
Agricultural exports grew by the end of 1991 to $2.9 billion from $1.1 billion. Consumer exports more than tripled, to $3.4 billion from $1 billion. Exports of capital goods leaped to about $11 billion from $5 billion.
The accord would build on this promising start. Trade liberalization would create more jobs and export opportunities. The more we export, the better: 70 cents of every dollar Mexicans spend on imports goes for U.S. goods. Furthermore, what is good for Mexico is good for the U.S.: For every dollar in growth of Mexico's gross domestic product, 15 cents goes toward U.S. goods.
Research by the Institute for International Economics suggests that the pact would create as many as 175,000 net new U.S. jobs. The jobs would pay well. According to Commerce and Labor Department data, U.S. workers in export-related jobs earn 17 percent more than average U.S. workers.
Opponents says businesses will move south to take advantage of low-wage labor. False. Mexico's low wages will not give it a strong competitive advantage. Mexican workers are far less productive on average than ours. As a result, a U.S. company that moves to Mexico would have to hire more workers to achieve its desired output -- and might not save a penny in total labor costs.
Nor does Mexico offer a haven from international labor standards. Mexico has ratified 73 International Labor Organization conventions on working rights, including those on occupational safety and health.
Moreover, in 1991 the U.S. and Mexico signed a memorandum of understanding to share information and cooperate on a wide range of labor issues, including worker rights, enforcement and programs to improve workplace health and safety.
Better yet, Mexico needs U.S. products and technology to improve its productivity. As Mexico's productivity rose, so would Mexico's appetite for U.S. products. Mexican prosperity and stability would reduce pressures for illegal immigration and alleviate international strains that sometimes occur because of cross-border traffic.
Critics say the agreement would encourage environmental cheating. False again. President Salinas has made clear that Mexico has no interest in becoming a haven for U.S. polluters. In 1988, Mexico adopted a comprehensive environmental law, based on U.S. law and experience. Mexican authorities can, for instance, shut down industrial facilities that violate the law -- and they have ordered more than 1,000 such shutdowns since 1989.
All new investments must meet these new standards, which in some cases are more stringent than ours. The U.S. and Mexican environmental agencies also have designed a plan to address pollution in the border area. We have committed ourselves to spending $241 million in fiscal 1993 for the plan. Mexico has pledged $460 million over the next three years.
The Administration has worked hard to insure that the free-trade agreement would impose no undue burdens on U.S. working families. Of course, any economic reforms with long-term benefits could hurt some people in the short run. Therefore, we would phase in the provisions gradually. And the Administration is committed to working with Congress to insure effective adjustment assistance, including job training and placement, for affected workers.
In sum, the North American Free Trade Agreement promotes growth, raises standards of living and creates jobs in the U.S., Mexico and Canada. When people wonder what a world of economic interdependence will be like, they can find intimations in the agreement, for in a world of fair and free trade we all win.

HEADLINE: Air-Noise Pledge for U.S. Open Won't Cost New York a Cent

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Public Trust Betrayed" (letter, July 30), on "subsidized" sports facilities, Benjamin Haber asks who in the New York City administration agreed to the provision in the United States Tennis Association business terms allowing limited rent reductions for significant La Guardia Airport-related airplane overflight, with its accompanying noise, during United States Open tournament play.
I did. And the reasons are compelling. The Tennis Association is investing in the city -- it will spend $180 million of its own money to build the National Tennis Center expansion. Compared with other major sports facilities around the country, this is about as unsubsidized as one can get. 
 The Tennis Association has agreed to keep the United States Open -- one of the world's premier tennis events -- here for 25 years and, unlike other professional sports venues, the National Tennis Center is open to the public, except during tournaments. Few people would feel that a privately developed facility that is open for public use and that generates approximately $130 million a year in economic activity for the city constitutes a violation of the public trust.
Anyone who follows tennis knows that constant noise from airplanes threatened the United States Open's ability to continue to attract world-class players to the tournament and, therefore, threatened the continued presence of the tournament in New York City.
Besides what the Tennis Association is investing, the rent to the city will increase threefold -- to $900,000 in the first year alone. Given the success we have recently had working with the Federal Aviation Administration to abate airplane noise during tournament play, I think it is safe to say that although this has proved a pivotal bargaining point, this part of the agreement will end up costing us nothing.

HEADLINE: Abortion Rights Law Wouldn't Work Anyway;
Only the Poor Suffer

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Is it only people active in the protection of poor women's access to contraception who see through the Governmentspeak of Bush Administration officials? In "What Abortion Isn't" (letter, July 28), Dr. William R. Archer thrusts the abortion issue where it has no place and distorts facts about the program he administers, Title X of the Public Health Service Act, which provides family planning services to poor women.
Dr. Archer maintains that Title X funds have increased for 20 years. In reality, the program was funded at $162 million in 1981 and is now at $150 million, a significant cut, without allowing for inflation. 
 Title X's restriction that "none of the funds appropriated under this title shall be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning" has been scrupulously observed, and even the General Accounting Office has not been able to find otherwise. Yet the Bush Administration, in an effort to promote its political agenda, has created the "gag rule," which prohibits apprising a pregnant woman of all her options -- childbirth, abortion and adoption -- when she requests information at a Title X clinic.
The gag rule is back in the courts, with the Administration pressing hard to force family planning clinics to deny poor women the same information that any woman who can pay for her health care can easily obtain.
I agree with Dr. Archer that abortion is not a method of family planning. Who ever said it was? But please spare us the righteous tone and the attempts to force a political position on poor women trying to take responsibility for their reproductive lives.

HEADLINE: Japan's Broken Pledge of Change Comes Back to Haunt Its Economy

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 14

 BODY:
Japan is struggling with a deepening economic downturn that may prove to be the harshest in two decades, but what most troubles some economists is that the Japanese Government vowed this type of decline would not happen.
Six years ago, the Government committed itself to transforming its export-driven economy into one led by consumer demand. The Prime Minister at the time, Yasuhiro Nakasone, promised President Ronald Reagan a "historic change" as his Government sought to reduce the yawning trade surplus, head off protectionist pressure from the United States and let the long-suffering Japanese consumer enjoy more of Japan's growing prosperity. 
 But the economic downturn, caused largely by a steep decline in corporate investment, is making it clear that the promise has gone unfulfilled, many economists say. And economic policy is still shaped to benefit manufacturers over consumers, giving Japanese corporations an advantage in global competition. During the last six years, Japanese consumers have had to bear an increasingly heavy tax burden, and they are still paying prices that are among the world's highest.
 
Shadow Over Commitments
 Japan's failure to carry through on its 1986 commitment raises a host of troubling questions. These include how much the West should trust other Japanese commitments, whether such a transformation is possible in the short term, and what measures might be effective in bringing greater balance to Japan's trade and economic practices.
Japan's economy is expected to grow 1 to 2 percent this year, a steep decline from 4.5 percent in 1991. That compares with growth in the United States of 1 percent in 1990, a decline of seven-tenths of a percent in '91, and a projected gain of 2.1 percent this year.
But as Japan's economy skids, its trade surplus is expected to exceed $120 billion this year, a record.
When times are tough, the Japanese still look to stronger exports, not consumer demand, to lift the economy out of its rut. In the first half of this year, for instance, exports rose 8.3 percent while imports declined 6.5 percent, making for a six-month surplus of $62.88 billion. The surplus with the United States has stabilized at a little more than $40 billion a year, economists say. Most of the sharp growth is coming in Japan's surplus with Europe and Asia.
Japan's failure has already worsened tensions with its trading partners, including the United States. The situation has also dashed the West's hopes that the Japanese economy, by bolstering imports, would become an engine for global growth.
"The point was to unlock this tremendous pent-up demand among Japanese consumers," said Paul Summerville, an economist here with Jardine Fleming Securities. "Japan would have benefited enormously, but it would not have benefited a lot of political interests."
He added, "It's now that we need Japan to consume more, but it can't."
 
 
No Push for Tax Cuts
 While the Government has been announcing new measures by the week to rescue the stock market from its two-and-a-half-year collapse and stabilize the economy -- which has not yet officially been declared in a recession -- little thought is being given to stimulating consumer demand directly through tax cuts or other means. The Government argues that consumers would only save the money from the tax cuts, not spend it, and that the budget surplus might be turned into a deficit.
"We are moving in the right direction, but we have made less progress than was expected," commented Yutaka Kosai, president of the Japan Center for Economic Research and a member of the commission that proposed the economic shift. "Economic growth would have been a little slower if all the proposals had been adopted, but the economy would have been more stable because consumer spending is usually more stable than business investment."
Some economists argue that Japanese consumers have actually had their spending power reduced by a variety of Government policies. An analysis by Jesper Koll, an economist here with S. G. Warburg Securities (Japan), found that individual income taxes had increased 14.5 percent a year since 1989.
Taxes rose, Mr. Koll said, nearly twice as fast as household incomes, which increased 7.7 percent a year.
Mr. Koll added that social security contributions had increased an average of 11.7 percent a year since 1989. Together, he estimated, these extra costs have cut consumer spending by about 12 trillion yen, or more than $90 billion at current exchange rates, in the last three years.
 
 
Crisis in Mid-1980's
 Japan's commitment was developed in an atmosphere of crisis. In 1985, the trade surplus was heading toward what seemed an astronomical level of more than $50 billion.
In September 1985, Japan and the United States agreed to increase the value of the yen sharply against the dollar and other currencies in what became known as the Plaza Accord, after a meeting at the Plaza Hotel in New York. The idea was that a weaker dollar would reduce American imports by making foreign goods more expensive, and raise exports by cutting the overseas prices of American-made goods.
In addition, then-Prime Minister Nakasone assembled what became known as the Maekawa Commission, after its leader, Haruo Maekawa, a respected former governor of the Bank of Japan. To promote domestic consumption, the commission proposed in a report in 1986 that the Japanese work fewer hours, take more vacations, receive tax breaks and save less.
The Government appeared unwavering in its commitment to the transformation. Mr. Nakasone said the restructuring would be difficult. "But we think we can do it," he insisted. "And it will be done."
The Government did slowly begin a campaign aimed at inducing the Japanese to work less and spend more. It also opened some markets to imports, making it cheaper for the Japanese to buy goods like foreign cigarettes, beef and citrus fruits. But the far more urgent task the Government tackled was helping manufacturers deal with the burden of a much stronger yen. The principal tools they used were lower interest rates and an easy monetary policy.
Corporate investment hurtled ahead at three and four times the rate of the economy's expansion. Japanese industrial companies expanded their purchases of new equipment by trillions of yen, with the growth rate hitting 25.4 percent in the fiscal year that ended on March 31, 1989.
Meanwhile, private consumption barely kept up with the overall growth of the economy, hovering at 3.6 to 5.5 percent a year.
The consumer enjoys few of the benefits of the new growth. According to a Government survey, already-built houses cost 7.1 times the average annual income of the Japanese.
Japanese individuals also fled the stock market, helping drive down trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange; the average daily trading volume recently fell to a 10-year low.
Economists say that about 60 percent of the economy's high-octane growth since 1986 was fueled by business investment. "It's true that domestic demand increased during those years, but this was due to business investment rather than a change in personal consumption," said Yukio Noguchi, an economics professor at Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo.
He said the excesses of these policies contributed to Japan's current malaise. The Government, he said, relied too heavily on monetary policy in its efforts to ease the trade surplus. The current slowdown was initiated in late 1989 when the Government began to raise interest rates, seeking to gain control the inflationary spiral in the financial markets.
Capital investment by corporations fell sharply. The Economic Planning Agency said recently that manufacturers would reduce their capital investment by 8.3 percent this year.

HEADLINE: FREE TRADE ACCORD EXPECTED TO TRIM NATION'S FOOD BILL

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 14

 BODY:
For the American consumer, the biggest effect of the new North American Free Trade Agreement will take place in the neighborhood supermarket, where fresh fruits and vegetables will become more plentiful, more readily available in winter and will almost certainly become cheaper.
The free trade pact that the United States, Canada and Mexico reached this week will, if ratified, eliminate the taxes now imposed on tomatoes, cantaloupes, cucumbers and many other foods imported from Mexico. The taxes, or tariffs, are intended to protect American farmers from imports, and they add significantly to the price of these foods. The accord will also reduce transportation costs by opening long-haul cross-border truck routes to low-wage Mexican carriers.
 
Cheaper Roses
 The agreement may even lower the cost of romance -- cutting out the 8 percent tax on cut roses from Mexico.
"You will find a greater availability of fruits and vegetables in your store, and the prices will be lower," said Colin A. Carter, a professor of agricultural economics at the University of California at Davis. "There is a saving for consumers -- there's no question -- because many of these products have been protected right now from import competition." 
 A family of four living in a state on the Mexican border could save up to $50 a year on its food bills once the tariffs are eliminated, Mr. Carter said. Families living farther from the border would save less, because high transportation costs mean that fewer Mexican fruits and vegetables are eaten in Eastern and Northern states, he added.
The Agriculture Department has not yet tried to estimate the savings, said Roger D. Runningen, the department's chief spokesman. "On certain fruits and vegetables in certain times of the year, we would expect some price reductions," he said.
 
Which Farmers Are Angry
 But while shoppers may be pleased, some American farmers are furious. From Florida and Georgia to California and Michigan, they fear that more competition from Mexico may result in foreclosure signs on their fences. Citrus, peanut and winter vegetable growers are especially upset.
Ben C. Abatti raises cucumbers, lettuce, asparagus and other vegetables on a 14,000-acre farm near Holtville, Calif., just five miles north of the Mexican border. He competes directly with Mexican farmers in nearby Mexicali, and relies on tariffs of up to 35 percent to offset the difference between American labor costs of $6 an hour and Mexican wages as low as $5 a day.
"If we didn't have the tariffs today, they'd run us out of business tomorrow, that's for sure," Mr. Abatti said.
Farmers like Mr. Abatti who harvest labor-intensive crops make up a small and vocal minority pitted against the many American farmers who grow crops that do not thrive in the heat and sun of Mexico. They look forward eagerly to selling more corn, hogs and other highly mechanized commodities to its 92 million people.
John C. Kintzle, who is raising a bumper crop of corn this summer on 980 acres near Coggon, Iowa, said he supported the free trade accord because it would mean more demand and higher prices for his harvests as Mexico eliminates its import limits. "Any time we can create demand, we're better off," he said. "And we know that with the crop this year, and the new technology, we need all the markets we can get."
These differences within the American agricultural community have split farm-state legislators more along crop lines than party lines. Lawmakers representing farmers whose crops are also produced efficiently in Mexico tend to oppose the pact, while legislators from districts that will benefit from access to Mexican markets are more favorable to the accord.
For example, Mr. Abatti's Congressman, Representative Duncan Hunter, is a Republican who vehemently opposes President Bush's agreement. But Iowa's representatives, including two Democrats, generally support it.
Free trade in fruits and vegetables could also have an enormous effect on the flow of legal and illegal Mexican immigrants, many of whom find jobs in the United States picking vegetables for lack of comparable employment at home. Mr. Abatti employs up to 700 immigrants at harvest time. As trade barriers fall, it will make sense for some of those workers to harvest crops in Mexico for shipment across the border.
Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, cited one study this week that showed the free trade accord would persuade 1.6 million potential Mexican immigrants to "forgo those lower-skilled jobs in the United States and stay at home."
 
Trade Barriers
Consumers Paying For Farm Profits
 Agriculture is the world's most protected industry, and American farmers are no exception. The United States imposes steep taxes on many imports and even more restrictive quantitative limits on imports of peanuts, sugar and dairy products. The tonnage limits restrict peanut imports to an amount that averages out to seven nuts for every American.
The changes from the new trade pact will be slow because some of the highest taxes will be phased out over 15 years, but the results at the end will be striking. Peanuts, for example, sell for $700 a ton in the United States but only $300 a ton on world markets.
When the 1990 crop failed in the United States, prices soared. The Agriculture Department removed peanut butter from the school lunch program because it could not import cheaper peanut butter from overseas.
"I consider it a way in which the peanut growers enhance their incomes at the expense of consumers," said Dale E. Hathaway, the director of the National Center for Food and Agriculture Policy, a nonprofit research group in Washington. "They transfer income from peanut eaters to peanut growers."
The accord will, over 15 years, waive the peanut-import restriction, which many economists welcome. The growers, however, are understandably hostile, insisting that their peanuts are better than foreign peanuts and more likely to be free from disease and pesticide contamination.
Danny O. Fillingame, who farms 2,000 acres in Dawson, Ga., with his father, notes that American consumers say in surveys that they want a quality product. "But they're willing to accept a lot lower-quality product," he said. "In my opinion, it's not fair."
Like the peanut farmers, American citrus growers also enjoy considerable protection from imports at the expense of consumers. People who like orange juice pay a stiff price: up to 35 cents in extra taxes for each imported gallon, which also allows Florida growers to charge more for their crop. After heavy lobbying by the growers, the tariff will be phased out over 15 years, the longest possible period under the accord.
 
Against the Pact
California Growers Are Frightened
 When Mrs. Hills introduced the free trade agreement at a White House new conference last Wednesday, she mentioned that consumers would benefit from being able "to get a cantaloupe a couple of months later than you can get one down at your Safeway this morning."
In practice, the United States already waives its 35 percent duty on Mexican cantaloupes during winter months when they do not compete with American producers. But the free trade accord will also eliminate the summer duty over the next 15 years, and American growers are very unhappy.
Southern California farmers estimate that it costs them nearly $5 to grow, harvest and pack a 24-pound box of cantaloupes, while it costs Mexican farmers just $3.50. Labor is slightly more than half the cost of growing cantaloupes, and American workers earn 10 times as much, including fringe benefits, as workers in Mexico.
The 35 percent tariff currently balances this difference, at a cost to consumers of about 5 cents extra for a one-pound cantaloupe. The result has been a fierce fight here to keep the tariff -- a fight that puts the fiercely independent and strongly Republican farmers here in a difficult position.
"Competition is great, and I believe in competition, and I support a great competition with the other guy, but when you can't compete because of dollars and wages, it's just like banging your head against the wall," said George C. Stergios, who has a 4,000-acre farm near Mr. Abatti's and who is the president of the Imperial Valley Vegetable Growers Association.
The Agriculture Department contends that American farmers opposed to the agreement may be exaggerating their troubles. The same growers, of produce like tomatoes, have invested more money than their Mexican counterparts in irrigation and harvesting equipment. The American producers have reduced their costs and thus become more competitive than their Mexican rivals, department officials say.
 
For the Accord
Midwest Farmers Anticipate Gains
 Midwestern farmers are counting on the free trade accord to help them earn more money. They hope that by pulling down Mexico's trade barriers, the agreement will make the average Mexican prosperous enough to buy more American products from the Midwest.
"Instead of eating a diet that is very low on protein and very high on tortillas and refried beans, they'll eat more meat," said Steven C. Noah, the director of the Midwest Agribusiness Trade Research and Information Center in Des Moines.
Before the collapse of oil prices in the early 1980's stunned the Mexican economy, American farmers had a strong market across the border. When Mexico lost much of its oil income, American food sales there fell by 37.4 percent in just three years, to a $1.11 billion in the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30, 1986.
At that time the Mexican economy started to recover and began to grow even faster than the United States economy. American agricultural shipments across the nation's southern border nearly tripled.
Throughout the world, people in poor countries tend to buy more American meat and grain as they become more affluent. The pattern has been repeated in Japan since World War II, in the Middle East in the 1970's, and now again in Mexico.
If Mexico has a competitive advantage in melons and oranges, the United States is an overwhelming rival in hogs and grain. Much of the Mexican landscape is too arid for these commodities, and farmers there have small, inefficient plots. Large tractors and combines are in short supply in Mexico and the winters are not cold enough for long-term grain storage.
The United States has none of these problems, while it has a highly efficient food storage, processing and transportation system. For example, some wheat that has been stored in grain elevators in North Dakota and Montana by the Federal Government since the late 1950's is still edible.
Through a complicated system of import licenses, Mexico has prevented American farmers from dominating its food markets -- and perhaps bankrupting hundreds of thousands of peasant corn farmers in southern Mexican states. Under the free trade accord, Mexico will allow the duty-free import of 2.5 million tons of corn a year, an amount roughly comparable to shipments in recent years.
Any extra shipments will be subject to an initial tariff of 215 percent that will be phased out over 15 years. American corn growers welcome the move because the Federal Government has been cutting its subsidies since 1985.
"Government support to agriculture has declined since the mid-1980's, and implicit in reduced Government support has been a promise to find new markets," said Peter J. Wenstrand, who raises corn on his 1,500-acre farm near Essex, Iowa. "Any time you talk about increased trade, it helps corn."
 
The Politics
The Farm Lobby Is Deeply Divided
 The North American Free Trade Agreement has split the farm vote in Congress, and eventual approval of the agreement will depend partly on whether this split persists.
Florida, Texas, California and Hawaii will be hurt the most by Mexican competition because they have very similar growing seasons and crops, and lawmakers from rural areas in these states have been critical of the agreement. But the unusual alliances within American agriculture have also produced some other critics in Congress.
The nation's severe restrictions on sugar imports, for example, have the support not only of sugar cane growers but also of sugar beet growers and corn farmers, whose product is used to make corn sweetener. Sugar beets are grown in states like North Dakota that would otherwise be expected to support the pact.
Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, criticized the free trade pact in a speech on Wednesday to members of the American Sugar Alliance, a Washington-based industry group. "It's unfair, it's outrageous and it's a sellout of American sugar interests," he said.
But other Democrats from farm states have raced to the agreement's defense. "Right now, if you want to get big applause -- there's a lot of unemployment -- you just say anything against foreigners," Representative Neal Smith of Iowa said. "But that's not responsible."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Host City;
A Houston-Style Convention: Republicans in Heavy Traffic

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Aug. 14

 BODY:
For the first time ever, urban sprawl may be one of the defining experiences of a national political convention, when the Republican Party gathers here beginning this weekend.
Many delegates will travel as far as 30 miles through Houston's notorious rush-hour traffic on freeways with nicknames like "The Beast" to get from their hotels to the Astrodome, where the speech-making will happen. And even partying will require long treks to the vast prairie that stretches west of the city, and to Galveston Bay 40 miles to the southeast. 
 To ready Houston for the Republicans, city fathers coaxed thousands of unenthusiastic Houston residents to sign on as volunteer workers, raised more than $4 million to remake a cavernous sports stadium into a convention hall for one week, and persuaded the Houston Astros to embark on the longest road trip any major league team has taken since the invention of the airplane.
But in the end, those challenges may pale in comparison to the efforts it will take simply to get delegates from one part of this city to another.
"Nothing has been done like this before, when you consider the size of the area and how spread out things are," said Paul Klepper, a retired Marine Corps colonel who commands hundreds of vehicles and even distant traffic lights from the convention's transportation control center.
"This is like a war room," Mr. Klepper said of his headquarters packed with computers and radios, "because managing traffic and transportation for this convention is going to be a war."
Spread out over 581 square miles and with a metropolitan area larger than Rhode Island, Houston has a dazzling downtown skyline but lacks any real center.
The Astrodome itself, nearly six miles from downtown, is one of many isolated nodules of urban development. Since it sits, surrounded by vast parking lots, at the center of its own 260-acre complex, the convention site cannot be reached from anywhere on foot without breaking into a serious sweat in the August heat. And the thousands of Houston Oiler fans who have listened to kickoffs on their car radios will attest that reaching it by automobile can be equally maddening.
As a result, almost all the groups involved in the convention are operating their own mass transit systems. Even the Galleria, Houston's premier mall, will run shuttle buses decorated as elephants with four-foot trunks.
Getting 6,000 gift bags from corporate donors to delegates and Republican officials this weekend will involve an elaborate distribution system with a fleet of trucks on loan from local companies. The trucks will also make the rounds of more than 50 hotels every day of the convention carrying additional gifts, like plastic cowboy boots filled with red, white and blue M&M's.
 
Elephantine Efforts
 In addition to transportation problems, there were hundreds of smaller challenges as the convention neared.
Rendering the Republican mascot in Texas proportions resulted in two giant topiary elephants, one at the Astrodome and the other at the Houstonian Hotel and Conference Center, President Bush's Houston residence, both evidence of painstaking pruning. Delegates will also be greeted by an 11-foot chocolate elephant weighing 227 pounds, and by a live one, with feet painted red, white and blue.
There was a last-minute scare when, just as construction was due to start inside the Astrodome, local officials demanded an independent inspection of the 27-year-old stadium's roof to make sure it could hold a 3 1/2-ton curtain as well as the dozens of lights and speakers now suspended from it. The dome passed muster.
Specially installed electrical and telephone systems at the stadium were reinforced to withstand a hurricane. And tons of sound-absorbing material have been placed all over the Astrodome to dampen a notorious echo that delights cheering sports fans by magnifying their din but bedevils speakers.
And simply filling the vast spaces of the Astrodome complex required considerable artistic and political ingenuity. Adjoining the stadium is the Astrohall, which many Houstonians associate with the mooing, braying and snorts of the livestock show that accompanies the city's annual rodeo. Now the news media inhabit it.
 
Filling Empty Space
 Responding to a Presidential request for innovative events, Republican planners created an "American Spirit Pavilion" in the Astroarena, another large building next to the stadium. Workers installed a 4-foot-wide section of the Berlin Wall there on Thursday not far from where an 8-foot bronze statue of the President will be erected.
But most of the effort went into the great cavern of the Astrodome itself.
"The hardest part was to create something that will focus attention on the podium so the speakers don't just get lost in here," said Bob Keene, an art director based in Los Angeles who is the design chief for the convention.
His solution: A square-topped arch faced with faux limestone now towers 60 feet above what used to be shallow left field. The arch, flanked by two video panels of 49 television screens each, serves as the backdrop for a podium that juts 44 feet toward second base.
 
Prefabricated Podium
 Getting the Houston Astros to leave their home field for a 28-day road trip, required rounds of legal and financial wrangling. So, with just three weeks to prepare the Astrodome, the entire podium structure was first built in a warehouse, disassembled, trucked to the Astrodome in sections, then reassembled. Altogether, 500,000 man-hours went into remaking the stadium.
Much of the construction costs were covered by $4.3 million collected by the Houston Host Committee, mostly from corporate donors. Republican officials praised the committee for the biggest convention fund-raising effort ever.
But the response from the general public did not set records for enthusiasm. The host committee fell 1,000 people short of its goal of recruiting 12,000 volunteers to help as drivers, baby-sitters, ushers and in many other roles. Clean Houston, another volunteer organization, expected 15,000 people to help pick up garbage from the streets but drew only 7,000.
That was a little more than half the number that turned out for the clean-up campaign prior to the 1990 Economic Summit, but this year they picked up slightly more garbage: 2,231 tons.

Consumers will find fruits and vegetables cost less as a result of the new North American Free Trade Agreement -- which is infuriating to American farmers who must compete with low-wage Mexican producers. But farmers growing corn in the Midwest cheer the pact for the new markets it opens to them. Agriculture is the most protected of industries, and consequently the changes to be wrought by the accord are the greatest. [Page 1.]
A troubling aspect of Japan's deepening economic malaise is that the nation has not lived up to a Government promise made to the U.S. to transform itself from an export-driven economy, which has produced a yawning trade surplus with the U.S., into one led by consumer demand, which would help foreign producers.

Opponents of the trade accord are gearing up to prevent its enactment or significantly change it. Among them are environmentalists, church and labor groups. Some plan to campaign for Bill Clinton in the belief he would change it. [34.]

Companies
Citicorp cut its previously reported second-quarter earnings by $28 million to $143 million, saying regulators had forced it to do so, and to sign a formal acknowledgement that the company's problems are great enough to require extra close attention. Bank officials immediately went into their version of spin control to persuade the rest of the world its problems were minor. [31.]
First City Bancorporation of Texas said it would sell major subsidiaries and try to persuade investors to supply it with $100 million of fresh capital. The effort to avoid collapse came after months of unsuccessful efforts to find a merger partner. [31.]
WNEW-AM may soon begin broadcasting financial and investment news. Westwood One and Robert Sillerman, owners of the legendary but troubled New York radio station, agreed to sell it to Michael Bloomberg L.P., which provides data on stock, bonds and other financial instruments for securities traders. [33.]
Computervision went public at $12 a share. That price for the former Prime Computer was lower than expected and led Shearson Lehman Brothers, the investment firm that financed a previous leveraged buyout of Prime, to say it would report an additional loss of $40 million or more. Computervision also sold $300 million in bonds. Proceeds of both issues will be used to pay down debt. [33.]
 
The Economy
Production by the nation's industrial plants rose 0.4 percent in July to erase an identical drop in June, the Federal Reserve reported. But important manufacturing areas were weak. [31.]
 
Markets
The Dow rose 15.67 points to end at 3,328.94, but for the week, the average lost 3.24 points. Both its ups and its downs followed those in the bond market. [41.]
Treasury bond prices rebounded. Economists said bonds appeared to gain strength from the latest survey by the University of Michigan, which showed consumer confidence remained low. The price of the long Treasury bond rose $7.19 per $1,000 in face amount, regaining some of its $12 drop on Thursday. [41.]
The dollar was mixed as traders waited to see if interest rates would fall in the United States and rise in Germany. [42.]
Platinum futures prices fell again on low inflation and relative calm in South Africa, but gold and silver rose slightly. [42.]

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Media;
Why Candidates Like Public's Questions

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 14

 BODY:
Taking his turn at a recent "Ask George Bush" question-and-answer session in Philadelphia, a high school student sounded as if he was about to put the President on the spot.
"I hate to sound like Barbara Walters, but I need to know," the teen-ager, Angelo Cruz, said at the start of a question about financing a costly education project. "Where is the money coming from? Is it going to be taken out of taxes because, you know, we're in so much debt?" 
 Mr. Bush must have been relieved because the question turned out to be not so tough at all. The President tossed off a stock reply: that it was up to Congress to free itself from "the grips of a very powerful union" and pay for the project. Mr. Cruz had no chance to follow up.
 
The Public Wants to Know
 No wonder that in this talk-show campaign, Mr. Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton -- encouraged by Ross Perot's initial success in such formats -- often bypass national reporters, leaving their jobs to ordinary citizens.
A review of the hundreds of questions posed to the Presidential candidates in the last four months reveals a striking difference between those asked by reporters or talk-show hosts and those asked by people in the audience or calling in. Reporters dwell on the process, asking about polls, tactical strategy and, of course, the story of the day. Questions from the public are far less confrontational, and an overwhelming number of people ask candidates how they would solve problems that affect the questioner.
"While we were all trying to run Bill Clinton to the ground on the subject of Gennifer Flowers," said Peter Jennings, the ABC News anchor of "World News Tonight," "the voters in New Hampshire wanted to know about the economy. And we were getting in their way."
Explaining that regular voters can sometimes elicit more information from a candidate than more intimidating journalists, he said, "You could have had a Donaldson or a Koppel hammer away at him, but as a human being he'd be less forthcoming."
 
Concern With Policies
 Michael J. Robinson, an associate professor of government at Georgetown University, said questions from the public were a refreshing change from the "bored, burned-out reporters' questions." Too often, he said, the press "focuses on what may be the most trivial message of the day and does not come back to policy concerns."
Indeed, at a session with high school students in East St. Louis, Ill., during his bus tour last week, Mr. Clinton was asked only substantial questions about issues like affirmative action and spending on AIDS. But on his way out he was confronted by reporters who asked him mostly political questions, like whether his trip to East St. Louis was in response to the Rev. Jesse Jackson's criticism that he had avoided black areas in his first bus tour.
Some political analysts argue that the downside of allowing citizens to ask questions -- and the reason the campaigns clearly prefer this format -- is that most are too timid to ask pointed questions and often let candidates off the hook by not following up. The citizens can also be so concerned with their own interests, the analysts say, that they do not ask timely, important questions.
Larry J. Sabato, a professor of government at the University of Virginia and author of "Feeding Frenzy: How Attack Journalism has Transformed American Politics," has even less patience for the questions nonjournalists ask. "The average voters asking politicians questions is like the blind leading the evasive," he said. "Reporters are trained to have the guts to egg the politicians on. Frequently, we only see the real person when they get angry."
 
Difference in Questions
 In posing a question about Social Security to Mr. Clinton and his running mate, Senator Al Gore, on the CBS News program "This Morning" on Monday, a woman did anything but anger the candidate. She held up her hands, fingers crossed, and said, "Good morning, Governor Clinton, Senator Gore, our future President and Vice President."
Mr. Clinton replied, "Nothing like an unbiased question, right?"
Here, in compressed form, are the first six questions that callers asked Mr. Clinton recently on the CNN program "Larry King Live." They are for the most part issue-oriented.
1) Your views on trade between the United States and Mexico?
2) Why didn't you attend a black newspaper publishers meeting and why do you not speak about black nations?
3) Would you give money to Russia?
4) Would you release loans to Israel?
5) How would you make the economy more competitive?
6) Have you changed your campaign approach by going on talk shows?
By contrast, here, again condensed and not including follow-ups, are the first six questions that Stone Phillips asked Mr. Bush on "Dateline NBC" this week. He was not asked much about policy.
1) Are you prepared to accept the recommendation of top Republicans for an across-the-board income tax cut?
2) With tensions rising around the world, can you afford to bring James A. Baker 3d, the Secretary of State, to the White House?
3) If you felt it was in the best interest of the nation, would you withdraw from the race?
4) Did Dan Quayle offer to step aside if you thought that would help?
5) If your granddaughter said she was pregnant and wanted to have an abortion, what would you do?
6) What do you mean when you say "family values"?
In an interview, Mr. Phillips defended his questions, including his asking Mr. Bush later in the broadcast if he had ever had an affair. Given that the President had been asked earlier in the day at a news conference about an unsubstantiated report on his private life, Mr. Phillips said, it was legitimate for him to raise the subject.
"If you had 25 voters in the Oval Office on that day, I don't think you can say that it wouldn't have been asked," Mr. Phillips said. "It was a difficult question to ask, but it became a fair question because they have made it an issue in the campaign."
 
Punches Pulled, Usually
 James Lake, a senior adviser to the Bush campaign, acknowledged that when ordinary citizens question the President, "people pull their punches a little."
Mr. Bush admitted as much. After voters in the Rose Garden politely quizzed him on the economy, education and gang violence in a session broadcast on the CBS program "This Morning" recently, Paula Zahn of the program hit a nerve by asking him why his Administration was adrift.
Mr. Bush scolded Ms. Zahn and her co-anchor, Harry Smith. "Why are these people not asking me all of this?" he said, surveying the audience of non-reporters. "It is you and Harry that have the controversial questions."
But while the questions from citizens are generally friendlier, it is the amateur who sometimes dares to ask the most mortifying question.
After almost making it through his two-hour live appearance on "This Morning" on Monday, Mr. Clinton got hit with this from an educator in Wisconsin: "Strong family values is No. 1 on my list of qualifications," she said. "From all the reports of your marital problems, et cetera, I'd like you to convince me that you would take the Presidential oath seriously."
After stammering for a few seconds, Mr. Clinton began his response, "If I haven't convinced you now, I don't know that I can."

HEADLINE: July Output Increased 0.4%, Erasing the Decline of June

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 14

 BODY:
Production by the nation's industrial plants rose four-tenths of 1 percent in July to erase an identical drop in June, the Federal Reserve Board said today. But it noted a marked weakness in important manufacturing areas.
The Fed attributed the rise to increased output from mines and utilities, which offset weakness in the more significant manufacturing sector. Manufacturing was unchanged after declining two-tenths of 1 percent in June. 
 Private economists warned that the economy was losing steam after a burst of activity in the spring and early summer, much the same as happened a year ago.
"The economy is not gaining momentum; it is coasting to a stop," said Jack Albertine, an analyst for Albertine Enterprises Inc. "The manufacturing sector, once the proud engine of growth in the American economy, is barely breathing."
Also, the Commerce Department reported that business inventories jumped six-tenths of 1 percent in June to the highest level in 16 months at $833.37 billion.
The rise in inventories was the largest since an increase of seven-tenths of 1 percent in May 1990 and followed a decline of one-tenth of 1 percent in May.
The bulge in supplies of goods on the shelves may cause retailers and wholesalers to hold back on placing new orders until they see signs that consumers are more willing to buy.
The Fed said a second straight monthly cutback in auto production, as well as steadily weakening output in military industries, restrained manufacturing activity last month.
"Much of this weakness is attributable to curtailed motor vehicle production, but output in some other major industries such as textiles, furniture, instruments and electrical machinery also dropped back," the Fed said.
Consumer confidence has been undermined by high unemployment and poor opportunities for increasing incomes. Recent signs are that average wage earners' hopes for the future are growing more pessimistic rather than brightening.
A private study called the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index, which is released to paying subscribers, showed a drop in its preliminary August reading to 75.3 from 76.6 in July, people in the financial markets said.
There was evidence in the Fed's report on industrial output that manufacturers already were responding to weak consumer demand by scaling back their production plans.
"Output of consumer durable goods, which includes motor vehicles and appliances, declined for a second straight month in July," the Fed said. "In addition, output of aerospace and miscellaneous transportation equipment, which has been weak for some time, fell further in June and July.'

HEADLINE: Opponents Start to Plan But Lack Unified Theme

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 13

 BODY:
President Bush has hailed a trade agreement between North American countries as the beginning of a new era, but opponents of the measure are gearing up to prevent its enactment or significantly change it.
The opponents, who represent different groups with widely different interests, have yet to coalesce, however, and form any unified plan of attack. 
 Some say the best way to proceed is to prevent the President's re-election and scrap the trade pact, which United States, Mexico and Canada agreed upon Wednesday and now faces ratification by the legislative bodies of all three countries.
These critics say that, although Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the Democratic Presidential candidate, has said he agrees that the nation needs some form of new trade treaty, he would do more than President Bush has done to protect American jobs from being lost that might be lost under it.
 
Environmentalists Concerned
 Other opponents, like the winter-vegetable farmers of Southern California's Imperial Valley, are dead set against the agreement but still solidly behind the President.
And still others accept the economic aspects of the agreement but object to what they predict will be adverse environmental effects.
The opposition organizations say their strategies will come together quickly after the full details of the agreement, but how that will happen is not clear.
What is clear, however, is the ire of many of these groups, with names ranging from Friends of the Earth and the Sierra Club to the United Steelworkers of America, National Farmers Union and the United Methodist Church.
"The emphasis of each group is going to be different," said Mark A. Anderson, director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s task force on trade. "But all share a common concern that the implementation of this agreement is not going to be beneficial."
 
Sales Pitch Awaited
 Lori M. Wallach, who chairs the executive board of Citizen Trade Watch Campaign, a coalition of 60 environmental, labor and farm groups that monitor trade issues, said: "There will be a lot of activity on this. Carla Hills said her job is to sell this agreement. Well, we say to her: 'Bring it on.' " Mrs. Hills is the United States trade representative and the chief negotiator of the agreement.
Kevin L. Kearns, a fellow with the Economic Strategy Institute, a public policy research group here, said: "There is no question that after September, when the details of this agreement come out, people will go over this with a fine-tooth comb. And when that happens you're going to see a grand-scale coalition forming."
The groups said their efforts will inevitably be varied, because of the divergent nature. Labor groups, for example, complain that the trade agreement would cause nearly 500,000 manufacturing jobs to move to Mexico from the United States. Environmental groups complain that the agreement would create ecological problems, particularly along the border.
"We believe that Mexico cannot be a haven for polluters and that's what would happen under this agreement," said Roni Lieberman, a spokeswoman with the Sierra Club. "This agreement would give industry the right to go to Mexico and pollute and then send the dirty products back to the United States."
Farmers say that the agreement would cause prices for sugar, peanuts and dairy products to plunge. "We don't know all the details of the agreement yet," said Clay Pederson, vice president of the National Farmers Union, a trade association representing 250,000 farm families. "But what little we do know, we don't like."
He said his group had decided to work for Mr. Clinton in the Presidential campaign, citing trade issues as an important factor. "Our PAC endorsed Governor Clinton and Senator Gore last week, the first time we have made an endorsement," Mr. Pederson said of his political action committee. "Some of the statements Governor Clinton has made -- about protecting jobs, environment and farms -- reflect how we feel." The Sierra Club, too, plans to work for Mr. Clinton.
Not all of the opponents favor the defeat of President Bush, however. Large-scale sugar-cane farmers of Hawaii join the Southern California vegetable growers in vehemently opposing the treaty but retaining strong support for the President.
Some religious groups, like the United Methodist Church, complain that the agreement does not call for enough to bolster wage levels in Mexico.
In a church publication, Mark Harrison, a program associate, said that the church would seek a trade agreement that included "an affirmation of a country's social economic and environmental priorities."
The National Consumers League is worried that the agreement would encourage exploitation of children in the workplace. "We're concerned that consumers in the United States will be unknowingly faced with products that are made as the result of child labor exploitation," said Darlene Moore, a senior associate.
The Bush Administration has said that, because of the lower wage rates in Mexico, the agreement will make North Amercian companies far more competitive with their counterparts in Asia. The President contends, too, that the agreement will open the once-closed Mexican markets for a number of products made in the United States, namely automobiles and computers.
Mr. Clinton has pledged to accompany any trade agreement he would reach with assurances that jobs in the United States and environmental standards would not be threatened.
After the agreement was announced, he said he was still reviewing it and wishes to study its potential effect on labor and the environment before taking a stand.
The Administration lawyers say they are still fine tuning the treaty language and that it will be several weeks before a complete text is released.
