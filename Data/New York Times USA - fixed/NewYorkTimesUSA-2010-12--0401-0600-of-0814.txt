HEADLINE: With Their Dome Deflated, The Vikings Still Need a Home

BYLINE: By PAT BORZI

 BODY:
MINNEAPOLIS -- The deflated roof hung limply inside the Metrodome like a pie crust Monday, and the Minnesota Vikings' chances of playing next Monday night's game against the Chicago Bears there may be sagging as well.
Representatives of Birdair Inc., the company from Amherst, N.Y., that manufactured and installed the roof, arrived late Monday afternoon to assess the damage, according to Roy Terwilliger, the chairman of the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission, which operates the Metrodome. Meanwhile, fabric to replace the three damaged roof panels was being shipped overnight from the Pontiac Silverdome in Michigan and the Carrier Dome in Syracuse, which also have air-supported roofs. 
Terwilliger remained hopeful that Birdair could estimate the repair time by late Monday night. Unless the roof can be patched within a few days, Terwilliger said the Vikings would move next Monday night's game to TCF Bank Stadium at the University of Minnesota, an open-air facility about two miles away. That decision must be made by Tuesday, he said, to give the university time to remove snow and prepare the field.
''I'm sure the N.F.L. would like to know as soon as possible, by tonight or tomorrow,'' Terwilliger said.
The shift of Sunday's Vikings-Giants game to Monday at Ford Field in Detroit hurt the Vikings financially; a capacity crowd of about 64,000 had been expected at the Metrodome. The Vikings declined to estimate the lost revenue from refunded tickets. But based on an average ticket price of $75.69, as determined by Team Marketing Report, the Vikings may have lost $4.84 million in gate receipts -- a blow for a team that ranked 29th in the 32-team league in revenue in 2009, according to Forbes Magazine.
The collapse also provided a different context to the Vikings' push for a new stadium to replace the 28-year-old Metrodome. ''I think it certainly fosters their argument that they need a new stadium,'' said John Mara, the Giants' president and co-owner. ''For this to happen is just pretty incredible.''
Though Terwilliger called the Dome structurally sound, he said its small number of luxury suites and premium seating made it economically obsolete.
The Vikings' lease expires after the 2011 season, and the team is exploring a number of options, including building a retractable-roof facility on the Metrodome site or in a Twin Cities suburb. The team also acknowledged conversations with the two Los Angeles-area groups hoping to lure an N.F.L. team to Southern California.
Lester Bagley, the Vikings' vice president for public affairs and stadium development, said it was inappropriate to discuss the issue in the aftermath of the collapse.
''Those conversations will occur in due time,'' he said in a statement released by the team.
After the Dome's Teflon roof collapsed three times from 1981 to 1983 because of heavy snow, the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission adopted a twofold strategy to prevent future occurrences, according to the executive director Bill Lester. Whenever snow built up, hot air was pumped into the space between the roof's two layers. Workers also climbed on the roof and used steam and high-powered hot-water hoses to melt snow.
That method proved effective until Saturday night, when dangerous gusts forced workers off the roof, Lester said. Snow breached the roof at about 5 a.m. Sunday.
''The confluence of high winds and the snowfall was the worst of all possible scenarios for us,'' Lester said.

HEADLINE: Tracking Tardy Flights

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
Do passengers care about a flight's on-time record when they buy an airline ticket?
The Transportation Department thinks they do, and it now requires carriers to disclose the information when customers search for fares online.
But in complying with the rule, the airlines have chosen very different ways of presenting the information, suggesting mixed feelings about revealing before the ticket is purchased that some flights consistently arrive late.
Continental includes a link next to each flight in its search results saying, ''See On-Time Performance,'' while JetBlue tells customers in big text at the top of the page, ''Did you know you can click on a flight number to see its on-time performance?'' 
But US Airways, Delta and United Airlines do not even hint that this information is available. Customers have to know to click on or hover over each flight number to make that flight's on-time record appear. American and Southwest Airlines, meanwhile, provide links that are easy to overlook.
''There's a huge disparity in how airlines choose to display this information,'' said Henry Harteveldt, a travel analyst with Forrester Research. ''Those that aren't up front about it unfortunately end up looking like they're trying to hide something, even if that's not the case.''
Whether passengers care if a flight has an 87 percent or a 62 percent on-time record is a continuing debate. When the Transportation Department first proposed the rule, the Air Transport Association, the airline trade group, argued that travelers were not interested in the data, even calculating that it would take 10 extra seconds to look at it. The group argued that the extra burden would drive customers to book tickets at online travel agencies, like Travelocity and Expedia, instead.
Those online agencies are not required to publish on-time data for the flights they sell. Nor are smaller airlines like Spirit or Virgin America, because they are not obligated to collect performance data and submit it to the Transportation Department.
The department uses the data to track the industry's overall on-time record, which was 84 percent in October -- the latest results announced last week. But that number includes data from only 18 airlines, and does not include flights operated by many regional carriers, which are more prone to delays.
By requiring the airlines to publish the on-time record for each flight they sell, including flights operated by their regional partners, the government aimed to give travelers information about a specific flight before they booked a ticket. The government also requires the airlines to publish the percentage of arrivals that were more than 30 minutes late and how often the flight was canceled (if it was canceled at least 5 percent of the time). The new rules, which took effect last summer, were included in federal passenger protections adopted by the Transportation Department last spring.
Despite the wide variation in how this information is presented, Bill Mosley, a spokesman for the department, said the airlines were all complying with the regulation, since providing a link to the on-time data was allowed.
But Mr. Harteveldt suggested that some airlines might be adhering to the letter of the law rather than its spirit out of business concerns. ''I think the airlines are afraid that people will book away from certain flights,'' he said.
The data does show there can be a wide variation in delays. Among the 20 flights US Airways offered in a recent search for a trip from Philadelphia to La Guardia Airport in New York, all for the same price on the same day, the on-time record ranged from 24 to 88 percent. Eleven of the flights had an on-time performance below 55 percent.
Jim Olson, a spokesman for US Airways, said the airline consistently ranked high in the government's on-time statistics (which do not include many of the regional flights on the Philadelphia-to-La Guardia route), and did not highlight the on-time data on its Web site more prominently because customers did not consider that information a priority.
''We have not received a single complaint about this topic from our customers,'' he said.
Since the numbers are based on data collected two months earlier, the airlines have argued that the information is not necessarily an accurate predictor of whether that same flight will have a poor on-time record several months later.
''It's difficult to understand how looking at historical data helps you make a decision going forward,'' said David A. Castelveter, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association. ''The variables that affect flight performance change on a daily basis.''
And it may well be that having this on-time data does not affect booking decisions -- although until more passengers know it exists, it is tough to gauge how travelers are using this information.
Michael Steiner, an executive vice president with Ovation Corporate Travel in Manhattan, said the agency provided on-time data for the flight options it offered to clients, but had found that most of its customers prioritized price and schedule instead.
''Do people want to know about on-time performance? Yes,'' Mr. Steiner said. ''Is it a factor when people are making connections? Absolutely. But I don't know that it's really changing behavior in a significant way.''
But Jean Covelli, president of the Travel Team, a travel agency in Buffalo, said her clients definitely cared about a flight's on-time record and avoided flights that were regularly late.
''If you're in a city where you have to connect, it's way more relevant than if you're in a big city with shuttle service,'' she said. ''You want to see on-time statistics at a minimum in the 70th percentile to feel like a flight is reliable.''

HEADLINE: Its Recovery Sputtering, Japan Will Cut Corporate Income Tax Rate

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Japan will cut its corporate income tax rate by 5 percentage points in a bid to shore up its sluggish economy, Prime Minister Naoto Kan said here Monday evening.
Companies have urged the government to lower the country's effective corporate tax rate -- which now stands at 40 percent, around the same rate as that in the United States -- to stimulate investment in Japan and to encourage businesses to create more jobs.
Lowering the corporate tax burden by 5 percentage points could increase Japan's gross domestic product by 2.6 percentage points, or 14.4 trillion yen ($172 billion), over the next three years, according to estimates by Japan's Trade Ministry. 
It was unclear, however, how Japan would make up for the estimated 1.5 trillion yen ($18 billion) decline in tax revenue that a 5 percentage-point corporate tax cut would mean for government coffers. The Japanese government is already heavily indebted, with total public debt approaching twice the size of its $5 trillion economy.
Announcing the reduction to reporters outside his official residence after deliberations by a government tax panel, Mr. Kan stressed what he said were the benefits of such a cut. Japan's corporate tax rate stood at around 50 percent in the 1990s, but has been gradually reduced.
''By daring to go with a 5 percent reduction, we will spur companies to invest domestically, expand employment and raise wages,'' Mr. Kan said. ''That will stimulate the domestic economy, support growth and shake off deflation.''
Japan's economy grew by a revised 1.1 percent in the three months to September from the previous quarter, topping a preliminary estimate, the government said last week. But a spate of weak data in recent weeks has raised concerns that Japan's recovery from the global economic crisis may be losing steam.
The country's unemployment rate worsened slightly in October, edging up to 5.1 percent, as both industrial production and household spending slipped. The jobless figure is low by international standards but close to historic highs in Japan.
Japanese companies have amassed unprecedented amounts of cash since the lean years of the 1990s, but have not reinvested the funds to expand domestically or increase employment or payrolls. A tax cut could whet companies' investment appetite, the government hopes.
The government is also worried that a strong yen is prompting companies to move production overseas, hurting jobs in Japan. Both a strong currency and relatively high corporate tax rate places Japanese companies that repatriate profits at a disadvantage in foreign markets.
In a survey of nearly 23,000 companies published this month by the credit research firm Teikoku Data Bank, more than 44 percent of respondents cited lower corporate taxes as a prerequisite to stronger economic growth in Japan. That outranked measures to stimulate employment, at 41.9 percent, or further government deregulation, at 21.8 percent.
A 5 percentage-point tax rate cut is unlikely to do much to solve Japan's woes, however. An effective corporate tax rate of 35 percent would still be higher than South Korea's 24 percent or Germany's 29 percent, for example.
Moreover, economists say that Japanese companies are reluctant to invest in Japan, not because of corporate tax levels but because they are not confident that the domestic economy will keep growing -- especially against the backdrop of a shrinking population.
''We think this reflects poor prospects for long-term growth in Japan,'' Takuji Aida, the Tokyo-based senior economist for UBS, said in a note last month. Still, he said, ''stable currency markets and a more internationally competitive tax system will be essential.''
Meanwhile, the government is trying to offset lost tax revenue with tax increases elsewhere, which could blunt the effect of reduced corporate tax burdens. Mr. Kan has said the government should consider raising Japan's 5 percent consumption tax rate, one of the lowest in the industrial world. That could expand Japan's tax base, but dampen much-needed growth in consumer spending.
But the hope is that a lower corporate tax rate will ''spark corporate activity'' and sharpen Japan's competitive edge overseas, encouraging businesses to hire, in turn bolstering incomes and consumption, Teruhiko Mano, a researcher at Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting, said in a note.
''There may be doubts over why Japan must lower its corporate tax rate when its tax revenues are insufficient,'' Mr. Mano said. ''But to maintain and stimulate corporate activity and gross domestic product, it is imperative to attract people, products and funds to Japan. A high corporate tax rate has been one big barrier.''

HEADLINE: Investors Giddy as China's Tech Upstarts Find Home in U.S.

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
Last week, shares of Youku, called the YouTube of China, rose 161 percent in the first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
E-commerce China Dangdang, an online retailer heralded as the Chinese Amazon.com, popped 87 percent after its initial public offering the same day.
The Internet content provider ChinaCache International Holdings rose 95 percent in the day after its Nasdaq debut in October. 
But investors' giddiness over the tech upstarts - and the dozens of other Chinese companies that have gone public in the United States in recent months - has some wondering whether this boom has the makings of a bubble.
''If these I.P.O.'s continue to work, they'll play them until the merry-go-round stops,'' said Scott Sweet, senior managing partner of the research firm IPO Boutique. ''And when it stops, it will stop with little notice - and it will be nasty.''
Amid a sluggish I.P.O. market, companies from China are finding a home in the United States. Last week, six Chinese stocks started trading on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, the most ever in a single week. The 35 Chinese offerings so far this year have accounted for 23 percent of I.P.O.'s in the United States, up from 1 percent in 2000, according to Thomson Reuters.
More are expected in the coming months. Youku's biggest rival, Tudou, filed plans last month to go public in the United States.
For Chinese companies, listing on American exchanges comes with stricter accounting and disclosure standards - which can be costly for smaller companies just starting out. But the rewards are significant, potentially including access to more capital, a wider investor base and the cachet of a New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq ticker symbol.
''It's the patina associated with the highest-standard marketplace in the world,'' said Scott Cutler, executive vice president and head of listings for NYSE Euronext. ''That means something when you're doing business internationally.''
With a listing in the United States, Mr. Cutler said, a Chinese company is also likely to draw a comparison to a domestic stalwart - as in the case of Youku and YouTube. That can help spur significant shareholder interest out of the gate.
After his company's I.P.O., Youku's founder and chief executive, Victor Koo, called it a ''great day.''
''This step will position Youku for future development and growth to be the primary video content provider for Chinese Internet users across all Internet-enabled devices,'' Mr. Koo said in a statement.
The trick for investors- as in the late 1990s dot-com bubble - is separating the future Amazons from the Pets.coms.
While I.P.O.'s can make investment bankers and founders rich, regular investors who do not get the initial price rarely make the same returns.
Baidu.com, hyped as the Chinese Google, rose 354 percent the day of its public offering in August 2005. But the stock quickly slumped, falling more than 60 percent over the next six months. Shares didn't fully regain their ground until the end of 2006.
At quick blush, the latest batch of Chinese offerings appears to best the broader group in the United States. On average, they have returned 30.5 percent this year, compared with a 22.5 percent gain for all new stocks, according to data from Renaissance Capital, an investment firm in Greenwich, Conn.
But excluding the first day of trading, the numbers tell a different story. Chinese companies with American offerings this year are up 10.9 percent, excluding the one-day pop, compared with 11.4 percent for all new listings.
Investor interest in Youku has already cooled significantly. Shares continued to rise the day after its first-day surge. But after that, the stock started to slide. It closed Monday at $30.40 - 138 percent above its initial offering price of $12.80, but down 39 percent from its $50 high.
Four other new listings last week, including the movie distributor Bona Film Group and the mobile application provider Sky-mobi, made their debut to tepid interest from investors.
''Drinking the Kool-Aid - it's absolutely that,'' said David Menlow, president of the research firm IPO Financial. ''When somebody on TV throws out the phrase, 'This is the Chinese equivalent of Amazon,' who's going to dispute its strength in an economy that just doesn't seem to want to stop?''
In Mr. Menlow's view, Chinese companies like Youku should be categorized as high risk, high reward. The allure is obvious, given the country's soaring economy and growing middle class.
''Investors are clamoring for growth investment opportunities,'' Mr. Cutler said of the New York Stock Exchange. ''It so happens that the Chinese are delivering on all fronts.''
But the dangers, some argue, deserve as much attention, if not more. For one thing, American investors tend to know comparatively little about new Chinese companies. Worrisome, too, is China's poor reputation when it comes to corporate governance.
''That is what looms in the shadows,'' Mr. Menlow said. ''When one of these deals unravels because of accounting problems, restatements or anything that is going to eviscerate the foundation of the financials in a company, then we may end up having somewhat of a mini tsunami effect with the rest of the Chinese deals that are out there. It will be like dominoes that will fall.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Obama's Tax-Cut Package Passes Crucial Senate Test With Votes to Spare

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With robust bipartisan support, the Senate on Monday advanced the tax-cut package negotiated by President Obama and Congressional Republicans, increasing pressure on House Democrats to set aside their opposition.
The vote, to cut off debate and end any filibuster, assured that the Senate would approve the $858 billion package on Tuesday and send it to the House, where Democrats are still demanding changes to a provision granting a generous tax exemption to wealthy estates.
The Senate vote was 83 to 15, with 45 Democrats and 37 Republicans in favor. Opposed were nine Democrats, five Republicans and Senator Bernard Sanders, independent of Vermont. 
Many Democrats had initially reacted furiously to the plan, but the rage seems to have yielded to resignation. Even House Democrats who remain opposed to the deal say they expect it to be approved within days, though they are still weighing plans to force votes on proposals to impose a steeper federal tax on large estates.
In a brief appearance in the White House briefing room, Mr. Obama did not directly address the desire of House Democrats for changes, and urged them to pass the legislation quickly, saying it would help create jobs while helping the middle class.
For Mr. Obama, the Senate vote offered affirmation that his administration had made the most of what seemed to be a rough political predicament, in which it was forced to negotiate a tax agreement with the Bush-era tax cuts set to expire at the end of the month and Congressional Republicans empowered by their big victory in the midterm elections.
''This proves that both parties can in fact work together to grow our economy and look out for the American people,'' Mr. Obama said.
The agreement would extend all of the Bush-era tax rates, even on the highest incomes, maintain the reduced rate of 15 percent on capital gains and dividends and set new estate tax parameters, all for the next two years.
The bill would also keep jobless aid flowing to the long-term unemployed for an additional 13 months, provide a one-year payroll tax cut to most American workers and continue an array of other tax breaks for individuals and businesses intended to help the economy.
Mr. Obama said he understood that there were lawmakers unhappy with parts of the plan on both sides of the aisle, and he and his aides have made clear in recent days that he still fiercely disagrees with the Republicans over extending the lower tax rates on annual incomes above $250,000 per couple or $200,000 per individual.
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican minority leader, said that he, too, was unhappy with aspects of the deal, including the provision to continue jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed without offsetting the $56.5 billion cost with spending cuts elsewhere. But Mr. McConnell praised the overall agreement and insisted that by cutting taxes it would force Democrats to restrain spending.
''This bipartisan compromise represents an essential first step in tackling the debt -- because in keeping taxes where they are, we are officially cutting off the spigot,'' Mr. McConnell said in a floor speech. ''And until we did that, Democrats in Washington were never going to be serious about cutting spending or debt. As long as more revenue was coming in, they would always have an excuse to spend more.''
Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, said he decided to back the plan because of the provision on jobless aid, which will maintain extended limits that now range from 60 weeks in states with less than 6 percent joblessness to 99 weeks in states where the unemployment rate is more than 8.5 percent.
''Today I voted in favor of badly needed relief for Rhode Islanders struggling in this tough economy,'' Mr. Whitehouse said in a statement.
The senators who voted against the plan included Democrats who said it did not do enough for the middle class and Republicans who said they worried that the plan would vastly increase the deficit.
House Democrats seem intent on making an effort to change the estate tax language in the bill, which would set an exemption of $5 million per person and a maximum rate of 35 percent for two years.
They would prefer an estate tax provision with parameters that were in place in 2009 -- an exemption of $3.5 million per person and a maximum rate of 45 percent.
Aides said one possibility would be to propose the change as an amendment.
But even if Democrats succeed in approving a change to the estate tax provision in the House version of the bill, the Senate is virtually certain to reject it.
Senate Republicans strongly support the estate tax provision agreed to by the White House, and some Democrats also favor it, including Senator Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas, who has previously co-sponsored similar legislation on it.

HEADLINE: Lying Ahead for the Health Law, Years of Constitutional Wrangling

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
By contradicting two prior opinions, Monday's court ruling in Virginia against the Obama health care law highlighted both the novelty of the constitutional issues and the difficulty of forging consensus among judges who bring differences in experience, philosophy and partisan background to the bench.
Judge Henry E. Hudson of Federal District Court in Richmond wrote with conviction that the law's requirement that most Americans obtain insurance goes ''beyond the historical reach'' of Supreme Court cases that limit federal regulation of commercial activity. During the last two months, however, two other federal judges ruled with equal force that the provision fell squarely within the authority Congress was granted under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. 
Ultimately, the Supreme Court will have to resolve the conflict, and many court watchers already expect a characteristically close decision. But what is now clear is that the challenges from dozens of states to the law's constitutionality can no longer be dismissed as frivolous, as they were earlier this year by some scholars and Democratic partisans.
''All the insiders thought it was a slam dunk,'' said Randy E. Barnett, a professor of constitutional law at Georgetown University who supports the health care challenges. ''Maybe a slam dunk like weapons of mass destruction were a slam dunk.''
The Supreme Court's position on the Commerce Clause has evolved through four signature cases over the last 68 years, three of which have been decided since 1995. Two of the opinions -- Wickard v. Filburn in 1942 and Gonzales v. Raich in 2005 -- established broad federal powers to regulate even personal commercial decisions that, taken in the aggregate, may influence a larger economic outcome.
But two other cases -- United States v. Lopez in 1995 and United States v. Morrison in 2000 -- limited Congress's regulatory authority to ''activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.''
The central question before the courts has not been whether the health care market substantially affects interstate commerce, a point largely accepted by all sides. Rather, the issue has been a semantic one: determining whether the act of not obtaining insurance is best defined as activity or, as Virginia's solicitor general, E. Duncan Getchell Jr., has argued in the Richmond case, ''inactivity'' that is beyond Congress's reach.
Mr. Getchell, who argued the case for Virginia's attorney general, Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, told Judge Hudson during an October hearing that if Congress could require the purchase of health insurance, there would effectively be no limits on federal power.
Justice Department lawyers have responded that individuals cannot opt out of the medical market because they never know when they might be hit by a bus and require treatment. The act of not obtaining insurance, they contend, is thus an active decision to pay for health care out of pocket. Such individual decisions, when taken together, can shift billions of dollars in uncompensated care costs to governments, hospitals and the privately insured, and thus can be regulated.
Judge Hudson, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, commented during the October hearing that the federal government's position would give Congress ''boundless'' authority to force Americans ''to buy an automobile, to join a gym, to eat asparagus.''
On Monday, he formalized that view. ''This broad definition of the economic activity subject to Congressional regulation lacks logical limitation and is unsupported by Commerce Clause jurisprudence,'' he wrote.
Only two weeks earlier, Judge Norman K. Moon of Federal District Court in nearby Lynchburg, Va., found precisely the opposite. ''Far from 'inactivity,' '' wrote Judge Moon, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, ''by choosing to forgo insurance, plaintiffs are making an economic decision to try to pay for health care services later, out of pocket, rather than now, through the purchase of insurance.'' A second Clinton-appointed judge has upheld the law as well.
Judge Hudson also rejected the federal government's secondary claim that it had authority to enact the insurance requirement under Congress's power to tax. That is because once the provision takes effect in 2014, the fine for not having insurance will be levied as an income tax penalty.
That claim put Justice Department lawyers in the awkward spot of insisting that the provision constituted a tax, even though President Obama and other Democratic leaders adamantly denied during the legislative debate that they were raising taxes. Judge Hudson gave weight to those denials, and to the final bill's use of the word ''penalty'' to describe the fines, a change from earlier versions.
Jack M. Balkin, a law professor at Yale who supports the act's constitutionality, noted that ''there are judges of different ideological views throughout the federal judiciary'' and said that the health care plaintiffs had helped their cause by filing lawsuits in conservative venues.
Judge Hudson seemed content with the knowledge that his opinion would be one of many. ''The final word,'' he wrote, ''will undoubtedly reside with a higher court.''

HEADLINE: New Round Of Comments On Drilling

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
Gov. David A. Paterson ordered state environmental officials on Monday to complete revisions to their proposed standards for a controversial type of natural-gas drilling by June and submit them to a new round of public comment. 
In his executive order, Mr. Paterson said hydraulic fracturing combined with horizontal drilling required a comprehensive review of possible environmental impacts before its ''deployment'' in the state. He gave officials with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation until June 1 to publish ''a revised draft'' of the standards and accept public comment ''for a period of not less than 30 days.'' They may also schedule hearings, the order said.
The department had been working on issuing final environmental standards for drilling permits after holding hearings on an earlier draft proposal last year and receiving more than 14,000 written comments. But the governor is making the department hold off on a final document until the public has a chance to see what changes were incorporated.
Peter M. Iwanowicz, the department's acting commissioner, said many of the comments have criticized the proposed standards for failing to adequately address issues like the cumulative impact of multiple drill sites, disposal of wastewater from the drilling and the protection of drinking water. He said ''it behooves'' the next administration to incorporate the range of different issues in the revised draft.
''It's one of these issues New Yorkers care very, very deeply about,'' he said.
A spokesman for Governor-elect Andrew M. Cuomo had no comment on the executive order, saying all executive orders from the previous administration were subject to review. But during the campaign, Mr. Cuomo said that although drilling was important to the state economically, it also had to be safe.
Since the environmental department had not set a date for finalizing its standards, it is not clear by how much Mr. Paterson's order further delays horizontal hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, on the Marcellus Shale in the state.
The governor's order said no drilling permits could be issued until completion of the final standards ''subsequent to the conclusion of the public comment period,'' meaning July 1 at the earliest. Mr. Iwanowicz said drilling could theoretically begin in 2011, ''but a lot of it depends on how the issues are addressed by this draft.''
The drilling uses the high-pressure injection of water, sand and chemicals to more economically release gas deposits.

HEADLINE: U.S. Mideast Envoy Tries to Revive Talks

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER; Isabel Kershner contributed reporting.

 BODY:
JERUSALEM -- After nearly two years of frustration and failure, the Obama administration began its Middle East peace efforts anew on Monday with its special envoy, George J. Mitchell, holding talks here on ways to improve the atmosphere between Israel and the Palestinians and ultimately negotiate over the core issues that separate them.
Last week the administration ended its effort to persuade Israel to freeze settlement building in the West Bank as a precursor to direct talks. Instead, there will be no direct talks for now. Rather, Mr. Mitchell will ask both sides to lay out their negotiating positions to the United States separately and the Americans will seek ways to bridge the gaps. 
Mr. Mitchell met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Monday and was due to see President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank on Tuesday. He will then meet with the foreign ministers of the Arab League in Cairo on Wednesday.
Mr. Mitchell, who has not been here for three months, found himself pursuing this more indirect strategy after the Obama administration withdrew an offer to Israel of warplanes and diplomatic assurances in exchange for a 90-day freeze on settlement construction.
Israeli officials say Mr. Netanyahu had accepted the offer in principle but before it was accepted by his government Washington pulled out, worried that it placed too much pressure on those 90 days and that the Palestinians might not negotiate because the proposed freeze excluded East Jerusalem.
At an economic conference in Tel Aviv on Monday, Mr. Netanyahu said that although he had been ready to consider another freeze, he was happy to see the emphasis shift from a construction halt -- what he called a marginal issue -- to core questions like mutual recognition, security and refugees.
Israeli officials said they expected that initial discussions with the Americans would center on gestures that Israel would offer Palestinians -- easing of security, improved economic opportunities -- and how to structure the talks ahead.
Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Abbas did hold direct talks in September near the end of a first settlement construction freeze. But Mr. Abbas ended those talks when the freeze ended, and efforts since then have focused on returning to those direct talks. Now, the initial approach will be limited to each side's speaking with the United States.
Among the Palestinians, the prevailing atmosphere was one of sourness and gloom. Officials said they did not expect Mr. Mitchell to bear any new ideas or encouraging proposals. They questioned the ability of the United States to play the role of mediator and expressed uncertainty about where to go from here.
After a meeting on Sunday, members of the Fatah Central Committee, the main decision-making body of Mr. Abbas's party, said they opposed any negotiations with Israel, direct or indirect, in the absence of a settlement freeze. They added that there would have to be clear terms of reference for any further talks, namely a two-state solution based on the 1967 lines.
''Regretfully,'' Azzam al-Ahmed, a Fatah Central Committee member told the radio station Voice of Palestine on Monday, ''the American administration is still moving in the shadow of the Israeli stance, in order to avoid upsetting the Israeli right-leaning government.''
Khalil Shikaki, a prominent Palestinian political analyst based in the West Bank city of Ramallah, said the Palestinian negotiators would probably continue to engage with the Americans and share their thinking with Washington.
''But the Palestinian side will most likely want to avoid the perception that they are engaged in negotiations with the Israelis,'' Mr. Shikaki said in a telephone interview. Putting the emphasis on engagement with the Americans, he continued, would represent a ''shift in focus'' from the so-called proximity talks, the indirect, American-brokered negotiations that took place earlier this year.
At the same time, the Palestinians are pursuing other options, chiefly seeking international endorsement for the 1967 lines as the borders of their future state.
''There is a growing desire on the part of the Palestinian public to seek out alternative means,'' Mr. Shikaki said.

HEADLINE: World Trade Organization Upholds American Tariffs on Tires From China

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The World Trade Organization on Monday upheld the Obama administration's decision last year to impose tariffs of up to 35 percent on tires from China, rejecting a complaint by Beijing that the punitive duties violated international agreements.
The decision, which the United States trade representative called ''a major victory,'' came on the same day that differences on trade and currency between the world's two largest economies were highlighted on two other fronts. 
A federal agency found on Monday that ineffective enforcement by the Chinese authorities had contributed to widespread trademark, copyright and patent infringement in China.
Also on Monday, two senators, Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, and Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, proposed amending the tax bill in the Senate to include a measure that would let the United States impose higher duties on some Chinese imports in retaliation what most economists agree is an undervalued currency.
The developments came on the eve of two days of talks here between Wang Qishan, China's vice premier for economic affairs, and the United States commerce secretary, Gary Locke, and the trade representative, Ron Kirk. Those talks are expected to include enforcement of intellectual property rights but not currency valuations, which in the United States is the purview of the Treasury Department.
Mr. Kirk applauded the ruling in the tire case, saying it ''demonstrates that the Obama administration is strongly committed to using and defending our trade remedy laws to address harm to our workers and industries.''
The tariffs were a significant victory for the United Steelworkers, which had requested the tariffs, contending that a surge in imports had threatened domestic manufacturing.
''Since the tariffs have been in effect, U.S. domestic tire production has increased, tire producers have made new capital investments, and new jobs have been created for American tire workers,'' the union's president, Leo W. Gerard, said in a statement after the W.T.O. ruling was issued in Geneva.
The imposition of the tariffs was the first time that the United States invoked a special safeguard provision that was part of its agreement to support China's entry into the W.T.O. in 2001.
Under that provision, United States companies or workers harmed by imports from China can ask the government for protection simply by demonstrating that American producers have suffered a ''market disruption'' or have experienced a surge in imports from China. In more traditional antidumping cases, the government would have to determine that a trading partner was competing unfairly or selling its products at less than their true cost.
The United States International Trade Commission, a quasi-judicial independent agency, had recommended that the Obama administration impose the tariffs for three years.
According to the steelworkers' union, a surge in imports from China resulted in sharp declines in capacity, production, shipments and employment by American tire producers between 2004 and 2008.
Domestic tire capacity declined to 186.4 million tires, from 226.8 million, during that period, while production dropped to 160.3 million tires, from 218.4 million.
The United States already had a 4 percent tariff on Chinese tires. The new duties involved an additional tariff of 35 percent for one year, reduced to 30 percent in the second year and 25 percent in the third.
Three days after the administration announced its decision, the Chinese government brought a complaint to the W.T.O., calling the duties ''a serious case of trade protectionism, which China resolutely opposes.''
A three-member W.T.O. panel found that the United States ''did not fail to comply with its obligations'' under world trade agreements. China can appeal the panel's findings to the W.T.O.'s appellate body within 60 days.
The Obama administration said the tariffs had helped domestic producers increase production, preserve jobs and consider new investments. But the Tire Industry Association, a trade group that seeks to end the tariffs, has questioned the tariff's effectiveness and called for it to be lifted.
On the matter of intellectual property, the trade commission released a report Monday finding that violations of intellectual property rights ''remains a central concern in the U.S.-China bilateral trade relationship.''
The report noted that the federal Customs and Border Protection agency seized $204.7 million worth of counterfeit and pirated goods that originated in China in the 2009 fiscal year. Footwear made up nearly half of that amount, followed by handbags, wallets and backpacks; consumer electronics; and apparel.
The report also covered a move by China to promote ''indigenous innovation'' through policies and regulations that United States companies view as potentially discriminatory.
Senator Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which oversees trade, urged China to address the report's findings during the bilateral talks scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday here, part of a forum known as the United States-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade.
A second report, due in May, will try to quantify the impact of intellectual property violations and ''indigenous innovation'' policies on American jobs and workers.

HEADLINE: Trimming Bloated Balance Sheets

BYLINE: By AGNES T. CRANE and CHRISTOPHER SWANN

 BODY:
Corporate titans are not usually rewarded for shrinking their companies. But the chief executives of two of the world's biggest companies, Jeffrey R. Immelt of General Electric and Vikram S. Pandit of Citigroup, have had to do something similar. Bloated balance sheets heavily dependent on short-term financing forced both these companies to beg for government help two years ago. Since then, they have been shedding assets in a bid to return to normal business and create a buffer against ever needing taxpayer handouts again.
If it were a race, Citi Holdings, the unit that houses the bank's blacklisted assets, would have a sizable lead. Including the pending sale of the Student Loan Corporation, Citi Holdings has trimmed its balance sheet by 44 percent in two years. GE Capital, in comparison, is pacing itself. The unit's balance sheet has shrunk 15 percent since the end of 2008, and its unwanted ''red assets'' are about 24 percent smaller than a year ago, at $105 billion. 
To be fair, Citi Holdings and GE Capital are two varieties of apple. Citi created its unit to clear the garbage -- and noncore units like the Smith Barney brokerage house -- out of its still mighty global bank. Much of GE Capital, meanwhile, remains an integral unit of its industrial parent. So while it might be shedding assets like Polish mortgages, those will be partly offset by growth in lines like commercial lending and leasing, which support its world-class industrial and infrastructure businesses.
Still, both made similarly critical missteps by piling into risky investments linked to the booming real estate market with short-term borrowings. Citi received the most help from Washington -- capital injections, guarantees for its debt and insurance on its most distressed assets. But without government support, it is hard to see how GE Capital could have managed through the crisis without a fire sale of good assets. It borrowed nearly $12 billion over five days from a Federal Reserve facility in October 2008.
The race is still not over. GE Capital sees the finishing line in 2012, by which time it hopes to cut an additional $40 billion from the balance sheet. And though Mr. Immelt may be lagging Mr. Pandit, if he remains committed to shrinking he is unlikely to hear many boos at his annual investor presentation today.
Deal Gusher
It is tempting to use costlier oil to explain Monday's three oil services deals, headlined by General Electric's $:800 million ($1.3 billion) purchase of Wellstream Holdings. But the stronger underlying theme is rising interest in techniques for reaching oil that is hard to get at. Specialists want new capabilities -- and the majors want bigger partners.
Wellstream and two other takeover targets, PSN and Easternwell, all have expertise and technology in extracting energy from tricky places. Flexible pipes of the type Wellstream makes are essential as energy giants delve deeper into the oceans. PSN is a specialist in increasing production from old wells. And Australia's Easternwell knows how to extract coal seam gas -- once a nuisance that killed canaries in mines, but now a precious resource.
Demand for traditional drilling equipment remains slack despite rising oil prices because new discoveries of conventional fossil fuel deposits have been scarce. Instead, the oil services arms race has focused on how to reach difficult deposits.
In addition, rather than abandoning old wells and moving on, it has become worthwhile to keep older wells alive -- another technically challenging proposition. So far, only about a third of the fuel in existing wells worldwide has been harvested, according to the research firm IHS.
This, rather than oil for $90 a barrel, is the main deal driver. Even two of the biggest deals of recent years, Schlumberger's takeover of Smith and Baker Hughes's purchase of BJ Services Company, had more to do with the targets' expertise in cracking previously inaccessible energy out of rock than with buoyant oil prices.
For the smaller players in oil services, there is a mergers-and-acquisitions motivation beyond technology, too: specialists in hard-to-get oil will need to grow as demand for their services increases. Of course, a bargain basement crude price would slow consolidation. At $50 a barrel, some of the more costly exploration and recovery methods cease to be economical. But assuming no such collapse, companies in the oil services sector will keep exploring for new deals.

HEADLINE: Should We Pull Back in the Mideast?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Reality Check'' (column, Dec. 12):
Thomas L. Friedman has put into words what I have long felt. I am 58 years old, and for most of my adult life I have been hopefully following the Middle East peace process, from the Oslo accords to the Camp David negotiations to the road map, ad infinitum and ad nauseam. 
Throughout decades of suffering the futility of hope about this peace process, there has been but one constant: It's been all process, no peace.
Yes, it's time for the United States to step away and let the parties figure it out for themselves.
Tom Fahey Springfield, Va., Dec. 12, 2010
To the Editor:
Thomas L. Friedman asserts that Israelis ''don't get it.'' As an American and an Israeli, let me assure Mr. Friedman that Israelis do get it. Sadly, we get it all too well.
For more than 43 years, every offer, every compromise has been met with a resounding ''no'' by the Palestinians. Had Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, accepted the offer made by Ehud Olmert, the former Israeli prime minister, this discussion would not be necessary.
Had Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, accepted the offer of Ehud Barak, the Israeli leader, at Camp David, this discussion would not be necessary.
Israel is one of America's closest allies. Israel understands this. Succumbing to American pressure for an extended settlement freeze would have had as much effect on solving the disagreement with the Palestinians as it would on solving the economic woes in the United States. None.
Peter Yurowitz Highland Park, N.J., Dec. 12, 2010
To the Editor:
Thomas L. Friedman's diagnosis is correct, but I disagree with his prescription. The failure of Israeli and Palestinian leaders to cooperate with American peacemaking efforts is irresponsible.
Peace is in the interest of both peoples -- as it is a chief national security interest for the United States. It may be true that the United States can't want peace more than the parties themselves, but America needs Middle East peace, and needs it badly.
The remedy for the parties' intransigence is not walking away from the peace process, as Mr. Friedman suggests, but the opposite: aggressive treatment in the form of American muscle.
Under real American pressure, Israeli and Palestinian leaders will have little choice but to cooperate with an initiative that serves America's regional and global policies.
Ori Nir Spokesman Americans for Peace Now Washington, Dec. 12, 2010
To the Editor:
I agree with Thomas L. Friedman when he states, ''I am for the most active U.S. mediation effort possible to promote peace, but the initiative has to come from them,'' referring to the Israelis and the Palestinians.
Regardless of the amount of aid the United States has provided to Israel since its founding, Israel is not a puppet of the United States and should do what is in the best security interests of its people.
The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, is so weak he cannot make a decision on his own without first consulting the Arab League.
Here is the real reality check: The Israelis do not have a legitimate negotiating partner in Mr. Abbas.

HEADLINE: Just One Ruling, But an Outsize One

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- By the numbers, President Obama is beating opponents of his signature health care bill two to one in federal court. Of the three district court judges who have ruled on the merits of constitutional challenges to the landmark Affordable Care Act, two have sided with Mr. Obama.
But from a political standpoint, the only case that really matters is the one Mr. Obama lost on Monday. 
Judge Henry E. Hudson's decision leaves the White House playing defense for the foreseeable future on an issue it once thought would secure Mr. Obama's legacy. It provides another rallying point for conservatives as they make the case that government is overreaching and must be reined in. And as the Virginia case and others like it make their way through the appeals process and ultimately to the Supreme Court, it ensures that health care will remain a topic of intense debate in the new Congress and into the 2012 presidential campaign.
Monday's ruling gives a boost to what Peter Wehner, who advised President George W. Bush on domestic policy, calls a ''full-scale assault by the Republican Party and conservatives'' on the measure. In Washington, Congressional Republicans are planning a symbolic vote to repeal the measure when they take control of the House of Representatives next month, and are vowing to chip away at it through financial cuts. Republicans say Judge Hudson's decision provides a legal underpinning for such efforts.
''Judge Hudson's a serious judge and he has put into words, and into a legal decision, a fairly profound pronouncement, which is that a key element of Obama's health care plan is unconstitutional, and that's going to energize people at every level of government who oppose the law,'' said Mr. Wehner, now a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center here. ''Conservatives have been dealt a lot of setbacks from the judiciary and judges along the way; this one is a powerful ratification of the conservative world view, and it complicates things for the Obama administration.''
The ruling puts Mr. Obama on the defensive over health care at a time when he would rather be talking about the economy and forging a relationship with the newly empowered Republicans in Congress. And in addition to energizing Mr. Obama's critics on the right, the decision is reigniting a long-simmering debate on the left about whether he should have pushed for a government-run system to cover the uninsured, without the controversial mandate to buy insurance.
White House officials consoled themselves Monday with the relative narrowness of the decision; Judge Hudson ruled only the mandate unconstitutional, and not the whole bill, though stripping out the mandate would undercut much of the bill's promise to expand access to health care while holding down costs.
But Judge Hudson did give Republicans additional ammunition. In his ruling, he took lawmakers and the White House to task for characterizing the penalty facing people who refuse to buy insurance as a tax -- a term the White House had been loath to use during the political debate. Republicans were ecstatic; Representative Trent Franks of Arizona predicted the decision would be the ''death rattle'' of the health bill.
For Mr. Obama, who opposed a mandate in the early stages of his presidential campaign, there was a certain irony in the ruling. His fellow Democrats insisted that while it might look like a victory for Republicans, it would galvanize their party as well.
''The more heated this becomes, the more light there will be, because the more this is discussed, the more our country will realize that the status quo is simply unacceptable,'' Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan and outgoing chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said, adding Democrats would defend the bill at '' ''every juncture.''
But Democrats are also looking to the president to carry the fight forward with the same vigor he displayed before the bill's passage -- a level of enthusiasm that might be hard for him to muster, given his political circumstances in the aftermath of the drubbing his party took in last month's midterm elections. Representative Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois, said Mr. Obama needed to become more aggressive about defending the measure he fought so hard to pass.
''The president has to be the leader in very forcefully explaining and touting this bill because I think we need to take the offensive on this issue,'' Ms. Schakowsky said. ''The next two years it's going to be all about leadership from the White House.''
Yet there is only so much the president can do. Mr. Obama still weighs in on health care from time to time, most recently when his administration announced new rules requiring insurance companies to spend at least 80 percent of health premium dollars on medical expenditures for patients. But, try as he might, he has been unable to bring the public to his side. Surveys do show that the some individual provisions of the law, such as barring insurers from denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions (a provision that would fall if the Virginia court ruling is upheld) and allowing young adults to stay on their parents' plans until they are 26, are broadly popular.
But nine months after the bill's passage, Americans remain divided over whether to repeal it, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, which tracks public opinion on the measure. Experts say that division is fueled by persistent confusion about just what the bill would do.
''You have all these comments out there that it's a government takeover of health care, that it's going to be bad for seniors, that it's pulling the plug on grandma,'' said Jonathan Oberlander, a professor of health policy at the University of North Carolina. ''That stuff has stuck politically, and it's evident in those numbers, in the very divided public support for reform.''
So long as Mr. Obama is president, Republicans' only real hope for undoing the health bill rests with the courts. The House repeal measure is all but certain to fail in the Senate, and even if it passed, Mr. Obama would veto it.
For his part, the president sought to play down the significance of the court ruling in Virginia.
''Keep in mind, this is one ruling by one federal district court,'' Mr. Obama said in an interview with WFLA, a Florida television station, adding: ''You've got one judge who disagreed. That's the nature of these things.''

HEADLINE: Deeper Looks at the Crisis Of '08 and the Oval Office

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
CAPITAL OFFENSE
How Washington's Wise Men Turned America's Future Over to Wall Street
By Michael Hirsh
342 pages. John Wiley & Sons. $26.95.
REVIVAL
The Struggle for Survival Inside the Obama White House
By Richard Wolffe
312 pages. Crown. $26.
A now infamous 1999 Time magazine cover featured Alan Greenspan (then chairman of the Federal Reserve), Robert E. Rubin (then Treasury Secretary) and Lawrence H. Summers (then deputy Treasury secretary) as ''The Committee to Save the World.'' The three men, the magazine declared, had steered America through the perilous shoals of highly volatile world markets. The United States economy remained ''astonishingly robust'' and, by protecting American growth, the three had made ''investors deliriously, perhaps delusionally, happy in the process.'' 
A decade later, in the wake of America's 2008 fiscal meltdown, the thinking of Time's ''Three Marketeers'' and their colleagues in Washington and on Wall Street would be cited as a major cause of that crisis. Mr. Greenspan has been chastised for keeping interest rates too low for too long, for failing to see the danger of subprime mortgages and falling house prices, and for neglecting to use the Fed's regulatory clout to restrain the excesses in the market. Mr. Rubin has been taken to task for promoting the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, which was passed during the Great Depression and prohibited commercial banks from engaging in the investment business. And Mr. Summers has been criticized for failing to foresee the risks derivatives posed and for his reluctance to regulate these exotic financial instruments.
In fact, the main reason the financial crisis of 2008 occurred, the journalist Michael Hirsh argues in his provocative new book, ''Capital Offense,'' is that ''the people in charge of our economy, otherwise intelligent and capable men like Greenspan, Rubin and Summers -- and later Hank Paulson and Tim Geithner -- permitted themselves to believe, in the face of a rising tide of contrary evidence, that markets are for the most part efficient and work well on their own.''
Many of the essential points Mr. Hirsh, chief correspondent for National Journal and former national economics correspondent for Newsweek magazine, makes about the financial calamities of 2008 will be familiar to readers of other recent books -- most notably, Nouriel Roubini and Stephen Mihm's ''Crisis Economics''; David Wessel's ''In Fed We Trust'' and Daniel Gross's ''Dumb Money.'' And many of Mr. Hirsh's larger arguments about free-market fundamentalism owe a heavy debt to ideas articulated by the liberal economist Joseph E. Stiglitz in his 2010 book, ''Freefall: America, Free Markets, and the Sinking of the World Economy.''
Nonetheless, ''Capital Offense'' does a highly informed, if decidedly opinionated, job of situating these developments within a historical context, and the book makes for useful and succinct reading at a time when the state of the economy -- and President Obama's handling of the recession -- are being vociferously debated in Washington and around the country.
In these pages Mr. Hirsh looks at how the ideas of John Maynard Keynes -- predicated upon the belief that markets do not automatically self-correct, and that government intervention is sometimes necessary -- were embraced in Washington in the wake of the Great Depression. He chronicles how the opposing ideas of Milton Friedman -- who believed that free markets functioned efficiently without bureaucratic interference -- gained ascendancy with the election of Ronald Reagan and the abrupt collapse of the Soviet Union. And he charts how the deregulation movement accelerated during the administrations of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, arguing that it created an ''indomitable zeitgeist'' that would set the stage for disaster.
Regarding the differences between advocates of government intervention and those who contend that free markets operate better on their own, Mr. Hirsh says that such arguments, boiled down, are ''largely about the issue of human rationality versus irrationality. One side holds that markets are basically rational and efficient on their own -- that they are an optimal way for societies to allocate resources -- and governments only interfere. The other side holds that markets and the people who make them up often behave irrationally, inefficiently and unjustly, and therefore the best course is to keep government involved at all times.''
Mr. Hirsh contends that ''at the precise moment in history when a deep rethinking of regulation was required, the free-market fundamentalism had reached its height, and the economic mind-set had grown dead-set against regulation.'' Increasingly complex derivatives (many designed by physicists, who, Mr. Hirsh says, headed for Wall Street with the demise of the cold war, and who failed to factor into their mathematical models the vagaries of human behavior) hugely increased the risk factor in the markets, even as they eluded the understanding of many financial executives.
What Mr. Hirsh, like Mr. Stiglitz, finds particularly perplexing, is that many of the people who ''let the catastrophe'' of 2008 happen in the first place are now back ''running the show.'' New thinking failed to fill the ''conceptual vacuum'' in economics, he says, and for many people ''the old regime and the old intellectual constructs -- compounded of Friedmanism, Greenspanism and Rubinism -- continued to dominate by default.''
Mr. Summers has been President Obama's chief White House economic adviser (it was announced in September that he would be leaving the administration by the end of the year), and Mr. Geithner (who worked under Mr. Summers and Mr. Rubin in the Clinton administration) is the administration's Treasury Secretary.
In Mr. Hirsh's opinion, President Obama did not seem ready to ''address the deeper ills of the free-market system,'' but instead quickly turned his attention to health care during his first year. And as partisanship accelerated in the country along with the health care debate, Mr. Hirsh concludes, ''one of the few issues everyone on both sides of the political divide could actually unite on -- the power of Wall Street and the too-big-to-fail problem -- was lost in the political maelstrom.''
Richard Wolffe's new book, ''Revival'' -- which argues in passing that ''Obama's economic team was the most dysfunctional group of the president's advisers'' -- uses the administration's efforts to grapple with the country's fiscal woes and its handling of health care legislation as prisms by which to look at how this White House operates.
Although the book showcases the author's inside knowledge of the White House and provides some revealing insights into the president's ambitions, temperament and modus operandi, it covers a highly arbitrary time frame, ending before this fall's midterm elections. The book, a sequel of sorts to the author's 2009 campaign book, ''Renegade,'' is also constricted by a highly schematic thesis, which contends that Mr. Obama's aides are divided into ''two powerful and self-righteous camps,'' and that those camps represent warring sides of the president's own personality.
On one side, as Mr. Wolffe tells it, are the ''Revivalists'' like Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser, and Robert Gibbs, the press secretary: ''campaign loyalists who believed in the transformational spirit of Change'' and ''nurtured a sense of mission and a sincere belief in the unique talents of their leader to bend the arc of history and reform the culture of politics.''
On the other side, he says, are ''the Survivalists,'' like former chief of staff Rahm Emanuel: ''political insiders who measured Change in the smaller increments of the here and now'' and ''saw themselves as scrappy realists who used any means necessary to advance their leader's agenda.''
Mr. Wolffe writes that Mr. Obama ''straddled'' both groups: ''he was an unconventional outsider who could break the established rules of politics to dramatic effect; yet he was also a conventional insider with an innate aversion to risk and a commitment to compromise. His mistake, if not his hubris, was to assume that others would either share his powers of reason or understand the sincerity of his motives.''
Echoing what Jonathan Alter wrote about the president in his recent book, ''The Promise,'' Mr. Wolffe writes that ''there were few around him who thought health care was the right way for Obama to define his first year,'' especially given the state of the economy. But the president pushed ahead anyway: in part, Mr. Wolffe suggests, because of memories of his mother's worries about medical insurance in the months before her death from cancer; in part because it was a priority for the first lady; in part because he aspired to be a great, history-making president and liked to ''take on the toughest political challenges he could find.''
Though some aides urged that he spend more time on his domestic agenda, Mr. Wolffe reports, the president also ''devoted himself to some of the most arcane details of diplomacy'' and foreign policy, when it was a subject that captured his imagination -- like nuclear arms control and the Start treaty, a subject that returned him to ''one of his first interests as a student at Columbia University.''
''Inside the West Wing,'' Mr. Wolffe writes at the end of his book, Mr. Obama ''liked to say that he would rather do big things in one term than small things in two terms.''

HEADLINE: In Health Law, Old Arguments Get New Airing

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
''We are against forcing all citizens, regardless of need, into a compulsory government program,'' said one prominent critic of the new health care law. It is socialized medicine, he argued. If it stands, he said, ''one of these days, you and I are going to spend our sunset years telling our children, and our children's children, what it once was like in America when men were free.''
The health care law in question was Medicare, and the critic was Ronald Reagan. He made the leap from actor to political activist, almost 50 years ago, in part by opposing government-run health insurance for the elderly. 
Today, the supposed threat to free enterprise is a law that's broader, if less radical, than Medicare: the bill Congress passed this year to create a system of privately run health insurance for everyone. On Monday, a federal judge ruled part of the law to be unconstitutional, and the Supreme Court will probably need to settle the matter in the end.
We've lived through a version of this story before, and not just with Medicare. Nearly every time this country has expanded its social safety net or tried to guarantee civil rights, passionate opposition has followed.
The opposition stems from the tension between two competing traditions in the American economy. One is the laissez-faire tradition that celebrates individuality and risk-taking. The other is the progressive tradition that says people have a right to a minimum standard of living -- time off from work, education and the like.
Both traditions have been crucial to creating the most prosperous economy and the largest middle class the world has ever known. Laissez-faire conservatism has helped make the United States a nation of entrepreneurs, while progressivism has helped make prosperity a mass-market phenomenon.
Yet the two traditions have never quite reconciled themselves. In particular, conservatives have often viewed any expansion of government protections as a threat to capitalism.
The federal income tax, a senator from New York said a century ago, might mean the end of ''our distinctively American experiment of individual freedom.'' Social Security was actually a plan ''to Sovietize America,'' a previous head of the Chamber of Commerce said in 1935. The minimum wage and mandated overtime pay were steps ''in the direction of Communism, Bolshevism, fascism and Nazism,'' the National Association of Manufacturerscharged in 1938.
After Brown v. Board of Education outlawed school segregation in 1954, 101 members of Congress signed a statement calling the ruling an instance of ''naked judicial power'' that would sow ''chaos and confusion'' and diminish American greatness. A decade later, The Wall Street Journal editorial board described civil rights marchers as ''asking for trouble'' and civil rights laws as being on ''the outer edge of constitutionality, if not more.''
This year's health care overhaul has now joined the list.
On the most basic level, the law will ensure that people can get health insurance, and thus medical care, even if they are not insured by their employer or their spouse's employer. Today, many can't.
The people who try to buy policies in the individual market are disproportionately those who have reason to think they or their children will need medical care. Healthy people, on the other hand, often go without coverage -- until they think they need it. So insurance companies charge sky-high prices for individual policies, to cover the high average costs of care.
The new law takes two steps to solve the problem. First, it prohibits insurers from denying coverage or charging more because of a person's health. Second, the law requires individuals to have insurance, spreading the costs of care among the sick and the healthy.
Two federal judges upheld the individual mandate this year, saying that it fell under Congress's power to regulate commerce. But Judge Henry Hudson, of a Federal District Court in Virginia, ruled on Monday that Congress had overstepped by prohibiting a form of inactivity -- that is, not buying insurance. And as Reagan did with Medicare, Judge Hudson argued that the mandate had a larger meaning: he said it ''would invite unbridled exercise of federal police powers.''
In truth, the law is quite moderate. It is more conservative than President Bill Clinton's 1993 plan or President Richard Nixon's 1974 plan (in which the federal government would have covered anyone who wasn't insured through an employer). It's much more conservative than expanding Medicare to cover everyone. It is clearly one of the least radical ways for the United States to end its status as the only rich country with millions and millions of uninsured.
But the law depends to a significant degree on the mandate. Without it, some healthy people will wait to buy coverage until they get sick -- which, of course, is not an insurance system at all. It's free-riding.
Without the mandate, the cost of insurance in the individual market would rise, perhaps sharply, because some healthy people would not be paying their share. Just look at Massachusetts. In 1996, it barred insurers from setting rates based on a person's health but did not mandate that individuals sign up for insurance. Premiums then spiked. Since the state added a mandate in 2006, more people have signed up, and premiums have dropped an average of 40 percent.
It's easy to look at the current debate and see an unavoidable trade-off between this country's two economic traditions -- risk-taking and security. But I don't think that's quite right. I think it is ultimately as misplaced as those worries about Social Security and Medicare equaling Bolshevism.
Guaranteeing people a decent retirement and decent health care does more than smooth out the rough edges of capitalism. Those guarantees give people the freedom to take risks. If you know that professional failure won't leave you penniless and won't prevent your child from receiving needed medical care, you can leave the comfort of a large corporation and take a chance on your own idea. You can take a shot at becoming the next great American entrepreneur.
With every previous major expansion of the safety net, history has had a chance to prove the naysayers wrong. It may yet in the case of universal health coverage. But the decision now seems to rest with the nine members of the Supreme Court.

HEADLINE: Fed Goes Ahead With Bond Plan

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve, batting away unusually fierce criticisms, forged ahead on Tuesday with its effort to prop up the economic recovery by buying $600 billion in Treasury bonds.
But interest rates on government bonds continued to march upward, appearing to defy one of the Fed's goals for the bond-buying program: lowering long-term interest rates. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note surged to 3.47 percent, up from 3.27 percent late Monday, and the highest level since May.
In their last scheduled meeting of the year, Fed policy makers stuck with the bond-buying plan they announced on Nov. 3, finding that the recovery was ''continuing, though at a rate that has been insufficient to bring down unemployment.''
In its statement, the Fed did not publicly acknowledge, much less react to, the uncertainty in the bond markets or the criticisms leveled by foreign central banks and conservative economists, among others. 
Nor did it mention the biggest surprise it has confronted in the six weeks since its bond-buying announcement, the Obama administration's $858 billion deal with Congressional Republicans to extend all of the Bush-era tax cuts in return for some short-term fiscal stimulus.
By raising expectations for growth next year -- along with heightening concerns about the size of the deficit -- the tax-cut compromise has complicated the Fed's bond-buying strategy, which was devised over the summer.
The recent uptick in interest rates -- the 10-year Treasury yield was as low as 2.39 percent in early October, and 2.67 percent on the day of the November announcement -- is interpreted in at least two starkly different ways.
Laurence H. Meyer, a former Fed governor, said the rise in interest rates was a result of more positive economic growth estimates.
''What does the Fed say when rates are pulled up by stronger growth? Hooray,'' he said in an interview. ''How does this change its assessment of the effectiveness of the program? Not at all.''
Even so, Mr. Meyer suggested that the Fed's November action -- the most momentous decision this year -- was made against a different economic and political situation than the current one.
''If they had known about the political backlash, the strengthening of the economic data and the totally unexpected fiscal stimulus, I doubt they would have begun the program,'' said Mr. Meyer, who runs a forecasting firm, Macroeconomic Advisers. ''But now that it's under way, it's more disruptive to stop it in the middle than to complete it.''
Other economists were more skeptical, saying the rise in interest rates demonstrated the limited effectiveness of the Fed's program to buy bonds in a bid to lower long-term interest rates and spur growth.
''All the king's horses and all the king's men can't push bond yields back below 3 percent again,'' Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, wrote in a note to investors after the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed panel that sets monetary policy, met and announced that it was continuing the bond buying plan.
''There must be some disappointment at the F.O.M.C. that the purchases have not kept 10-year yields from rising so much, let alone decline,'' Mr. Rupkey wrote.
The customary terse statement by the committee offered no clue as to how Fed officials had interpreted recent events like the tax-cut compromise and the rise in interest rates.
The committee's periodic assessment of economic conditions was only marginally more positive than the last one, in November. Investors look for even the slightest changes in wording to gauge shifts in the Fed's outlook.
The committee found that household spending was increasing ''at a moderate pace'' -- instead of ''gradually,'' as it wrote in November -- and ''remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth and tight credit.''
It found that ''the housing sector continues to be depressed'' and reaffirmed that employers had been reluctant to hire and that measures of underlying inflation had continued to move downward.
Unsurprisingly, the committee voted to keep the benchmark short-term interest rate -- the federal funds rate at which banks lend to each other overnight -- at a target of zero to 0.25 percent, the level it has been at since December 2008.
And it repeated its stance that the fed funds rate would remain ''exceptionally low'' for ''an extended period,'' the phrases it has used since March 2009.
Along with the $600 billion in bond purchases through June -- roughly $75 billion a month for eight months -- the Fed is using about $30 billion a month in proceeds from its mortgage-related investments to buy Treasury securities. That smaller program was announced in August and is continuing.
While the committee said it would ''continue expanding its holdings of securities as announced in November,'' it emphasized that it would continue to re-evaluate the effort.
It said it would ''regularly review the pace of its securities purchases and the overall size of the asset purchase program in light of incoming information and will adjust the program as needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability.''
The committee's vote was 10 to 1. Thomas M. Hoenig, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, was again the lone dissenter, as he has been all year. His string of eight dissents is the most in a single year since a Fed governor, Henry C. Wallich, dissented eight times in 1980, according to Fed records.
''Mr. Hoenig was concerned that a continued high level of monetary accommodation would increase the risks of future economic and financial imbalances and, over time, would cause an increase in long-term inflation expectations that could destabilize the economy,'' the statement said, summarizing his dissent.
Investors had been nearly unanimous in expecting that the Fed would not change course so soon after making a major decision, and those expectations were not disappointed.
''If the Fed is going to make any adjustments to its large-scale asset purchase program, they are going to do it next year,'' said Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak & Company in New York, adding, ''We don't foresee that as of yet.''
Mr. Meyer predicted that Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, would face tough questions from Republicans in the next Congress but that the bond buying strategy would work out for the Fed in the long run.
''It's a very hostile environment, and it's going to be unpleasant for the chairman for some time, until the economy really seems to be picking up and inflation remains low,'' Mr. Meyer said. ''Then he'll look like a genius. When history is written, the Fed will get more credit for the strengthening of growth than it probably deserves.''

HEADLINE: BEIJING TURBINE; China Sets Rules and Wins Wind Power Game

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
TIANJIN, China -- Judging by the din at its factory here one recent day, the Spanish company Gamesa may seem to be a thriving player in the Chinese wind energy industry it helped create.
But Gamesa has learned the hard way, as other foreign manufacturers have, that competing for China's lucrative business means playing by strict house rules that are often stacked in Beijing's favor.
Nearly all the components that Gamesa assembles into million-dollar turbines here, for example, are made by local suppliers -- companies Gamesa trained to meet onerous local content requirements. And these same suppliers undermine Gamesa by selling parts to its Chinese competitors -- wind turbine makers that barely existed in 2005, when Gamesa controlled more than a third of the Chinese market.
But in the five years since, the upstarts have grabbed more than 85 percent of the wind turbine market, aided by low-interest loans and cheap land from the government, as well as preferential contracts from the state-owned power companies that are the main buyers of the equipment. Gamesa's market share now is only 3 percent. 
With their government-bestowed blessings, Chinese companies have flourished and now control almost half of the $45 billion global market for wind turbines. The biggest of those players are now taking aim at foreign markets, particularly the United States, where General Electric has long been the leader.
The story of Gamesa in China follows an industrial arc traced in other businesses, like desktop computers and solar panels. Chinese companies acquire the latest Western technology by various means and then take advantage of government policies to become the world's dominant, low-cost suppliers.
It is a pattern that many economists say could be repeated in other fields, like high-speed trains and nuclear reactors, unless China changes the way it plays the technology development game -- or is forced to by its global trading partners.
Companies like Gamesa have been so eager to enter the Chinese market that they not only bow to Beijing's dictates but have declined to complain to their own governments, even when they see China violating international trade agreements.
Even now, Gamesa is not crying foul -- for reasons that are also part of the China story. Although the company's market share in China has atrophied, the country's wind turbine market has grown so big, so fast that Gamesa now sells more than twice as many turbines in China as it did when it was the market leader five years ago.
So as Gamesa executives see it, they made the right bet by coming to China. And they insist that they have no regrets about having trained more than 500 Chinese machinery companies as a cost of playing by Beijing's rules -- even if those rules have sometimes flouted international trade law. It is simply the table stakes of playing in the biggest game going.
''If we would not have done it, someone else would have done it,'' said Jorge Calvet, Gamesa's chairman and chief executive.
Gamesa, an old-line machinery company that entered the wind turbine business in 1994, is a modern Spanish success story.
Its factories in Pamplona and elsewhere in Spain have produced wind turbines installed around the world. With sales of $4.4 billion last year, Gamesa is the world's third-largest turbine maker, after Vestas of Denmark, the longtime global leader, and G.E.
With its relatively low Spanish labor costs, Gamesa became an early favorite a decade ago when China began buying significant numbers of imported wind turbines, as Beijing started moving toward clean energy. Gamesa also moved early and aggressively to beef up sales and maintenance organizations within China, amassing 35 percent of the market by 2005.
But Chinese officials had begun to slip new provisions into the bidding requirements for some state-run wind farms, requiring more and more of the content of turbines to be equipment produced within China -- not imported.
Those piecemeal requirements soon led to a blanket requirement. On July 4, 2005, China's top economic policy agency, the National Development and Reform Commission, declared that wind farms had to buy equipment in which at least 70 percent of the value was domestically manufactured.
''Wind farms not meeting the requirement of equipment localization rate shall not be allowed to be built,'' stated the directive, known as Notice 1204.
Trade lawyers say that setting any local content requirement -- let alone one stipulating such a high domestic share -- was a violation of the rules of the World Trade Organization, the international body that China had joined just four years earlier. Joanna I. Lewis, a Georgetown University professor who is a longtime adviser to Chinese policy makers on wind energy, said she and others had repeatedly warned Beijing that the local-content policy risked provoking a W.T.O. challenge by other countries.
But the Chinese government bet correctly that Gamesa, as well as G.E. and other multinationals, would not dare risk losing a piece of China's booming wind farm business by complaining to trade officials in their home countries.
Rather than fight, Gamesa and the other leading multinational wind turbine makers all opted to open factories in China and train local suppliers to meet the 70 percent threshold.
Mr. Calvet said Gamesa would have opened factories in China at some stage, regardless of the content policy.
''If you plan to go into a country,'' Mr. Calvet said, ''you really need to commit to a country.''
Ditlev Engel, the chief executive of Vestas, said in an interview, ''We strongly believed that for us to be competitive in China, it was very important for us to develop an Asia supplier base.''
A top executive at a rival of Gamesa and Vestas, who insisted on anonymity for fear of business retaliation by Beijing, said that multinationals had another reason for going along with China's dictates: ''Everybody was too scared.''
Local Production
There is a difference between setting up an assembly plant in a host company -- as many European wind turbine companies, including Gamesa, have done in the United States, for example -- and ceding the production of crucial parts to companies in the host country.
In the United States, where there are no local-content requirements, the wind turbine industry uses an average of 50 percent American-made parts. For its American operations, Gamesa relies somewhat more than that on American suppliers, but it still imports some parts from Spain, including crucial gearboxes.
Within weeks after Beijing's issuance of Notice 1204, Gamesa sent dozens of Spanish engineers to Tianjin. The engineers did not just oversee the construction of the assembly plant, but fanned out to local Chinese companies and began teaching them how to make a multitude of steel forgings and castings, and a range of complex electronic controls.
One Chinese supplier here became so adept at making a 10-ton steel frame that keeps a wind turbine's gearbox and generator aligned even under gale-force conditions, and making it so cheaply, that the Spanish company now ships the Chinese frame halfway around the world for turbines that Gamesa assembles at its American plant in Fairless Hills, Pa. Mr. Calvet said the American manufacturing sector had been so weakened in recent decades that for some components there were no American machinery companies readily available.
It was not until the summer of 2009, when senior Obama administration officials started looking at barriers to American clean energy exports, that the United States pressed China hard about Notice 1204. The Chinese government revoked it two months later.
But by then, the policy was no longer needed. Some Gamesa wind turbines exceeded 95 percent local content.
''The objectives of the local content requirement were achieved, and probably more achieved than anyone expected,'' said Steve Sawyer, the secretary general of the Global Wind Energy Council, a trade group based in Brussels that represents wind energy companies from around the world, including China.
A Battle Takes Shape
China agreed to abide by the W.T.O.'s trade rules when it joined the organization in 2001. And Chinese officials, when willing to comment on such matters at all, typically defend their actions as being within the bounds of fair play.
Li Junfeng, an official at the National Development and Reform Commission who oversees renewable energy policy, defended the local content policy.
''It was localization support,'' Mr. Li said in an interview. China is a developing country, he said, and developing countries need to do what they can to foster industrial development.
But the Obama administration takes a different view. It included the local content rule in the investigation it announced on Oct. 15, an inquiry into whether China's clean energy policies had violated W.T.O. rules. The investigation was spurred by the United Steelworkers union, which has no qualms about taking on Beijing because it has no sales contracts at risk in China.
Zhang Guobao, the director of China's National Energy Administration, said at an Oct. 17 press conference that the United States was wrong to cite the local content rule in its investigation -- because China had already abolished it. Mr. Zhang did have a point: the W.T.O.'s main redress for a local content protection is to push the offending country to revoke it.
But the United States investigation of China goes beyond local content, and the W.T.O. has other weapons at its disposal.
The trade organization, for example, has authority to order the repayment of subsidies a government gives to its export industries to the detriment of foreign competitors. The steelworkers' petition cites various forms of subsidies and support that China has given to its industries in potential violation of international trade rules. That includes low-interest loans from state-owned banks and grants of cheap or free land, as well as other perks not available to foreign companies operating in China.
As for the state-owned wind farms that are the main buyers of wind energy equipment, China has many policies to preserve their dominance, while limiting market opportunities for foreign companies that might try to develop wind farms.
Those policies -- all potential W.T.O. violations, according to some experts -- are an open secret.
Earlier this autumn the Chinese wind turbine maker Ming Yang Wind Power Group made an initial public offering of its shares on the New York Stock Exchange, as prelude to entering the American wind energy market. The financial disclosures in the company's prospectus acknowledged that ''we obtained land and other policy incentives from local governments,'' as well as deals requiring that the municipal governments' wind farms buy turbines only from Ming Yang.
China Looks Abroad
Gamesa, among other multinational turbine makers, so far has benefited from the growing market in China, despite policies that have increasingly relegated those companies to fighting over ever-thinner slices of the pie.
But that dynamic could be changing. The Chinese government is now slowing the approval of new wind farms at home. The pause, whose duration is unclear, is meant to give the national electricity system time to absorb thousands of new turbines that have already been erected and not yet connected to the grid.
Gamesa had an ample order book lined up before the government applied the brakes. But the government policy means that the Chinese turbine makers, having become giants on the backs of companies like Gamesa, must now look beyond their captive national market for further growth.
Sinovel, China's biggest wind turbine maker, has said it wants to become the world's largest by 2015. The company's chairman and president, Han Junliang, said in October at the annual China Wind Power industry conference in Beijing that his goal was to sell as many turbines overseas as within China.
Sinovel is among the Chinese companies now opening sales offices across the United States in preparation for a big export push next year. They are backed by more than $13 billion in low-interest loans issued this past summer by Chinese government-owned banks; billions more are being raised in initial public offerings led mainly by Morgan Stanley this autumn in New York and Hong Kong.
Multinationals are alarmed. Vestas, for example, is closing four factories in Denmark and one in Sweden, and laying off one-eighth of its 24,000-person labor force this autumn, in an effort to push its costs down closer to Asian levels, its chief, Mr. Engel, said.
The Chinese push, clouded by the Obama administration's investigation of the steelworkers' complaint, could complicate the climate change debate in the West. Wind farm developers in the West are worried that Western governments may be less enthusiastic about encouraging renewable energy requirements if these programs are perceived as creating jobs in China instead of at home.
The provincial government of Ontario in Canada now wants to take a page from China's playbook by trying to require 25 percent local content for wind energy projects and 50 percent for solar power projects in the province. The Japanese government responded by filing a W.T.O. complaint against Canada in September, asserting that Ontario was violating the W.T.O. prohibition on local content requirements. By contrast, Japan has never filed a W.T.O. complaint on any issue against China, for fear of harming diplomatic relations with its large neighbor.
Meanwhile, the Chinese government is intent on turning its wind energy industry into the global leader, helping manufacturers coordinate export strategies and providing various sorts of technical assistance.
Mr. Li, the overseer of the Chinese renewable energy industry, publicly exhorted the leaders of the nation's biggest wind turbine makers at the China Wind Power conference, a three-day event that drew hundreds of executives from around the world.
''You cannot be called a winner if you are the leader for three or five years,'' Mr. Li told the Chinese executives. ''You can only stand on the top line if you are the leader for 100 or 200 years.''
The Chinese presidents sat quietly and respectfully, chins down. Senior executives from the foreign manufacturers -- including Vestas, G.E. and Gamesa -- sat alongside them, staring straight ahead in stony silence.

HEADLINE: A Kitchen-for-Rent Is a Lifeline for the Laid-Off

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
In New York's culinary world, with its unending appetite and closet-size kitchens, it is an unimpressive building housing a seven-day-a-week, 24-hour revolving-door operation built on need, ambition and nostalgia.
Marisa Angebranndt, who lost her job at a hedge fund when Wall Street collapsed, now makes whoopie pies there.
Shefalee Patel, who had a hand in one of the most ambitious construction projects in the Middle East before being laid off, uses the space to turn out Indian sweets.
Miguel Urrego, a son of Colombian immigrants who had worked as a bartender's assistant, waiter and cook all over Manhattan, caters parties with a menu produced there that is as diverse as New Yorkers' palates: gyoza and mini-falafel; focaccia and soba noodles; bite-size burritos and croquettes. 
On a block in Long Island City, Queens, shared by car washes, plumbing parts manufacturers and livery-car garages, the three, as well as other cooks, pay by the shift to use a commercial kitchen equipped with 80-quart mixers, deep-frying caldrons and walk-in ovens, churning out food they sell on the Web and at farmers' markets and coffee shops.
The kitchen's 5,500-square-foot work space is both a refuge for dreamers and a life preserver for the unemployed.
''There are a lot of career-changers here, a lot of casual gourmets who channeled their energies into cooking as a way to make money,'' said Meg LaBarbara, a former travel consultant who makes dips and spreads at the kitchen, called the Entrepreneur's Space, on 37th Street near Northern Boulevard.
Working at a hedge fund, Ms. Angebranndt, 35, had organized meetings and retreats for high-level executives. After the fund shut down in 2008, she invested her severance pay and savings in whoopie pies, adapting her grandmother's cookie recipe and her own fillings -- no marshmallow, but a dozen flavors of butter cream.
''I started out making cakes for my friends, then I asked them to spread the word, and next thing I knew, I was cooking at home until 2 in the morning,'' Ms. Angebranndt said. ''I figured, there's less money, but also less stress and more fun.''
Ms. Patel, 32, worked as a civil engineer for Bermello Ajamil & Partners, which is based in Miami, and was involved in the development of artificial islands off the coast of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates until she was laid off last year.
The idea to make sweets to sell first occurred to her while she was still in Dubai, where she said chocolates are packaged and consumed as if they are luxury goods. Once she lost her job, she put the idea into action, cooking in her mother's kitchen in Passaic, N.J., before moving to the commercial kitchen in Queens.
It is too early to know if whoopie pies or Indian treats will be lucrative, but neither Ms. Angebranndt nor Ms. Patel is worried about that.
As Ms. Patel said, ''I haven't looked for a job since I started cooking here.''
The kitchen, rare in its approach, solves many problems. It offers cooks space they do not have at home, is fully equipped and complies with the city's health code. The place has also fostered an informal network, where cooks combine purchasing orders for things like butter and olive oil to save money, or rely on one another as taste testers.
But like many of its users, the kitchen suffered when the economy cratered. It used to function as a training ground for unionized workers, available for rental to commercial cooks at night and on weekends. Once grants and donations dried up, though, the Consortium for Worker Education, the union-backed nonprofit group that sustained it, could no longer afford to lease the space.
The kitchen was supposed to close at the end of August, but its manager, Kathrine Gregory, hatched a survival plan and enlisted the cooks to help her.
One made vegan pate. Another baked Finnish ruis bread. Ms. LaBarbara made sun-dried tomato hummus, and Ms. Angebranndt, of course, baked whoopie pies. The food was laid out before a small group of officials from the city and nonprofit groups who had gone to the kitchen to hear Ms. Gregory's pitch. They left extending a bailout package worth more than $250,000 and a $1-a-year lease agreement for the equipment.
''The way to a funder's heart,'' Ms. Gregory observed, ''is through his stomach.''
Seth Bornstein, executive director of the Queens Economic Development Corporation, which invested $100,000 in the venture, described the kitchen as ''a laboratory in taking chances.''
Had the kitchen closed, it would have displaced 100 small businesses, like Ms. Angebranndt's WannaHavaCookie, Mr. Urrego's Creative Concepts, Ms. LaBarbara's Dinners Almost Finished for You and Ms. Patel's Sweet Silk.
On a recent weekday, Tom Petty crooned from a boombox -- ''You don't have to live like a refugee'' -- as Ilale Gooden squeezed globs of chocolate cake strips and Grand Marnier liqueur to roll into truffles for her cake business, Nana Pearl's Wooden Spoon.
Nearby, Mr. Urrego, 35, shouted orders in Spanish into a cellphone cradled between his ear and shoulder as he traveled from stove to slicer to table, arranging bits of chipotle-glazed chicken and beef with chimichurri sauce onto a party platter. Trays of Gruyere and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, red grapes and strawberries, mini-burritos and quesadillas lay on a nearby cart, destined for a car dealership's office party in Midtown.
''Sorry I don't have a lot of time to talk today, but this is a busy time of the year for us,'' said Mr. Urrego, who started his catering company last year in space he leased at a bakery in Ozone Park, Queens.
At the kitchen here in Long Island City, space is rented by the shift; the most expensive is from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., which costs $231, and the cheapest is from 1 a.m. to 7:30 a.m., which costs $154. Mr. Urrego is the most regular client, taking eight or more shifts each week, often overnight.
Some of the cooks work alone, but Ms. Patel drafted her mother into the kitchen, and her sister made the packages for her concoctions. Her brother designed the company's Web site.
''It's a true family business,'' she said.
Ms. Patel creates variations of an Indian sweet called burfi, a type of fudge flavored with nuts, fruits or spices that she had watched her mother make ''a thousand times.'' She favors cardamom over curry and chili, combines coconut with dark chocolate ganache, and mixes nutmeg and apple cream or pecan and maple caramel for a distinctly American twist.
Her first order, right after she got laid off, was for 100 favor boxes for her best friend's wedding, each containing two sweets made with dates and coconut. For Diwali, the Indian festival of lights, celebrated in November, she sold 500 gift boxes. ''And,'' she said several weeks ago, ''I already have a bunch of orders for Christmas.''

HEADLINE: Espada Is Charged With Stealing From a Health Network He Controlled

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM and NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
In spring 2006, Pedro Espada Jr., then a vanquished state senator from the Bronx who oversaw a sprawling, multimillion-dollar health care network, wrote to federal authorities demanding that they investigate his chief rival.
Mr. Espada, who would return to the Senate in 2008 and lead a coup that shut it down and paralyzed state government for a month, said his rival, State Senator Ruben Diaz Sr., had misused employees of nonprofit groups that Mr. Diaz controlled for political fund-raising and campaigning.
But in the months before and after he wrote the letter, according to federal charges leveled against Mr. Espada on Tuesday, he was the one behaving badly. Indeed, the indictment portrays Mr. Espada, the departing Senate majority leader whose political career unspooled in a swirl of scandal when he lost his primary race in September, as a legislator who embezzled with abandon. 
And the schemes detailed in the indictment, which also charges his son, Pedro Gautier Espada, ranged from the extravagant to the absurd.
According to the charges, he used money from a subsidiary of the health care network, Soundview Healthcare Center, to pay for after-school tutoring for one young member of his family and to cater a birthday party for another at his home -- complete with a petting zoo, pony rides and a videographer to record it all for posterity.
Money from the same subsidiary paid for a ghostwriter to work on his personal book project and to service the air-conditioning system at his Mamaroneck home, according to the indictment. It contends that he even tried to use $49,000 for the down payment on a $125,000 Bentley, though he never bought the car because his credit application was rejected.
Prosecutors also charge that the elder Espada used a Soundview corporate American Express card to pay for personal expenses. Among the charges was more than $100,000 worth of meals for him and his family, window treatments for his home and tickets to Broadway shows and sporting events.
All in all, the six-count indictment obtained by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn charges that Mr. Espada, 57, and his son, 37, abused their positions at Soundview between 2005 and 2009 to divert more than half a million dollars from the nonprofit organization and related companies for their own benefit and the use of family members and friends.
The charges were announced by the office of the United States attorney in Brooklyn, Loretta E. Lynch; the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Internal Revenue Service; and Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo, who is the governor-elect. Mr. Cuomo's office initiated a civil inquiry and brought a lawsuit in May against Mr. Espada, his son and Soundview.
''The indictment alleges that funds that could have been, and should have been, applied to purchase medical equipment and enhance health care services for an historically underserved population were diverted by the defendants for their personal use and to benefit friends and family members,'' Ms. Lynch said in a statement. ''In these difficult economic times, the charged crimes are all the more reprehensible.''
Ms. Lynch said the investigation was continuing.
Mr. Espada, the highest ranking Hispanic lawmaker in the state, founded the health care network in 1978.
His lawyer, Susan R. Necheles, said the senator and his son denied any wrongdoing and intended to fight the charges in court.
''Soundview has provided high quality health care to thousands of families, children and senior citizens in the Bronx,'' Ms. Necheles said. ''Today is a sad day for Soundview and a sad day for the Espada family.''
In a conference call with reporters on Tuesday, Mr. Cuomo and one of his senior aides, Mitra Hormozi, who was designated as a special assistant United States attorney for the investigation, said the dollar figure in the attorney general's civil lawsuit -- $14 million -- was larger than the amount charged in the indictment because Mr. Cuomo's wide civil jurisdiction over charities under New York State law enabled his lawsuit to encompass acts for which Mr. Espada could not be charged under federal criminal law.
But if convicted, both Mr. Espada and his son, whose lawyer did not return a call seeking comment, face a maximum of 10 years in prison for each of the five counts of embezzlement, five years for the single conspiracy count and a fine of $250,000 for each count on which they are convicted.
The indictment caps a turbulent two-year term as state senator during which Mr. Espada became perhaps the most controversial lawmaker in the Capitol.
He won election in 2008 by defeating an equally scandal-plagued incumbent, Efrain Gonzalez Jr., despite accusations that he did not actually reside in the district in question and owing tens of thousands of dollars in campaign fines. Mr. Espada refused to vote with fellow Democrats until he got a committee chairmanship and other perks, yet for months refused to file election paperwork or disclose the names of the donors who had financed his campaign.
And in summer 2009, Mr. Espada, still unsatisfied, staged the coup against his own party, joining with Republicans in a bid to wrest control of the narrowly divided Senate from the Democrats. The move plunged state government into chaos for a month.
Senate Democrats elevated Mr. Espada to majority leader in exchange for his allegiance. But unbeknown to Mr. Espada, he was already under investigation by Mr. Cuomo. Emboldened by Mr. Cuomo's lawsuit this year, a coalition of labor unions and liberal activists joined together to back a primary opponent, Gustavo Rivera, and successfully ousted Mr. Espada.
The federal charges could spell the end of a quarter-century political career that is one of the more unusual and turbulent in recent New York City political history, spanning multiple investigations, repeated accusations of fraud and electoral misconduct, and seemingly incessant campaigns for office.
Since the late 1980s, Mr. Espada's name has appeared on Bronx ballots roughly a dozen times, including bids for City Council, borough president, State Assembly and State Senate -- the last a job he has held three different times in two different Bronx districts.

HEADLINE: In New York, Black and Hispanic Strongholds Become More White

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS; Griff Palmer contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Metropolitan New York is being rapidly reshaped as blacks, Latinos, Asians and immigrants surge into the suburbs, while gentrification by whites is widening the income gap in neighborhoods in Manhattan and Brooklyn, according to new census figures released on Tuesday.
Some of the largest population gains since 2000 were recorded in places that not long ago might have been considered marginal, including Bedford-Stuyvesant and Williamsburg in Brooklyn; Castle Hill and Hunts Point in the Bronx; South Jamaica in Queens; and Newark, Jersey City and Hoboken in New Jersey. Parts of those neighborhoods and cities, as well as the financial district in Lower Manhattan, registered large gains. 
The number of Hispanic residents declined in tracts in Williamsburg, Bushwick and Greenpoint, Brooklyn, and in Washington Heights, but increased in the north Bronx; Woodside and Ozone Park, Queens; and central Harlem. The black population shrunk by double digits in Brooklyn's Prospect Heights, Clinton Hill and Fort Greene, in central Harlem and in South Ozone Park, but jumped in Canarsie and Flatlands, Brooklyn, and in Springfield Gardens, Queens.
The non-Hispanic white population swelled on the Lower East Side and in Harlem, Washington Heights, Clinton Hill and Bushwick, but declined in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, and in Rego Park, Queens. Asians increased in Forest Hills and Flushing, Queens, and in Bensonhurst.
Diverse racial, ethnic and immigrant enclaves have proliferated in New York City and especially its suburbs since 2000, but that increase generated only negligible inroads against historic patterns of racial segregation, according to analyses of the new data. Most whites in the metropolitan area and most blacks in the city still live where a majority of their neighbors are of the same race.
The latest figures are the single largest data release in the Census Bureau's history, providing a look for the first time since 2000 at a variety of characteristics, including income, race, immigration and commuting habits for people in areas as small as just a few square blocks. Based on samples taken from 2005 to 2009, the five-year American Community Survey is separate from the 2009 survey, which probably better reflects the full impact of the recession, and from the 2010 Census, which is supposed to count people at every address.
Since 2000, decades of white flight eased and the proportion of non-Hispanic white New Yorkers increased slightly, to 35.5 percent. So did New York City's proportion of Hispanic residents, to just over 27 percent. The proportion of blacks declined by a percentage point, to 23.3 percent, and the share of Asian residents rose by almost two percentage points, to nearly 12 percent.
For the first time since the 1970s, fully half of Manhattan's population is non-Hispanic white. The borough is 24 percent Hispanic, 14 percent black and 11 percent Asian.
The number of non-Hispanic whites has increased in three other counties in the area since 2000: Brooklyn, and Middlesex and Ocean in New Jersey.
New York City's foreign-born population remained fairly constant since 2000, about 36 percent. Three of the nine counties in the country where people born abroad made up one-third or more of the population are in New York or the surrounding area: Queens (47 percent, second to Miami-Dade, with 49 percent), Brooklyn (37 percent) and Hudson (40 percent) in New Jersey.
Hispanics are now the majority population in the Bronx, though Puerto Ricans, who were once dominant, have lost numbers, while the populations of Dominicans and Mexicans have risen.
Gentrification decreased the number of non-English speakers in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, while Chinese and Hispanic immigrants swelled the proportion of people who do not speak English at home in the southern portion of Staten Island.
Since 2000, the Dominican Republic, China and Mexico have sent the most people to New York. There have also been large influxes from Bangladesh and Pakistan, as well as from Ghana and elsewhere in the sub-Saharan region of Africa.
But many of the biggest gains in diversity were in the suburbs, generated by newly arrived Hispanic and Asian immigrants, and their American-born children. Their population increased in every county, typically clustered in ethnically or racially monolithic communities. Big percentage gains were recorded in places as far-flung as Ramapo and Huntington in New York; New Haven and Meriden, Conn.; and Jackson Township and Camden, N.J.
Spurred by a surge in people from Latin America, the Caribbean and Asia, foreign-born residents exceeded 60 percent of the population in Palisades Park and West New York, N.J.; 50 percent in Fairview, Guttenberg, Harrison and Union City, N.J.; 40 percent in Bergenfield, Cliffside Park, Elizabeth, Fort Lee, North Bergen, Passaic, Ridgefield and Teterboro, N.J.; and Bellerose Terrace, Elmont, Hillcrest, New Cassel, Port Chester, Sleepy Hollow, South Floral Park and Spring Valley in the Westchester, Rockland and Long Island suburbs. An influx of Jamaicans helped push the foreign-born population in Blue Hills, Conn., near Hartford, to more than 40 percent.
In the entire nation, residents of only four counties took 40 minutes or more to get to work: the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island, where, at 42.5 minutes, mean travel time was highest. (The lowest was 3.4 minutes in agricultural King County, Tex.) Manhattan, with 58 percent, was one of 17 counties in the country in which more than half of the residents over 25 had a bachelor's degree or higher.
Despite progress in the last decades of the 20th century, among the 100 largest metropolitan areas, New York stands third, behind Milwaukee and Detroit, on an index of black segregation compiled by William H. Frey, a Brookings Institution demographer.
Dr. Frey and Profs. John Iceland of Pennsylvania State University and John R. Logan of Brown University found persistent patterns of residential segregation in metropolitan areas around the nation that were repeated in New York.
In 2000, on average, a black suburbanite lived in a neighborhood that was 47 percent black. In 2005-9, that neighborhood would have been 44 percent black, the analysts found.
In 1970, whites in the metropolitan area were likely to live in a neighborhood that was 92 percent white, a figure that declined to 76 percent in 2000, and to 73 percent in 2005-9.
''New York is among a group of metropolitan regions,'' Professor Logan said, ''where the Great Migration created large black ghettos, and where very high levels of segregation have proved very resistant to change.''

HEADLINE: Immigrants Make Paths To Suburbia, Not Cities

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE and ROBERT GEBELOFF; Sabrina Tavernise reported from Washington, and Robert Gebeloff from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Immigrants fanned out across the United States in the last decade, settling in greater numbers in small towns and suburbs rather than in the cities where they typically moved when they first came to this country, new census data show.
Following jobs to rural and suburban areas, in industries like construction and the food business, immigrant populations rose more than 60 percent in places where immigrants made up fewer than 5 percent of the population in 2000. In areas that had been home to the most immigrants, the foreign-born population was flat over that period. 
In Los Angeles County, long a major destination for new immigrants, the foreign-born population remained largely unchanged for the first time in several decades. In contrast, it quadrupled in Newton County, in central Georgia outside Atlanta.
Tuesday's report represented the biggest single data release in the Census Bureau's history, with more than 11 billion individual estimates for 670,000 specific geographic locations -- areas as small as several blocks.
Unlike the 2010 decennial census, which counts every American, Tuesday's survey, the American Community Survey, details characteristics using samples taken from about one in 10 Americans between 2005 and 2009.
They show a portrait of a rapidly changing America, whose young population is much more diverse than its older one.
About 48 percent of newborns last year were members of minority groups, compared with just a fifth of those over 65, a statistic that raises questions about possible generational tensions for the United States in coming decades, particularly over the cost of education and health care, said Kenneth Johnson, senior demographer at the Carsey Institute at the University of New Hampshire.
It also foreshadows a growing divide: Graduation rates for blacks and Hispanics -- the overwhelming majority of all immigrants in the United States -- are far below those for whites. The trend line therefore suggests that the country will be facing a growing shortage of educated Americans as global competition intensifies, particularly as other countries' graduation levels rise.
In the last large immigration wave, in the late 19th century, immigrants took several generations to assimilate into American society through education. But the United States cannot afford to wait that long as its declining economy struggles to compete with developing countries like China, said Marcelo M. Suarez-Orozco, co-director of an immigration research center at New York University.
''Today we have two elevators,'' he said. ''One stuck in the basement and the other moving up faster than it ever has before.''
''It is placing us at a huge disadvantage,'' Professor Suarez-Orozco added.
The spreading of immigrants throughout the United States reflects their mobility in the work force, particularly because of the booming housing industry last decade.
Roberto Suro, author of ''Strangers Among Us: Latino Lives in a Changing America,'' estimated that several years ago, before the housing bubble burst, one out of every three newly arrived Hispanic immigrants was working in construction.
These workers were joined by their families, and communities that had never encountered immigrants in large numbers suddenly saw large influxes. Friction often followed.
Stafford County, Va., for example, where residents have demanded a crackdown on illegal immigrants, saw its immigrant population nearly triple.
''It was a kind of deficit spending, borrowing against the future in very human terms,'' said Mr. Suro, a former reporter for The New York Times and The Washington Post. ''The leveraged asset was the work of the immigrants. The long-term payout was the social requirement to settle them and look after their children.''
The country's biggest population gains were in suburban areas. But, in a departure from past decades when whites led the rise, now it is because of minorities. More than a third of all 13.3 million new suburbanites were Hispanic, compared with 2.5 million blacks and 2 million Asians. In all, whites accounted for a fifth of suburban growth.
Even in rural America, where the population grew the slowest -- just 2 percent since 2000 compared with 7 percent nationwide -- foreign-born residents accounted for 37 percent of that growth. Three-quarters of them were not citizens, suggesting that they had arrived only recently in the states.
Demographers did not agree on what the new data said about segregation trends.
William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution, said his analysis of the data showed a decline in racial segregation in 61 of the top 100 metro areas.
One example is New Orleans, where segregation has declined noticeably, probably because blacks from segregated areas left the city after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Black segregation is still higher than it is for Asians and Hispanics in the United States.
''Nationally we are moving to greater integration,'' Mr. Frey said.
A study by John R. Logan, a demographer at Brown University, and Brian J. Stults, a demographer at Florida State University, came to different conclusions by looking closely at neighborhoods of between 3,000 and 5,000 people. They concluded that black segregation had changed little from 2000 in the metropolitan areas, and had actually increased in areas where blacks are a smaller share of population.
The data also showed an increasingly pinched middle class. Median income declined by almost 5 percent in the past decade, with a few exceptions, including Maryland, Rhode Island and Wyoming. The deterioration was worse in counties dependent on manufacturing, where income dropped by 9 percent.
Of the five counties with poverty rates higher than 39 percent, four contain or are in American Indian reservations in South Dakota. The fifth, Willacy County, Tex., is in the Rio Grande Valley.
The Washington suburbs were home to some of the most affluent, educated people in America. The three places in the country with the highest median household income are all in Virginia -- Falls Church, and the counties of Fairfax and Loudoun. Seven of the 17 counties where more than half of people 25 and older had a bachelor's degree were in Washington's suburbs.
There were 62 counties where fewer than 10 percent of the adult population had a bachelor's degree. Fourteen of these counties were in Georgia, nine in Tennessee, eight in Kentucky and five each in Florida and West Virginia.
The county with the lowest median home values for owner-occupied housing units was Reeves in Texas, at $29,400. The county with the highest median home values was Nantucket, Mass., at more than $1 million.

GRAPHIC: MAPS: Where New Immigrants Have Settled: More immigrants in the last decade have settled in suburbs and small cities than in urban centers, which had attracted many of their predecessors. The growth of immigrants was most pronounced in counties where immigrants had comprised less than 5 percent of the population in 2000.
Most Household Incomes Shrank ...: Incomes fell in about three-quarters of the nation's counties, especially in Michigan, where most incomes dropped 10 percent or more, and the Southeast. Still, some states, like Texas, Wyoming and the Dakotas, saw pockets of income growth.
... While Most Money Remained in Cities: Virginia has the three counties with the nation's highest median household incomes, all surrounding Washington, D.C., while more than 20 percent of the nation's counties, mostly rural, have median incomes less than $30,000.

HEADLINE: A Plan to Save the San Francisco Bay Delta Falters

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- A high-stakes effort to remake the San Francisco Bay Delta, the West Coast's largest estuary, is looking as fragile as the degraded delta itself these days.
Four years into the effort, the distance between competing water constituencies has only been widening as self-imposed deadlines come and go.
Farmers and cities in Southern California are pressing for a return to the abundant supply of water delivered through the 1,000-square-mile delta before a drought and legal rulings to protect endangered fish led to constraints two years ago. Environmentalists want ironclad guarantees that threatened fish like the minnow-size delta smelt will not be wiped out for want of water.
The Bay Delta Conservation Plan, a federal and state initiative, would re-engineer the delta to make it safe for native species and would establish a framework for water distribution for the next 50 years. The delta, where California's two largest rivers come together, supplies about one-quarter of the freshwater used by about 23 million Californians. 
The goals of the plan are to keep vegetables and fruit trees growing in the Central Valley, taps running in Southern California and native fish swimming in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers and in the briny western reaches of the delta, which the rivers feed and give it its formal name.
But the Westlands Water District, which serves some of the wealthiest and most powerful agricultural interests, has pulled out of the negotiations, saying it doubts it will get the water deliveries it had expected.
''The original purpose was to restore our water supply,'' said Tom Birmingham, the general manager of the district, which snakes along the western edge of the Central Valley and serves 600 farms, according to its Web site.
The route the water takes is not without risks. Because of 160 years of farming and the construction of 1,100 miles of levees, delta lands have sunk and are now 3 to 20 feet below sea level. Mindful of how Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans in 2005, planners are also focusing on the possibility that a big earthquake or storm could break crucial levees and allow saltwater from the bay to inundate the delta, which could shut off a large source of the freshwater supply for months.
Among the proposed solutions to the environmental and engineering issues is a $13 billion tunnel that would tap into the Sacramento River farther upstream and divert water around the delta. The tunnel, which could be 33 feet in diameter and 33 miles long, would be designed to be more resilient to earthquakes. It could also eliminate the springtime problem of newly hatched young smelt being sucked into giant pumps south of the delta that pull the river water into the distribution system.
Another proposal calls for a canal system to serve the same purpose. And a third calls for installing gates to isolate one of the northernmost channels of the San Joaquin River, setting aside a permanent habitat for fish.
Both Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, and the incoming Democratic governor, Jerry Brown, support the twin goals of making the supply of water running through the delta reliable and protecting the species that have dwindled.
As Spreck Rosekrans, a delta expert for the Environmental Defense Fund, said, ''The reliability of our water systems is key to California's economy.''
But Mr. Birmingham said that no agency contracting for water from federal or state projects ''is going to spend billions of dollars on the implementation of a program that isn't going to provide benefits to them.''
While he did not specify what water deliveries would be adequate, Mr. Birmingham and other Westlands officials had expressed comfort with the option most closely studied, which could ensure that the district gets more than 70 percent of the maximum flows that it contracts for.
In 2009, that flow was reduced to 10 percent of the contracted amount; a political outcry ensued.
The district originally joined in the conservation effort partly to win exemptions from some provisions of the Endangered Species Act. The premise is that helping to create or restore habitat for a species can outweigh the harm imposed by another activity -- in this case, transporting water south through the federal and state systems.
The precise relationship between flows of river water and fish mortality is not clear. Still, environmentalists and fishermen note that the years of abundant water for farmers and Southern California cities corresponded to years when fish populations crashed -- in the case of the smelt, almost to the vanishing point. (Judge Oliver W. Wanger of Federal District Court ruled Tuesday that the 2008 federal plan to protect the smelt was critically flawed and sent it back to the Fish and Wildlife Service for reconsideration.)
The work on the Bay Delta Conservation Plan had nonetheless been moving in a direction favorable to Westlands interests for much of the past year, with most of the attention devoted to a set of flow-related criteria that would assure the district of supplies they considered sufficient.
Then, federal and state biologists reported in September that those criteria could deprive the smelt of crucial water flow.
In November, David Hayes, the Interior Department's No. 2 official, made it clear that the finding meant that other formulas, which would probably mean less water for farmers, would have to be studied as well. Westlands officials were furious.
''We were sold a bill of goods once again by the federal government,'' said Westland's president, Jean Sagouspe. In an interview, he said the scientific process had been ''politicized,'' and he went so far as to call Mr. Hayes a ''liar.''
Mr. Sagouspe predicted that the loss of Westlands financial support, which has covered more than a third of the planning costs so far, would doom the project. ''Nothing will get built if we're out,'' he said.
In an interview, Mr. Hayes played down the district's move. ''I would turn my attention not to talking to them but to continuing the work we're doing,'' he said, adding that the other major water users are ''still at the table.''
New actions and announcements from both state and federal officials are possible at any moment.
By agreement and by state law, Westlands had been sharing the cost of the plans with the Kern County Water Agency, which represents wealthy farmers and investors and growing communities to the west of the southern Sierra Nevada, and with the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. These two agencies might now have to bear future costs with only the help of whatever money can come from the financially squeezed state and federal agencies.
So far the planning costs are expected to exceed $226 million, however, and more than half of that has already been spent.
''The costs go up significantly if major parties are dropping out,'' said Jeff Kightlinger, the chief executive of the Southern California district. ''While we have not been necessarily as vocal as Westlands, we share the same frustrations.''
If the planning process falls apart, Mr. Kightlinger said, the water users might ''limp along without a big grand fix but a number of patches.''
Environmentalists warn that inaction on the delta ecosystem could imperil aquatic life. At the same time, many acknowledge the need for a solution that also adequately addresses the needs of farms and cities.
''The theatrics of people leaving the negotiating table is just that, it's theatric,'' said Jon Rosenfield, a biologist with the nonprofit Bay Institute and a member of the restoration plan's steering committee.
''There has to be a conservation and restoration plan for the delta,'' Mr. Rosenfield said, ''that improves the status of the species and provides better water supply reliability for the water users.''

HEADLINE: Unlocking a Grip on Rare Earths

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- The United States is too reliant on China for minerals crucial to new clean energy technologies, making the American economy vulnerable to shortages of materials needed for a range of green products -- from compact fluorescent light bulbs to electric cars to giant wind turbines.
So warns a detailed report to be released on Wednesday morning by the United States Energy Department. The report, which predicts that it could take 15 years to break American dependence on Chinese supplies, calls for the nation to increase research and expand diplomatic contacts to find alternative sources, and to develop ways to recycle the minerals or replace them with other materials.
At least 96 percent of the most crucial types of the so-called rare earth minerals are now produced in China, and Beijing has wielded various export controls to limit the minerals' supply to other countries while favoring its own manufacturers that use them. 
''The availability of a number of these materials is at risk due to their location, vulnerability to supply disruptions and lack of suitable substitutes,'' the report says, which also mentions some concerns about a few other minerals imported from elsewhere, such as cobalt from the Congo.
The Energy Department report is being released the same morning that cabinet officials from China and the United States will meet in Washington to discuss economic and commercial issues.
While no detailed agenda has been released, the talks are expected to include American objections to China's tightening restrictions on rare earth exports -- like a two-month halt this autumn on shipments to Japan, and a shorter-lived slowdown of exports to the United States and Europe.
And on Tuesday, China's finance ministry announced on its Web site, and the official Xinhua news agency later reported as well, that China plans to increase its export taxes on some rare earths next year. The ministry did not say how much the taxes would increase. Although World Trade Organization rules ban export taxes, China has imposed them on rare earths for the last four years.
David Sandalow, the assistant secretary of energy for policy and international affairs, who oversaw preparation of the Energy Department report, said in a telephone interview that the timing of the report's release and the American-China cabinet meetings was coincidental.
But the report reflects an emerging view within the American government that domestic sources of rare earths are needed, in addition to suppliers in many other countries, to ensure the viability of clean energy manufacturing in the United States.
''We can build a new industry and put our clean energy future on a sound footing, creating many new jobs in the process,'' Mr. Sandalow said.
Still, the report presents a fairly gloomy assessment of the United States' ability to wean itself from Chinese imports. For as long as the next 15 years, the supplies of at least five minerals that come almost exclusively from China will remain as vulnerable to disruption as they are absolutely vital to the manufacture of small yet powerful electric motors, energy-efficient compact fluorescent bulbs and other clean energy technologies, the report said.
The five minerals are medium and heavy rare earth elements of which China mines an estimated 96 percent to 99.8 percent of the world's supply: dysprosium, terbium, neodymium, europium and yttrium.
China also increasingly dominates the manufacture of clean energy technologies that require such minerals, including the production of million-dollar wind turbines. Chinese export restrictions have added up to $40 a pound to world prices, which makes a big difference particularly for some of the less expensive rare earths, like lanthanum, that sell for several dollars a pound in China.
That is among the reasons, along with cheap labor and extensive Chinese government subsidies, that many clean energy manufacturers have found it cheaper to shift production to China.
Mr. Sandalow said that wind turbine manufacturers were capable of building very large turbines without rare earths. But using rare earths could reduce the per megawatt cost of wind energy and improve its competitiveness through savings on other materials, like steel and copper.
He cautioned that the United States had been putting far fewer resources than China into exploring ways to use the powerful magnetic and other properties of rare earths.
''There are thousands of rare earth researchers in China and dozens in the United States, and that underscores both the challenge and the opportunity,'' he said. ''Their expertise in this area is significant.''
China's finance ministry, in announcing plans to raise export taxes on some rare earths, did not indicate which minerals might be affected.
Since 2006, China has imposed an export tax of 15 percent on light rare earths like lanthanum and cerium, which are needed for oil refining and glass manufacturing, and 25 percent on heavy rare earths like dysprosium and terbium.
China mines about 92 percent of the world's light rare earths.
Dysprosium, which helps rare earth magnets preserve their magnetism at high temperatures, is mined almost exclusively in southern China and sells for $95 a pound in China and $135 a pound outside, including the export tax.
Dysprosium has emerged as the mineral most vital to clean energy industries yet most vulnerable to supply disruptions, the report said.
Dudley Kingsnorth, a prominent rare earth mining consultant in Perth, Australia, said he agreed that a dysprosium shortage was likely. He added that he expected that a rare earth shortage would slow the overall adoption of new rare earth technologies by clean energy industries for at least the next five years.
American and Japanese officials have said that they might file a legal challenge at the World Trade Organization to China's taxes on rare earth exports, as well as on quotas that China imposes on rare earth exports.
Until this autumn, Chinese officials had portrayed their rare earth policies as an effort to force high-tech companies to move their factories to China and retain supplies for domestic industries. The Chinese government has recently shifted to describing the export restrictions as an environmental measure, noting that extracting and processing the minerals can be a highly toxic process that has also resulted in leaks of radioactive mining waste into the groundwater in northern China.
But while W.T.O. rules allow export restrictions for environmental reasons, that is only if a country also restricts domestic consumption, which China has not done.
Demand for rare earths and China's virtual chokehold on supplies have prompted some overseas companies to enter, or re-enter, the field.
Molycorp, an American company that in August made an initial public offering of its shares on the New York Stock Exchange, plans to open in 2012 a large rare earth mine at Mountain Pass, Calif., that closed in 2002 after prices were undercut by Chinese competitors. Molycorp announced on Monday that it had received the last of the construction permits needed to proceed.
The Lynas Corporation of Australia plans to open at the end of next year a large rare earths mine at Mount Weld, Australia.
But both the Molycorp and Lynas mines will produce mostly light rare earths and relatively little of the medium and heavy rare earths needed for magnets and other significant clean energy applications.
Dozens of small mining companies hope to open new mines in the United States and elsewhere that could tap reserves of medium and heavy rare earths. But these small companies face formidable legal, financial, marketing and management obstacles, the Energy Department report said.

HEADLINE: The Real Estate Collapse? It'll Be in the Final

BYLINE: By JULIE SATOW

 BODY:
In 2008, when most Americans were fleeing the real estate market, David Mann was charging toward it. After selling a clothing manufacturing company in Manhattan that he had helped run, Mr. Mann, 32, decided to pursue a master's degree in real estate development.
Last May he graduated from the Schack Institute of Real Estate at New York University and after an eight-and-a-half-month search, he finally landed a job.
''It took months of looking every day and applying to 300 positions, but I have finally found my dream job,'' said Mr. Mann, who will be the project manager of a condominium development in Park Slope, Brooklyn.
In recent years, the real estate industry's reputation has faltered as it shoulders much of the blame for causing the deepest recession in decades. Despite this drubbing, and the fact that jobs are still hard to come by, students like Mr. Mann are flocking to master's programs in real estate, where the recession is seen as a teaching tool and a rich source of case studies. 
Mr. Mann chose real estate at the suggestion of several childhood friends who worked in the industry. ''It seemed like a smart move,'' he said. And despite the subsequent long job search, he added, ''it couldn't have been a more interesting time to be in school. Every day the professors were trying to understand this new reality and share their insights with us. We were completely green and ignorant, and in some respects, so were they.''
For students considering a master's in real estate, there are programs like the Schack Institute, mostly run out of schools of continuing education, where many students work full time and complete their coursework over a number of years. Several universities also offer intensive, full-time programs that vary in length from one to two years.
Though relatively new, the master's degree in real estate is seen by employers as a viable alternative to an M.B.A., said James D. Kuhn, president of the real estate service company Newmark Knight Frank and the chairman of the advisory board at the Schack Institute. ''It used to be that the only alternative was getting an M.B.A.,'' Mr. Kuhn said, ''but around 1995, with the advent of real estate investment trusts and debt securitizations, academic institutions began taking real estate more seriously.''
In a recession, many graduate schools report an uptick in applications as professionals who have lost jobs look to polish their resumes while they wait a return to the work force.
That trend is especially true in real estate, because of the industry's boom and bust nature. ''Students are very aware that real estate is a cyclical industry,'' said David Funk, the director of the Program in Real Estate at Cornell University. ''If they get the degree now and bolster their skills, they will graduate just in time to take advantage of a rebounding market.''
That was the strategy behind Chaeri Kim's decision to enter the Schack Institute. ''By the time I graduate in the spring, the market will be ready to start hiring,'' said Ms. Kim, who is 28 and a native of South Korea. She was pursuing a degree in architecture before deciding she would have a better chance finding work as a developer.
One indication of rising interest among students is an increase in acceptance yields -- the percentage of applicants accepted into a program who choose to enroll. At the School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation at Columbia, which offers a master's degree in real estate development, this year was a record applicant-yield pool, said Vishaan Chakrabarti, the director of the real estate development program. In fact, the one-year program has begun accepting fewer students in expectation that a greater percentage of accepted students will choose to attend.
''It is extremely competitive,'' said Mr. Chakrabarti, who left his position as an executive vice president of design and planning at the Related Companies 18 months ago to lead the Columbia program. Of the 94 students who graduated in May, 87 percent are now employed, he said.
Mindful of the real world, professors are integrating the recent market crash into curriculums. Christian L. Redfearn, an associate professor at the University of Southern California and the director of the graduate programs in real estate there, said there was a renewed emphasis on fundamentals.
''In the middle of the bubble, students kept wondering why they had to do all this research when it was so simple to flip a property for a profit,'' Professor Redfearn said. ''Now, it is much more fun to teach because not only are there all these great case studies to learn from, but the students are far more interested in understanding the basics.''
Hugh Kelly, a clinical associate professor of real estate at the Schack Institute, agreed with that assessment. ''In easier times,'' he said, ''students were satisfied with just learning the techniques -- what math or which software programs do they need to impress an employer?'' Now, he said, they want to learn how to make good judgments.
At Cornell, Mr. Funk said, ''we don't want our curriculum swinging rapidly to cover the issues du jour, so we are offering short intensives that focus on contemporary trends,'' adding that classes that teach asset allocations are also popular.
And the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which established its Center for Real Estate in 1983, is placing a greater emphasis on ''the role of systemic phenomena, things that reach beyond any one industry or asset class and put the whole system on an unsustainable path,'' said David Geltner, director of M.I.T.'s master's program in real estate development and the director of research at the Center for Real Estate. In other words, teaching what can go wrong.
The students now in graduate real estate courses have more experience and higher test scores than their predecessors, several institutions have found.
At the University of Southern California program, the average work experience of students has jumped to 6.6 years in 2010, compared with five years in 2003. In the last seven years, its acceptance yield has topped 70 percent from just 55 percent, while in the same period the Graduate Management Admission Test, or GMAT, test scores now average 652 compared with 630.
''In the last two years, the quality of our students has been the highest we have ever had,'' Professor Redfearn said. ''A lot of people who were entering real estate to make a quick buck have left, and those who remain in the field are deeply committed.''
A number of universities are following N.Y.U.'s lead and have begun offering real estate degrees at their schools for continuing education. Georgetown University began offering a master's of professional studies in real estate as part of its School of Continuing Studies in 2008. ''I'd say graduate degrees may be one of the fastest-growing areas of the real estate market right now,'' said Charles Schilke, the associate dean for the program.
But not every program has escaped the downturn unscathed. At M.I.T., class size has dropped precipitously. Before 2009, classes were generally 35 students a year, but last year it plummeted to just 14 students. This year, that figure is back up to the mid-20s, Professor Geltner said. Reasons for that drop-off, he said, included the high cost of tuition, a lack of financial aid and the inability of many students to take time off from work in such uncertain economic times. While the cost, at $58,780 for the 2010-11 academic year, is roughly in line with the other private degree programs, ''alas, I believe we don't have nearly as much financial aid available'' to help defray the cost, Professor Geltner said.

HEADLINE: Westerly, R.I., Waits for Its Development Angel

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

 BODY:
WESTERLY, R.I. -- The mutual fund investor Charles M. Royce has spent millions buying and redeveloping properties in this waterfront town on the Connecticut border -- his way, associates say, of strengthening a community where he has summered for many years. His biggest venture by far is Ocean House, a $140 million hotel, resort and condominium that opened last summer in the moneyed enclave of Watch Hill.
But in Westerly's historic downtown, where Mr. Royce controls more than a dozen properties, many of them vacant, redevelopment plans that have been vaguely outlined over the last several years have only grown more hazy. Residents frustrated by what they call a lack of progress are wondering whether anything will happen at all and worrying about the impact on surrounding businesses. 
''He has a right to do whatever he wants with his property,'' said Randall Saunders, a Westerly native and the owner of a clothing shop in Watch Hill. ''What I don't like is making all these promises and then five, six years go by and nothing's happened.''
The Ocean House alone was a formidable undertaking for Mr. Royce, who runs Royce & Associates, a mutual fund company in Manhattan. The sunny yellow resort, on a bluff not far from his oceanfront residence, is modeled after a Gilded Age hotel of the same name that stood on the site for more than 130 years. After buying it for $11.5 million in 2005, Mr. Royce and his investment partners planned to restore it, but experts advised against it. Mr. Royce ordered a close replica from Centerbrook Architects, on an even grander scale.
Ocean House opened last summer, with peak-season room rates starting around $500 a night. ''From our standpoint, it's almost too good to be true,'' said Charles E. Vacca, town assessor. Assessed at $71 million, it is Westerly's biggest taxpayer, paying some $670,000 in property taxes per year.
Mr. Royce's real estate company, W. H. Properties, has acquired at least a dozen small commercial properties. And his family foundation, Royce Family Fund, financed the purchase of nine more through the Westerly Land Trust. Most of the properties are downtown, a compact municipal center on the Pawcatuck River with many late 19th- and early 20th-century buildings.
Mr. Royce, 71, did not respond to requests for an interview. He had previously described a desire to refashion the river frontage along Main Street to create a more attractive gateway into downtown, with a riverfront boardwalk, shops and upper-floor residences. The area has been dominated by auto service shops and strip plazas for years.
W. H. Properties owns at least six properties on Main Street, and the Westerly Land Trust an additional four. According to the trust's tax returns, the foundation has provided the trust with more than $5 million in interest-free loans for property acquisitions. Some of the properties may be resold, while others may be retained or transferred to another nonprofit entity, according to Harvey C. Perry II, the trust's president. The Royce family fund is paying operating expenses.
The trust's other properties, bought from 2005-8, include three largely vacant landmark structures: the former United Theater, built in 1928; a Montgomery Ward store; and the granite-face Industrial Trust bank, which dates to 1880. The trust also owns the building that houses the Knickerbocker Cafe, a once-hallowed blues venue that was revived with Mr. Royce's help. Local investors own the business.
Without a single chain store, Mr. Perry said, ''downtown Westerly has the real potential to be an authentic, old New England village. Unfortunately, right now we have a lot of empty storefronts, and businesses struggle.''
Mr. Royce and his wife, Deborah, have a record in redevelopment. In Stamford, Conn., they restored the 1930s-era Avon Theater as a nonprofit art house cinema. And in Tannersville, N.Y., their family fund backs the Hunter Foundation's purchase and renovation of vacant village properties, one of which houses an Adirondack-style lodge.
In Westerly, the land trust is the public face of their revitalization efforts. Last year, the trust unveiled a plan to renovate the United Theater and Montgomery Ward buildings into an arts complex. But the project has stalled -- the only obvious change is a new storefront occupied by an artists' cooperative gallery. Mr. Perry said bids would soon be solicited for part of the project.
News this year that Mr. Royce stepped in to help rescue another redevelopment project, this one a historic inn in the beachfront community of Weekapaug, has caused some business owners here to question his commitment to downtown.
''Before you start a new project, it only seems logical that you would finish the first one,'' said Carrie Baird, a shoe store owner. ''He's scooping up all this property downtown, but we never see him, ever.''
Business owners have been kept in the dark, said Joseph Pellegrino, a co-owner of the Van Ghent Cafe and the president of the Westerly-Pawcatuck Downtown Business Association. (Pawcatuck is the community on the Connecticut side of the river.)
''He's a powerful man, and he can buy up anything he wants,'' Mr. Pellegrino said. ''What scares me is when he buys these properties and nothing gets done. I just hate to see it go any worse.''
Land trust and town officials say plans for downtown were slowed by the poor economy and costs associated with the Ocean House. The resort was more expensive than originally projected and opened in a difficult economic climate. Of 23 planned condominiums, five have sold, according to land records.
Now, aware of local frustrations, the land trust has decided to move ahead with downtown planning on its own. With the help of a $60,000 grant from Rhode Island Housing, a group that promotes affordable housing and community development, the trust will hold community sessions to bring the public into the discussion. The trust hopes to tap some state financing to get a project or two off the ground. But it is also possible that Mr. Royce, who is ''totally supportive,'' will eventually buy into the plan, said William McKendree, the land trust's vice president.
''If he sees a community getting excited about an idea,'' Mr. McKendree added, ''he's the first one to jump in and make it happen.''

HEADLINE: A Rent Spike Looms at Stuyvesant Town

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Thousands of tenants at Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village will face a potential spike in rents and more uncertainty over the future when a year-old accord expires Wednesday, ending a period of calm at the financially troubled complexes in Manhattan.
The agreement followed a 2009 Court of Appeals ruling that the owners of the complexes had wrongfully deregulated about 4,400 apartments and raised their rents while receiving special tax breaks from the city. Under the accord, the owners agreed to temporarily reduce rents in those apartments, but since then, the two sides have been unable to bridge their differences. 
At issue are the new legal rents that should be charged for those apartments and the amount of money the landlord must repay tenants for past overcharges, according to two executives who were briefed on the talks but insisted on anonymity because of strict confidentiality agreements. In court papers, the tenants estimated that the owner owed current and former tenants more than $200 million in rent rebates.
The closely watched case has thrilled tenant advocates throughout the city and stunned landlords who may also have improperly raised rents and deregulated apartments while receiving special tax breaks. But the full implications of the decision remain ambiguous.
The expiration of the accord, or interim agreement, at Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village will throw the issues back into the courtroom of Justice Richard B. Lowe III of State Supreme Court, who is overseeing the case.
At the same time, the company that controls the complexes, CW Capital, is expected to raise rents for the 4,400 apartments that were improperly deregulated. The question is, by how much? Under current rent guidelines, landlords may raise rents by 2.25 percent for a one-year renewal and by 4.5 percent for two years. But, the executives said, CW Capital may raise the rents even higher, to what they believe are the legal limits for the units.
''It is unfortunate that the parties were not able to reach an agreement before their deadline, but it is important to the community that they continue to negotiate in good faith,'' said Daniel R. Garodnick, a city councilman who lives in Peter Cooper Village. ''This should not be viewed as an opportunity by CW Capital to raise rents beyond what is allowed by rent stabilization. The tenants are now protected by the law, and they deserve to see a fair recovery.''
Mr. Garodnick and the tenant association at the complexes are eager to see CW Capital resolve the court case so that they can begin serious talks with the company about the possibility of a co-operative or condominium conversion that would allow the complexes' 25,000 residents to buy their apartments at a discount, or remain as rent-regulated tenants.
Gregory Cross, a lawyer for CW Capital, did not return calls requesting comment. Nor did Alexander H. Schmidt, a lawyer for the tenants.
Beyond the question of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, tenant advocates and landlords in the city are girding for what promises to be a noisy battle in the Legislature next year over the court decision and the laws governing rent regulation, which are up for renewal. Advocates for tenants expect landlords to lobby for legislation that would effectively overturn the Stuyvesant Town court decision, known as Roberts v. Tishman Speyer Properties.
Michael McKee, a board member of the Tenants Political Action Committee, said, ''I suspect landlords are stalling, hoping that they can undo Roberts in June as the price of extending the rent regulation laws.''
In 2006, Tishman Speyer and BlackRock Realty bought Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village for $5.4 billion in the biggest deal in real estate history. Like other investors during the real estate boom, the firms planned to replace tenants with rent-regulated apartments with tenants paying substantially higher, market-rate rents. Unable to convert enough units at Stuyvesant Town before the recession hit and they ran out of money, the two partners defaulted in January and handed the properties to their lenders, represented by CW Capital.
After the court ruling, landlords said the decision could affect as many as 80,000 apartments.
Some real estate investors have shied away from buying buildings that received similar tax breaks, because it is unclear what their legal rent rolls should be. But there has not been an avalanche of lawsuits from tenants.
Indeed, there were 70 fewer overcharge complaints filed with the New York State Homes and Community Renewal in the year since the court decision than in the year before, according to James Plastiras, a spokesman for the housing agency. The Stuyvesant Town decision did spawn tenant lawsuits at about a dozen complexes with more than 4,500 apartments, all but one (Parker Towers in Queens) in Manhattan, according to lawyers involved in the cases.

HEADLINE: Sidestepping the U.S. Dollar, a Russian Exchange Will Swap Rubles and Renminbi

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- Russia and China are poised to take a small but symbolic step in their expanding economic relationship, a move that in the long term could make the dollar less relevant to business between the two nations.
On Wednesday, a Moscow securities exchange is scheduled to open direct trading between the Chinese currency, the renminbi, and the Russian ruble. If the market develops, it could eventually cut the dollar out of a portion of Russian and Chinese trade.
Although China's business with Russia is only a sliver of what it does with the United States, there is room to grow: Russia is the world's largest energy exporting nation, and China a big consumer as the world's second-largest economy, behind the United States. And yet when a railroad tanker of Russian oil crosses the border into China, the transaction is settled in dollars. 
The new currency exchange is meant to start changing that. The trading system will operate through the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange, or Micex, which is Russia's largest stock exchange and also handles foreign currency transactions. It will be the first trading in the Chinese currency outside mainland China and Hong Kong.
''We are pioneers,'' a Micex spokesman, Nikita N. Bekasov, said in a telephone interview. In the long term, if other nations moved in the same direction, trading in renminbi outside China could diminish demand for the dollar. Chinese companies exporting to Russia or other countries could instead buy local currency directly, without the need for dollars as a common currency to conduct their business.
The initial volumes on the Russian exchange, though, are expected to be tiny. And they will be tailored to serve Russian banks with clients doing business in China, rather than speculators wishing to build up a portfolio in renminbi, anticipating that its value will appreciate. The United States is among Western nations that have pressured China to let the renminbi appreciate.
Initially, the Micex renminbi-ruble session will last one hour each morning, timed for trading with banks in Russia's Far East near the Chinese border, many time zones ahead of Moscow.
Exchange officials say they expect only several million renminbi, or about half a million dollars, to change hands daily. The trade is reciprocal, as China in November opened an exchange for rubles and renminbi in Shanghai.
''It has symbolic value,'' said Peter Westin, the chief economist at Aton, a brokerage firm in Moscow.
The development coincides with the opening of a trans-Siberian oil pipeline that is expected to expand Russia's trade with China by freeing up railroad capacity for exports of coal, metals or other commodities, and could make it easier to do business along the remote border.
Cutting the dollar out of this emerging bilateral trade has been a policy goal of the Russian president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, who wants to establish the ruble as a reserve currency held by central banks, to diminish its volatility.
''If China places some part, even a small part, of its reserves in rubles, this is a major boost to the global fortunes of the ruble,'' Yaroslav Lissovolik, chief economist at Deutsche Bank in Moscow, said in an interview.
''Clearly the dollar will remain the key pillar of the global financial architecture,'' Mr. Lissovolik said. ''But this is one of the ways some of the emerging markets want to raise the profile of their currencies.''
The initial daily trading session is mostly intended to test the market and the settlement systems for the Chinese currency, whose export is restricted by Chinese capital controls, the Micex spokesman, Mr. Bekasov, said.
Renminbi are hard to obtain outside China, because of Beijing's anticipation that their value will rise if China succumbs to American pressure to liberalize its currency. Several banks from China, which will be identified at the opening session on Wednesday, have agreed to support liquidity on the Russian market by providing renminbi, Mr. Bekasov said.
The Micex has a history of establishing market rates between currencies: It opened in January 1992, just a few weeks after the collapse of the Soviet Union, as a trading platform for banks wanting to create a market-based exchange rate between the dollar and ruble.
To mark Wednesday's occasion, the Chinese ambassador to Russia, Li Hui, plans to strike the opening bell at Micex and then attend a celebratory brunch.
''We thought about trying to make Chinese food,'' Mr. Bekasov said of the planned festivities, ''but instead decided to make Russian food because it would be more interesting for the Chinese.''

HEADLINE: Bond Yields Rise as the Fed Continues Its Buying Program

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Bond prices fell and stocks were slightly higher on Tuesday after the Federal Reserve said it was continuing its bond purchases because the recovery was continuing at a rate that has been insufficient to lower unemployment.
While a stronger-than-expected retail sales report gave shares a lift early in the day, the market indexes lost ground after the statement by the Federal Reserve policy makers.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 47.98 points, or 0.42 percent, to 11,476.54. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 1.13 points, or 0.09 percent, to 1,241.59 and the Nasdaq composite index added 2.81 points, or 0.11 percent, to 2,627.72. 
Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond rose sharply, hitting 3.49 percent in intraday trading. The yield fell to 3.47 percent late Tuesday, up from 3.27 percent Monday. The price of the 10-year note rose 1 19/32, to 92 30/32.
''The shift from safe haven investments to equity markets is full on,'' said Tom di Galoma, head of fixed-income rates trading at Guggenheim Partners.
Monday's equities market seemed to set the tone for the week by edging slightly higher, when the broader index gained a fraction of a point, as the Fed meeting and the Senate vote on extending the Bush tax cuts held traders at bay.
Economists said that the Fed statement had few surprises for a market that had been pricing in expectations for what it might say about its $600 billion bond buying program.
''It was almost verbatim with what they had last month,'' said Daniel J. Cook, chief executive of IG Markets. ''As far as the markets were concerned we have seen a little bit of a whipsaw back and forth.''
''As far as heading into the end of the year this definitely is not a game changer,'' Mr. Cook said.
The Fed statement said the central bank had ''decided today to continue expanding its holdings of securities as announced in November,'' while the committee did not close the door to re-evaluating the program.
The bond market has continued to feel the fallout from a volatile week with a sell-off in Treasuries, partly as investors anticipated the effect of the tax cut deal, which was expected to help stimulate the economy yet increase the federal deficit. The Senate voted late on Monday to advance the $858 billion tax-cut package, assuring they would approve it and send it to the House.
Jeffrey N. Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial, said it was too soon after the Fed started the program to expect it to change. But a ''minority view'' expected the Fed to take into account the impact of the tax deal on the deficit.
''Some investors were disappointed that the Fed didn't increase the size of its purchases to offset the tax deal,'' Mr. Kleintop said.
Mr. di Galoma said that the Fed ''did not talk about any additional purchases.''
Economic reports released on Tuesday showed improvements in retail sales. The Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.8 percent in November, the fifth consecutive monthly increase, and exceeding analysts' forecasts.
Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank, said ''the main spotlight'' will be off the Fed after Tuesday's meeting, the last of the year, and traders will probably focus more on examining such economic data.
''Retail sales clearly seem to look a bit more positive, and once they quit worrying about what the Fed will say they may return to the fundamentals,'' Mr. McCain said. ''Beyond today we are getting to the point where the markets are showing some signs of being a little overextended.''
Analysts said the retail sales data were a good indicator of the start of the holiday shopping season and seemed to confirm a generally upbeat trend in economic data in recent weeks. The National Retail Federation on Tuesday revised its holiday forecast to a 3.3 percent increase from last year's shopping season. The previous forecast was for a 2.3 percent gain.
''The start to the holiday season has surpassed all expectations,'' said the trade group president, Matthew Shay. ''While employment data is still a concern, we are starting to see improvement in other economic indicators that support an increase to our forecast. In order to sustain this momentum for retailers and the U.S. economy, there must be a renewed focus on jobs as we enter the new year.''
Still, many economists couch their responses with questions about sustainability, given the continued pressures in the job market.
''The holiday shopping season appears to have got off to a very good start, suggesting that fourth-quarter consumption growth will be strong,'' Capital Economics wrote in a research note. ''But without a meaningful acceleration in real income growth, this tentative consumer revival cannot last.''
Steve Blitz, a senior economist for ITG Investment Research, said the data showed signs that the housing market was struggling with sales of furniture and appliances continuing to decline.
''The question is whether, after the holidays are over and gift card balances are down to zero, consumers put their hands back in their pockets,'' he said. ''My guess is that they will -- given the still considerable shortfall in employment and wages from the prerecession high and the need to rebuild household balance sheets.''
Other economic data on Tuesday showed that wholesale prices as measured on the Producer Price Index rose 0.8 percent in November. The core index, which excludes food and energy, edged up 0.3 percent, reflecting an economy that is still struggling.
The Commerce Department said in a separate report that business inventories in October rose 0.7 percent, compared with a 1.3 percent rise in revised figures for September. Analysts had forecast a 1 percent rise.

HEADLINE: Homeless in Los Angeles

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Los Angeles Seeking to Shed Reputation for Homelessness'' (news article, Dec. 13) painted an incomplete picture of homelessness in Los Angeles and local efforts to end it. 
The Home for Good plan is a commendable first step toward moving single homeless individuals off the streets. But the plan ignores the more than 13,000 homeless children and youth attending Los Angeles public schools, and their families.
In this recession, more Los Angeles families are homeless. And with shelters full, many are sleeping in cars, living in substandard housing or remaining in unsafe living situations where they are victims of domestic violence.
While single adults living on the streets of Beverly Hills may be more visible, these families are no less deserving of assistance, and the consequences of inaction will be no less severe: if today's homeless children cannot get stable housing and remain enrolled in school, they will become tomorrow's homeless adults.

HEADLINE: November U.S. Retail Sales Top Forecasts

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Retail sales rose for a fifth consecutive month in November, as the biggest jump in department store sales in two years gave the holiday shopping season a strong start.
The Commerce Department said retail sales increased 0.8 percent in November, more than was forecast. The gain in October was 1.7 percent, propelled by a huge increase in auto sales. At the same time, inventories held by businesses rose for a 10th consecutive month in October as company sales increased by the largest amount in seven months.
In the retail report, auto sales retreated a bit in November. But excluding autos, sales rose 1.2 percent -- the best showing since last March. 
Department store sales jumped 2.8 percent, the strongest advance in two years. That supported private industry readings that this year's holiday shopping season got off to a good start.
Still, Best Buy, the electronics retailer, reported Tuesday that its quarterly net income, which covered a three-month period ending on Nov. 27, fell more than expected. The company said it lost sales of TVs and laptops to competitors. It also cut its full-year outlook.
One benefit for shoppers is that inflation remains tame. The Labor Department reported that wholesale prices rose 0.8 percent in November, reflecting a jump in energy prices. But core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food, rose 0.3 percent.
Consumer spending is closely watched because it accounts for 70 percent of total economic activity. A drop in retail sales in May and June had raised fears that the economy could be in danger of slipping back into recession.
Since that time, however, sales have posted five consecutive increases and economists are raising their forecasts for growth. Many say they believe a big tax cut package working its way through Congress will give consumers more money to spend in the new year.
For November, auto sales slipped 0.8 percent. But that came after a sizable 5.8 percent surge in October sales by auto dealers.
The rise in department store sales represented a solid rebound from a 0.9 percent drop in October.
Analysts said that heavy holiday discounting, which started as early as October, and an improving economy were helping to bolster spending.
Even the weather was playing a part. The arrival of cold weather in November, after two months of unseasonably warm weather, helped to increase sales of coats and other cold-weather gear.
Retail sales also got a lift in November from a rise in gasoline prices. That pushed up sales 2.7 percent at service stations.
Specialty clothing stores sales rose 2.7 percent, after a 1.2 percent gain in October. Sales at general merchandise stores, a category that includes big retail chains like Wal-Mart and Target, increased 1.3 percent -- an improvement from the 0.3 percent rise in October.
Sales were down in November at furniture stores, appliance stores and hardware stores.
In a third report, the Commerce Department reported that business inventories increased 0.7 percent in October after a revised 1.3 percent rise in September. October sales jumped 1.4 percent, the biggest advance since a 2.5 percent rise in March.
Continued strong gains in inventories and sales are viewed as encouraging signs for the economy.
Many businesses had undertaken a liquidation of inventories in early 2009 as they struggled to keep costs under control. The swing from slashing inventories to rebuilding stockpiles has provided support for growth beginning in the final three months of 2009 -- just months after the recession ended in June 2009.
For October, the 0.7 percent rise in total inventories reflected a 0.9 percent increase in inventories held by manufacturers and a 1.9 percent rise in inventories held by wholesalers. Inventories at the retail level dropped 0.6 percent, but that was mostly because of a strong month for auto sales.
The 1.4 percent rise in sales showed strength at all points in the supply chain. Sales by manufacturers rose 2.2 percent, with smaller gains posted by retailers and manufacturers.
Total inventories climbed to $1.42 trillion in November, increasing 7.5 percent from the low point for stockpiles of $1.32 trillion reached in September of 2009.

HEADLINE: Reopening A House That's Still Divided

BYLINE: By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN

 BODY:
PHILADELPHIA -- The convulsive currents that roil the telling of American history have become so familiar that they now seem an inseparable part of the story itself. Here is a nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to a proposition of human equality, that, for much of its first century of life, countenanced slavery, institutionally supported it and economically profited from it. The years that followed have been marked by repair, reform and reversals; recompense, recrimination and reinterpretation. Extraordinary ideals and achievements have been countered by extraordinary failings and flaws, only to be countered yet again, each turn yielding another round of debates.
And here, in this city where the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence were signed; where a $300 million Independence National Historical Park has been created, leading from the National Constitution Center to Independence Hall; and where the Liberty Bell, as a symbol of the nation's ideals, draws well over a million visitors a year, a great opportunity existed to explore these primal tensions more closely on a site adjacent to the Liberty Bell Center in Independence park. Unfortunately, those opportunities have been squandered in ''The President's House: Freedom and Slavery in the Making of a New Nation'' which opens on Wednesday. 
It is almost painful, given the importance of this site, to point out that the result is more a monument to these unresolved tensions than a commemoration of anything else. After $10.5 million and more than eight years; after tugs of war between the city and the National Park Service and black community organizations; after the establishment of a contentious oversight committee and street demonstrations, overturned conceptions and racial debates, it bears all the scars of its creation, lacking both intellectual coherence and emotional power. On Wednesday the Park Service takes over the site with its work cut out for it, since rangers will have to weave the competing strands together.
But consider what opportunities there were. The construction of a new $9 million exhibition space for the Liberty Bell drew attention to this adjacent site, where the nation's first two presidents -- George Washington and John Adams -- had lived between 1790 and 1800, when Philadelphia was the nation's capital.
The house had long ago been demolished -- much of it in the 1830s -- and in the 1950s the site, near Sixth and Market Streets, was the location of a public restroom. But the house was once one of the grandest mansions in Philadelphia. Its inhabitants included Richard Penn (grandson of the Pennsylvania colony's founder); the British general William Howe (who occupied Philadelphia while Washington's army licked its wounds in Valley Forge); Benedict Arnold (who may have begun his espionage here); and Robert Morris (a financier of the Revolution). All vanished history.
Then, in an illuminating 2002 article in The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography, the historian Edward Lawler Jr. mapped out the house and its probable dimensions, and pointed out the irony that just steps from the new Liberty Bell Center was a site that had once sheltered Washington's slaves.
The Park Service contested some of his conclusions and refused to outline the footprint of the lost President's House in its designs for the center. But the issue was soon taken up by scholars, including Gary B. Nash, author of the new book ''The Liberty Bell,'' as well as by political activists like the lawyer Michael Coard and his Avenging the Ancestors Coalition, who argued that the existence of slave quarters adjacent to the city's paean to liberty demanded major commemoration.
There was a cascade of events, chronicled by The Philadelphia Inquirer, including Congressional legislation and financing, city oversight and funds, an expansion of the Liberty Bell exhibition, the establishment of an oversight committee and the solicitation of redesigns. In 2007 an archaeological dig began, revealing the foundation and the remains of a tunnel once used by servants and slaves. The dig, viewed by the public, ignited debate.
Washington ultimately took nine slaves to Philadelphia from Mount Vernon, where more than 200 slaves were held. And they were part of a household staff that may have numbered two dozen, including white indentured laborers and servants. Though the slaves were part of a population of nearly 4,000 others in Philadelphia, there were also more than 6,500 free blacks in the city in 1790, and Washington's slaves were exposed to the experience of liberty.
We know some astonishing details about the effects. Ona Judge (here called Oney), a servant to Martha Washington, and Hercules, the household cook, both escaped to freedom.
Some of Washington's most unattractive characteristics also emerge. He and Martha Washington pursue Judge for years, though she later establishes herself with her own family in New Hampshire. And though Washington expressed his opposition to slavery, and freed his own slaves in his will, he went through bizarre machinations to ensure that the slaves he took to the nation's capital would not be subject to local laws granting them freedom after six months. He exchanged them with others at Mount Vernon, issuing instructions: ''I wish to have it accomplished under pretext that may deceive both them and the public.''
So here we not only have the father of our country showing his darkest side, we also see the foundations of the nation at their darkest. Yet here is where Washington invented the executive branch, conducting affairs of state. Here is where it became clear that a democratic ruler was no king, had no claim on his dwelling place and was himself meant to serve the people.
How, then, should such a site be developed? A 2005 call for designs stressed that it would have to pay attention to many themes: the house, its workers, the executive branch, African-American Philadelphia, escapes to freedom. In addition, it noted that community discussions led to five ''cultural values'' that should be clear: identity, memory, agency, dignity, truth. There was also a requirement that the site be open 24/7 to visitors.
As ultimately designed by Kelly/Maiello, the site is a space bounded by a low wall roughly outlining the footprint of the house (but often departing from it), marked by protruding rectangular slabs into which are inserted mock fireplaces and video screens. In the house's heart, a transparent wall allows visitors to view the archaeological work in progress. And attached to the walls are either long panels surveying historical themes -- the executive branch, slavery in the President's House -- or rudimentary illustrations. A few show the escape of Judge, a few give some glimpse of foreign policy in the house (protests over the Jay Treaty with England), and more give some sense of slavery (including Washington's signing of the Fugitive Slave Act, which put all escaped slaves in danger).
''History is not neat,'' we read. ''It is complicated and messy. It is about people, places and events that are both admirable and deplorable.'' And the President's House, we are told, ''exposes the core contradiction at the founding of this nation: enshrinement of liberty and the institution of slavery.''
But what precisely is being exposed? A few yards away, the Liberty Bell Center discusses abolition and slavery; the park's visitor center has an exhibition about the Underground Railroad; the nearby African American History Museum has a powerful audio and video history of blacks in Philadelphia. Accounts of slavery are even found at Mount Vernon.
Here, though, we get neither a sense of the place, nor a sense of the issues (and much of the year, the open air will be inhospitable). We don't learn about the differences between Washington and Adams. We don't learn much about the pictured events. There is no real narrative. Illustrations can also be melodramatically contentious: we see a seemingly disdainful Washington dangling a ''peace medal'' before a suspicious Seneca Indian leader
As for slave life, it is also difficult to piece together. The video screens that come to life above the fake mantels give the impression of a half-finished 21st-century home. The videos themselves (with scripts by Lorene Cary), in which slaves and servants provide first-person accounts of experiences, at least provide some sense of life. But how do we put these experiences in context? What was Philadelphia's free black community like? How did white workers and black slaves live together here?
We are told that the President's House ''offers an opportunity to draw lessons from the past.'' But what lessons? That Washington was flawed? That slavery was an abomination? Are these revelations? A memorial to the practice of slavery is mounted here, inscribed with the names of African tribes from which slaves derived, but it has no particular relationship to Philadelphia or this site. The need for some such memorial is keen, but here it seems thumped down as an intrusion.
So what is learned? Not what makes this site special, but what makes it ordinary; not the foundations of what led to the overcoming of slavery, but a sense of its enduring presence. Would this display be any different if presidents had not lived here? And would our understanding be any different without it?
''The President's House'' opens on Wednesday in Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia; phila.gov/presidentshouse.

HEADLINE: The Phillies Are Now The Hunted

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

 BODY:
It is going to take awhile to think about the Phillies as the overlords of baseball, the team that can outspend and outrecruit all of the others.
But that day is here. With their midnight strike to acquire Cliff Lee, the Phillies have assembled a pitching staff -- Cole Hamels as No. 4? -- that really should win the World Series come late October. Anything less will be failure.
Yankees fans, who must wonder if New York bumptiousness in management and in the stands turned off Lee and his wife, always embrace the awesome responsibility of front-runner. Now Phillies fans will learn to live with it. 
Remember when Phillies fans had a surly underdog mentality every time the Mets and their raffish fans arrived in town and took over their ballpark? Ha! That era is long gone, on both sides.
The Phillies have assembled one of the great pitching staffs in baseball history, just going by the credentials of (might as well use alphabetical order and let the manager work out a rotation) Roy Halladay, Hamels, Lee and Roy Oswalt.
This staff is competing with the great Atlanta staff of the past generation, the Cleveland staff of the mid-1950s and the Los Angeles Dodgers staff of the '60s, and some Yankees staffs of various ages.
As a sobering observation, Giants fans could remind people that the Phillies were not even in the World Series this year. The Giants were a delightful surprise put together late in the season, and they deserved their championship, but that is ancient history now that the Phillies have parlayed attendance, cable and other income to snatch Lee from the Yankees and the Rangers.
The Phillies should win next season, which is the only season that matters, even though the Phillies signed Lee for five years. In a nation racked by unemployment and debate over how to recover, these offers all sound like funny money. The Yankees were apparently offering a seven-year contract while the Phillies swooped in with a front-ended five-year contract for a pitcher who will turn 33 in August.
The Yankees, who had dreamed of throwing C. C. Sabathia and Lee as twin aces, always expect to get their man. Big Bronx bucks are almost always enough to bring anybody to the Bronx. Some of them thrive -- Mark Teixeira, Sabathia, Hideki Matsui, David Cone, Paul O'Neill, and even Alex Rodriguez, in his diva way. But there is a whole history of players who have not thrived in New York, for one reason or another: Johnson, Brown, Pavano. It's not for everybody. And presumably not for Cliff Lee from Arkansas.
Everybody will play down the incident in the A.L.C.S. when a lout or three accosted Lee's wife among the traveling party of the Texas Rangers. Lee assured everybody it was not an issue, which does not mean they forgot about it. They could have used the Yankees to raise the tide to float his humble little skiff to Philadelphia.
It is even possible Lee observed the way the Yankees management whacked away at their captain -- No. 2, Derek Jee-tah! -- with leaked challenges to go look elsewhere as a free agent. That gibe did not sound like Brian Cashman but rather somebody higher up in the Yankees hierarchy, channeling the Boss, saying that a real general manager does not let the help be too demanding.
Lee could not have missed Jeter's sizzle when he finally re-upped, saying in very un-Jeterian tones that he did not appreciate the snide comments in public. The intrusive news media is a given, so Jeter could have been talking only about management.
Cashman was complimentary toward Lee on Tuesday, although he did note that Lee had not personally informed him of his decision -- ''but that's fine,'' Cashman said. He added that he was prepared to ''climb back down the mountain and hit a new trail,'' and he praised his starters, with or without Andy Pettitte, who may retire.
Now the Yankees must pick through the leavings at the end of the free-agent season. It's just like holiday shopping. But they have as much as $20 million a season to play with and they will think of something. Frankly, this setback will be good for Yankees players and fans, force them to be creative, see how the other side feels. All eyes are on the Phillies now.
A note of reality: signing an established superstar pitcher is tricky because the allure is his body of work.
In the past decade, the Mets have subsidized superb competitors for great work done elsewhere. This is known as the Petey Syndrome, after Pedro Martinez, who went downhill after a honeymoon, as did Johan Santana and Frankie Rodriguez.
The Phillies surely noticed that Lee did not exactly dominate the World Series, with 2 starts, 2 losses, 11 2/3 innings and a 6.94 earned run average. The postseason will chew up pitchers. Now Major League Baseball is threatening to expand its playoffs.
Lee should be fine for a few years. But five? It's a different sport, but the Islanders fell apart collectively after winning four consecutive Stanley Cups (and playing in a fifth final) because they had essentially skated an entire extra season. Intensity adds up, particularly in the arm of a pitcher.
Lee pitched for four teams in the past two seasons, and maybe he was tired of orienting himself, learning new player parking lots and new gate attendants and new routes to new ballparks.
He had a trial run with the Phillies at the end of 2009 -- he did not get a ring -- and chose the Phillies over the Yankees as the best way to get one. He chose chesty Jimmy Rollins and the rest of that confident band. Phillies fans should now study the traditional presumptiveness of Yankees fans. As of now, the Phillies should never lose a game in 2011. That's how it works.

HEADLINE: Big Appliances Put Out as Trash Are Vanishing, Puzzling the City

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM

 BODY:
Over the last several months, 22,741 New Yorkers contacted the city's Department of Sanitation and arranged for the pickup of refrigerators, air-conditioners and freezers. In more than 11,000 instances, the machines vanished before sanitation workers arrived in their white trucks to pick them up.
Who, then, is stealing the household appliances of New York City?
Perhaps it is not the most pressing question facing city authorities, but it is something of a mystery nonetheless. The appliances did not develop legs and walk away, and they did not simply disappear. 
Scavengers, to be sure, abound in New York, especially during tough economic times. But the sheer magnitude of the thefts -- 11,528 appliances, to be precise -- over a relatively brief period suggests to some in city government and the recycling industry that a more organized enterprise may be at work as well.
Deepening the mystery, these were neither the latest Sub Zero behemoths, sleek Bosch nor stylish retro Smeg refrigerators. They were garbage, quite literally -- discarded appliances left at the curb for pickup by the Sanitation Department.
And while the value of one discarded appliance may seem marginal at best, in the scrap industry, the fluctuations of commodity prices and volume add up to real money.
Indeed, the big loser in what might be called New York's Appliances Caper appears to be a multinational recycling conglomerate, a subsidiary of which has a large city contract to recycle the hundreds of thousands of tons of metal, glass and plastic generated each year by New Yorkers, including bulk metal, like appliances.
The subsidiary, Sims Municipal Recycling of New York L.L.C., estimates that the thefts, along with schemes involving redeemable bottles, are costing the company $2 million to $4 million a year.
Behind those losses, some in the industry -- by some accounts an $85 billion annual business in 2008 -- see the hand of organized crime, although no one can point to hard evidence. New York's enduring and resourceful mob families have long played a role in both the recycling and scrap industries and have a knack for turning up where the money is.
The mob's longstanding involvement in the scrap industry, which had diminished a decade ago, has seen something of a resurgence in the last three years, said George Khouzami, the coordinating supervisor for the organized crime branch in the New York office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
At the same time, the urban hunter-gatherer is far from a new, or rare, phenomenon, and scavenging in New York is quite likely as old as the municipality itself, where the wealthy have a way of leaving a bountiful trail of usable, if not salable, detritus in their wake. And as the economy has deteriorated, more and more people tend to look to scavenging to make a few extra dollars.
''It's not just the individual entrepreneur anymore; it's now organized entrepreneurs,'' said Robert Lange, the director of the Sanitation Department's Bureau of Waste Prevention, Reuse and Recycling, which negotiated the contract with Sims.
While it was only in July that the department began keeping records on the number of appliances that disappeared from curbside, Sims began feeling the bite a little more than two years ago, said Thomas Outerbridge, the general manager of the company's municipal recycling division. That was shortly after the company, which had been handling the city's metal, glass and plastic recyclables since 2002, signed its current 23-year contract, worth roughly $1.5 billion. Mr. Outerbridge said the company began to see a significant drop-off in the volume of materials the Sanitation Department was picking up and dropping off at its two facilities.
With seasonal fluctuations, the department's recycling trucks had been delivering roughly 20,000 tons of plastic, glass and metal each month to Sims's sorting facilities. But the company has seen that decline by 1,000 to 1,500 tons a month.
''Whether it's attributed to scavenging activity, an individual is rarely going to go out and pick up bulky metal,'' Mr. Outerbridge said. ''That's not a guy with a stick over his shoulder and a bag of cans.''
To track thefts, sanitation officials used online requests and calls to the city's 311 hot line for the agency to remove chlorofluorocarbons from refrigerators, freezers, air-conditioners, water coolers and dehumidifiers. The removal of the gases, which deplete the ozone layer, is required by Environmental Protection Agency regulations, and specially trained sanitation crews respond to the requests, draw the materials out of the appliances and leave them for removal by the department's regular recycling pickup.
A task force in the Department of Sanitation Police that focuses on crimes like illegal dumping and the thefts of recyclables has also seen a significant increase in activity, where it plays cat and mouse with a constant stream of determined thieves, said Inspector Robert D'Angelo, who leads the task force.
Driving vehicles ranging from personal cars and rented trucks to vans that look as if they themselves are a tank of gas away from the scrapyard, thieves who live by the Sanitation Department's recycling pickup schedules, listed on the agency's Web site, cruise the city's streets the night before the big white trucks make their rounds.
In response, the officers have stepped up their enforcement, Inspector D'Angelo said, and while the theft of curbside recyclables warrants only a summons, the sanitation officers impound the vehicles and their cargo -- frequently a jumbled load of refrigerators, air-conditioners, Venetian blinds, office partitions and stoves.
This year through Dec. 1, the task force has seized more than 270 vehicles, according to records provided by the department. But the small force does not have the resources either to track the thieves to the scrapyards where they sell their haul or to determine whether there are connections among any of the people.
But on most nights, the officers move through the city neighborhoods in small teams, working in plain clothes and unmarked cars, circling block after block in the areas they know provide good hunting for their targets, lying in wait and then pouncing, with lights and sirens, when they see someone remove material from curbside, which under law belongs to the city.
On a recent night in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, they grabbed a man driving a ragged Dodge van packed with scrap -- what looked like the contents of two messy garages crammed into the back of a van with Pennsylvania plates. The driver, a squat bedraggled-looking man in jeans and a blue shirt with a blue bandana covering his head, stood looking defeated as two officers, Michael Bristol and Ed Burke, surveyed the van and its contents.
''This guy has been out here before,'' said Officer Burke, nodding his head toward the open back doors of the van and adding, ''It's a nice load.''

HEADLINE: At N.Y.U., a Global Role For an Ex-Prime Minister

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
A half-year ago, he resigned as British prime minister after a bruising campaign and some stiff criticism of his politicking skills. But on Tuesday, Gordon Brown was pressing the flesh again -- this time at New York University, where he talked about his new book, led a discussion with selected students and eased into the Greenwich Village institution that will be his academic home for the next two years.
Mr. Brown, the university announced, has been named N.Y.U.'s inaugural ''distinguished global leader in residence.'' Still a member of Parliament, he will bring the cachet and credentials that go with being a former chief executive of Britain to a university on an ambitious global mission, with a new liberal arts campus in Abu Dhabi and study-away sites on five continents. 
It turns out that Mr. Brown and the university's president, John Sexton, are old friends, having been introduced years ago by a mutual friend, the Democratic political adviser Robert M. Shrum, who is a senior fellow at N.Y.U. Two years ago, Mr. Brown appointed Mr. Sexton as co-chairman of a Britain and United States study group on higher education in a global context.
Indeed, the two share a vision of global interdependence that borders on zealous. In a 2008 speech in Boston, at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, Mr. Brown told the audience, which included Mr. Sexton, that for the ''first time in human history we have the opportunity to come together around a global covenant, to reframe the international architecture and build the truly global society.''
Mr. Sexton, for his part, has been busy molding N.Y.U. into what he calls the ''global network university,'' which, as he recently wrote, ''can foster the advancement of humankind in special ways.''
Mr. Brown, 59, will not teach courses and will not be paid, N.Y.U. officials said. But he will spend two weeks a year at the university's New York campus, as well as a week in Abu Dhabi and a week at one of 12 study-abroad sites, participating in public events like those held on Tuesday. Mr. Brown will also meet with students in more intimate forums and lead a colloquium on global civil society.
His is just the latest big international name to land on an American campus. Yale University also has a penchant for former British prime ministers, with Tony Blair teaching a course on faith and globalization for the third year. The Peruvian author Mario Vargas Llosa was teaching two courses at Princeton this semester when he won the Nobel Prize in Literature.
Mr. Brown led Britain during the financial crisis, then stepped down in May after his Labour Party lost control of Parliament. In an interview between events on Tuesday, he said he was drawn to N.Y.U. because of its international aspirations. ''The idea of a global network university where barriers are broken down and people can use modern technology to debate and educate each other is incredibly appealing,'' he said. ''N.Y.U. is setting the pace that others will follow.''
In introducing Mr. Brown, Mr. Sexton talked fondly of spending time with his friend at Chequers -- the British equivalent of Camp David -- marveling that ''a guy from Brooklyn'' was sitting in a chair once used by Winston Churchill, discussing the world with the prime minister.
At the question-and-answer session led by Mr. Shrum, Mr. Brown, whose new book is titled ''Beyond the Crash: Overcoming the First Crisis of Globalization,'' focused on the need for countries and continents to cooperate to bolster the global economy, fight climate change and tackle disease.
Afterward, at a book signing, he made small talk with students, asking them about their programs of study, and posed for pictures. Patrizia Mancini, 29, a master's student in the university's Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, said she arrived at N.Y.U. this fall from London, where she lived for three years, following Mr. Brown's progress.
''I have to say that he seems like a different person,'' Ms. Mancini said. ''He's way more relaxed. As a politician, he would seem fake when he smiled, but now he seems so natural.''

HEADLINE: Right Flank Puts Pressure On G.O.P. on Tax-Cut Bill

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Republicans are under pressure from the Tea Party movement and some other conservatives to reject the compromise tax bill, potentially complicating its passage and highlighting how the Republican Party is likely to face a persistent rightward push when it takes control of the House next month.
A group called the Tea Party Patriots circulated a petition this week calling the compromise a bad back-room deal with President Obama that violates the principles that Tea Party candidates campaigned on, like reducing the deficit, in the midterm elections. 
Sarah Palin has criticized the deal, and former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts said in an op-ed article in USA Today on Tuesday that he opposed it. Commentators like Rush Limbaugh and conservative bloggers are also weighing in on the deal, and proclaiming it wanting.
The tax-cut package passed its first test in the Senate on Monday with overwhelming Republican support, and the number of House Republicans who have expressed opposition remains limited. The Senate is expected to vote on the bill as early as Wednesday morning, and the House could take it up shortly after.
Aides to House Republican leaders said they still expected a sizable majority of their members to vote for the legislation. But each defecting Republican represents another Democrat who must be swayed to vote for the bill -- which has already been decried by many in that caucus -- and adds to the public relations problem for the legislation, which neither party has promoted as a thing of beauty.
Representative Michele Bachmann, Republican of Minnesota, is against the package, said her spokesman, Sergio Gor. ''She would like to see an up-or-down vote solely on extending tax cuts without other conditions,'' Mr. Gor said. ''Also, we've heard there are earmarks in there. It is turning into a Christmas tree with a bunch of ornaments.''
Representative Mike Pence of Indiana, the departing chairman of the House Republican Conference, told a conservative radio show host Tuesday that ''I will not vote for this tax deal when it comes to the floor of the House of Representatives.''
Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California, fiercely criticized the bill in a news release as ''an incomplete effort that fails to create a permanent tax structure,'' and he hinted that he might not vote for it.
The unrest may foreshadow the dynamic that is coming in January with the 112th Congress, which will be chock-full of Tea Party-affiliated freshmen.
Just as the bill exposed tensions between many members of the Democratic caucus and the White House -- most notably Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, who irritated the Obama administration by peddling his own tax plan, and Senator Bernard Sanders, independent of Vermont, who took to the Senate floor for several hours last week to excoriate the bill -- the continuing problems among Republicans over fiscal issues are also elucidated here.
''I think presidential aspirants will try to out-conservative each other for their own purposes,'' Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the incoming House budget chairman, said in an interview with The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, in reference to Mr. Romney's opposition.
Brad Dayspring, a spokesman for Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the Republican whip, was equally pointed in an e-mail. ''Playing political chess with the budgets of millions of working families and small businesses is dangerous,'' he said.
While the rightward push may influence some members of Congress, it was clear that the Senate was unmoved. The tax bill set for a vote on the Senate floor ''is not subject to being reopened,'' said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader.
The White House also expressed confidence that a bill it was promoting as the best compromise available would end up on President Obama's desk. The first vote in the Senate, said Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, ''demonstrates the broad bipartisan support that the agreement enjoys.''
Outside of scoring points with the party's right flank, Republicans said they knew there would be risks in rejecting the deal outright. While the compromise contains several features they dislike -- a two-year limit on the tax-cut extensions and the inclusion of the unemployment insurance benefits, among other things -- they are widely viewed as having the upper hand in the negotiation process. Should the Bush-era tax cuts expire because of opposition to the deal from conservatives and voters face across-the-board tax increases next year, Republicans would at least share the blame.
''The reality is that Democrats control all the levers of power today and will control two of the three come January,'' Mr. Dayspring said. ''The choice is to act now or increase taxes on everyone on Jan. 1, causing a deeper recession and the loss of tens of thousands of jobs nationally -- an indisputable fact and an unacceptable result.''

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Panelists Dissent on Causes of Crisis

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Republican members of the commission appointed by Congress to investigate the causes of the financial crisis plan to release on Wednesday a document that assigns government housing policies substantial blame for the origins of the 2008 financial crisis.
The release of the 13-page document is an indication of a major partisan division within the 10-member Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, which was required to deliver its report on Dec. 15 but has pushed that deadline back to January. Two people close to the work of the commission provided copies of the document to The New York Times on Tuesday. 
The Republican members of the panel were angered last week when the commission voted 6 to 4, along partisan lines, to limit individual comments by the commissioners to 9 pages each in a 500-page report that the commission plans to publish next month with Public Affairs, an imprint of the Perseus Books Group, one Republican commissioner said.
The Government Printing Office will publish an official version of the report that will contain the full comments of each commissioner, but the commercially available version -- which represents the view of the Democratic majority -- is the one likely to get the most visibility, said the commissioner, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he feared being deluged by calls if he were identified.
The commission has loosely modeled its work on the Pecora hearings, which the Senate held in the 1930s to investigate the causes of the Depression, and on the 9/11 Commission, whose 2004 report, published by W. W. Norton, became a best seller.
While the many causes of the financial crisis are likely to be dissected by economists and other scholars for decades, some of the causes can be arranged along a partisan spectrum.
Democrats have emphasized factors like fraudulent practices by mortgage lenders and reckless risk-taking by Wall Street banks and other financial institutions, while Republicans have focused on poor oversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the entities that supported the secondary market for mortgages, and decades of government efforts to encourage homeownership.
''While the housing bubble, the financial crisis, and the recession are surely interrelated events, we do not believe that the housing bubble was a sufficient condition for the financial crisis,'' the document states. ''The unprecedented number of subprime and other weak mortgages in this bubble set it and its effect apart from others in the past.''
The document was signed by Bill Thomas, the vice chairman of the commission and a former congressman from California; Keith Hennessey, a former adviser to President George W. Bush; Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office; and Peter J. Wallison, who was White House counsel to President Ronald Reagan and is now a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.
Citing several government agencies, the document argues that ''the government subsidized and, in some cases, mandated the extension of credit to high-risk borrowers, propagating risks for financial firms, the mortgage market, taxpayers, and ultimately the financial system.''
The document also examines the unappreciated risks that accompanied the transformation of mortgages into complex securities -- like collateralized debt obligations -- that could be sold to investors. ''Put simply, the risk of a housing collapse was simply not appreciated,'' the document states. The document also examines how the crisis intensified after the government allowed Lehman Brothers to collapse in September 2008, an event that caused bondholders to panic. It argues that the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department acted appropriately to stanch the crisis.
''While we believe that the government deserves quite a lot of the blame for getting our financial system and our nation into trouble in the first place, we applaud the quick and decisive actions taken by our nation's leaders during the panic,'' it states.
The commissioner who discussed the document emphasized that it did not represent the full Republican perspective. ''It is solely for the purpose of laying down a marker on Dec. 15 and laying out some of the basic questions that we believe must be answered in the final report,'' he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Concludes North Korea Has More Nuclear Sites

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and WILLIAM J. BROAD; David E. Sanger reported from Washington, and William J. Broad from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration has concluded that North Korea's new plant to enrich nuclear fuel uses technology that is ''significantly more advanced'' than what Iran has struggled over two decades to assemble, according to senior administration and intelligence officials.
In carefully worded public comments in recent days, senior American and South Korean officials have also argued that the new plant could not have been constructed so rapidly unless there was a sophisticated network of other, secret sites -- and perhaps a fully operating uranium enrichment plant -- elsewhere in the country. 
These conclusions strongly suggest that North Korea has evaded layers of economic sanctions and efforts to intercept sea and air shipments, an effort begun in the Bush administration and accelerated after a United Nations Security Council resolution passed last year after the North's second nuclear test. The intelligence estimates also greatly complicate the task for American diplomats -- including a senior delegation of State Department and White House officials who left for China on Tuesday -- who have been struggling for weeks to fashion a common plan with Asian allies and China to contain North Korea's nuclear advances.
North Korea already has the fuel for 6 to 12 nuclear weapons and has conducted two nuclear tests, a capability it developed by harvesting plutonium from a nuclear reactor that was recently shuttered. While the North says the new uranium enrichment plant will produce fuel for reactors that could produce electricity for the impoverished country -- the same argument Iran has made for its enrichment efforts -- the North does not possess such reactors today. But if the plant is used to produce highly enriched uranium, it could give the country another pathway to increasing its nuclear arsenal.
Some American officials said they were most concerned that the real intent of showing off the new capability last month to a Stanford expert, Siegfried S. Hecker, a former director of Los Alamos National Laboratory, and two of his Stanford colleagues, was to advertise North Korea's wares to other countries that might want to buy them. Dr. Hecker said he was ''stunned'' that North Korea had succeeded in building the plant so quickly.
Last Friday, Gary Samore, President Obama's chief nuclear adviser, said for the first time that ''the North Korean program appears to be much more advanced and efficient than the Iranian program, which is running into problems.'' Reports from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations nuclear watchdog, indicate that the Iranians are experimenting with advanced centrifuges, but have not installed them on an industrial scale, despite years of efforts. Those efforts have been slowed by sabotage, according to widespread reports that Mr. Samore all but confirmed.
''The U.S. and its allies are doing everything we can to try to make sure that we complicate matters for them,'' he said Friday.
After alluding to a secret North Korean effort to help Syria build a nuclear reactor, which was ultimately destroyed by Israel in a 2007 bombing raid, Mr. Samore said that the new North Korean centrifuges could be attractive to other nations. He added that a critical element of American strategy must now be ''to ensure that the North Koreans don't sell to the Middle East.''
But that has been tried before, and the success of efforts to halt shipments has been spotty at best. According to secret State Department cables made public by WikiLeaks, the United States believes that North Korea successfully shipped 19 advanced missiles to Iran five years ago, and that other technology has passed through the Beijing airport on its way to Iran. Russian experts, the cables showed, disagreed with the American conclusion about the missiles.
Yet three weeks after North Korea's nuclear revelations, the United States, China, Japan and South Korea are unable to agree upon a response. South Korea is reluctant to go to the United Nations Security Council, after China watered down sanctions against the North for its apparent role in the sinking of the Cheonan, a South Korean warship, which killed 46 sailors.
Several Chinese officials and academics who deal with North Korean issues argued a week ago in Beijing that it would be counterproductive to seek more sanctions or resolutions at the Security Council -- efforts that have been tried before, and that have largely failed.
American, South Korean and Chinese officials have acknowledged in recent days that despite their intense focus on the North's efforts to obtain uranium enrichment technology, they all missed the assembly of the plant at Yongbyon, North Korea's main nuclear complex. The area is under intense scrutiny from American satellites, but the new plant was built inside an old structure -- and satellites cannot see through the roof. Intelligence officials have said in the past that they have few spies in North Korea with access to the most sensitive facilities.
When it comes to North Korea, the United States has frequently had to rely on breakthroughs by allied intelligence services. South Korea first notified Washington, a decade ago, that North Korea was buying components for uranium enrichment. The head of Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service, came to Washington in 2007 and dropped photographs of the North Korean-built nuclear reactor in Syria on the coffee table of Stephen J. Hadley, President George W. Bush's national security adviser.
American officials caution that it is not clear the North Koreans can get the new enrichment plant running: Dr. Hecker was given a quick walk-through of parts of the plant, and could not confirm whether the centrifuges were operating. But what he saw was enough to convince him, and American intelligence experts, that the facility could not have been built that quickly unless a network of centrifuge construction facilities and uranium processing plants existed elsewhere.
''It is likely that North Korea had been pursuing an enrichment capability long before the April 2009 date it now claims,'' Glyn Davies, the American ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency, said last week. If so, he said, there was a clear likelihood that North Korea ''has built other uranium-enrichment-related facilities in its territory.''

WASHINGTON -- Terry McGraw, the chairman and chief executive officer of the McGraw-Hill Companies, said he had been ''very pleasantly surprised'' by President Obama's recent efforts to promote the interests of American business. But Mr. Obama could do better, he added, if he had a high-powered adviser with more of a business bent in the White House.
''You've got to strengthen the team,'' Mr. McGraw said in an interview on Tuesday. ''You've got to get some gravitas.'' 
Nearly halfway through Mr. Obama's term, the dearth of business and Wall Street types in his administration rankles many executives, if only as a proxy for their unhappiness with his policies and occasional antibusiness political speech. And the White House has struggled to find such a person to fill the one spot about to open in Mr. Obama's inner circle, the director of the National Economic Council, the job being vacated this month by Lawrence H. Summers.
The president's uneasy and somewhat distant relationship with the worlds of business and finance will hang over his meeting on Wednesday with the chiefs of about 20 corporations, among them Google, American Express, UPS and Intel.
While Mr. Obama has held such roundtables in the past, this one is part of a new effort by the administration to build closer ties over the next two years, officials say. Relations have improved since the big Republican gains in the midterm elections: Mr. Obama has concluded a free-trade agreement with South Korea, negotiated a tax-cut package with Congressional Republicans and delayed antipollution emissions regulations, all steps applauded by business constituencies.
But Mr. Obama has had trouble enlisting a prominent business executive, and the spot that will open when Mr. Summers returns to his Harvard professorship in January is not seen as a comfortable fit for a corporate chief.
Presidents of both parties, but especially Republicans, typically have had high-profile executives in their cabinets, though the executives' records in the world of politics are mixed. President George W. Bush, for example, had a string of chief executives as Treasury secretary -- Paul O'Neill of Alcoa, John Snow of CSX and Henry M. Paulson Jr. of Goldman Sachs -- though only Mr. Paulson was seen as exercising much influence.
President Bill Clinton most prominently had Robert E. Rubin, a former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, as Treasury secretary and director of the National Economic Council. Mr. Clinton also had two White House chiefs of staff who came from the business world, Thomas F. McLarty III and Erskine B. Bowles.
Mr. Obama, taking office amid a financial crisis and the worst recession since the Great Depression, recruited advisers experienced in economics and governmental crisis management. That included Mr. Summers, a former Treasury secretary, and Timothy F. Geithner, who had been president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as Treasury secretary.
To be in charge of relations with business, Mr. Obama picked one of his closest advisers from Chicago, Valerie Jarrett, a former chief executive of the Habitat Company, a real estate development company. But some in the business community do not regard her as an effective advocate; she is so close to the president, some say, that she is more apt to tell them what he thinks than the other way around.
''In the Clinton White House, people in the business community turned to someone like Bob Rubin when there was discussion internally,'' said one Democratic lobbyist, who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid criticizing a president of his own party. ''It's not an anti-Valerie thing; I just don't think they believe that there is anybody inside with that stature and that view.''
In an interview, Ms. Jarrett said the discord between the administration and business leaders was an inevitable result of the crisis the president inherited and of the uncertainty businesses felt in the debates over health care and financial regulations. Now, she said, the two sides can turn the page.
Conflict with the health and financial industries is sure to persist, however, as the administration writes the regulations to put the new laws into effect.
In recent weeks, Ms. Jarrett has been organizing a series of meetings between Mr. Obama and executives. That includes the Wednesday gathering, which is closed to the press.
''We have assured the group that is coming that the intent is to have a working session with the president,'' Ms. Jarrett said. ''This is not a photo-op.''
As for replacing Mr. Summers, Ms. Jarrett said Mr. Obama believes that what is more important than hiring a business leader is having ''a person who is going to give the president the best possible advice on how to grow the economy.'' Even so, she said she had done ''an enormous amount of outreach'' seeking suggestions for candidates.
The problem for the administration head-hunters comes down to the job description. The director of the National Economic Council is one of four principals on the economic team and is the only one to work near the Oval Office. But the job requires being an honest broker for other advisers' views, knowing how government works and showing deference to Congress. Most executives have little such experience, or interest.
No widely known executives are among those Mr. Obama is known to have spoken with or is considering. They include Roger Altman, a Wall Street investment banker who was a deputy Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration; Richard Levin, an economist and the longtime president of Yale University; and Gene Sperling, a counselor to Mr. Geithner who was director of the National Economic Council in Mr. Clinton's second term.
Mr. Bowles, a former businessman who led Mr. Clinton's Small Business Administration and then served as his chief of staff, has said he is not interested. Some administration advisers have talked of creating a job for an executive as a counselor to Mr. Obama.
David Cote, the chief executive of Honeywell, who also serves on Mr. Obama's economic recovery board and was on his bipartisan debt-reduction commission, said he told Rahm Emanuel, the former White House chief of staff, early on that Mr. Obama should tone down his antibusiness remarks. But he says the tough talk did not disappear as quickly as he would have liked.
Still, Mr. Cote said he is not ''hung up'' on Mr. Obama hiring business executives.
''I don't think somebody has to have actually been there to have the right mindset or attitude,'' he said. ''My concern up to most recently has just been that kind of attitude or approach that felt too much like we were the bad guys.''

HEADLINE: The Crying Game

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
We've had to adjust to so many strange developments lately. I'm sure we'll get used to having a speaker of the House who weeps a lot.
That would be John Boehner, the new guy.
''He is known to cry,'' the outgoing speaker, Nancy Pelosi, told Deborah Solomon in The Times Magazine. ''He cries sometimes when we're having a debate on bills.'' 
Pelosi, of course, does not cry in public. We will stop here briefly to contemplate what would happen if she, or any female lawmaker, broke into loud, nose-running sobs while discussing Iraq troop funding or giving a TV interview.
(Pause)
O.K., moving forward.
Boehner is a gravel-voiced Ohioan who wears snazzy suits and hangs out a lot with lobbyists. One of the few cheery prospects the new year holds for Democrats is his upcoming demonization, since there is no such thing in 21st-century America as a loveable leader of the House of Representatives. Unless America is totally won over by the idea of a Sobbing Speaker.
''I think people are going to like him,'' said Lesley Stahl, who interviewed Boehner for a ''60 Minutes'' segment shown last Sunday, during which he broke down several times.
The most arresting moment came when Boehner told Stahl he can no longer make visits to schools, or even look at the little kids on the playground, because he immediately starts crying.
That had me alarmed. I thought there was going to be some terrible story about an ailing child that would then force me to have warm and sympathetic thoughts about John Boehner.
But no. The reason, Boehner finally choked out, was because ''making sure these kids have a shot at the American dream, like I did, is important.''
We will stop again briefly to imagine what would have happened if Nancy Pelosi, upon being elected speaker, had confessed on national TV that she was unable to visit schools in her district because the sight of little children made her break into sobs.
(Pause)
O.K. About Boehner. Many of us first noticed his tendency toward tears when he appeared on election night to celebrate his party's taking control of the House. He had hardly gotten in front of the microphone before things got watery.
''I spent my whole life chasing (sob) the American dream,'' he told the cameras. ''Put myself through school, working every rotten job there was ...''
The American Dream has had such a bad year. During the campaign, it was tossed around by billionaire candidates who insisted on telling groups of underprivileged children that they, too, could someday own a mega-yacht or run a slimy but extremely profitable health care corporation.
Now, John Boehner is blaming the Dream for making him howl like an abandoned puppy. It's what my friend Rebecca Traister calls ''Boehner doing Masterpiece Theater on the hard life of John Boehner.''
Traister is the author of ''Big Girls Don't Cry,'' a chronicle of the Clinton-Obama battle for the Democratic presidential nomination. One of the best-remembered moments in that campaign -- Hillary Clinton cries in New Hampshire -- is an excellent example of the difference between what men and women can get away with, tear-wise.
''Hillary didn't cry,'' Traister pointed out. ''Not a drop of liquid fell below her lower lash.'' With her back to the wall and the presidency on the line, Clinton approached the edge of a sniffle and we are still talking about it. Boehner is driven to great, noisy sobs when he contemplates the fact that as a youth, he mopped the floor at his father's tavern.
Besides the crying gap between men and women, there's also one between Republicans and Democrats. On the one hand, you have the folks who can't afford tears because it makes them look weak, and on the other, the people who are presumed to be tough and hard-nosed, for whom crying is an attractive sign of complexity.
Boehner is opposed to extending unemployment benefits for the jobless, and he wants to kill off the law that guarantees health coverage to all Americans. So you know when he starts weeping when his wife says she's ''real proud'' of him, it's not a sign of softness.
In 2007, he cried while delivering a speech on the floor of the House, in support of funding for the war in Iraq. ''After 3,000 of our fellow citizens died at the hands of these terrorists, when are we going to stand up and take them on?'' he sobbed.
Then this year, he voted against providing money to take care of our fellow citizens who became ill while doing rescue and reclamation work at ground zero after the terrorist attack.
Twice.

HEADLINE: A Green Detroit? No, a Guzzling One

BYLINE: By EDWARD NIEDERMEYER. 
Edward Niedermeyer is the editor of the Web site The Truth About Cars.

 BODY:
Portland, Ore.
WHEN President Obama announced in March 2009 that his administration would guide General Motors and Chrysler through a government-financed bankruptcy, he made it clear that the taxpayers' $80 billion would buy nothing less than a sweeping transformation of the entire auto industry.
''This restructuring, as painful as it will be in the short term, will mark not an end, but a new beginning for a great American industry,'' he said, ''an auto industry that is once more outcompeting the world; a 21st-century auto industry that is creating new jobs, unleashing new prosperity and manufacturing the fuel-efficient cars and trucks that will carry us toward an energy-independent future.''
Now, nearly a year and a half after the two automakers exited bankruptcy, the administration has defined down the goals of the bailout, focusing on G.M.'s and Chrysler's return to profitability and job creation. Though these are promising developments that show the bailout has not been an unmitigated short-term failure, the new emphasis shows just how far the industry is from the kind of transformation we were promised. 
In particular, what Mr. Obama called his ''one goal'' -- having Detroit ''lead the world in building the next generation of clean cars'' -- is nowhere near being achieved. While the idea of improving G.M.'s and Chrysler's fuel efficiency was doubtless a politically popular justification for the bailout, American consumers have not embraced the goal with equal fervor. Sales of fuel-sipping compact and subcompact cars have actually dropped this year, while pickup and sport utility vehicle sales grew by double-digit percentages.
This dynamic is not limited to Detroit, as Honda and other foreign producers have seen their sales this year grow largely on the backs of light trucks. But, as the king of S.U.V. and pickup sales, Detroit has been the main beneficiary of the market's continued preference for less-efficient offerings.
At General Motors, sales of actual cars this year have fallen by nearly 6 percent compared with last year's anemic numbers, while light trucks (which include pickup trucks, S.U.V.'s, minivans and crossovers) are up by more than 16 percent. Despite rolling out the much-hyped Cruze compact and the Volt plug-in hybrid, G.M. still sells half again as many trucks and S.U.V.'s as it does cars. This year 73 percent of Chrysler's sales have been light trucks.
It's true that most modern crossovers are more efficient than the truck-based S.U.V.'s that kept Detroit afloat in the 1990s. But American producers collectively remain a long way from contending for green car leadership. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the Detroit automakers have three of the four lowest average fleet fuel economy ratings among full-line manufacturers, and none achieves the industry average of 22.5 miles per gallon.
Detroit seems aware of this troubling dependence on trucks and S.U.V.'s. G.M.'s chief executive, Dan Akerson, recently warned that his company needs a plan to deal with a possible gas price shock and announced the hiring of 1,000 engineers and researchers, ostensibly to work on high-mileage vehicles. But recent history shows that automakers are just as vulnerable to credit crunches and other economic shocks as they are to sharp increases in energy prices. On this front, Detroit is falling back into the bad habits that led G.M. and Chrysler to collapse.
At the height of Detroit's S.U.V. boom, impressive per-unit profit margins gave rise to a number of tactics -- cash rebates from manufacturers, low-interest loans and the like -- that increased short-term sales at the expense of long-term viability. Today we are seeing a similar pattern. Incentives like rebates help push vehicles off lots but erode brand equity and resale values that help automakers compete over the long term. G.M. and Chrysler still lead the industry with above-average amounts of cash on the hood of each car they sell.
Another troubling trend is an increase in fleet sales -- the delivery of huge numbers of units to corporations and government agencies. While fleet sales improve short-term volume, the profit margins are slim and the practice can hurt long-term sales as consumers come to view the models as unsexy ''fleet queens.'' And Detroit has gorged on such sales in 2010, with some 32 percent of all vehicles from the Big Three sold through October going to fleet operators. Furthermore, a quarter of all the hybrids built by Detroit since President Obama took office have been bought by federal agencies, showing that enthusiasm for Detroit's hybrids is limited somewhat to government fleet buyers.
In addition, even when it comes to the trucks and S.U.V.'s that Americans actually do want to buy, the bailed-out automakers are building vehicles faster than they can be bought. Inventory levels at both companies have ballooned this year, to the point where G.M. now has nearly three months' worth of sales sitting on its lots and Chrysler's excess inventory (in terms of days of supply) is exceeded only by such marginal players as Saab, Mitsubishi, Suzuki and Mazda.
Allowing new cars to pile up on lots may well be the most deadly of Detroit's new-old bad habits, as the practice not only artificially inflates sales numbers (which, ridiculously, are booked upon production, not when a vehicle is driven off the lot), but also lead to yet more incentives, fleet sales, subsidized leases and subprime lending.
And if Detroit's slipping into bad old habits wasn't distressing enough, the bailouts have created a perverse new dynamic. With G.M. stock now being publicly traded on Wall Street, taxpayers have every incentive to cheer on the bailed-out automaker as it overproduces vehicles and pushes cheap credit. After all, the sooner G.M.'s stock hits a certain level -- likely around $52 per share -- the sooner the Treasury can sell its remaining equity and get taxpayers out of risk.
That day, however, looks further and further off. G.M. stock has yet to get back to the $36 a share price it reached on its first day of trading last month; and even in a best-case scenario taxpayers will be on the hook for Chrysler until at least 2013. And that's assuming gas prices don't rise sharply and the credit markets don't freeze up again.
Even if taxpayers do get their money back, Detroit's blithe resumption of its old ways could bring America's automakers back to Washington someday, hat in hand. If so, let's hope that with the benefit of hindsight, taxpayers will know not to expect transformation from an industry that seems so clearly set in its ways.

HEADLINE: DEMOCRATS YIELD AS SENATE PASSES BIG TAX PACKAGE

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Janie Lorber contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Senate on Wednesday approved the $858 billion tax plan negotiated by the White House and Republican leaders, and House Democrats said they expected to pass the bill on Thursday after a final, and seemingly futile, effort to change a provision that benefits wealthy estates.
The Senate vote was 81 to 19 as Democrats yielded in their long push to end the Bush-era lowered tax rates for high-income taxpayers. Republicans agreed to back a huge economic stimulus package, including an extension of jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed and a one-year payroll-tax cut for most workers, with the entire cost added to the federal deficit.
It was the first concrete product of a new era of divided government and acid compromise.
In the House, Democratic leaders said they would bring the bill to the floor on Thursday along with an amendment to tax more estates at a higher rate. Democrats predicted privately that the amendment would be rejected and the package approved, but the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, was not ready to concede. 
''We will make our point,'' Ms. Pelosi said at a news conference Wednesday evening, in which she repeated her opposition, shared by many Democrats, to the provision granting a tax exemption to estates of up to $5 million per person, or $10 million per couple. Republicans have said they will not accept any change.
Other Democrats predicted the tax plan would be passed as is on Thursday, making clear that their initial fury at the prospect of extending Bush-era tax rates even on the highest incomes had given way to acceptance that the White House, its leverage weakened by midterm election losses, had negotiated the best compromise it could. President Obama urged Congress again on Wednesday to pass the bill unchanged and without delay.
Mr. Obama praised the Senate action, calling the bill ''a win for American families, American businesses and our economic recovery,'' even as he nodded to the tough bargain he had struck, adding, ''It includes some provisions that I oppose.''
Some Democrats said they had concluded that the administration had won important concessions to help middle-income Americans as well as the unemployed while giving a short-term jolt to the struggling economy. Others said they simply could not be held responsible for allowing all of the Bush-era tax cuts to expire at the end of the month, raising taxes on everyone.
The Senate's overwhelming approval of the tax plan was a brief flash of bipartisan cooperation amid the deep partisan acrimony in the waning days of the 111th Congress. The tax plan was supported by 43 Democrats, 37 Republicans and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut. Opposed were 13 Democrats, 5 Republicans and Senator Bernard Sanders, independent of Vermont. Mr. Lieberman and Mr. Sanders caucus with the Democrats.
''A tremendous accomplishment,'' the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, declared shortly before the vote on Wednesday. ''Whether you agree with all the contents of the bill or not, everyone should understand this is one of the major accomplishments of any Congress where two parties, ideologically divided, have agreed on a major issue for the American people.''
The two-year tax measure will touch virtually every American -- poor and rich, old and young, married or single, with children or living alone, and even those who die. And, with a reprise of this year's contentious debate now slated for the height of the 2012 presidential campaign, the bill is likely to be a precursor to a broader effort by Mr. Obama to overhaul the nation's labyrinthine tax code and begin tackling the long-term deficit.
The tax plan would extend all of the lowered income tax rates enacted under President George W. Bush, as well as the 15 percent rate on capital gains and dividends, which were due to expire at the end of this month.
And it would set new estate tax parameters, including the exemption of $5 million per person, or $10 million per couple, and a maximum rate of 35 percent. All these provisions would last for two years. The estate tax lapsed entirely this year, but was set to return on Jan. 1 with an exemption of $1 million per person and a maximum rate of 55 percent.
The bill would also keep jobless aid flowing to the long-term unemployed for 13 more months, maintaining extended limits, which now range from 60 weeks in states with less than 6 percent joblessness to 99 weeks in states where the unemployment rate is more than 8.5 percent. Benefits normally last for 26 weeks.
The one-year payroll tax cut would reduce to 4.2 percent the 6.2 percent Social Security tax levied on income up to $106,800. For a family with $50,000 in annual income, the cut would yield tax savings of about $1,000. For a worker paying the maximum tax, it would provide savings of $2,136.
The bill also contains an array of other tax breaks for individuals and businesses, aimed at pumping up the economy. It continues a college tuition credit for some families, an expanded child tax credit and the earned income tax credit. It also includes a two-year adjustment to the alternative minimum tax to prevent as many as 21 million more households from being hit by it, and it contains a provision allowing businesses to write off certain expenses more quickly.
The tax deal was sealed in back-channel talks between Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. It offered a glimpse of a new power dynamic that is likely to characterize the next two years, as Republicans take control of the House and occupy six more seats in the Senate.
Democratic opponents of the plan said it would overly benefit the wealthiest Americans and not do enough for the working class and the poor, and that the money used to continue reduced tax rates on the highest incomes could be better spent on other steps to stimulate the economy. Before the vote on Wednesday, Mr. McConnell denounced the effort by Democrats to approve a $1.1 trillion spending bill that would finance the government through the end of the federal fiscal year on Sept. 30.
Mr. McConnell called on Democrats to approve a stop-gap spending measure that would last only through the early part of next year instead, and to abandon everything else on their agenda and adjourn for the year.
Democrats, however, are refusing to back down on any of their priorities, which include the omnibus spending bill, the New Start arms control treaty with Russia, a bill to repeal the military's ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy barring open service by gay men and lesbians, and an immigration measure that would create a path to citizenship for certain illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children.
The spending bill in particular has incited a contentious battle. Senator Daniel K. Inouye, Democrat of Hawaii and chairman of the Appropriations Committee, said he believed he had the votes to pass it. Senate Republicans have denounced the bill, which includes hundreds of lawmaker-directed spending items known as earmarks, only to face blistering questions about earmarks they themselves had requested.
Aides to Mr. Reid said they had mapped out a path to securing votes on all of the legislation, which would mean staying in session until next Thursday, two days before Christmas, and potentially returning the week before New Year's Day.

HEADLINE: Making It, Until a Slip on the Ice Threw Life Into Crisis

BYLINE: By ANDREW KEH

 BODY:
In February, Evelyn De La Cruz slipped on a patch of ice on the sidewalk and felt a sharp pain in her left ankle.
She told herself that it did not hurt, that it was not a big deal.
She could not afford for it to be a big deal.
But the next morning, it was clear something was wrong. 
''I was hysterically crying, because while I had all this pain, all I could think of was time off from work without pay,'' Ms. De La Cruz said in an interview at her apartment in Rockaway Beach, Queens. ''And, oh my God, that was even more painful.''
Ms. De La Cruz, 50, is one of an untold number of Americans whose lives fell into disarray at the start of the current recession, one of a legion of New Yorkers who had been living comfortably for years, until suddenly, shockingly, they were not.
The worst has passed, she said, but the experiences are raw in her mind.
Ms. De La Cruz's troubles began in January 2009, when she lost her job as an executive assistant at Planned Parenthood. ''I never saw it coming,'' she said.
A severance package and weekly unemployment checks helped, but they were barely enough for her to pay the $1,600 rent on her apartment and support her daughter Erica, 20, the youngest of her three children.
Falling behind on her rent and desperate for work, Ms. De La Cruz applied for more than 200 jobs. Three companies called her for interviews; none panned out.
''With the stress, I started not being able to sleep at night,'' she said. Doubts about her ability to get a job crept into her mind. ''That brought me so much fear, the thought that as I get older, it was getting more difficult to find a job, that the skills, maybe, are not there.''
Ms. De La Cruz's luck turned late that summer when, out of the blue, one of her old bosses offered her a job at the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, where her ex-boss was working. Ms. De La Cruz accepted the job and carefully began saving her money. By winter, although she was still a month behind on her rent, it seemed as if that weight could soon be lifted from her shoulders.
Then came that patch of ice.
The day after Ms. De La Cruz fell, she learned that she had broken her ankle and would require surgery. The rehabilitation kept her out of work for six weeks; during that time, her only income was the $170 she received each week in disability payments.
After being so close to paying off her debts, she fell even further behind on her rent, and in March, her landlord gave her an eviction notice. She was given until April to pay $3,830 in rent arrears.
The thought of losing the apartment where she had lived for six years rattled her. She realized she had become deeply attached to the beach, which had calmed her in her most anxious moments. ''I love Rockaway,'' she said. ''I love my apartment. I could not imagine moving from here.''
Ms. De La Cruz was referred to Margert Community Corporation, a housing counseling agency that helped her procure grants of $2,440 from the Bridge Fund of New York City and $1,000 from the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of the seven organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
Ms. De La Cruz was able to pay the overdue rent and remain in the apartment, where she hopes to stay for years to come.
She is back at work now, trying to save, still living check to check. But her experience, humbling and harrowing as it was, also reassured her about what might come.
''I was a little embarrassed that I had to do this,'' Ms. De La Cruz said of seeking assistance. ''But I was also comforted, in a way, knowing that even in this economy there are still people and organizations that are trying to help.''
HOW TO HELP: Checks payable to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund may be sent to 4 Chase Metrotech Center, 7th Floor East, Lockbox 5193, Brooklyn, N.Y. 11245.

HEADLINE: Even the Tree Has a Stylist

BYLINE: By PENELOPE GREEN

 BODY:
CAMPION PLATT, an architect known for designing swanky spaces like Manhattan's MercBar, renovated the Upper West Side town house owned by his publicist, R. Couri Hay, this year. And as a special favor, later this week he plans to decorate Mr. Hay's Christmas tree for him. There will be lavender tinsel, one garland of signed Warhol dollar bills and another made from celebrity photographs Mr. Hay snipped from magazines during the year -- images of his ''favorite scandals and beauties,'' Mr. Platt said, including Tiger Woods, Lindsay Lohan and Carla Bruni. A video installation showing moody black-and-white Manhattan holiday images, which is also Mr. Platt's firm's Christmas greeting, will be playing continuously on Mr. Hay's flat-screen television. To be sure, Mr. Platt is doing a bit of cross-pollinating by planting his name on Mr. Hay's festivities, but he is also making sure that the decorations for Mr. Hay's annual Christmas party are on a par with the interior architecture. 
For those who regularly avail themselves of the services of decorators and designers, the holiday decorations may be part of the service contract. In some cases, like Mr. Platt's efforts for Mr. Hay, it's brand protection for the designers, as well as an assist to a friend. That is why Rick Garofalo performed a holiday zhoosh in the Chelsea studio of his friend and client Penelope Zabolotney, helping prep ''her cocoon of pale,'' as Mr. Garofalo described the taupe-and-white space he decorated for Ms. Zabolotney, a design director at Coach, for the all-white Christmas party she gives every December. There was a fluffy white artificial tree pocked with silvery ornaments, and cylindrical vases filled with white feathers and calla lilies. For the party last year, Mr. Garofalo even made white cocktails to match.
For clients with three or four homes, what many would consider a holiday perk may be more of a necessity. Consider the needs of a European couple with a young family -- 4-year-old twin boys -- who live abroad but maintain a house in Connecticut and a penthouse on the Upper East Side, which they like to visit at Christmas. For six years, their decorator, Scott Salvator, has shouldered the Manhattan portion of the holiday preparations for them, ordering the 12-foot Douglas fir, the ropes of pine garlands, the Noble pine wreaths. Mr. Salvator also arranges for the building's superintendent and the housekeeper to help unearth the family of nutcrackers that he bought, and the ribbons and ornaments he has collected, from the storage bin in the basement, so that he and his associates can swag the place like a Victorian engraving, a task he completed last Saturday, just hours before the family arrived. (The tree is due Thursday.)
''This just goes to the notion that an interior designer is a full-service provider,'' Mr. Salvator said. ''As opposed to being someone who just shops. You are creating a lifestyle.''
On Friday, he spent seven hours in Manhattan's flower district on 28th Street, searching for ''a few things to fill in,'' he said. He spent Saturday fluffing the penthouse. A holiday fully designed by this decorator might cost anywhere from $5,000 to $50,000 -- at first, the cost of decorating the penthouse for the holidays was in the tens of thousands while Mr. Salvator was still accumulating the elements -- but he would rather you didn't call him. His holiday fluffing is meted out to just two very special clients, neither of whom live in New York, and it wears him out.
He recalled one particularly arduous Christmas he orchestrated in the Hamptons: the long drive out in a painter's van on Dec. 24, when he crouched in the back with a hair dryer aimed at the still-wet faux-marble top of a wall console a carpenter was waiting to install. When Mr. Salvator and his partner, Michael Zabriskie, arrived, they parked a few streets away from the house, in case the objects of all this fluffing -- the chief executive ''of a major corporation'' and his family -- arrived and saw the van.
''We trimmed the tree, put the logs in the fire and candles everywhere, throughout which time Michael was eating, without meaning to, all the Christmas cookies the housekeeper had prepared, so she had to make more,'' Mr. Salvator said.
At dusk, ''as the family came in the front door, we snuck out the back, walking through other people's properties to find our van. We didn't want the family to see us and feel guilty that we were there till the last hour. It's like good dancing -- the trick is to not make it look hard.''
This year, Robin Bell, a Connecticut designer, is producing a camouflage-print Christmas for three generations of a Midwestern family (eight adults and four children) who spend the holiday together at their rambling, shingle-style farmhouse in Salisbury, Conn. The other day, Ms. Bell was knee-deep in props, sorting out the gifts she would be tucking into the camouflage-print tote bags she had bought to use in lieu of stockings, the totes being a family tradition she thought up for them a few years ago.
She ticked off the elements: ''Camouflage braces and bow ties for the men; boudoir pillows. I'm looking for camo-print shams. I'm looking for fleece blankets. There will be thermal underwear in gray with monograms, travel umbrellas and flashlights.''
She plans to wrap presents in white vellum and brown kraft paper, and tie them up with twine. Extra paper and twine will be delivered to the house, so the clients can wrap their own gifts following her template, she said.
''We're doing the tree Saturday'' -- with only white lights and no ornaments, Ms. Bell's signature -- and ''we go heavily armed with glue guns. There's lots of boxwood. When people have more than one house, they want to arrive and hit the ground running.''
Ms. Bell is down to two outsourced Christmases, she said. ''One year I did six, and that was really too much. Salisbury is the most exhausting.''
How much does she charge?
''Not enough, according to my husband.''
James Hunter, a project designer for Paul Wiseman, a San Francisco-based decorator whose work shows up frequently in Architectural Digest, had a budget of $5,000 to decorate a 1920s house the firm had recently completed in Hillsborough, near San Francisco. A money manager and his family of five moved in last August, and a week ago the wife asked for a fluff for a holiday party. Mr. Hunter deployed magnolia and pine garlands, gold ribbons and candles, and even some wrapped presents, ''to give it some glamour,'' he said.
''Holiday fluffing is a complimentary service,'' he added. ''It makes the client look good, and it makes our decorating look good.''
His boss, Mr. Wiseman, cautioned that this sort of service is rare, for good reason. He remembered the year he complained to a client that her tree wasn't quite up to snuff, taste-wise. ''It was a really beautiful house'' -- it had, in fact, appeared in Architectural Digest -- ''and she always had the tree done, but it always looked like the work of a department store,'' Mr. Wiseman said. ''Which I told her. She grabbed me by the collar and said, 'O.K., sucker, you do it!' I went through all my ornaments and all of hers, and I thought it might take a morning. Two days later, I was done. That was three or four years ago, and I have not decorated my own tree, or any tree, since.''
Indeed, many decorators wince at the prospect. ''It sounds like hell,'' Darren Henault said. ''I can barely get it together to decorate my own.''
Or as Jeffrey Bilhuber put it: ''It's something I would prefer not to think about, let alone do. It's just not my job.''
It is the job, however, of florists like Connie Plaissay, the principal of Plaza Florists on East 69th Street, who handles Christmas for many on the Upper East Side, including the St. James Church on Madison Avenue, with gusto and great good humor. ''I love Christmas,'' he said.
Mr. Plaissay's is an indoor-outdoor service: window boxes filled with boxwood and pine; garlands of pine and magnolia up and down a town house's stairs and mantels; trees for each floor, which he has handpicked early in the growing season in northwestern Pennsylvania and delivers, sets up and trims, in some cases with ornaments from his store. One Park Avenue triplex he decorates every year for about $30,000 takes two days and six people to complete.
This year, Mr. Plaissay is working with celadon green, aubergine and gunmetal glass balls, and satin ribbons in lavender and peach, chocolate brown and burgundy. Business fell off 35 percent last year, he said, because of the economy, but as of last week, his orders were exceeding last year's.
''We started before Thanksgiving,'' he said, ''because so many people said they were leaving town before Christmas.''
Malcolm Kutner, a Manhattan designer, also started before Thanksgiving to help a German client decorate her second home, a 20,000-square-foot triplex loft, for both holidays. ''It's very themed and schemed -- very funky with pine garlands and gourds that we spray-paint in silver and gold,'' Mr. Kutner said. ''It's very collaborative; she gives me a shopping list of what she wants to work with, and I make it happen.''
The most famous outsourced Christmas, of course, is at the White House, where the holiday decorating was overseen this year by Laura Dowling, its chief floral designer, and installed by hundreds of volunteers, as HGTV viewers saw in a program Sunday evening. The star is the Blue Room Christmas tree, decorated this year in ornaments designed by students at the Savannah College of Art and Design in natural materials, in service to Michelle Obama's theme of ''Simple Gifts.''
No mention was made of last year's decorations, which were partially styled by Simon Doonan, the creative director of Barneys New York. Tinselgate, as Mr. Doonan described it, erupted when a conservative blogger noted that one Blue Room tree ornament showed a photograph of Mao Zedong, and another a photograph of a drag queen named Hedda Lettuce. ''White House Commie-Chic Xmas,'' read one blog post.
But there was no socialist plot: The Blue Room tree's theme last year was monuments, and the ornaments were put together by civic groups all over the country. The Mao ornament came from Pittsburgh, a nod to that city's famous son and monument, Andy Warhol. And Ms. Lettuce had been helping out in a gay seniors' center, where she decoupaged her green-wigged photo onto an ornament.
Mr. Doonan, who spoofs pop culture every year in his Christmas windows for Barneys, said the White House is the only other holiday zhoosh he has been persuaded to do. ''By the time December rolls around, I am tinseled out,'' he said. ''The Obamas were, for obvious reasons, the exception. It was the apotheosis of my career as a holiday elf.'' Mr. Doonan has largely recovered.
Phoebe Howard, however, a Southern decorator based in Jacksonville, Fla., who got into the design business by way of her Christmas decorating, still shudders at her efforts. Fourteen years ago, she was, as she put it, a housewife with four children looking for some extra cash to plump up her own holiday extravaganza. ''I'd tell my kids, 'This is going to be the best Christmas ever!' '' she said. ''And then worry I wouldn't be able to pull it off.''
She and a friend charged a flat rate of $300 for a soup-to-nuts service: setting up the tree, hanging garlands and wreaths, placing paperwhites in strategic locations.
''I didn't do the tree, though I'd put the lights on and set the ornaments by the tree,'' Ms. Howard said. ''I'd tell them to have some forced family fun later on. I think so many people don't want to do the holiday decorations. It would be one thing if your husband and your children would be involved. They say they will, but they mostly scatter, and I think most women feel strapped by it all. Right now, there's a tree lying on my back porch, and every day I say I'm going to drag it in, and then every day I say I'm going to do it tomorrow.''
Recently, a decorating client called Ms. Howard and asked her if she would do Christmas for her, for old times' sake. Ms. Howard's reply?
''I told her I'd rather pump her gas.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Consumer Prices Made Small Gains in November

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Consumer prices in the United States rose slightly less than expected in November, and prices excluding food and energy edged up for the first time since July, according to a report on Wednesday that implied virtually no inflation pressures as an anemic recovery continued. 
Another report said the nation's industrial output rose 0.4 percent in November, its biggest gain since July and the latest sign of a firmer end to the year for the nation's economy.
On the inflation front, the Labor Department said its Consumer Price Indexnudged up 0.1 percent as energy prices rose by the smallest amount in five months, slowing from a 0.2 percent increase in October. The core index, which excludes food and energy, ticked up 0.1 percent as expected, after being flat for three straight months.
Economists had expected overall consumer prices to rise 0.2 percent in November.
The rise in industrial output in November, reported by the Federal Reserve, was above a median forecast of 0.3 percent in a Reuters poll, and followed a downward revision of October's reading from flat to a decline of 0.2 percent.
Output rose 5.4 percent compared with one year earlier, according to the data. A spike in utilities partly offset a 6.0 percent decline in the production of motor vehicles and parts.
Capacity use, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, rose to 75.2 points in November from a revised 74.9 in October, but remained substantially below its long-term average.
Officials at the Fed tend to look at utilization measures as a signal of how much ''slack'' remains in the economy -- how much room growth has to run before becoming inflationary.
Also on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said its gauge of manufacturing in the state rebounded in December after falling sharply in the previous month, led by growth in new orders and shipments.
The Empire State Manufacturing Survey's general business conditions index climbed 22 points, to 10.57, in December from minus 11.14 in November.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a reading of 5 points for December.
The new-orders index rose to 2.60 points in December from a minus 24.38 last month, while shipments rebounded to 7.11 from minus 6.13.
Employment gauges deteriorated, however. The index for the number of employees fell to a negative 3.41 in December, the lowest in a year, from 9.09 in November. The average employee workweek index slipped to minus 14.77 from minus 12.99.
The index of business conditions six months ahead dropped to 48.86 in December from 54.55 in November.
The survey of New York manufacturing plants is one of the earliest monthly guideposts to factory conditions.

HEADLINE: A-List Parties: More Taste, Less Flash

BYLINE: By ALEX WILLIAMS

 BODY:
AMONG the heirloom antiques that Bronson Van Wyck, the Manhattan party planner, keeps in his cavernous Flatiron district apartment is a giant map of England from the 1930s, on which each social engagement of King George VI was meticulously plotted.
''This was found rolled up in a closet in Princess Margaret's apartment at Kensington Palace after she died,'' said Mr. Van Wyck, 37, his voice as dry as a 10-parts-to-1 martini. ''I bought it from her son.''
Dressed like an Oxford don in heavy gray wool pants and a maroon Burberry cardigan, Mr. Van Wyck explained how the king's social secretary recorded each royal visit with a handwritten four-digit code. The result looks like a battle map.
''I wonder if he knew that every time he came to town, someone like me had worked for days or weeks or months in advance to organize things,'' he said. 
Lately, it is Mr. Van Wyck's own social calendar that has been getting a workout. Earlier this fall, he kicked off the social season by organizing 12 A-list events in 12 days, including the Whitney Museum of American Art gala, Hugh Jackman's party at the Museum of Modern Art and Denise Rich's Angel Ball, in addition to corporate events for Kenneth Cole and Ann Taylor.
His peers have taken notice. Mr. Van Wyck was recently named the readers'-choice event designer of the year by BizBash, a prominent industry journal.
Meanwhile, he remains a party planner of choice for the hush-hush billionaire set -- folks like George Soros, David Koch and Rupert Murdoch, who appreciate his more low-key approach. ''We don't play the ace when we can win with the king,'' Mr. Van Wyck explained.
In a holiday season that is looking brighter, Mr. Van Wyck's busy schedule is further proof that the affluent have granted themselves permission to entertain again. ''The phone didn't ring for five months,'' he said, recalling the dark days of early 2009 when lavish parties would have seemed gauche.
Still, entertaining with unemployment rates around 10 percent requires a degree of sensitivity, he said. The party cliches from the boom times -- ice-sculpture swans, Cristal-filled tables, out-of-season flower arrangements the size of a Subaru -- invite questions of taste nowadays.
Less flash has been good for Mr. Van Wyck. As the president of Van Wyck & Van Wyck, an event production company and marketing company he runs with his mother, Mary Lynn, and his sister, Mimi, his events are known for being tastefully understated and elegant.
''It comes to discretion, it comes to quality -- we're not doing loud things,'' he said. ''We're creating experiences that are not about the 300,000th Ecuadorean rose. Our brand has never been one of excess; it's been one of good taste.''
At a dinner for Massimo Ferragamo at the Ferragamo store on Fifth Avenue in July, for example, Mr. Van Wyck said he resisted the temptation to drape the tables in $400-a-yard Scalamandre fabric, opting instead for canvas -- albeit, canvas painted with images from the frescoes of the Palazzo Spini Feroni in Florence, Italy, which houses the Salvatore Ferragamo Museum.
It's all about personalizing the experience, he said. ''If it's for Calvin Klein, we want to make it look like Francisco Costa took a break from designing clothes and designed a party,'' he explained. ''If it's for Anne Ford, we want people to say, 'It's so you. ...' ''
It doesn't hurt that Mr. Van Wyck displays a natural ease in mingling with people of extreme wealth who prefer not to shout about it. After all, he is a Van Wyck, a family that settled in New York in the 1660s, when it was still New Amsterdam. He is a descendant of Robert Anderson Van Wyck, who became the first mayor of the newly unified New York after the consolidation of the five boroughs in 1898. (And, yes, the Van Wyck Expressway, which links Kennedy Airport with Brooklyn and Queens, is named after him.)
There's not much in his carriage that suggests that Bronson Van Wyck grew up on a farm in Tuckerman, Ark. The farm, however, had been in his mother's family for generations. His parents settled there after his father finished Harvard Business School, and his father approached agriculture in the Mississippi Delta with entrepreneurial zeal, he said. It was not a small farm, but don't ask how many acres. ''That's one of those questions like, 'How much did money did you make last year?' '' he said. From there, he continued through Groton and Yale.
As his pedigree might suggest, Mr. Van Wyck could have stepped out of a Whit Stillman movie fully hatched. Each sentence seems to be sprung from coy diffidence and measured irony. Fittingly, his crew members are outfitted in T-shirts with the British wartime slogan ''Keep Calm and Carry On.''
His aristocratic manner served him well after Yale, when he took a State Department internship in Paris, where he helped organize parties for Pamela Harriman, then the United States ambassador to France. Learning to put parties together under one of the 20th century's renowned hostesses was like learning guitar from Eric Clapton. It was an inspiration, he said.
''She appeared effortlessly elegant, and the way she entertained appeared effortless,'' Mr. Van Wyck recalled of Mrs. Harriman. ''But to appear effortless takes a hell of a lot of work. If you want to be the duck who appears to be gliding across the water, you better have your feet kicking pretty hard beneath the surface.''
His career in diplomacy got sidetracked when he decamped to Hollywood and decided to make a go of it in the film industry, with a string of jobs that included reading scripts, designing sets and acting. But life as a film drone wasn't for him. One Sunday, staring at a stack of unread scripts, he called his mother for support. She asked him what he'd want to do that weekend, if he could do anything. Have a party, he answered.
'''Well, let's go figure out how to get paid for that,' '' he remembered her saying.
Mr. Van Wyck's first job as a planner was for the wedding of a friend, Marina Rust Connor, a Vogue editor and Marshall Field heiress, on Islesboro, a small island in Maine. He modeled the rehearsal dinner after a traditional clambake, complete with a tent illuminated by wrought-iron chandeliers, its ceiling covered in mattress ticking turned inside out. Photos of the party appeared in Vogue. A career was born.
Mr. Van Wyck was still in his 20s when he brokered his diplomatic and family connections and started giving parties full time on New York's and Washington's social circuit. He was hired to organize George W. Bush's inauguration in 2001 (he had been booked to do Al Gore's inauguration when the election was still in dispute, he said).
Despite his preppy sensibilities, Mr. Van Wyck is careful to avoid making his events feel like a stuffy summer cotillion. Vulgarity, as Cyril Connolly said, is the garlic in the salad of taste, so for a recent surprise birthday party given for the developer Richard LeFrak by his sons, Harrison and Jamie, Mr. Van Wyck brought in a six-foot-in-diameter disco ball and planted a lava lamp on every table.
This being 2010, he was careful not to go too over the top. There were ''no flowers, no cage dancers and no tropical orchids -- but we probably wouldn't have suggested those things, anyway,'' Mr. Van Wyck said. ''Well, maybe the cage dancers.''

HEADLINE: Auto Research Group Says Mileage Mandate Will Cost Jobs

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
YPSILANTI, Mich. -- A study by an auto industry research group said on Wednesday that requiring automakers to meet fuel economy standards of 60 miles per gallon by 2025 would decrease sales because cars and trucks would become more expensive, and could eliminate up to 1.3 million jobs nationwide. 
Such a requirement, which is under consideration by the Obama administration and supported by some environmental groups, could actually increase emissions if many people avoid buying new vehicles and hold on to less efficient ones longer, the group, the Center for Automotive Research, said. The worst case would be for the government to enact aggressive standards and for gasoline prices to remain low, Sean McAlinden, the group's chief economist, said.
Under Mr. McAlinden's projections, the cost of a vehicle by 2025 would increase by an average of $9,147, or about 23 percent. At the same time, given the higher fuel-efficiency requirements, drivers would save an average of $2,693 over the life of the vehicle if gasoline were $3.50 a gallon or $4,616 if it were $6 a gallon.
An increase in costs would cause the industry to sell 4.5 million fewer vehicles a year, resulting in the loss of about 222,000 jobs at carmakers and their suppliers, Mr. McAlinden said. The group says each job in the auto industry supports about six jobs in the broader community.
''The higher the mandate and the lower the gasoline price, the lower the employment,'' he said.
For 2010, the government requires automakers to meet corporate average fuel economy standards of 27.5 m.p.g. for passenger cars and 23.5 m.p.g. for pickups, sport utility vehicles and other light trucks. The standard rises to 35.5 m.p.g. for cars and trucks combined by 2016.
Advocates of the higher standards say they are necessary to reduce energy usage and dependency on foreign oil, but critics say they prevent automakers from developing new vehicles to suit consumers' tastes. Consumers flocked to small cars in 2008 as gas prices surged above $4 a gallon, but truck sales have rebounded this year amid stable gas prices.
''Cars are consumer products, and the consumer is fickle,'' Mike Omotoso, the senior manager of global powertrain forecasting at J. D. Power & Associates, said. ''We have to satisfy consumer demand.''

HEADLINE: The Case for Renewable Ethanol

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Good Energy Subsidies, and Bad'' (editorial, Dec. 9): 
If you want to enact smart energy policy, let's start by increasing the use of the only available, affordable alternative to oil today: homegrown, renewable ethanol.
In 2009, the ethanol industry contributed $53.3 billion to the nation's gross domestic product, created and supported more than 400,000 American jobs, and reduced oil imports by 364 million barrels. And studies show that ethanol is 59 percent cleaner than gasoline.
The only reason the ethanol industry needs government support today is that we are denied access to all but 10 percent of the fuel market. Growth Energy's Fueling Freedom plan would redirect tax credits to build out a national ethanol infrastructure to allow access to a fair and open market. As a result, our air would be cleaner, our prosperity would be enhanced and our security would be strengthened. That is smart policy.
Wesley K. Clark Little Rock, Ark., Dec. 9, 2010
The writer, the retired general, is co-chairman of Growth Energy.

HEADLINE: A Business Owner Reflects on a Failure To Pay His Taxes

BYLINE: By RICHARD RYS

 BODY:
On his way from Philadelphia to the Jersey Shore for some senior-week revelry in the early '80s, 17-year-old Gary Barbera had business on his mind. He had seen a newspaper advertisement for a 1971 Chevy Nova and decided to buy it -- not for cruising with his buddies but as an investment. Later that week, after giving the Nova a good wash and some detailing, he sold his very first car, at a profit of $360.
Two years later, the 19-year-old was running a Buick dealership. In his mid-20s, he says, he became the youngest Chrysler dealer in the country. His success continued, and he was consistently named a top-rated dealer in the mid-Atlantic region with annual sales that exceeded $100 million. He later added a General Motors dealership. His aggressive advertising -- including a 2009 commercial that featured a President Obama look-alike offering cash for clunkers -- helped make him a household name in Philadelphia. 
But his small-business success story took a dark turn in 2007, when the Internal Revenue Service began an investigation of Mr. Barbera's financial practices. The inquiry revealed $77,675 in unpaid taxes, mostly on a number of Chrysler ''dealer reward'' bonus checks issued in his name. The I.R.S. concluded that Mr. Barbera had been deliberately ''skimming'' income to avoid paying taxes and filed charges.
Now 46, Mr. Barbera recently pleaded guilty to one felony count of filing false tax returns. He was ordered to pay $119,744.55 in restitution and interest plus a $30,000 fine and is serving three years' probation. Under house arrest, he wears an ankle bracelet but can go to work to run his Philadelphia dealership.
While Mr. Barbera's case is a cautionary tale for those owners who do not have rigorous accounting systems in place -- as well as for those who may be tempted to shield some income -- he says his business is actually recovering quite well from both the recession and his personal struggles.
Here is a condensed version of a recent conversation.
Q.How did you get into the car business?
A. My dad had a gas station and a car wash/repair center, and I worked there. Some kids want to be firemen or police. I always knew I wanted to sell cars.
Q.So what did you do?
A. I went to Kutner Buick in Northeast Philadelphia. I was 17 years old and I told the manager if I'm not the top salesman in the first month, don't hire me. I wasn't 18, so I wasn't old enough to work there. He let me sell and put the deals in someone else's name. In 1989, I shopped around for a dealership, and Chrysler was really doing bad. I was able to get in with very minimal up front.
Q.What made you a good car salesman?
A. Everyone says I'm a natural at marketing. It just came to me.
Q.Do you still enjoy the business?
A. It's in my blood. It's immediate gratification. I like the constant measure of knowing how I'm doing.
Q.What was your reaction when the I.R.S. began its investigation?
A. Great. Let them look, because they're not going to find anything.
Q.You didn't realize that you had unreported income for 2003 and 2004?
A. At the time, of course I didn't. They weren't secret checks. But the problem was they were not picked up by the accountant.
Q.Why do you say the accountant should have picked it up? If you put the check in your business account, how could he miss it? If you put it in your personal account, how could he catch it?
A. I take full responsibility for those checks. So you say, O.K., Gary, how did it happen? I should have double-checked to make sure the accountant picked it up.
Q.But you pleaded guilty to deliberately ''skimming'' those checks, didn't you?
A. The prosecution uses that word. They have cookie-cutter words -- ''skimming'' is one of them.
Q.According to your plea agreement, most dealers have those checks made out to the company.
A. It's an option.
Q.You got personal checks and put them in a personal account and kept track of it in a separate set of books.
A. That's why I'm saying I take full responsibility for those checks not being accounted for. You can do whatever you want, but at the end of the year, you better pick up every red cent.
Q.Looking back, is there anything you would do differently?
A. Yes. My accountant sent me into the I.R.S. meeting without a lawyer and without him, and everybody I talked to said you never do that.
Q.What was discussed at this meeting?
A. Um, y'know, I really can't recall.
Q. There's nothing in the court records that indicate you met with anyone on your own, except for one time when you pulled an I.R.S. investigator aside to say it was all your accountant's fault.
A. Well, I really don't remember that either.
Q.You felt the I.R.S. was using you as a public service announcement.
A. Yes. My opinion was that the I.R.S. doesn't have a public relations department. All they have is the media to deter people from not paying their taxes.
Q.What has been the most difficult aspect of this?
A. The timing with the auto credit crisis. Chrysler went into bankruptcy and then General Motors went into bankruptcy. Timing is everything and the timing was really bad.
Q.How concerned were you that your dealerships would be among the ones Chrysler let go?
A. Not even a little bit. We bleed Chrysler. We were No. 1 for all those years. But I had just gotten G.M. within a week of when the I.R.S. came in. General Motors did not renew our contract when they came out of bankruptcy.
Q.Do you think Chrysler is going to make it?
A. Absolutely. Third quarter, they posted a profit. The dark days are behind us.
Q.How will you do this year?
A. 2010 is finishing up strong.
Q.Would you say it's half of what you were doing during those peak years?
A. Probably 60 percent. But I see 2011 as above the initial forecast. The domestic auto business is coming back even faster than anyone could anticipate. The biggest problem is the access to credit. Ally [formerly GMAC] got bailed out, but I've got to tell you, they ain't doing nothing with it. Obama finally gets a small-business economic package, up to $5 million dealers can lend to their customers, and Ally isn't participating in it. It's mind-boggling.
Q.How has your probation and being on house arrest affected your business?
A. Not at all. I can go to work, I can go shopping, I can get haircuts, I go to auto auctions.
Q.How cumbersome is your ankle monitor?
A. Um, it doesn't bother me. You wouldn't even notice it. Girls wear ankle bracelets. It's my ankle bracelet.
Q.What has been the reaction from people on the street?
A. If you were John Smith, it wouldn't have happened.
Q.Do you think your customers weren't bothered because they already have a mixed view of car dealers?
A. I'll tell you, the old cliches never die. Build a good mousetrap, they will come. In my store, our claim to fame is you'll have more inventory than if you shop all day. We take care of you in the service center. That's what's important. Especially in Philadelphia. It's union, hard-working people. In America, everyone loves a comeback, right?
Q.Any advice you would give to other small-business owners as a result of what you've been through?
A. Keep it simple, stupid. People try to complicate things. If you're taking money, take it right through payroll.

HEADLINE: Immigration to U.S., After Dip, Is Back Up

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
The flow of immigrants to the United States has resumed, after falling to the lowest level in decades during the recession, a new study finds.
The number of immigrants in the United States was estimated to have risen by about half a million in the year that ended in 2009, a jump from the previous year, when immigration stopped almost completely during the recession, according the study, which was conducted by the Brookings Institution and is being released on Thursday. 
The rise pointed to an increase in demand for immigrant labor in the economy, said Audrey Singer, a demographer and co-author of the report. However, the number is still far below the increases of more than a million a year that took place earlier in the decade. The flow reached a peak in 2006, with a 1.8 million increase in the foreign born population.
''It's an uptick in opportunity,'' Ms. Singer said. ''Immigrants are very mobile in responding to economic changes.''
In 1980, the foreign-born population in the United States was about 4.5 million. By 2000, it had reached 11.3 million, bringing the foreign-born population to about 13 percent of the total. In the early 20th century, after the last big wave of immigration to the United States, immigrants had reached 15 percent of the population.
In 2008, immigration came to a standstill, the first big slowdown in decades of surging numbers, according to the report, which was based on estimates by the Census Bureau. Last year, the foreign born population stood at 7.4 million.
''After three decades of nonstop growth, immigration seems to have paused,'' the report says.
The biggest losses were in cities that had boomed in recent years, particularly in the housing industry, including Phoenix, Riverside and San Bernardino in California and Tampa, Fla.
Cities where the recession had less of an effect, including Austin, Tex., Houston, Raleigh, N.C., and Seattle, continued to gain immigrants.
The biggest increases came in smaller metropolitan areas that had little or no immigrant populations before. Among them were Jackson, Miss., whose foreign-born population grew by half in the two years ending in 2009, Birmingham, Ala., where immigrants increased by a quarter, and Worcester, Mass., and Omaha, which both experienced growth of about 20 percent, according to the report.
There was a slight rise in the portion of immigrants without a high school education, though the report noted that it was unclear whether this was because of low-skilled immigrants already in the United States, or because of less educated ones arriving. Immigrants with a bachelor's degree did not change, the report said.

HEADLINE: BEIJING TURBINES; Wind-Tossed Worries

BYLINE: By TOM ZELLER Jr. and KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
PIPESTONE, Minn. -- Finishing the 20-story climb up a ladder inside a wind-turbine tower, Scott Rowland opened the top hatch to reveal a panorama of flat farmland dotted with dozens of other turbines.
Two of the closest, like the tower he was standing on here, were built by Goldwind USA, where Mr. Rowland is vice president for engineering. ''These are very sophisticated machines,'' he said.
They are also the only three Chinese-made wind turbines operating in the United States.
That could soon change, though, as Goldwind and other Chinese-owned companies plan a big push into the American wind power market in coming months. 
While proponents say the Chinese manufacturers should be welcomed as an engine for creating more green jobs and speeding the adoption of renewable energy in this country, others see a threat to workers and profits in the still-embryonic American wind industry.
''We cannot sit idly by while China races to the forefront of clean energy production at the expense of U.S. manufacturing,'' Senator Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, said during a debate this year over federal subsidies for wind energy.
Such sentiments help explain why Goldwind is putting a distinctly American face on its efforts -- and is diligently highlighting plans to do more than simply import low-cost equipment from China.
''Goldwind was approaching this as, 'We're going to build an organic, North American organization,' '' said Mr. Rowland, a Texas native and former engineer at the Boston-based wind farm developer First Wind. ''So the opportunity to work with them -- and with folks I've known for a long time -- was really attractive.''
By entering the United States, the Chinese industry is coming to a world leader in wind energy capacity: roughly 41 gigawatts, or enough to power the equivalent of 10 million American homes. Only China itself, which recently passed American output, generates more wind power -- 43 gigawatts -- although that is spread over a population more than four times the size of the population of the United States.
But American wind output still meets only a small portion of the nation's overall demand for electricity -- about 2 percent -- compared with countries like Spain, which gets about 14 percent of its electrical power from the wind.
And the tepid United States economy, rock-bottom natural gas prices and lingering questions about federal wind energy policy have stalled the American wind industry, which currently represents only about 85,000 jobs. Even the American market leader, General Electric, reported a sharp drop in third-quarter turbine sales, compared with the same period last year.
All of which might indicate that dim market prospects await the wave of wind-turbine makers from China. But the Chinese companies can play a patient game because they have big backing from China's government in the form of low-interest loans and other blandishments -- too much help, in the critics' view.
Even now, the United States wind energy industry is by no means an all-American business. After G.E., the current market leaders in this country are Vestas of Denmark, Siemens of Germany, Mitsubishi of Japan and Suzlon of India. None of the governments of those countries, though, are suspected of unfairly favoring their home industries and discriminating against foreign competitors on anything approaching China's scale.
In the case of China, the Obama administration is investigating whether the Chinese may have violated World Trade Organization rules in subsidizing its clean-energy industry.
Mr. Rowland's company, Goldwind, is the fledgling American arm of a state-owned Chinese company that has emerged as the world's fifth-largest turbine maker: the Xinjiang Goldwind Science and Technology Company.
To help finance its overseas efforts, Xinjiang Goldwind raised nearly $1 billion in an initial public stock offering in Hong Kong in October -- on top of a $6 billion low-interest loan agreement in May from the government-owned China Development Bank.
Goldwind, which set up a sales office in Chicago, has hired about a dozen executives, engineers and other employees so far. Most, like Mr. Rowland, are Americans already experienced in the wind energy field.
That includes Tim Rosenzweig, the company's newly installed chief executive and the former chief financial officer of First Wind, who sees parallels with the resistance Japanese carmakers met when they set up operations in the American auto market in the 1980s.
''In terms of a business school case study, you definitely think of that, and I think that decisions around eventually putting manufacturing here solved part of that equation,'' Mr. Rosenzweig said. ''So our goals of localizing and creating jobs here and investing in the U.S. -- all that is part of the equation.''
Goldwind executives and their Chinese bosses no doubt learned from the uproar generated late last year when a Chinese energy conglomerate, A-Power Energy Generation Systems, joined an American investment firm and a Texas developer, Cielo Wind Power, to announce plans for a $1.5 billion wind farm, using 240 to 300 turbines, in West Texas.
Critics argued that the project -- which was eligible for about $450 million in federal stimulus funding set aside by the Obama administration for renewable energy projects -- would support thousands of manufacturing jobs in China, while creating only a few hundred less valuable construction and maintenance jobs in the United States.
Hoping to mute the jobs controversy, A-Power and its parent company, Shenyang Power Group, brokered a deal last August with the United Steelworkers union. The deal is meant to ensure that major components for the planned Texas wind farm -- including the towers, some enclosures for the turbine and the giant turbine blades -- would be supplied from the United States.
The Chinese companies also said they expected to buy as much as 50,000 tons of steel from American mills to build the Texas project, and A-Power and its partners announced plans to eventually open a manufacturing plant in Nevada.
Still, some skeptics say the Chinese manufacturers are too new to wind energy to warrant investing in their equipment for wind farms intended to operate for decades.
Wind turbines made by Chinese manufacturers sell for an average of $600,000 a megawatt, compared with $800,000 or more for Western models made from Chinese parts, and even higher prices for European and American machines. Yet, Western banks have been leery of lending wind farms money to buy the Chinese equipment because of concerns about its reliability, according to Robert Todd, the Hong Kong-based director of the renewable energy, resources and energy group at HSBC.
But with the American wind industry in the doldrums, there are few other big investments pending. The American Wind Energy Association estimates that this year only 5,500 megawatts of new capacity has been added in the United States. That is only about half of last year's total -- and far less than the 17,600 megawatts, or more, being installed this year in China, which has provided more subsidies and set more renewable energy targets for its utilities.
Proponents of the Chinese push say the availability of inexpensive turbines from China -- and ample customer financing from its state-owned banks -- could help put wind energy back on a growth track by making it more affordable for American utilities and developers.
''Wind power in the United States is in a disordered phase because of a lack of funds,'' said Andrew Hang Chen, the president of Usfor Energy, a consulting firm in Pittsburgh that advises the Chinese government and its state-controlled wind energy companies. ''It's a very good opportunity for Chinese businesses to access the U.S. market.''
But Steve Trenholm, the chief executive for North American operations at a big wind farm developer, E.On Climate and Renewables, said his company still leaned toward staying with Western multinationals, most of which have set up at least limited manufacturing facilities in the United States.
Especially when federal grant money is involved, he said, ''there is a strong preference to tie it to U.S. manufacturing.''
Already, though, much of the manufacturing for American wind energy is done offshore, with the big European developers importing some of the most sophisticated and valuable turbine components from factories overseas. Even G.E. now buys gearboxes from China to install in turbines that it assembles in the United States. The American Wind Energy Association has estimated that about 50 percent of a typical wind turbine being erected today in the United States is imported.
But the Chinese companies probably know they will be judged by a different standard.
When Goldwind USA's chief, Mr. Rosenzweig, visited the company's three pilot turbines here in Minnesota last month, accompanied by Mr. Rowland and the company's spokesman, Colin Mahoney, they detailed the American-made bona fides of their machines.
The towers, they said, were built by SMI & Hydraulics, a metal fabricator in nearby Porter, Minn. American contractors in Big Lake, Minn., and Gary, S.D., were used to transport the equipment, lay the foundation and install the turbines.
The fiberglass blades came from a plant in South Dakota -- albeit one owned by the Danish firm LM Wind Power. The company is also in discussion for future projects with other American tower makers, Mr. Mahoney said.
He estimated that $6.2 million of the Minnesota pilot project's cost of nearly $10 million went to American manpower and components. But the real guts of the Goldwind machines -- the generators, hubs and nacelles, or turbine housings -- were built in China.
Mr. Rosenzweig said his team was looking at ways to move more of that work to American shores.
''There's an economic proposition to actually have American workers here doing the assembling of the hubs and nacelles, and maybe generators down the road,'' Mr. Rosenzweig said. ''We've been approached by a number of states and their economic development teams,'' he said. ''So we're getting there.''
But with the Chinese market starting to level off even though Chinese factory capacity keeps surging, Goldwind and other Chinese companies will still have a powerful financial incentive to avoid idling new assembly lines in China. And labor is much cheaper in China -- $300 a month for blue-collar workers and $500 a month for engineers. Workers and engineers in the United States could expect to make at least 10 times as much.
Nonetheless, Goldwind's team sees plenty of room for American jobs.
Joining the Goldwind executives here for the tower tour was James P. Mikel, the head of Renew Energy Maintenance, a small firm based in Brandon, S.D., that has signed a long-term deal with Goldwind to handle upkeep of the turbines.
Mr. Mikel said he was initially wary of working with an unknown Chinese wind company. But he said a visit last spring to Goldwind's operations in Beijing -- and the prospect of expanding employment at home -- changed his mind. After all, the Chinese companies are the ones with the money to spend on the American wind industry right now.
''I was concerned at first,'' Mr. Mikel said. ''But I live here, and these turbines mean more jobs. Five years from now, we'll look back and wonder what all this concern was about.''

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about China's growing prominence in wind energy misstated, in some editions, the amount of wind power China generates. It is 43 gigawatts, not megawatts.

HEADLINE: Wind Power for Boston, Made in China

BYLINE: By TOM ZELLER Jr. and KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
Goldwind USA and A-Power Energy Generation Systems are not the only big Chinese-owned wind energy companies setting up shop in this country. 
Sinovel, a state-owned company based in Beijing that is China's largest wind turbine manufacturer, has signed a contract with the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority to provide a 1.5-megawatt wind turbine. The machine will provide electricity for a wastewater pumping station in the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston.
The turbine accounts for about half of the $4.7 million cost of the project, which is still in development and is being financed with money from the federal economic stimulus package.
Sinovel, with a $6.5 billion line of credit from banks owned by the Chinese government, has said its goal was to become the world's largest manufacturer of wind turbines by 2015. It also said it intended to eventually realize half of its sales beyond China's borders.
Meanwhile, Ming Yang Wind Power Group, China's fifth-largest wind turbine manufacturer, and its largest privately held wind power company, has opened a sales office in Dallas. Recently, the company raised $350 million in an initial public offering in New York, in a deal led by Morgan Stanley -- part of $6 billion being raised this year through initial public offerings by six Chinese wind turbine and wind farm companies.
Ming Yang is midway through at two-year, $737 million line of credit from China's state-owned Industrial and Commercial Bank. The bank has also agreed to provide financing to Ming Yang's overseas customers.

HEADLINE: STOCKS AND BONDS; Shares Slightly Lower From Euro Zone Concerns

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Early gains in the stock market evaporated Wednesday after worries about Europe's debt crisis overshadowed signs of growth in the United States. Bond prices fell, sending long-term interest rates higher again. 
The euro fell 1.2 percent against the dollar after Moody's said that it might lower Spain's credit rating. The stronger dollar hurts United States companies that do a lot of business overseas. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, the broadest measure of the stock market, fell 0.5 percent.
Stock prices started the day higher after reports showed that the manufacturing industry was growing and that inflation remained under control. The Federal Reserve said factory output rose for the fifth consecutive month in November. A separate report showed that consumer prices stayed flat last month.
In the late afternoon, the Senate overwhelmingly passed an $858 billion package that would extend tax cuts passed during the Bush administration for another two years. The measure now goes to the House, where it is expected to pass despite complaints by Democrats over what they see as overly generous estate tax rates for the rich.
The unfinished tax bill made some investors pause. ''No one is going to make any major planning decisions until this bill gets passed,'' said Timothy Speiss, a partner at EisnerAmper, a financial planning firm.
''I'm working with a lot of companies who are postponing deals until they know what the tax rates will be,'' Mr. Speiss said.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 19.07 points, or 0.17 percent, to 11,457.47.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 6.36 points, or 0.51 percent, to 1,235.23. The Nasdaq composite index fell 10.5 points, or 0.40 percent, to 2,617.22.
Coca Cola rose 1.3 percent to lead the 30 stocks that make up the Dow index. Alcoa, which fell 1.7 percent, was the worst performing stock in the index.
Consumer staples companies were the only one of the 10 groups that make up the S.& P. 500 index to rise.
Boston Beer, the maker of Sam Adams beer, rose 12.1 percent to $94.97 after it raised its 2010 earnings forecast. The company said it was shipping 12 percent more products than last year.
Ryder System gained 4.8 percent after an RBC analyst raised his investment rating on the trucking company, saying he expected demand for its services to rise.
Treasury prices fell, pushing their yields higher. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 15/32, to 92 15/32, and the yield rose to 3.53 percent from 3.47 percent late Tuesday. That was the highest the yield had been since May 13.
Bond yields have been rising since early October because investors expect the economy to improve. They also expect higher budget deficits because of the tax cut package.

HEADLINE: He Sold a Vision at Fox, and Marketers Bought It

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
FOUR decades later, Jon Nesvig, the dean of network sales executives, can still recall details of his first job.
''It was buying spot television time for General Foods in the Milwaukee and Minneapolis districts,'' said Mr. Nesvig, who will retire from his post as president of sales for Fox Broadcasting at the end of the year.
''The preferred buy was on the late news, if you could get it,'' he said in a wide-ranging interview on Wednesday, and ''the late news on the NBC affiliate in Bismarck, N.D., did a 72 rating -- not a 72 share, a 72 rating.'' 
A rating reflects the percentage of households with TV sets and the share is the percentage of those sets that are on for a given show. The days of 72 shares for broadcast fare, much less 72 ratings, are as far in the past as Benton & Bowles, the agency that hired Mr. Nesvig for his first job.
''Now, if you can get double digits, you're feeling pretty good about it,'' he said, laughing.
Even so, broadcast television networks like Fox, part of the News Corporation, are performing well despite the competition they confront from alternative media like cable and the Internet. That is because advertisers continue looking to them to reach consumers.
''For the last couple of years, it seems we have been fighting this perception that television is dead,'' Mr. Nesvig said, ''but just recently, it's been forecast that advertisers are going to be investing more in television'' as they rediscover its ''pre-eminent role in brand-building.''
That, and a belief the economy is getting better, led Mr. Nesvig, who is 67, to decide that ''it felt like the right time to go,'' he said. In October, Fox announced that he would retire after 21 years at the network and 40 in the media and advertising industry.
''I call Jon the godfather of network sales,'' said Rino Scanzoni, chief investment officer for the North American operations of GroupM, the media unit of WPP, who has faced Mr. Nesvig across the negotiating table for years.
''He was the elder statesman, the voice of reason,'' Mr. Scanzoni said. ''Other heads of sales looked to him. He will really be missed.''
Bill Koenigsberg, chief executive of Horizon Media in New York, said: ''Jon Nesvig is a man of amazing honor, smarts and natural instinct. He has been a leader and, now, a legend in the industry. I loved everything about him except his high CPMs.'' (That is shorthand for ''cost per thousand viewers,'' a common way TV commercial time is sold.)
When Mr. Nesvig joined Fox in 1989, as senior vice president for sales, the network -- battling ABC, CBS and NBC -- had been on the air for three years and programming in the lucrative prime-time evening hours for two.
''There were all sorts of comments about Fox's being the coat-hanger network,'' Mr. Scanzoni said, ''because of its being on UHF stations'' that required some TV set owners to improvise antennas.
Mr. Nesvig ''had to sell a promise and a commitment,'' Mr. Scanzoni said, at a time when agencies and advertisers were asking '' 'Another network? Is that going to work?' ''
''When you're selling more of a vision than a reality, you've got to be a pretty good salesman,'' Mr. Scanzoni said.
Helping out Mr. Nesvig, who was promoted to his present post in 1994, was the appeal to advertisers of popular series on Fox like ''The Simpsons,'' ''Beverly Hills 90210,'' ''Melrose Place,'' ''The X-Files,'' ''American Idol'' and ''House.''
''We have had a lot of good, innovative programming over the years,'' said Mr. Nesvig, who was interviewed in his office on the 20th floor of the News Corporation building in Midtown Manhattan.
But Fox has also had its share of clunkers, he acknowledged, mentioning ''When Animals Attack'' and ''Temptation Island.''
''The real inroad we made,'' Mr. Nesvig said, which enabled Fox to flourish, was in serving younger audiences when ''the older networks were older in their demographic profiles.''
Initially, Fox sought viewers aged 18 to 34, who were ''underserved'' by the big three, he added, and more recently ''we have gotten more mainstream,'' aiming at viewers ages 18 to 49.
Another reason for Mr. Nesvig's success, said Mr. Scanzoni of GroupM, was that ''he had Rupert's ear,'' referring to Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of the News Corporation.
In Fox's early days, Mr. Nesvig said, Mr. Murdoch and the corporate offices shared a floor with the network sales department, and Mr. Murdoch would engage in ''management by wandering; he'd walk on the floor and talk to the people actually doing it.''
''Rupert, as the proprietor in what was more of a mom-and-pop store, wanted to know what was in the cash register each day,'' Mr. Nesvig said, smiling.
''He was interested in how much money was in,'' he added, as well as ''what the advertisers were thinking.''
Even now, Mr. Nesvig said, Mr. Murdoch ''wants to know the story behind the numbers.''
Come the new year, explaining that to Mr. Murdoch will be the job of Mr. Nesvig's successor, Toby Byrne, who is being promoted from senior vice president for Eastern sales at Fox.
''It's been a remarkable experience,'' Mr. Nesvig said, then paused and added, ''Enterprises take on a life of their own and nobody is, probably, absolutely essential.''

HEADLINE: Accord Is Near on a Long-Stalled Project

BYLINE: By CARA BUCKLEY

 BODY:
The Lower East Side may be in the grips of a full-on gentrification, with a rotating cast of boutiques, hotels and cafes continuously flocking there, but several forlorn patches of land have remained frozen in time.
Coated in asphalt, ringed with chain-link fencing and a magnet for garbage and rats, the parking lots lining the south side of Delancey Street near the foot of the Williamsburg Bridge were meant to become beacons of urban renewal. Instead, they have sat undeveloped for 42 years, their prospects frozen by bitter disagreements over whether they should be made into commercial spaces or low-income housing or parks.
But now local leaders are slowly coming to an agreement over what should be built at the Seward Park Urban Renewal Area, as the plots are collectively known. After two and a half years of intensive meetings and negotiations, members of Community Board 3, which represents the area, are hoping that by mid-January they will finish up guidelines for the parcels' development. 
Various city agencies would then have to weigh in on and approve the proposal, a process that would probably take at least two years. But board members said that the community had never been closer to agreeing on a plan.
''This is the furthest it's ever come,'' said Dominic Pisciotta, chairman of Community Board 3.
The Seward Park stalemate began in 1967, when the city razed 14 blocks of tenements and ousted 2,000 residents to make way for new retail and residential sites. But subsequent proposals, including a plan by the Koch administration to have the developer Samuel J. Lefrak build on the site, were felled by community opposition.
Advocates for low-income housing said the city needed to house the displaced and others squeezed out by Manhattan rents. But nearby co-op owners, concerned about property values, argued that the neighborhood was already saturated with low-income housing. Seward Park redevelopment became an issue that few politicians seemed willing to touch.
David McWater, chairman of the community board task force writing guidelines for the site, said the board was emboldened by its successful recent campaign that rezoned about 110 blocks of the Lower East Side. The rezoning put height caps on new buildings, and also forged new relationships between previously disparate community voices.
''The rezoning gave us momentum,'' Mr. McWater said. ''People found out that they had a lot more in common, that there was a lot more middle ground, than what was previously thought to be.''
Under the proposed guidelines, the five remaining Seward Park redevelopment parcels would intersperse commercial and residential sites with open spaces and parks. The guidelines call for roughly 1,000 rental units; 40 percent to 60 percent would be market rate, 10 percent to 30 percent would go to middle- and moderate-income earners and roughly 30 percent would be low income. Residents ousted from the buildings razed in the late 1960s -- at least those still around -- may be given priority.
The largest retailers would be ''midbox,'' no more than 40,000 square feet each. The city has also offered to include in the plan four nearby sites, including the Essex Street Market.
''I love it,'' Brett Leitner, who lives in the area, said of the plan. He formed a group to advocate for a ''moderate third way'' and avoid the factionalism that stalled development for four decades.
Perhaps inevitably, there is still resistance to the proposal.
Joel Kaplan, another community board member, believes commercial enterprises would be best for the site: shops, a movie theater and offices that could prompt local economic development. Alternatively, he said he would support building residences that were 80 percent market rate and 20 percent lower income.
But Damaris Reyes, executive director of the Good Old Lower East Side tenant advocacy group, and a public member of the task force, said having up to 60 percent market-rate apartments was ''unacceptable.''
''It doesn't reflect the needs of this neighborhood, the need of the people who live here,'' said Ms. Reyes, who believes all the units should be for low-income earners. ''We think that we can do better. The city can do better.''
The community board chairman, Mr. Pisciotta, said Ms. Reyes's vision was politically infeasible, given the still potent opposition from nearby co-op owners that has been going on for decades. Still, several board members said a shared agreement was well within reach.
''Everybody can't have everything they want,'' Mr. McWater, the community board task force chairman, said, ''but I think we're pretty close to an equilibrium.''
One official who looms over the discussion is Sheldon Silver, the State Assembly speaker, whose district includes the land and whose power base is in those co-ops. His approval is seen as crucial.
''The speaker has tremendous respect for the leadership and members of Community Board 3 and their effort to achieve a true consensus about the future of Seward Park,'' Mr. Silver's spokeswoman, Sisa Moyo, said in a statement. ''He believes it is important for that process to take its course before commenting.''

HEADLINE: The Chinese Leader Calls on India to Be a Partner

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

 BODY:
NEW DELHI -- Kicking off a three-day tour of India on Wednesday, the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, encouraged the two countries to partner, not compete, as the world's balance of power tilts toward Asia.
''There is enough space in the world for the development of both China and India, and enough areas for us both to cooperate,'' Mr. Wen said in a speech to hundreds of executives from both countries.
''The 21st century is the Asian century,'' he said. ''It is also the century in which China and India can make great achievements.'' 
Mr. Wen is on his first visit to India in more than five years, and his agenda is heavily weighted toward strengthening business ties, in a bid to improve the weak economic relationship between the world's two most populous nations. Despite China's vast treasury and India's need for financing and infrastructure, China's investment in India has been minuscule compared to that of the United States and Britain.
More than 300 businessmen accompanied Mr. Wen from China, dozens more than accompanied other leaders who have visited India recently, including President Obama. When Mr. Wen took the stage at a ballroom in New Delhi hotel on Wednesday, many of the visiting executives cheered.
China and India are in the ''process of rapid industrialization and urbanization'' built on a foundation of fast and sustainable growth, Mr. Wen said. The two countries should ''open our markets to each other so we can give strong support to each other's economic growth.''
The two countries have different strengths, he said, like India's service expertise and China's manufacturing skills.
During the trip, Mr. Wen is expected to push Indian officials, including Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, to consider a free trade agreement with China.
Mr. Wen said that he planned to set new growth goals with Indian officials for bilateral trade, and suggested the two countries set up special investment zones.
He said he would also push to make it easier for capital and people to move more easily between the countries.
India and China are the world's fastest-growing major economies, home to two-fifths of the world's population, and share a border more than 2,000 miles long. Despite common problems, like a rapidly increasing need for electricity and a skyrocketing demand for urban housing, industrialists and economic ministers from the two countries have rarely partnered.
''From the Indian side, there has been a lot of suspicion of the strategic intentions of state-owned Chinese enterprises,'' said Jonathan Holslag, a research fellow at the Brussels Institute of Contemporary China Studies.
Chinese companies, when they have entered India, have been disappointed by their profits and stymied by red tape, Mr. Holslag said. ''Over all, it has been very difficult for Chinese companies to get their share of the Indian market.''
The Chinese delegation was greeted enthusiastically by India's commerce minister, Anand Sharma, and other Indian trade officials. ''There was a time when Asia counted for three-fourths of global G.D.P.,'' Mr. Sharma said, and those times are returning. ''In coming years, less than two decades, India and China will be two of the three largest economies in the world.''
Mr. Wen said $16 billion of deals between the two countries would be announced along with his visit. Some of the total included final agreements or financings of deals already under way.
A Chinese telecommunications equipment manufacturer, Huawei, said Tuesday evening that it planned to spend $2 billion to expand its India operations over the next five years, adding a new research and development campus in Bangalore that will employ 1,000.
Companies in India's Reliance ADA Group, the conglomerate controlled by Anil D. Ambani, said that they would receive financing from Chinese banks totaling about $3 billion, much of it to be used to buy goods from Chinese companies.
Reliance Power, the group's energy company, said in October it would buy boilers, turbines and generators for its coal power plants worth $10 billion from the Shanghai Electric Group. On Wednesday, a company executive said it had secured financing for part of that deal from Chinese banks, while Reliance Communications said it would get a $1.9 billion loan from China Development Bank.
Smaller deals announced on Wednesday included agreements between Chinese food manufacturers and Indian fish farms, and between Chinese textile companies and Indian yarn makers.
To date, China's foreign direct investment in India is small. From April of 2000 to September of 2010, China foreign direct investment in India was just $52 million, versus the United States' $9 billion, according to Indian government figures.
On the sidelines of Mr. Wen's speech, Indian businessmen expressed reservations at the possibility of further India-China cooperation.
''I just don't know,'' said one Indian trade group representative, who did not want his name used because his group was one of the sponsors of Wednesday's meeting. ''If China starts importing televisions to India that cost 2,000 rupees,'' or about $45, ''that's going to cut into local manufacturing,'' he said.
Still, China remains India's largest trade partner, with bilateral trade between the two countries expected to reach $60 billion this year. The relationship is skewed in China's favor, though, with Chinese exports to India more than double India's exports to China.
Mr. Wen said Wednesday that China ''takes seriously the trade imbalances'' between the two countries, and was ready to import more Indian information technology and pharmaceutical products.

HEADLINE: Legal Battles on Health Care Law Stir Questions of Partisanship in the Courts

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
PENSACOLA, Fla. -- With a loose web of conservative plaintiffs leading the charge, and judicial rulings breaking thus far along ideological lines, the drive to scuttle the Obama health care law is once again highlighting the role of partisanship in America's courts.
Legal scholars say there is nothing new and nothing particularly insidious about the use of the federal courts to revisit divisive policy debates once they have moved beyond Congress.
What is different about the health care cases, they say, is that multiple filings in diverse districts have resulted in a constitutional conflict over a landmark law even before it has taken full effect. Ideologically driven disagreements are rare among judges at the lower court level, they say, but do arise in cases where the issues are novel and highly charged.
On Thursday morning, the battle moves here to Pensacola, where attorneys general and governors from 20 states -- all Republicans but one -- face off against the Justice Department in a hearing before Judge Roger Vinson of Federal District Court. Judge Vinson has been hostile to the law in preliminary opinions and could become the second judge to find that a central provision is unconstitutional. 
Judge Henry E. Hudson, who sits in Richmond, Va., ruled on Monday that the law's requirement that most Americans obtain health insurance exceeded Congress's constitutional authority. That created a conflict with recent opinions by two other district court judges who upheld the same provision.
In the meantime, the rollout of the law will continue. Judge Hudson did not suspend any part of it pending appeal, as the insurance requirement does not take effect until 2014. The Supreme Court is expected to settle the dispute before then.
Like the Florida case, the Virginia lawsuit was filed by a Republican, Attorney General Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II. The list of other plaintiffs and law firms challenging aspects of the act in roughly two dozen cases reads like an index of conservative and libertarian interest groups: the American Center for Law and Justice, the Goldwater Institute, Liberty University, the Thomas More Law Center, the Pacific Justice Institute and the Pacific Legal Foundation, among others.
The sweeping health care law, which aims to make coverage available to more than 30 million uninsured Americans, passed in March without a single Republican vote.
The Florida and Virginia challenges to the law were filed in courthouses where conservative judges prevail, and where appeals would flow to the country's most conservative circuits. Scores of Republicans in Congress have signed supporting briefs, as have conservative advocacy groups.
Many of the plaintiff groups were created to press legal challenges precisely like the health care case, as the American Civil Liberties Union and similar groups do from the left.
For instance, the Thomas More Law Center in Ann Arbor, Mich., which is appealing a health care ruling it lost in Detroit, is known for its unsuccessful defense of a Pennsylvania school district that hoped to teach ''intelligent design'' as an alternative to evolution. The Goldwater Institute, which has filed a health care lawsuit in Phoenix, is also challenging public campaign financing in Arizona in a case headed to the United States Supreme Court.
Although there seems to be little coordination among the litigants or common fund-raising efforts, the groups' leaders are often explicit in equating their constitutional concerns with their political goals.
Nick Dranias, director of the Center for Constitutional Government at the Goldwater Institute, said his conservative group was doing its part by challenging a provision that creates an independent budgeting commission for Medicaid and Medicare.
''We're of the opinion here that the health care plan will not die in a single sweep,'' Mr. Dranias said. ''It will take a thousand cuts.''
But others said it was frustrating that politics sometimes obscured what they saw as legitimate constitutional concerns.
''I wish I could get Democrats to accept that this is not a partisan fight,'' said Timothy Sandefur, a lawyer for the Pacific Legal Foundation, which is pressing its lawsuit in the District of Columbia. ''This is a fight about how far the government can reach.''
The two federal judges who have upheld the law were appointed by President Bill Clinton, a Democrat. Judge Hudson and Judge Vinson were appointed by Republican presidents -- George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan, respectively.
Judge Hudson has deep Republican roots as a state and federal prosecutor in Northern Virginia. He is also a passive minority owner of a Republican political consulting firm, Campaign Solutions Inc. Among its former clients is Mr. Cuccinelli, the attorney general who is the plaintiff in the Virginia case. Mr. Cuccinelli stopped using the firm this year after news accounts disclosed Judge Hudson's investment.
Although the science is imprecise and often disputed, some scholars have found patterns of partisan divisions at all levels of the federal judiciary, based on the appointing president. At the district court level, there is generally a high degree of consensus among judges in similar cases, except when they confront polarizing constitutional questions like abortion, campaign finance and now health care.
''When the law is fairly clear, politics don't matter much,'' said Mark A. Hall, a professor of law and public health at Wake Forest University. ''But when the law is unsettled, inchoate, undeveloped, let's say, it's natural that judges' political, social and economic views will shape how they see things.''
Andrew D. Martin, a professor of law and political science at Washington University in St. Louis, has studied the influence of ideology on judicial decisions. ''Where district judges are presented with questions of first impression and have to make the type of constitutional judgments the Supreme Court does all the time, it's not at all surprising to see those choices line up along party lines,'' Professor Martin said.
Liberal critics of Judge Hudson's ruling have been quick to highlight his background, and to tweak conservatives.
''It's ironic, when Sarah Palin and others decry activist judges every other day, that a Bush appointee would make new law that strikes a critical element of a law properly enacted by Congress,'' said Neera Tanden, a health policy expert at the Center for American Progress, a liberal research group.
Representative Pete Stark, a California Democrat who leads the Ways and Means subcommittee on health, added, ''Apparently Republicans are now for judicial activism after they were against it.''
But David B. Rivkin Jr., a Republican lawyer from Washington who represents the plaintiffs in the Pensacola case, said those who label judges by presidential appointment ''are delegitimizing the judiciary.'' Mr. Rivkin said that it was ''a matter of accident and irrelevance'' that the health care rulings had broken down along such lines and that he had ''not heard a single partisan remark'' from his clients.
''The people who brought this lawsuit,'' he said, ''are all about the law.''
Correction: December 21, 2010, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about lawsuits over the health care law, which have raised the issue of partisanship in American courts, incorrectly included one group among those that have challenged the constitutionality of the law. Judicial Watch did not sue on those grounds. (It had brought a lawsuit over a Freedom of Information request for documents related to the law's enactment.)

HEADLINE: Clinton Pledges Bigger Role For Besieged State Department

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Seeking to reassert the State Department's role as the primary agent of Washington overseas, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on Wednesday announced an ambitious overhaul of diplomacy and development. And she promised to do it without spending a lot more money. 
Mrs. Clinton, in presenting a two-year review that has been one of her signature projects, declared that ''leading through civilian power saves lives and money.'' Among key changes is a heavier emphasis on resolving conflicts and a pledge to reinvigorate the United States Agency for International Development.
By cutting costs and redundant programs, Mrs. Clinton said the State Department could expand its role. Last week, the incoming Republican chairwoman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, vowed to cut the department's roughly $55 billion budget. Speaking to a large audience at the State Department, Mrs. Clinton said, ''With the right tools, training and leadership, our diplomats and development experts can defuse crises before they explode and create new opportunities for economic growth.'' That, she argued, was a ''wise investment for American taxpayers.''
The study, called the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review, comes as the department is reeling from the embarrassing release of secret diplomatic cables by WikiLeaks. Mrs. Clinton offered a small remedy for that security breach, announcing a new coordinator for cyberissues who will seek to safeguard the department's computer networks. ''Everyone is a potential leaker,'' Mrs. Clinton said, drawing a rueful laugh. Earlier, the audience stood in silence to honor Richard C. Holbrooke, the administration's special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, who died Monday. The report is dedicated to him.
The plan to restore the long-neglected Agency for International Development may be the review's most tangible element. Mrs. Clinton hopes to replenish the agency's staff, which shrank 38 percent from 1990 to 2007. She also announced that it would take control of the Feed the Future program, which seeks to increase global food security.

HEADLINE: At Talks in Washington, China Agrees to Better Protect Intellectual Property

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN; Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from Hong Kong.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senior Chinese officials pledged on Wednesday to better crack down on software piracy and other violations of intellectual property rights as part of a series of commercial agreements after two days of talks here.
The Chinese delegation, led by Wang Qishan, the vice premier for economic matters, also agreed to lift certain barriers to imports of heavy industrial machinery and to hold talks on easing a ban on imports of American beef that was imposed during a 2003 scare over mad cow disease.
The talks, which took place during an annual forum known as the United States-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade, did not address the thorniest issues in the economic relations between the two countries, like the giant trade imbalance and the value of China's currency. But the largely technical discussions helped set the stage for a state visit by President Hu Jintao to Washington next month, officials on both sides said. 
''The two sides have had candid exchanges of views on China-U.S. economic cooperation,'' Mr. Wang said in a joint news conference with his American counterparts: Ron Kirk, the United States trade representative; Gary Locke, the commerce secretary; and Tom Vilsack, the agriculture secretary.
Mr. Kirk praised Mr. Wang for agreeing to personally oversee a public campaign to reduce rampant theft of intellectual property -- copyrights, trademarks, patents and trade secrets -- in China. ''We expect to see concrete and measurable results on issues like intellectual property rights, including increased purchase and use of legal software in China,'' he said.
The Chinese government agreed Wednesday to allocate government money to buy legal software and to better track the management of software in state-owned enterprises. The effort will also include a crackdown on piracy of electronic journals, more effective rules for halting Internet piracy, and a crackdown on landlords who rent space to counterfeiters of products like footwear and apparel.
The involvement of Mr. Wang, China's top economic policy maker, could be significant, because in China, difficult changes are sometimes made only when a senior official publicly takes responsibility for them.
However, a major association of software makers offered a wary response to those pledges.
''We will know China has made real progress in reducing piracy only when software companies start seeing substantial increases in sales,'' said Robert W. Holleyman II, the president of the association, the Business Software Alliance.
The commercial value of pirated software for personal computers in China has nearly doubled, to $7.6 billion last year, he said. ''That is why we have called for trade negotiations to start focusing less on pledges and more on tangible results,'' Mr. Holleyman added.
Chinese officials also tried to address American reservations about a policy, intended to promote ''indigenous innovation,'' that American exporters view as potentially discriminatory.
Senior Chinese officials had said earlier this autumn that the policy would not require that national government agencies buy only products with technology initially patented or trademarked in China, a stance they reaffirmed on Wednesday. But the final language still has to be decided. Meanwhile, provincial and municipal government agencies seem to be officially or unofficially implementing similar policies without waiting for Beijing.
After years of stop-and-start talks on tough restrictions that effectively amount to a ban on American beef imports, both sides essentially agreed to start a new round of discussions.
The goal is to permit, by next year, some imports of beef from cattle under 30 months old.
In the agreements signed on Wednesday, Chinese officials said they would take these steps:
Revise a catalog of heavy machinery and other industrial equipment so as not to discriminate against foreign suppliers or provide prohibited subsidies. The catalog is used to encourage the development of machines that are not currently produced by Chinese companies.
Cooperate with the United States on technological standards for so-called smart grids, electricity networks that use digital technology to conserve energy and save money.
Remain neutral on wireless technologies like 3G, as well as future technologies, a step that is intended to ease access to China's market by American telecommunications companies.
Lift one barrier to foreign developers seeking to build wind farms there. The Chinese government will allow overseas experience in wind farm development, and not just experience in China, to qualify them for Chinese projects.
The talks did not cover the value of China's currency, the renminbi, which has been an irritant to the Obama administration. But the issue was raised when Mr. Wang met with the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, on Tuesday. Mr. Locke said the forum was crucial in rebalancing the global economy.
''The reality is that if we are to close the trade deficit, Americans need to export more and the Chinese need to purchase more,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Obama Tries Charm Offensive on Group of Top Executives

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Forget about the sharp critiques that President Obama leveled at Wall Street and corporate America during his first two years in office.
During more than four hours of meetings on Wednesday, Mr. Obama urged a group of chief executives to begin hiring and investing again as he wooed them, fed them and portrayed himself as an eager partner in the private sector's effort to get the economy going.
Mr. Obama invited the 20 executives to join him at the Blair House, across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House, for a series of discussions that aides said touched on trade, tax reform, education and how to encourage companies to stop sitting on their cash reserves. 
''We focused on jobs and investment and they feel optimistic that, by working together, we can get some of the cash off the sidelines,'' Mr. Obama told reporters as he walked back to the White House after the meeting. Attendees included Kenneth I. Chenault, chief executive of American Express; Eric E. Schmidt, chairman and chief executive of Google; and Indra K. Nooyi, chairman and chief executive of PepsiCo.
The charm offensive comes as Mr. Obama prepares for a Republican-controlled House of Representatives starting next month and his 2012 presidential run. So White House officials were projecting an image of a president seeking to work hand in hand with corporate America to repair the economy and get Americans back to work.
Mr. Obama began the meeting with an olive branch. ''Those of you around the table represent why America is unique, what is best about our entrepreneurial spirit, and I want to dispel any notion that we want to inhibit your success,'' he told the assembled corporate chiefs, according to an administration official who was in the room and would speak only on the grounds of anonymity. ''We want to be boosters because when you do well, America does well.''
Heading into the meeting, Mr. Obama told reporters that he was hoping to glean some ideas from the assembled business leaders on ways to help spur economic growth.
''We know the path that will lead to economic success,'' Mr. Obama said, as he promised to ''redouble'' the administration's ''commitment to fiscal discipline.''
During the weekend, he echoed his earlier remarks about the importance of getting the country's fiscal house in order.
He told the group that he was ''optimistic we will have a real serious conversation about fiscal health in the next year.''
Several business executives said that they welcomed the face-to-face meeting and the chance to clear the air after a year in which the White House and Wall Street have often seemed to be at war.
''Things were said on both sides that shouldn't have been and did not further the opportunity to work together,'' Honeywell International's chairman, David M. Cote, said as he arrived at the Blair House. ''I give the president a lot of credit for being man enough to say, 'Let's restart, let's work on how do we create a more vibrant economy.' ''
Mr. Obama has in the last month made several overtures that business leaders have applauded. They include a free trade agreement between the United States and South Korea and a compromise with Congressional Republicans to extend the Bush-era tax cuts.
There were a few notes of discord during the meeting though, including one when Mr. Obama expressed frustration with what he characterized as a disconnect between what he and business leaders talked about face-to-face, and what business lobbyists said about the White House -- and Mr. Obama himself -- when they were on Capitol Hill.
An administration official who was in the room said that Mr. Obama pointed out that lobbyists often made public complaints to Congressional representatives that undermined White House economic efforts.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Whitewash

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
When the financial crisis struck, many people -- myself included -- considered it a teachable moment. Above all, we expected the crisis to remind everyone why banks need to be effectively regulated.
How naive we were. We should have realized that the modern Republican Party is utterly dedicated to the Reaganite slogan that government is always the problem, never the solution. And, therefore, we should have realized that party loyalists, confronted with facts that don't fit the slogan, would adjust the facts.
Which brings me to the case of the collapsing crisis commission. 
The bipartisan Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission was established by law to ''examine the causes, domestic and global, of the current financial and economic crisis in the United States.'' The hope was that it would be a modern version of the Pecora investigation of the 1930s, which documented Wall Street abuses and helped pave the way for financial reform.
Instead, however, the commission has broken down along partisan lines, unable to agree on even the most basic points.
It's not as if the story of the crisis is particularly obscure. First, there was a widely spread housing bubble, not just in the United States, but in Ireland, Spain, and other countries as well. This bubble was inflated by irresponsible lending, made possible both by bank deregulation and the failure to extend regulation to ''shadow banks,'' which weren't covered by traditional regulation but nonetheless engaged in banking activities and created bank-type risks.
Then the bubble burst, with hugely disruptive consequences. It turned out that Wall Street had created a web of interconnection nobody understood, so that the failure of Lehman Brothers, a medium-size investment bank, could threaten to take down the whole world financial system.
It's a straightforward story, but a story that the Republican members of the commission don't want told. Literally.
Last week, reports Shahien Nasiripour of The Huffington Post, all four Republicans on the commission voted to exclude the following terms from the report: ''deregulation,'' ''shadow banking,'' ''interconnection,'' and, yes, ''Wall Street.''
When Democratic members refused to go along with this insistence that the story of Hamlet be told without the prince, the Republicans went ahead and issued their own report, which did, indeed, avoid using any of the banned terms.
That report is all of nine pages long, with few facts and hardly any numbers. Beyond that, it tells a story that has been widely and repeatedly debunked -- without responding at all to the debunkers.
In the world according to the G.O.P. commissioners, it's all the fault of government do-gooders, who used various levers -- especially Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored loan-guarantee agencies -- to promote loans to low-income borrowers. Wall Street -- I mean, the private sector -- erred only to the extent that it got suckered into going along with this government-created bubble.
It's hard to overstate how wrongheaded all of this is. For one thing, as I've already noted, the housing bubble was international -- and Fannie and Freddie weren't guaranteeing mortgages in Latvia. Nor were they guaranteeing loans in commercial real estate, which also experienced a huge bubble.
Beyond that, the timing shows that private players weren't suckered into a government-created bubble. It was the other way around. During the peak years of housing inflation, Fannie and Freddie were pushed to the sidelines; they only got into dubious lending late in the game, as they tried to regain market share.
But the G.O.P. commissioners are just doing their job, which is to sustain the conservative narrative. And a narrative that absolves the banks of any wrongdoing, that places all the blame on meddling politicians, is especially important now that Republicans are about to take over the House.
Last week, Spencer Bachus, the incoming G.O.P. chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, told The Birmingham News that ''in Washington, the view is that the banks are to be regulated, and my view is that Washington and the regulators are there to serve the banks.''
He later tried to walk the remark back, but there's no question that he and his colleagues will do everything they can to block effective regulation of the people and institutions responsible for the economic nightmare of recent years. So they need a cover story saying that it was all the government's fault.
In the end, those of us who expected the crisis to provide a teachable moment were right, but not in the way we expected. Never mind relearning the case for bank regulation; what we learned, instead, is what happens when an ideology backed by vast wealth and immense power confronts inconvenient facts. And the answer is, the facts lose.

HEADLINE: Small Steps on Global Warming

 BODY:
Given the chaos at last year's global warming meeting in Copenhagen, delegates to this year's sequel in Cancun, Mexico, hoped mainly to stop the bleeding. In fact, they did more than keep the battered United Nations process alive. Delegates were freed of the expectations of the conference in Copenhagen -- which failed to achieve its main objective: a legally binding treaty limiting emissions. And they found common ground in a few achievable steps that will increase trust among nations and could form the basis for stronger measures down the road. 
Rich countries, for instance, agreed to help poorer ones preserve their tropical forests and adopt cleaner energy systems through a new ''green fund'' that will initially be administered by the World Bank. For their part, developing countries agreed to greater transparency in reporting their emissions and their progress in reducing them. Transparency had been a huge sticking point with the Chinese, who do not like anyone looking over their shoulders. Tough bargaining by the Americans and timely pressure from other big developing nations like India brought China on board.
Saving the United Nations process, however, is not the same as saving the planet; the hard work of actually cutting emissions will fall to individual nations, especially the big emitters. It will thus be important to continue exploring parallel negotiating on tracks like the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate, originally convened by President George W. Bush and consisting of 17 big nations that account for nearly four-fifths of all emissions; and the Group of 20 industrial nations, which has put climate change high on its agenda.
The principal players, now and in the future, will be the two biggest emitters, the Chinese and Americans. They have talked about joint investments in clean energy technologies, and they obviously must keep climate change on their bilateral agenda. But, first and foremost, they must tackle their own emissions.
The Chinese have pledged to cut their carbon intensity -- the rate at which they allow emissions to grow -- but what the world will eventually need is net reductions. The United States, embarrassingly enough, has no national strategy. Congress's failure to pass a comprehensive climate bill has left President Obama with little to work with. Until it gets one, the world has a slim chance of bringing emissions under control.

HEADLINE: Reopened Wounds: 'More Than He Could Bear'

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES and PETER LATTMAN; Al Baker, Elissa Gootman, Nelson D. Schwartz and Susanne Craig contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Getty ImagesMark Madoff in 2005, at his father's firm in New York.
Last Friday, the publisher of a promising real estate newsletter called Sonar Report rose before dawn, scoured the news to gather items for that day's edition and, at 9:04 a.m., sent it out to his e-mail subscribers.
Unknown to almost all of his subscribers, that publisher was Mark David Madoff, the older son of the convicted swindler Bernard L. Madoff.
Less than 24 hours after sending his e-mail, he hanged himself in his downtown Manhattan apartment, leaving behind a life of burdens and blessings. 
The blessings appeared to be sustaining him, even on that final day, according to those closest to him. They recall a man who was patiently building a new business, talking regularly with close friends, spending time with his wife and four children and, even in the last hours of his life, walking his dog, an affectionate Labradoodle.
But behind that screen, the burdens of life as Bernie Madoff's son - the continuing suspicion from the public, the harsh accusations in numerous lawsuits, and his exile from the world of Wall Street - were steadily becoming unsustainable.
''The pressure of the last two years weighed on him enormously,'' said a person who had remained close to him since childhood. ''He was deeply, deeply angry at what his father had done to him - to everybody. That anger just seemed to feed on itself.''
The burden had eased as the public's fierce interest in the case seemed to fade, this person said. But the spate of lawsuits filed last week by the Madoff trustee included a troubling one against his children and ''cases against a lot of smaller people, many of whom he knew, some of whom were relatives,'' the person continued. ''It reopened the wounds. It must have just been more than he could bear.''
Mark Madoff, 46, had also been named in at least nine lawsuits that sought to recover millions of dollars in damages and muddied his professional reputation, friends said. And he was troubled by news articles that repeatedly - and, according to his lawyers, falsely - portrayed him as being under criminal investigation for some role in his father's epic crime.
Most frustrating of all, this person said, was the fact that neither he nor anyone who knew him could publicly defend him. ''There were all these comments from the trustee about how he was an incompetent boob, and to have all the people who knew otherwise muzzled by their lawyers - it was very, very hard.''
No one in the financial world, the only world where he had ever worked, would publicly risk giving a job to a Madoff.
He understood how tainted his identity had become. His wife, Stephanie, had applied to the court this year to have the last name of her and her two children changed to ''Morgan.''
The Madoff name appears nowhere on the corporate records for Sonar Report. Its address is a U.P.S. store near his home, where he stopped in regularly to collect the mail. He concealed his role as founder and editor of the newsletter from everyone except family and a few close friends.
At least eight of his faithful friends were willing to talk about his failed struggle to stay on course, but none wanted to be identified for this article out of respect for the family's privacy or concern that they would become the next target of what one called ''the crazies'' who circle around everyone in the Madoff saga.
Shame at being a Madoff shook the foundation of Mark Madoff's lifelong identity, a close friend said.
''He had always been so proud of his name and being the guy who was Bernie Madoff's son,'' the friend said. ''And then afterwards all anyone ever saw in him was that he was Bernie Madoff's son.''
The media attention, which only intensified after Mr. Madoff's suicide, prompted his family to decide to cremate his body and not hold a funeral. A private memorial service was held at an undisclosed location on Thursday.An Unwelcome SpotlightMark Madoff and his younger brother, Andrew, had become accidental celebrities the day their father was arrested. The day before, the two brothers had reported to law enforcement that their father had confessed that his investment business was ''one big lie,'' a multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme he had been running for years.
Bernard Madoff pleaded guilty and is serving a 150-year sentence in a North Carolina federal prison. His investors have cash losses estimated at $20 billion, but the wealth supposedly held in their accounts when the fraud collapsed totaled $64.8 billion. Mr. Madoff had not been in touch with his father or his mother, Ruth, since the fraud was exposed two years ago.
Mark Madoff had struggled visibly in the year that followed his father's arrest. In October 2009, his wife reported him missing when he went out for a walk after a marital spat and did not return for many hours, according to a person familiar with the incident. Police ultimately traced him to the Soho Grand Hotel. According to the person who has been close to him since childhood, he sought counseling after that episode and seemed to have steadied himself.
The unwelcome spotlight returned to the Madoff family as the second anniversary of his father's arrest approached. According to several friends, Mr. Madoff had expressed anger and frustration with the media coverage, especially articles he saw on the eve of his death that suggested federal prosecutors were continuing to scrutinize him and his brother. Their lawyers have said that neither Mark nor Andrew has been notified by prosecutors that he is the target or subject of a criminal investigation.
The renewed media attention and incessant litigation had weighed on Mr. Madoff, say his friends. But a close friend who spoke with him on Friday said his concern over the anniversary coverage didn't seem out of the ordinary.
''There was nothing from the discussion that suggested he thought this was some big event,'' the friend said. ''It seemed like this was the same old news coming up again.''
Mr. Madoff and his brother were raised in Roslyn, N.Y., on Long Island. ''He was the gorgeous blond boy that most guys envied for his good looks and most girls wanted to go out with, or at least flirt with,'' wrote Brett Cantor Harris, a schoolmate, on her blog the day of his death.
After graduating from the University of Michigan with a degree in economics, Mr. Madoff moved to New York and joined his father's company, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities. He worked in the firm's legitimate market-making and proprietary trading arm. The unit, which was run by the younger Mr. Madoff and his brother, was distinct from his father's sham money-management business and was a formidable success on Wall Street for decades.
Mr. Madoff married his college sweetheart, moved to the wealthy suburb of Greenwich, Conn., and had two children. He got divorced and married his second wife, the fashion executive Stephanie Mikesell. They had two children and settled in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood. He kept a residence in Greenwich and also owned a waterfront home on Nantucket.
After his father's fraud was exposed, Mr. Madoff's spending was constrained and subject to supervision by the bankruptcy trustee. But before then, his senior position at a stock-trading powerhouse had afforded him a luxe lifestyle.
Mr. Madoff earned $29.3 million over his last eight years at the firm, according to a lawsuit filed against him by Irving L. Picard, the bankruptcy trustee seeking to recover money for the fraud's victims. He also benefited from his father's bogus investment advisory business, taking at least $17 million more from his family's accounts than he deposited, the lawsuit asserted. It sought to recover at least $67 million from Mr. Madoff individually, and more than $130 million from the other Madoff family executives at the firm.
In the complaint, filed in October 2009, Mr. Picard described Mr. Madoff's compensation as ''astronomical,'' and accused him and his brother of being ''completely derelict'' in their duties and responsibilities at the firm.
Mr. Madoff took great pride in his career and was deeply hurt by Mr. Picard's accusations, friends say. The firm's market-making business employed about 120 people and traded tens of millions of shares a day, according to a presentation by Lazard, which helped the Madoff trustee sell the business last year.
Mark and Andrew Madoff also ran the firm's proprietary trading business, which they started in 1997 and which was liquidated last year. That business earned approximately $270 million over 11 years and substantially outperformed the overall market, according to the Lazard profile.
Mr. Madoff had always seemed sensitive to criticism and tended to take his grievances too much to heart, said one family friend and business associate. ''That's why I never believed he knew about the fraud,'' this person said. ''He was always a nervous wreck. He could never have stood it - keeping a secret like that would have torn him apart.''
Against that history, his behavior the last week of his life did not ring any alarms with those in regular contact with him.
They never expected how the week would end.Final MessagesPolice pieced together his final messages after seizing his computer and mobile phone, though his lawyers promptly protested and those devices were returned to his family this week.
According to the police reports, at about 4 a.m. on Saturday, Mr. Madoff sent two e-mails to his wife, Stephanie, who had taken their 4-year-old daughter to visit Disney World in Florida on Wednesday, Dec. 8, leaving their 2-year-old, Nicholas, in her husband's care.
One of his e-mails said, ''Please send someone to take care of Nick.''
Another said: ''I love you.''
He also wrote his lawyer, Martin Flumenbaum. That message said: ''Nobody wants to believe the truth. Please take care of my family.''
When Stephanie Madoff saw her husband's messages, she called her stepfather in New York and asked him to go immediately to the family loft on Mercer Street in lower Manhattan.
Her stepfather, Martin London, arrived just before 7:30 a.m. and found Mr. Madoff's body hanging from a black dog leash attached to a metal beam in the living room ceiling.
There was no evidence of a struggle in the tidy, well-kept apartment, police said. But there was wrenching evidence of Mr. Madoff's suicidal determination.
A snapped vacuum cleaner cord was suspended from the same metal beam, and a noose fashioned from that cord was on a table nearby. A second leash was attached to the beam, but there was no sign that it had been used in a suicide attempt, according to a person familiar with the investigation.
The victim's son was found unharmed in the apartment, as was the family's dog, Grouper.
The discovery horrified Mr. Madoff's friends, who felt he had been weathering the storm of the last two years and was slowly rebuilding his life.
An avid athlete, he had made plans in recent weeks for future ski trips with friends. He had visited his older son at a Western college. He had kept routine appointments - including one the Friday afternoon before his death.
Mr. Madoff had no illusions that he could get work in the securities industry again, according to the person close to him since childhood, but he did work hard in the last two years ''to maintain the network of relationships he had in the industry.''
A close friend, a financial services executive, offered Mr. Madoff a desk at his downtown offices where he could make calls and set up meetings to get back on his feet professionally.
Mr. Madoff did some quiet consulting work and about a year ago began sending out the Sonar Report. It was a one-man operation. He would wake at 4 a.m., search the Internet for real-estate related news and compile the newsletter himself, according to a close friend.
At first, he sent the newsletter free to attract a following. After about six months, he began asking $20 a month.
An introductory note to new subscribers said the Sonar Report was produced by ''a new firm'' and was ''looking to expand our subscriber base.''
It is unclear how many people were paying for the Sonar Report. In May, Mr. Madoff told a friend that he had 1,000 people on his mailing list.
A lawyer who advised Mr. Madoff on copyright issues related to the newsletter said that the focus of their conversations was always on the long-term viability of the venture. Mr. Madoff was hopeful that the business model was ''scalable'' and newsletters could be developed for other industries that weren't widely covered, the lawyer said.
Sonar Report has not appeared since Friday.
''Is it not in business anymore?'' asked an executive at a large real estate brokerage firm on Tuesday, after a reporter inquired about the newsletter Mr. Madoff had anonymously published. ''I haven't gotten anything from them this week.''

HEADLINE: CONGRESS PASSES TAX CUT PACKAGE For $801 BILLION

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Carl Hulse contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Congress at midnight Thursday approved an $801 billion package of tax cuts and $57 billion for extended unemployment insurance. The vote sealed the first major deal between President Obama and Congressional Republicans as Democrats put aside their objections and bowed to the realignment of power brought about by their crushing election losses.
The bipartisan support for the tax deal also underscored the urgency felt by the administration and by lawmakers in both parties to prop up the still-struggling economy and to prevent an across-the-board tax increase that was set to occur if the rates enacted under President George W. Bush had expired, as scheduled, at the end of the month.
Administration officials said Mr. Obama would sign the package into law on Friday. 
The final vote in the House was 277 to 148 after liberal Democrats failed in one last bid to change an estate-tax provision in the bill that they said was too generous to the wealthiest Americans and that the administration agreed to in a concession to Republicans. The amendment failed, 233 to 194.
Supporting the overall measure were 139 Democrats and 138 Republicans; opposed were 112 Democrats and 36 Republicans.
The bill extends for two years all of the Bush-era tax rates and provides a one-year payroll tax cut for most American workers, delivering what economists predict will be a needed lift. The Senate approved the package on Wednesday by 81 to 19.
The White House and Republicans hailed the deal as a rare bipartisan achievement and a prototype for future hard-bargained compromises in the new era of divided government.
But the accord also showed that policy-makers remain locked in an unsustainable cycle of cutting taxes and raising spending that has proven politically palatable in the short term but could threaten the nation's fiscal stability in years ahead.
Some Republican critics of the deal had said the Bush-era rates should be extended permanently, complaining that to do otherwise would create economic uncertainty. But some analysts said that such certainty was an illusion, given the longer-term problem with the deficit.
''Republicans are talking a lot about certainty,'' said Matthew Mitchell, a research fellow and tax policy expert at George Mason University. ''But even if they had won some sort of a victory where they got the current tax rates written in stone, spending is on such an unsustainable path in terms of entitlements, it really isn't certain at all.''
The temporary nature of the deal, however, could lend momentum to broader efforts to overhaul the tax code and tackle the deficit. With the tax debate now scheduled to resume at the height of the 2012 presidential election, some lawmakers said they hoped the fiscal landscape could be redrawn and the cycle of lower taxes and higher spending brought to a halt.
Throughout the debate in recent weeks, lawmakers in both parties expressed unhappiness with the tax agreement, and that there seemed to be an increasing recognition of a need to tackle the long-term problems.
In recent days, 22 senators -- 12 Democrats, 9 Republicans and 1 independent -- signed on to a resolution pledging to ''devise a comprehensive plan for addressing the fiscal concerns of our nation'' by focusing on ''tax reform, spending restraint and debt and deficit reduction'' in 2011.
That pledge suggested lawmakers might want to avoid repeating this debate in two years, and instead focus on proposals to clean up the tax code and potentially reduce rates for individuals and corporations alike, while simultaneously trying to bring spending in line.
''The era of deficit denial is over,'' said Bruce Reed, the executive director of Mr. Obama's bipartisan commission on reducing the national debt. ''They're just having a big year-end close-out.''
Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, for example, voted against the tax deal on Wednesday even though he is a champion of lower taxes. But Mr. Coburn, as a member of the debt commission, voted in favor of its blueprint for reducing the debt through 2020.
Mr. Coburn had proposed an alternative to the tax deal on Wednesday, seeking to reduce its cost using a number of strategies endorsed by the commission.
As the House moved toward approving the tax package, liberal Democrats railed against it and delayed the final vote by several hours after briefly objecting to the terms of debate.
The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi of California, accused Republicans of forcing Democrats ''to pay a king's ransom in order to help the middle class.''
Many of the Democratic opponents said the package would do too much for the wealthy, and warned that the payroll tax cut could undermine the stability of Social Security.
''It's a huge giveaway to the super-rich in tough economic times,'' said Representative Jim McDermott, Democrat of Washington, who called the plan ''craziness.''
Representative Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont, said, ''This legislation creates too few jobs and too much debt.''
Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, said he feared the one-year cut in the Social Security payroll tax, to 4.2 percent from 6.2 percent on income up to $106,800, would weaken Social Security because Republicans would insist on it being made permanent, and Democrats would relent. ''We know that politically once you make that tax cut it will be impossible to restore it,'' Mr. Nadler said.
Some Republican critics said the package would add too much to the deficit, and they objected to maintaining extended jobless aid without offsetting the cost with spending cuts elsewhere.
But most Republicans said they supported the deal.
''We are crawling out of the worst economic downturn in generations,'' said Representative Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia, who will be the majority leader next year. ''The choice is to act now or impose a $3.8 trillion tax increase.''
Mr. Cantor also reminded Republicans to recognize the limits of their new House majority. ''We could try to hold out an pass a different tax bill, but there is no reason to believe the Senate would pass it or the president would sign it if this fight spills into next year,'' he said.
Even some fierce conservatives said they were putting aside reservations about the overall cost to back the plan. ''I am going to fight to put this nation back on the road to fiscal sanity,'' said Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, announcing that he would vote aye.
In the Senate, Democrats on Thursday night abandoned efforts to pass a $1.2 trillion spending bill to finance the federal government through Sept. 30, and said they would accede to Republicans demands for a short-term stop-gap measure instead.
Senators said the stop-gap bill would run through the early part of next year, at which point Republicans will have greater leverage over spending decisions.
Senate Republicans had pledged to stop the spending measure, even though it included millions of dollars for projects that they had requested, and had threatened to force the entire bill, which is more than 1,900 pages, to be read aloud on the Senate floor.
Mr. McConnell, in floor remarks, praised the Appropriations Committee, of which he is a member, for its work on the spending bill that he and other Republicans blocked.

HEADLINE: Bigger Is Easier

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
President Obama faces an enormously difficult challenge over the next few weeks.
On the one hand, this moment is ripe for fundamental change. There is a pervasive sense that the nation is at a Sputnik moment when it either rises to face the international competition or it does not. Commissions are churning out sweeping proposals. The economy is strong enough for policy makers to think beyond the immediate crisis but not so strong that it allays the national fear of decline.
On the other hand, just as the popular longing for change is at its strongest, the political barriers preventing change are at their strongest, too. The Democrats in Congress distrust the White House and can barely work with the Republicans. Republicans are not in a mood to compromise and can barely work with the Democrats. Many in both parties are willing to wait until 2013, when their side might have more leverage. Voters are cynical about all of them and want every program cut except the ones they benefit from. 
Obama's challenge in the State of the Union address is to give voice to the inchoate longing for change, and to chart a political path through the Washington minefield so that voters and bond markets have the sense that the country is at least beginning to grapple with its problems.
To do that, the president doesn't have to go out on a limb and embrace specific (and politically suicidal) hard choices. But he probably does have to violate some taboos, on right and left, to give people a sense that everything is now up for discussion.
Then he'll probably have to fence off areas of cooperation from areas of conflict. Over the next months, the parties will fight over health care repeal and the rest. But while that's going on, it should be possible to build momentum and trust by working on corporate tax reform, individual tax reform, Social Security reform and other things. These issues are hard because they involve taking on powerful special interests. But at this moment in history, that's exactly what voters want to see their leaders doing together.
Most important, the president will probably have to take advantage of the following paradox: bigger is easier. If he just tinkers around the edges with modest proposals, then everybody will be on familiar ground. But if he can expand the current debate, then, suddenly, everybody is on new ground.
The general approach should be to offer the left something it really craves. Then offer the right something it really craves. Then, once you get them watering at the mouth, tell them they're going to have to bend on the things they don't care about in order to get the things they do.
To get the left excited, Obama might offer an activist growth agenda. This would involve spending more on infrastructure, research and job training -- the basic things he has always talked about. But it also would mean going further and embracing industrial policy.
Personally, I don't think the government is very good at investing in green energy, Midwestern job growth or other things. But many liberals do believe this. Smart economists like Dani Rodrik and Jeff Faux have been hatching what they call smart industrial policy proposals. Others have talked about learning from the Chinese and Singaporeans. If Obama showed some support for this kind of stuff, he'd generate enormous excitement on the left.
To get the right excited, he needs to offer fundamental welfare state reform. So far, most efforts to avert national bankruptcy have involved controlling spending but keeping the basic structure of the safety net intact.
But it should be possible to strengthen the safety net while modernizing some of the Great Society structures. Paul Ryan, a Republican, and Alice Rivlin, a Democrat, have come up with a Medicare reform plan in which new enrollees would receive a fixed contribution from the government, growing a bit faster than inflation. They would apply that money against the cost of health insurance. This would make Medicare a defined contribution program and save hundreds of billions. If Obama said he was open to thinking about this sort of fundamental reform, he'd generate tremendous excitement on the right.
This is the opposite of triangulation. Instead of finding small compromises in the middle, it marries big ideas on the left and right. In a polarized country, it may be easier to push through big change by marrying the left and the right than by relying upon an unfortunately weak vital center.
Moreover, this marriage is intellectually coherent. Joining these initiatives means shifting resources from consumption to production, from current spending to future investment.
Liberals would get dollars for the unemployed in Ohio. Conservatives would cap the growth of government. Bond markets would see credible action. Voters would see a government that can function and a future that looks better than the present.

HEADLINE: History Set To Repeat Itself

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his new blog at norris.blogs.nytimes.com.

 BODY:
A congressman from Texas, long a dissident critic of the Federal Reserve, is scheduled to become the chairman of a House panel with jurisdiction over the central bank. It promises to be a miserable time for the Fed chairman as he is peppered with hostile questions at oversight hearings and with legislation to force complete audits of Fed operations.
So it is now, with Representative Ron Paul about to take over as chairman of the Domestic Monetary Policy Subcommittee of the House Financial Services Committee. Mr. Paul campaigned against big banks, arguing that concentrated financial power goes hand in hand with concentrated political power.
If the Fed were abolished, he wrote last year, ''the national wealth would no longer be hostage to the whims of a handful of appointed bureaucrats whose interests are equally divided between serving the banking cartel and serving the most powerful politicians in Washington.'' 
It is not hard to imagine Mr. Paul lecturing the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in a committee room: ''You can absolutely veto everything the president does. You have the power to veto what the Congress does, and the fact is that you have done it. You are going too far.''
And so it was back in 1964, when that lecture was actually given by the then-new chairman of the House Banking Committee, a Texas congressman named Wright Patman. As Time magazine then wrote: ''For three decades, Wright Patman has fumed and fussed that the Federal Reserve system is too secretive, too independent, too insensitive to the hopes of small borrowers. A sharecropper's son, he often charges that it is a tool of Wall Street bankers.''
A joke during Mr. Patman's tenure was that the reason he chose a bright red carpet for his office was to hide the blood stains after William McChesney Martin Jr., then the Fed chairman, emerged from private meetings.
Mr. Paul is well aware of the precedent. His 2009 best-selling book, ''End the Fed,'' quotes Patman's lecture and then adds, ''I actually consider this an understatement, because in the past year or so during this bailout process, the Federal Reserve has garnered an unbelievable amount of power, making it much more influential around the world than the Congress or the president has ever been.''
Among the bills Patman pushed was one to audit the central bank. The Dodd-Frank Act passed this year allows for limited audits, and extending them is a centerpiece of Mr. Paul's agenda. Patman bitterly fought big bank mergers, while Mr. Paul condemns allowing banks to become too big to fail.
There are major differences between them, aside from the fact one is a Republican, while the other was a Democrat. Mr. Paul is a sound-money man who longs for the gold standard and thinks the collapse of paper money is inevitable. Patman was far more sympathetic to printing money, even voicing outrage during the Depression at the idea that government would pay interest to borrow money. Why not just print it, he asked?
Mr. Paul denounces the Fed for causing inflation, saying that producing inflation is the major reason for its existence. In 1937, Patman proposed legislation to require the Fed to stabilize the purchasing power of money, but he had something different in mind. He wanted to restore price levels to what they had been in 1926. To do that would have required inflation of about 25 percent to reverse the deflation of the Depression.
Another difference is the role a landslide played in regard to both men. In 1974, the Watergate wipe out produced a flood of liberal Democrats who were determined to put aside seniority as a strict determinant of chairmanships. Patman, who had been in the House since 1929, was ousted in a move that no doubt pleased the Fed. He died in 1976, just before Mr. Paul entered Congress.
The Republican landslide this year elected several representatives sympathetic to Mr. Paul's views, and weakened the party establishment that had previously kept Mr. Paul from being chairman of a subcommittee. This week Representative Spencer T. Bachus of Alabama, the incoming chairman of the Financial Services Committee, announced that Mr. Paul would have the job.
Mr. Bachus has endorsed Fed audits that go beyond the limited review called for by the Dodd-Frank Act, but he is anything but hostile to banks. He told The Birmingham News last week that ''my view is that Washington and the regulators are there to serve the banks.'' The News said he ''later clarified his comment to say that regulators should set the parameters in which banks operate but not micromanage them.'' His press secretary said he was too busy for an interview.
Mr. Paul takes on the subcommittee post at a time when the Fed is far better known than it was in the 1960s, and after its reputation has alternately soared and plunged. It was given credit for the long booms of the 1990s and earlier this decade, and for steering the economy out of the mild 2001 recession. There was criticism of its role in the technology stock bubble that preceded that downturn, but it was mild compared with the excoriation the Fed received for its failure to counteract the housing bubble that led to the recession that began in 2007.
In the end, neither Patman nor a later Fed-doubting Texas chairman of the committee, Henry Gonzalez, had much impact on the Fed. ''We did not achieve a whole lot,'' Mr. Paul said in an interview this week, recalling his work with Gonzalez. ''But I think things are changing.''
In the past, the majority in Congress, whether Republican or Democrat, was generally supportive of the financial establishment. That is still true, but the support has frayed amid resentment over big bonuses going to bankers whose jobs might have vanished had the government not bailed them out. Many Republicans embrace Mr. Paul's criticism of the Fed's role in the bailout and in the current monetary easing, which involves buying $600 billion in longer-term Treasury securities.
Fortunately, for both the Fed and the economy, the signs seem encouraging. The retail sales report this week was stunningly good, signaling a strong economy in the current quarter and into next year. The tax deal worked out between President Obama and Republican lawmakers will provide economic stimulus, even if it is not particularly efficient.
One sign of economic optimism is surging interest rates on long-term Treasuries. During the first 10 trading days of December, the yield on 10-year Treasuries rose from 2.8 percent to almost 3.5 percent. It has been nine years since yields rose that much over so short a time. Then markets were beginning to suspect the 2001 recession was ending, as it was. Markets now seem to expect a much better recovery next year than we saw this year.
There is another available interpretation. ''Did these rates move higher because the economy is getting stronger,'' asked Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group, ''or because bond investors fear the Fed is about to err by continuing to pump too much money into an economy that is in the midst of accelerating? Our concern, after talking to clients, is that it's the latter.''
So far, however, you can't find much evidence of that in the markets. The breakeven inflation rate on Treasury securities -- the rate investors seem to expect based on the relative yields of regular five-year Treasuries and inflation-indexed bonds -- has risen only a little, to 1.7 percent a year. As the Fed said this week in announcing no change in policy, ''longer term inflation expectations have remained stable.''
Mr. Paul was careful not to predict legislative success. ''I'm not making any rash promises,'' he told me. ''I'm up against a lot of influential and very powerful people. They've been able to work in secrecy since 1913,'' the year the Fed was established.
The idea of hostile Congressional hearings making a Fed chairman miserable may seem surprising to those with memories that go back only to the era of Alan Greenspan as oracle. But there is a rich precedent. Paul Volcker took his share of lumps when he was driving up interest rates to stop inflation, and bringing on a severe recession in the process. Now he is revered, in large part because he was successful.
If the economy fails to revive and inflation surges -- in other words, if Ben Bernanke's term as chairman looks like a failure -- pressures for fundamental changes at the Fed could become irresistible. But for the time being, it is likely that Mr. Paul's new post will provide more entertaining hearings than actual legislation.

HEADLINE: Harris Takes Control as Nets End an Eight-Game Losing Streak

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON and JOANNE C. GERSTNER

 BODY:
Devin Harris knew that facing the Washington Wizards, a team without a road victory this season, was the best opportunity for the Nets to snap their eight-game losing streak -- and he had to be the one to do something about it.
''This was one we had to have,'' said Harris, who called a team meeting before the game, then went out and had 29 points and 9 assists in the Nets' 97-89 victory Thursday night. ''If I'm going to be the guy here, then it's all about being aggressive and making things happen.'' 
Harris connected on 14 of 17 from the free-throw line, including six straight over the final 1 minute 30 seconds, to help the Nets (7-19) win for the first time in December and send the Wizards (6-18) to their 13th straight road loss.
Nets Coach Avery Johnson appreciated the way Harris took charge of the team, before and during the game.
''He had a little team meeting with the guys and the guys responded,'' Johnson said. ''Devin took charge on both ends of the floor for us. We need Devin to play like this. We need Devin to take shots.''
Harris was only 7 of 25 from the field, but made the plays down the stretch.
''We needed a little bit of a change,'' said Nets center Brook Lopez, who added 18 points. ''We needed to hold ourselves accountable a little. We're all sick of losing.''
The Wizards played without the top overall draft pick John Wall and forward Andray Blatche, both of whom sat out with knee problems.
The Nets, who led by 23 points in the second quarter, got 12 points and 17 rebounds from Kris Humphries.
The reserve Nick Young led the Wizards with 22 points.
CELTICS 102, HAWKS 90Kevin Garnett had 17 points and 13 rebounds -- one of three Boston players with a double-double -- to lead the host Celtics to their 12th straight win.
Paul Pierce had 15 points and 10 assists and Glen Davis had 18 points and 10 rebounds. Ray Allen scored 18 points and Nate Robinson had 14 for the Celtics (21-4). Marvin Williams had a season-best 26 points for the Hawks.
Boston point guard Rajon Rondo missed the game after spraining his left ankle in Wednesday's win at New York. He is expected to be sidelined at least a week.
PISTONS SALE TALKS SLOW After months of negotiations, talks to sell the Detroit Pistons have hit a major impasse as Karen Davidson, the team's owner, and Mike Ilitch, the leading candidate to buy the club, remain far apart on price.
Davidson said she hoped to sell the club by the start of the season, but now will be lucky to reach an agreement before the All-Star Game in February, according to several people involved in the sale.
Davidson and Ilitch, who had a 30-day exclusive negotiating window that expired before Thanksgiving, were still tens of millions of dollars apart. The two sides are still in contact, but talks have slowed with the holidays approaching.
The club was originally thought to be on the market for $425 million, a price some investors balked at. Although the Pistons are in an arena that is paid for, the team has been losing season-ticket holders, suite holders and corporate sponsorships because of the team's poor play and the impact of the recession on the economy in the Detroit area.
The sale process was complicated last week by the takeover of the New Orleans Hornets by the N.B.A., which paid about $300 million for the distressed team.
''Three hundred million for the Hornets is as much of a stretch as $400 million for the Pistons,'' said one investor with knowledge of the bidding process.
Citi Private Bank's Sports Finance and Advisory, which is representing Davidson, has started calling back some of the investors who originally bid on the club. Tom Gores, a Michigan native and billionaire who made his money in private equity, was originally interested in buying the team, as was George Postolos, a former executive with the Houston Rockets.
KEN BELSON AND JOANNE C. GERSTNER YAO HAS STRESS FRACTURE Yao Ming has a stress fracture in his left ankle, and the Houston Rockets said there was no timetable for his return. The career of Yao, a 7-foot-6 center, may be in jeopardy after a series of injuries.
Yao has been out since Nov. 10 with what had been called a bone bruise in the same ankle. A magnetic resonance imaging test performed Thursday revealed the stress fracture.
Yao sat out last season after surgery to repair his broken left foot. (AP)

HEADLINE: Who's Defining Middle-Class Values?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Ben Franklin's Nation,'' by David Brooks (column, Dec. 14):
I agree that it was the social context undergirding capitalism that created the American bourgeoisie, and that we must do a better job of celebrating and defining middle-class values.
But what has happened to those middle-class values? 
It seems there is a new social order -- or is it simply today's capitalism by which we measure our value? Does a major league ballplayer prove that he is the best because he can command a $125 million contract compared with the next guy at $110 million? Does a New York banker prove he is the greatest because of the many more millions or billions he takes home or controls compared with his competitors?
I doubt it, but something is clearly damaging our society as the rich get richer, the poor get poorer and the middle class shrinks.
Being middle-class with bourgeois dignity does not require aristocracy. It does require attention to the working class and the underclass if we are to survive as a democratic, happy people that can take care of its needs, and have a little left over for non-necessities.
Robert Weiss Mill Valley, Calif., Dec. 14, 2010
To the Editor:
Our values do set us apart from much of the world, but it is possible to think of America as an exceptional country without believing in a myth of American exceptionalism.
American dominance in the half-century after World War II was the product of specific historical circumstances. As the world recovered from postwar devastation and the Soviet Union's collapse ended the cold war, the world changed and multiple centers of economic and military power emerged.
Competing in a world of ''relative equals'' will test our values. History shows us that nothing lasts forever, not that there was some betrayal of what was divinely ordained to be.
Steven Berkowitz New York, Dec. 14, 2010
To the Editor:
I was horrified by David Brooks's idea that America could market its middle-class values to the newly ascendant Asian and Latin American countries.
I came to this country from India primarily because I was curious about it, possibly because I was taken in by the lure of its marketing. Many of us came seeking to excel in a meritocracy that valued our special intellectual abilities.
But I realize now that if there's one thing that's truly toxic in this country, it is its middle class, with its debt-laden suburban mansions, humongous S.U.V.'s and minivans, garages crammed with yesterday's gadgets and an insatiable need to surpass the Joneses.
If in 2030, these middle-class ''values'' of overconsumption and waste were to infect half a billion Indians, it would be a disaster for our planet.
Sridhar Subramanian Goleta, Calif., Dec. 14, 2010
To the Editor:
David Brooks writes of the need for well-defined middle-class values. As Senator Bernard Sanders pointed out in his filibuster on Dec. 10, the middle class is under attack, from the very rich and the corporations. Therefore, we see lower wages, and a drop to the underclass.
Republican ''middle-class values'' also leave those in the middle class behind, as they vote in more Republicans, at their own expense.
If we don't get a government that truly supports a middle class, by making good health care available to all, for instance, and supporting research and development for new industries, we are in trouble.
India will have a middle class, and we won't. Dan Donnelly Williston, Vt., Dec. 14, 2010

HEADLINE: Basel Report Shows Global Banks Are Far Short of Meeting Capital Rules

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- The largest global banks, especially those in Europe, may be hundreds of billions of dollars short of the capital reserves needed to comply with new regulations and may face pressure to shed risky assets as a result, according to figures released Thursday by two influential regulatory panels.
One of the panels, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, also provided a more detailed description of the rules it was developing for global banks, prompting some critics to complain that the definition of banks that are too big to fail seemed to be narrowing. 
Based on their 2009 financial results, the 94 largest banks would have been 577 billion euros, or $769 billion, short of the risk-free capital they will need to hold under new rules endorsed by the Group of 20 countries, the committee said.
The banks have until Jan. 1, 2019, to fully comply with the new rules, and many have already started bolstering their reserves. Their collective profit in 2009 -- a bad year for banking -- was 209 billion euros, suggesting that most institutions would be able to meet the new requirements by retaining profits instead of paying them out to shareholders.
''The transition period provides banks with ample time to move to the new standards in a manner consistent with a sound economic recovery while raising the safeguards in the system against economic or financial shocks,'' said Nout Wellink, chairman of the Basel Committee and president of the Dutch central bank.
The largest banks, from 23 countries including the United States, Japan and China, are also short of liquid assets that the rules will require them to hold as protection against short-term shocks, like the one after the failure of Lehman Brothers in 2008.
Taken together, at the end of 2009 the big banks had only 83 percent of the short-term cash they would need to keep operating during an emergency, when raising cash in the money markets would be difficult.
Separately, the Committee of European Banking Supervisors released a study on Thursday saying that the capital shortfall for the 50 largest banks in Europe would be 263 billion euros, or $351 billion. The study used the same methodology and time frame as the Basel Committee report, suggesting that more than half the shortfall lies with European institutions. Europe also has the highest concentration of international banks.
While there is a long transition period for banks to increase capital, markets could pressure them to act sooner.
''It's a competitive issue,'' said Ernest T. Patrikis, a partner at the law firm White & Case in New York and former chief operating officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Clients may say, '''I want to do business with a bank that has the most capital, the safest, most prudent banks,''' Mr. Patrikis said.
One of the Basel Committee's findings was that smaller banks were better capitalized, on average, than the big global institutions. Among 263 smaller institutions surveyed, the shortfall in reserve capital was only 25 billion euros, or $33 billion, based on 2009 results, a sum almost covered by a single year of profits. ''The small- and medium-sized banks, which are important for lending to business, are for the most part already there,'' said Stefan Walter, secretary general of the Basel Committee.
The smaller institutions also had almost all the cash they needed to withstand a financing shock, according to the committee, which consists of national bank regulators and heads of central banks. By contrast, the big institutions generally are more involved in activities that raise their level of risk and therefore their assets as calculated for regulatory purposes. The lower a bank's risk-weighted assets, the less capital it will have to hold. Big banks may face pressure to shed riskier assets to more easily comply with the new rules.
The committee also provided a 69-page description of the new rules, intended to clarify what they will mean in practice.
Harald A. Benink, a professor of economics at Tilburg University in the Netherlands, who follows banking regulation closely, said he was disappointed in what seemed to be a narrowing of the definition of banks too big to fail.
The Basel Committee and a separate panel based in Basel, the Financial Stability Board, are developing more stringent rules for banks whose problems can send shock waves around the world.
The document released Thursday suggested that the additional requirements would apply only to banks that are active globally. That is a mistake, Mr. Benink said, because countries like China have large banks that are not very active overseas but could rock the global financial system if they ended up in trouble.
''The number of banks which will qualify as global systematically important financial institutions will be very small,'' he said. ''My fear is that with the focus on global institutions this will not be a meaningful exercise.''
Leaders of the Group of 20 countries endorsed the Basel rules when they met in Seoul, South Korea, in November, and national authorities are incorporating them into their banking regulations.

HEADLINE: Rally Gives Dow and S.&P. Highest Closes of Year

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
A small drop in unemployment claims and a higher profit forecast by FedEx helped push stocks up Thursday. The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed at their highest levels of the year. 
The Labor Department said first-time claims for unemployment benefits fell last week to 420,000, the third drop in four weeks. The four-week average of claims also slid for the sixth consecutive week, reaching the lowest level since July 2008. That was before Lehman Brothers collapsed and markets seized up at the height of the financial crisis.
Separately, the Commerce Department said that housing starts rose slightly last month, reversing a two-month decline.
Card companies fell sharply after the Federal Reserve proposed a 12-cent cap on the fees that merchants pay every time a customer uses a debit card. Merchants now pay 1 to 2 percent of each transaction.
The proposal could cut revenue for major banks and card networks like Visa and MasterCard. Visa fell 12.7 percent, to $67.19. MasterCard fell 10.3 percent, to $223.49.
FedEx rose 2 percent, to $94.22, after the company raised its earnings predictions for next year because businesses and consumers were shipping more packages. Traders took that as a sign that the economy was improving.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 41.78 points, or 0.4 percent, to 11,499.25. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 7.64 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,242.87. The Nasdaq composite index rose 20.09 points, or 0.8, to 2,637.31.
Gains came across the market. All 10 company groups in the Standard and Poor's 500-stock index rose.
Alcoa was the biggest gainer of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow index, rising 3.6 percent, to $14.46. American Express fell the most. The company lost 3.4 percent, to $44.57.
A vote on a bill to extend the Bush-era tax cuts along with unemployment benefits was postponed Thursday afternoon by the House of Representatives. The Senate passed the bill on Wednesday. The tax package, a compromise between the White House and Senate Republicans, is expected to increase economic growth next year but also to widen the budget deficit.
House Democratic leaders say they will pass the bill but only after voting on whether to raise the proposed rate for the estate tax.
Interest rates were lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 27/32, to 93 10/32, and the yield fell to 3.42 percent from 3.53 percent late Thursday.
Investors have been selling Treasuries as their outlook on the economy improves, sending yields on the bonds higher. The yield on the 10-year yield was as low as 2.49 percent as recently as Nov. 4.
The dollar fell 0.2 percent against an index of six heavily traded currencies. Gold fell 0.8 percent.

HEADLINE: A Call for a Federal Office to Guide Online Privacy

BYLINE: By TANZINA VEGA

 BODY:
A Commerce Department task force called for the creation of a ''Privacy Bill of Rights'' for online consumers and the establishment of an office within the department that would work to strengthen privacy policies in the United States and coordinate initiatives with other countries.
The department's Internet Policy Task Force, in a report released on Thursday, said the ''Privacy Bill of Rights'' would increase transparency on how user information was collected online, place limits on the use of consumer data by companies and promote the use of audits and other forms of enforcement to increase accountability. 
The new protections would expand on the framework of Fair Information Practice Principles that address data security, notice and choice -- or the privacy policies many users agree to on Web sites -- and rights to obtaining information on the Internet.
''The simple concept of notice and choice is not adequate as a basis for privacy protections,'' said Daniel J. Weitzner, the associate administrator for the office of policy analysis and development at the Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration.
Consumer and privacy advocates said they were encouraged by the idea to expand on the fair practice principles. The report comes at a time when Internet privacy is a big priority in Washington with the release of a similar report by the Federal Trade Commission this month, the establishment of a White House subcommittee on privacy and Internet policy and the pending revision of the privacy directive of the European Union.
The F.T.C., in its report on online privacy this month, also called for improvements to the practice principles, but focused on installing a ''do not track'' mechanism that would allow computer users to opt out of having their information collected surreptitiously by third-party companies.
That recommendation caused concern in the online advertising industry, which has said that such a mechanism would hamper the industry's growth and could potentially limit users' access to free content online.
The task force report made little mention of a ''do not track'' option, but its members did recommend the creation of voluntary codes of conduct that would address emerging technologies and issues not covered by an expanded set of practice principles. The codes would be created by technology companies in the industry and would be approved by the Federal Trade Commission.
The new Privacy Policy Office proposed by the task force would work with the administration, the F.T.C. and other agencies on issues surrounding international and commercial data privacy issues. The office would not have enforcement authority.
''America needs a robust privacy framework that preserves consumer trust in the evolving Internet economy while ensuring the Web remains a platform for innovation, jobs and economic growth,'' the commerce secretary, Gary F. Locke, said in a statement. ''Self-regulation without stronger enforcement is not enough. Consumers must trust the Internet in order for businesses to succeed online.''
During a conference call after the announcement, however, representatives from the World Privacy Forum, the Consumer Federation of America and other organizations said they were concerned that a privacy policy office would be part of the Commerce Department and not an independent agency.
The report recommends that the F.T.C. remain the lead enforcement agency for consumer privacy issues. It also recommends that the United States continue to discuss privacy frameworks with other countries.
''Today's report is a road map for considering a new framework that is good for consumers and businesses,'' Mr. Locke said. ''And while our primary goal is to update the domestic approach to online privacy, we are optimistic that we can take steps to bridge the different privacy approaches among countries, which can help us increase the export of U.S. services and strengthen the American economy.''
Mike Zaneis, the senior vice president and general counsel at the Interactive Advertising Bureau, said he was encouraged by the report. ''It gives us an opportunity as an industry to prove that we can continue to move the ball forward on consumer privacy,'' Mr. Zaneis said.
According to a statement issued by the department, global online transactions are estimated at $10 trillion a year. Data from a 2009 study commissioned by the Interactive Advertising Bureau reported that interactive ads were responsible for $300 billion of economic activity in the United States annually.
The department will seek comment on the report through Jan. 28 and will publish questions from the report next week. No date has been set for the publication of final recommendations.

HEADLINE: Hoping to Lure Tech Jobs, City Seeks a Partner to Open a Graduate School of Engineering

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
Worried that New York City is not spawning enough technology-based start-up companies with the potential to become big employers like Google, city officials are inviting universities around the world to create an engineering campus on city-owned land.
Despite being home to more college students than any other city in the country, New York does not have a top-rated graduate school of engineering on a par with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology or Stanford University. Without one, the city has fallen far behind San Francisco, Boston and other metropolitan areas in the competition to attract new technology companies and the jobs they create, city officials said. 
On Thursday, Robert K. Steel, the deputy mayor for economic development, announced that the city would seek a ''top caliber academic institution'' as a partner in building a school for applied science and engineering. Hinting that there might be more interest among institutions based in other cities or countries, Mr. Steel cited the establishment of Cornell University's medical school in Manhattan as a precedent.
The city is willing to consider locating the new facility on one or more of its properties, including the old hospital campuses at the Brooklyn Navy Yard and on Roosevelt Island. Mr. Steel said city officials were open to suggestions about other locations for the school and would be willing to make a significant investment in the project. He did not provide an amount, but another city official said the value of the city's contribution, including real estate, could reach $100 million.
The announcement came in Mr. Steel's first public speech since he joined the Bloomberg administration this summer as a successor to Robert C. Lieber, who returned to private work. Mr. Steel said the city's economy had recovered stronger and faster from the recession than the rest of the nation had.
The State Labor Department reinforced that view by reporting that the city's unemployment rate edged down again in November, to 9.1 percent. Having declined steadily from a peak of 10.5 percent a year ago, the unemployment rate for the city is now significantly lower than the national rate, which rose to 9.8 percent in November, from 9.6 percent in October.
The number of private jobs in the city has increased by 1.6 percent in the last year, compared with just 1 percent for the country as a whole, said James Brown, principal economist for the department.
''We've been moving in the right direction, even if the month-to-month moves have been fairly small,'' Mr. Brown said. ''The flip side is we still have 350,000 unemployed people. It will take a long time of good solid job growth to get those numbers down to where they were when unemployment was 5 percent.''
The state's unemployment rate rose last month to 8.3 percent, from 8.2 percent in October, while the number of jobs statewide was virtually unchanged.
Finding ways to prompt job creation while the city government is laying off workers and cutting spending on new projects will be a primary mission for Mr. Steel, a former executive of the Goldman Sachs investment bank who was an official of the Treasury Department a few years ago. Speaking at Google's office in Manhattan, he attributed the city's relatively strong recovery to policies fostered by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to ''unleash the creative power of our people.''
Many of those efforts, like setting up incubators for nascent companies around the city, have been carried out with minimal financing. But the engineering center is a much bigger idea that could require many millions of dollars.
''It's a bold idea and a good one that could really happen,'' said George Campbell Jr., the president of the Cooper Union, a highly rated undergraduate engineering school in Manhattan. ''It's a question of money.''
Dr. Campbell said he had visited the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, a new research institution in Saudi Arabia. Built from scratch, that school cost about $9 billion, he said.
''We could build a world-class facility for much less than that, if the city is really serious about putting serious resources into building a world-class research facility,'' Dr. Campbell said.
He added that Cooper Union probably would respond to the city's request for expressions of interest.
Edward Guiliano, the president of the New York Institute of Technology, said his institution also would respond and hoped to get involved in the venture.

HEADLINE: Burnishing an Old Banking Name in a Modern World

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
LONDON - For Leonhard H. Fischer, chief executive of the European investment firm RHJ International, the future of banking lies in its past.
When Kleinwort Benson, the eminent British private banking brand with a 200-year history, came up for sale last year, RHJI, a spinoff of the American private equity house Ripplewood, swooped in. The acquisition of the business was completed in July for 230 million, or $363 million.
Now, Mr. Fischer bets that the Kleinwort Benson name is still strong enough to attract clients as he builds a traditional merchant bank around it, complete with private banking, asset management and advisory services. 
''Our goal is to position Kleinwort Benson back to the future as a classical merchant banking business,'' Mr. Fischer said. ''We want to be niche, opinionated, with a conservative private banking business and highly sophisticated advice. In a world that's defined by uncertainty, this is an old approach that will be modern again.''
Mr. Fischer is convinced that in today's crowded financial market there is room for a well-capitalized niche player with unique investment ideas. Wealthy clients are seeking a safe haven for their money outside larger banks tarnished by the financial crisis, he said. From Kleinwort Benson's London base, Mr. Fischer aims at wealthy expatriates and attract clients like trust funds, large corporations and governments worldwide.
Analysts differ on whether Mr. Fischer's plan will take off, and even Mr. Fischer acknowledged that competition was fierce. Banking giants like JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank have recently stepped up hiring to expand their wealth management operations as tighter capital rules hit their investment banking operations.
''The incumbents have just become stronger so it's not easy,'' Andrew Lim, a banking analyst with Matrix Group in London, said. Kleinwort Benson ''needs to show that the money can grow with them.''
Kleinwort Benson had about 4.7 billion in assets under management at the end of September, 11 percent less than a year earlier. Revenue dropped 7.7 percent to 18 million in the third quarter, compared with the same period last year. To strengthen the wealth management business, Mr. Fischer hired Sally Tennant in October from the private Swiss bank Lombard Odier as its chief executive.
Some analysts said that Kleinwort Benson was still a recognizable brand in financial circles and one that could help attract clients. It is also a brand Mr. Fischer is familiar with. Mr. Fischer, 47, was in charge of what was called Dresdner Kleinwort from 2000 to 2002 when it was Dresdner Bank's investment banking unit.
Mr. Fischer said he was ''really convinced that we made a very good investment.''
''We liked the remaining business mix and the fact that it had a clean and straight-forward balance sheet,'' he said. ''It's not one where every morning we'd wake up sweating that the regulator would call.''
For Kleinwort Benson, the transaction is the latest in a long list of different ownerships ever since Kleinwort, Sons & Company merged with Robert Benson & Company in 1961. Robert R. Benson had been financing the construction of British railway lines while Alexander Friedrich Kleinwort started off trading cigars in Cuba before underwriting stock sales, including that of Sears Roebuck & Company in 1906.
When Margaret Thatcher deregulated Britain's securities market in the 1980s, an event known as the Big Bang, it was a threat to the merchant banking model. In the years that followed renowned British banking names like Morgan Grenfell and SG Warburg disappeared into the hands of European banks looking to compete with American rivals by offering a broader range of services. Kleinwort Benson was bought by Dresdner Bank of Germany.
It then changed owners twice again and last year was put up for sale by Commerzbank as part of an agreed government bailout after losses during the financial crisis.
Mr. Fischer's career so far was almost as tumultuous as Kleinwort Benson's history. A former JPMorgan trader, he climbed the ranks at Dresdner Bank so quickly that at the age of 36 he became the youngest board member in Germany in 1999. A year later, at the peak of the dot-com boom, Mr. Fischer decided to expand the unit and buy the American advisory boutique Wasserstein Perella for the steep price of about $1.5 billion.
The acquisition turned out to be costly for the bank and for Mr. Fischer's reputation. Two years later, a disagreement about strategy between Dresdner's Frankfurt-based management and Mr. Fischer's London-based investment bank escalated and Mr. Fischer left for Credit Suisse.
There he successfully fixed and then sold the troubled insurance business Winterthur, but his achievement failed to get him the chief executive position at the Zurich-based Credit Suisse he wanted, and Mr. Fischer quit for RHJI.
Some bankers said Mr. Fischer paid too much for Kleinwort Benson, especially because he has yet to add other services like financial advisory. But Mr. Fischer said his offer was just 10 percent above Kleinwort Benson's net asset value and his hiring plans in the short term were restricted to about 15 bankers.
''It's wrong to assume that we'll go out and hire tons of mergers and acquisitions bankers,'' Mr. Fischer said. ''We're not out there to compete on league tables. We'll always be small.''
Over the next three years, RHJI plans to sell its nonfinancial assets, which account for 60 percent of its portfolio and include a holiday resort in Japan, and become a pure financial group. RHJI, which is based in Brussels, also brought its other financial investments, including a Dublin-based asset management business, under the Kleinwort Benson roof.
Mr. Fischer said he saw the future of the firm in London even as bigger banks threaten to move abroad because of higher taxes and tighter bonus rules. ''This is the place where people want to bank because they feel safe,'' he said. ''We don't need to open offices everywhere around the world.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Financial Bailout May Cost Less Than Thought

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, said Thursday that the $700 billion financial bailout would end up costing taxpayers less than Congressional analysts had estimated. 
The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that taxpayers will lose $25 billion on the rescue of banks, other financial institutions and automakers that came in at the peak of the crisis in the fall of 2008.
Mr. Geithner told a hearing by a Congressionally appointed panel that it would cost less than that.
''Those estimates are now around $25 billion,'' Mr. Geithner said. ''They are too high, in my judgment. Ultimately, they'll be lower.''
Mr. Geithner did not provide another estimate.
Measured in cost, he said, the bailout ''will rank as one of the most effective crisis-response programs ever implemented.''
The most important fact, he said, is that the government's combined investments in banks, financial institutions, automakers and credit markets ''will show a positive return,'' he said. ''The losses will be limited to the amount we spend on our housing programs.''
Mr. Geithner said the nation's financial system today ''is in a much stronger position than it was before the crisis.''
Still, he acknowledged, with unemployment hovering at an average 10 percent, ''Our work is not done.''
The damage, he said, is ''profound and tragic.'' He also said the housing market remains weak.
The panel's chairman, Ted Kaufman, Democrat of Delaware, said the economy ''is in a tremendously better place today than it was'' before the financial rescue came in.

HEADLINE: Howard Brown Center Tries to Mend Finances and Reputation

BYLINE: By JESSICA REAVES. 
jreaves@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
Howard Brown Health Center, a longtime pillar of Chicago's gay and lesbian community, faces its most daunting crisis: reclaiming its reputation as one of the nation's premier advocacy institutions in the wake of a financial scandal earlier this year that left its supporters shaken and led to the ouster of top executives.
This week, the agency's new senior management oversaw the final days of an emergency 50-day, $500,000 fund-raising appeal, and finalized plans to replace its board by June 30. The moves followed revelations that the center, known nationally for its contributions to public health research, was being investigated after accusations that it misused federal grant money to cover operating costs.
The task of mending the 36-year-old agency, which provides low- or no-cost medical care and counseling to 36,000 people a year, now falls to Jamal Edwards, 34, a lawyer who took over in June. Mr. Edwards must fill a huge budget gap while identifying new sources of revenue. 
''There is a history of mismanagement,'' Mr. Edwards said in an interview on Monday. Mr. Edwards, the chief executive and president of the Howard Brown Health Center, a low-slung modern building in the Uptown neighborhood, exuded a quiet confidence as he talked about past financial problems and missed opportunities for growth. He refused to assign blame for the current mess.
Last spring, the news broke in the Windy City Times, a gay advocacy newspaper, that the center was under investigation by the National Institutes of Health for allegedly misusing money meant to finance an AIDS study. Many people around the city were angered by the reports.
Although an internal investigation found that there was no intentional wrongdoing or ''misappropriation for personal gain,'' the center said that in October the matter was referred to investigators in the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the N.I.H. The institutes' Office of Extramural Research said it would not comment on whether it is conducting a review.
Numerous people in the gay community pointed fingers at Michael C. Cook, who was the chief executive of Howard Brown. Mr. Cook's 2005 appointment was hailed as a fresh start for the center, which was reeling from the arrest of a senior development officer on drug possession charges, followed quickly by the previous chief executive's forced resignation. Mr. Cook, who could not be reached for comment on this story, was widely credited with boosting the center's visibility and recruiting more minorities and women.
Mr. Cook and Mark Joslyn, the chief financial officer, were placed on administrative leave in April after the N.I.H. investigation was made public. A few weeks later, Mr. Cook resigned and Mr. Joslyn was fired. Mr. Edwards, meanwhile, had been appointed to the Howard Brown board in March as a nonvoting member. Formerly a litigator at Kirkland & Ellis, he also briefly served as the center's pro bono general counsel. He was named chief executive and president in June.
His first six months on the job have been eventful. In August, the N.I.H. compelled Howard Brown to turn over the balance of an ongoing federal AIDS study grant to Northwestern University, its longtime research partner.
The $539,000 transfer was a substantial blow to the center's roughly $12.5 million annual operating budget. Howard Brown's management eliminated 10 positions and curtailed employees' health benefits earlier this year, then decided to replace the lost money through the $500,000 donation drive. As of Wednesday, the total raised was just over $400,000, and Editha Paras, the chief financial officer, said she was confident they would reach their goal by Thursday's deadline.
That leaves Mr. Edwards free to identify additional revenue sources, including one tried and true option: shopping. The recession has slowed charitable giving, but the center has seen one benefit -- an increase in traffic and donations at its three Brown Elephant resale shops, which attract 250,000 visitors and net about $1 million annually. That money pays for services not covered by grants, Mr. Edwards said.
Other plans for reviving the bottom line include expanding pharmacy services and attracting more insured patients to the center's clinic and to Triad, its newly acquired private practice at Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center. Patients with insurance, regardless of sexual orientation, can support the center's mission by using its services, Mr. Edwards said. ''For every two or three insured patients we treat,'' he said, ''we can treat one person for free.''
For Danny Jones, 36, visiting Howard Brown's clinic was a form of activism. ''I have insurance,'' Mr. Jones said Monday as he waited for a prescription at the clinic's in-house pharmacy. ''I choose to come here, because this is a place I want to support.''
Mr. Jones, who drives 30 minutes to the clinic from his home in Bridgeport, said he had not seen a doctor in 10 years before hearing about the center from a friend. ''I haven't found anyone else who has made me feel this comfortable,'' he said. ''I don't have to explain myself, or my sexuality or why I want to be referred to in a certain way.''
This is an example of the ''culturally competent, affirming care'' Mr. Edwards referred to repeatedly in an interview -- the care that may be compromised if the center doesn't improve its finances.
Financial analysts say that because Howard Brown depends primarily on private donations, which may slow during recessions but rarely dry up altogether, its balance sheets should be in better shape than agencies that rely more heavily on depleted state coffers. But an examination of the organization's amended tax returns for fiscal years 2007 and 2008 revealed deeply seated troubles.
The returns show an organization unable to capitalize on its assets, stretched beyond its financial limits and making some questionable decisions. In 2008, faced with rising debt, the board approved a $55,000 raise and a $25,000 discretionary bonus for Mr. Cook, the former chief executive, boosting his total compensation to $272,690 from $197,708. During that same year, Dr. David Blatt, one of Howard Brown's two full-time physicians, took a $6,000 pay cut, to $165,676 from $171,761.
Mr. Edwards, whose compensation package is reportedly more than $250,000, said he would not comment on past actions, but said, ''I can assure you that going forward we are committed to fiscal health and responsibility, including compensating our talented staff fairly and responsibly.''
In six months, Mr. Edwards said, ''we'll need another $500,000 -- not because there's a big shortfall, but because we can't count on being able to raise enough to pay our debts.''
Which leads to the half-million dollar question: In a competitive climate for charitable contributions, how far will donors go for Howard Brown?
Amy Gudgeon, a senior consultant at Fiscal Management Associates, a firm that provides financial advice to nonprofit organizations, said the answer depends largely on an agency's willingness to engage in candid conversations with its donors and constituents.
''You have to emphasize transparency and a renewed commitment to financial accountability,'' said Ms. Gudgeon, who added that she is not familiar with the specifics of the Howard Brown case.
''And you need to do a deep-dive assessment of internal controls,'' she said. ''Why did the fraud or mismanagement happen? How are you going to keep it from happening again?''

HEADLINE: Sides Far Apart on a Potential Pistons Sale

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON and JOANNE C. GERSTNER

 BODY:
After months of negotiations, talks to sell the Detroit Pistons have hit a major impasse as Karen Davidson, the team's owner, and Mike Ilitch, the leading candidate to buy the club, remain far apart on price. 
Davidson said she hoped to sell the club by the start of the season, but now will be lucky to reach an agreement before the All-Star Game in February, according to several people involved in the sale.
Davidson and Ilitch, who had a 30-day exclusive negotiating window that expired before Thanksgiving, were still tens of millions of dollars apart. The two sides are still in contact, but talks have slowed with the holidays approaching.
The club was originally thought to be on the market for $425 million, a price some investors balked at. Although the Pistons are in an arena that is paid for, the team has been losing season-ticket holders, suite holders and corporate sponsorships because of the team's poor play and the impact of the recession on the economy in the Detroit area.
The Pistons, one of the N.B.A.'s top-drawing teams in the last decade, are 19th in the league in attendance this season, at 15,629 fans per game. That is down from ninth last season. On some nights, the 22,076-seat arena is less than half-filled.
The sale process was complicated last week by the takeover of the New Orleans Hornets by the N.B.A., which paid about $300 million for the distressed team, about $100 million less than Davidson was asking for the Pistons.
''Three hundred million for the Hornets is as much of a stretch as $400 million for the Pistons,'' said one investor with knowledge of the bidding process.
Citi Private Bank's Sports Finance and Advisory, which is representing Davidson, has started calling back some of the investors who originally bid on the club. Tom Gores, a Michigan native and billionaire who made his money in private equity, was originally interested in buying the team, as was George Postolos, a former executive with the Houston Rockets.
Mark Costiglio, a spokesman for Citi Private Bank, had no comment.
Ilitch has sought the Pistons because he lives in Detroit and already owns the Tigers and the Red Wings. He has wanted to build a new arena for the Red Wings in downtown Detroit, and having a second tenant in the Pistons would make the building more profitable. With three teams, Ilitch would have more reason to start a regional sports network.Ilitch is also in a good position to understand the depths of the Pistons' problems. This spring, he hired a dozen executives who worked in the team's front office and for the company that runs the Palace of Auburn Hills, where the Pistons play.
Davidson's company, Palace Sports and Entertainment, filed suit against Ilitch's company, Olympia Entertainment, in June, alleging that the former employees tried to steal proprietary information about season-ticket holders, advertising and other documents.
Kevin Grigg, a spokesman for the Pistons, had no comment on the sale talks. Karen Cullen, a spokeswoman for Ilitch Holdings, said she could not comment, citing a nondisclosure agreement.

HEADLINE: Security Forces Open Fire On Protesters in Ivory Coast

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER; Adam Nossiter reported from Dakar, Senegal, and J. David Goodman from New York.

 BODY:
DAKAR, Senegal -- Security forces loyal to President Laurent Gbagbo of Ivory Coast opened fire on demonstrators in the economic capital, Abidjan, on Thursday, beating and killing marchers who had planned to disrupt state television, one of the principal underpinnings of the government's hold on power, according to observers and news reports.
A leading Ivorian human rights group said at least 15 people had been killed among the crowds of supporters of Alassane Ouattara, who was elected president last month in a long-delayed vote but has been unable to assume office because Mr. Gbagbo has refused to step down. 
Estimates of the scale of violence varied widely. Mr. Ouattara's camp said 32 people were killed Thursday, while Amnesty International said that 9 were killed and news agencies reported death tolls between 6 and 18.
A police spokesman for Mr. Gbagbo's government declined to provide specifics in a phone interview, saying, ''I know nothing about it.'' But Mr. Gbagbo's education minister said on state television that 20 people had died, 10 of whom were police officers attacked by armed protesters, news agencies reported.
Mr. Ouattara has been recognized as the winner of last month's election by the United Nations, the African Union, the United States and the European Union, leaving Mr. Gbagbo in near-total diplomatic isolation. But he has resisted repeated calls to cede the office he has had for 10 years, the last five of which he held without an election.
The country's top elections officer proclaimed Mr. Ouattara the winner on Dec. 2, by a nearly nine-point margin. Only a day later, the head of the Constitutional Council, who is a close ally of the president, threw out vote totals from parts of the north -- the stronghold of Mr. Ouattara -- because of what he called ''flagrant irregularities,'' leading both men to claim the presidency.
The deadly standoff between the rival presidents appeared to be broadening on Thursday, as armed forces associated with the Ouattara camp clashed with Mr. Gbagbo's troops on the streets of Abidjan, as well as in a town in the center of the country. The town, Tiebissou, is just south of a de facto border separating the northern half of the country -- which has been controlled and exploited by rebels, known as the New Forces, since a 2002 civil war -- from the south, which is controlled by Mr. Gbagbo. Mr. Ouattara's prime minister, Guillaume Soro, is the secretary general of the New Forces.
Abidjan endured a day of tear gas, gunfire and loss on Thursday, as demonstrators confronted well-armed security forces all over the city. At one point, Mr. Gbagbo's forces fired on a Ouattara position, a spokesman for Mr. Ouattara said, leaving one dead.
The protests stemmed from calls by Mr. Soro earlier in the week for a march on the headquarters of state television, one of the main sources of information in the country after Mr. Gbagbo banned foreign broadcasts. It has become a tireless propaganda machine for his government.
The call for a pro-Ouattara march appeared to be well heeded, as some neighborhoods were crowded with demonstrators from early morning, observers said. But the march soon turned into a rout.
The United Nations issued a statement expressing alarm at the escalating violence, warning that those responsible for attacks against civilians would be brought to justice.
Mr. Soro had asked the United Nations to protect the marchers, but he was turned down, a United Nations spokesman told reporters on Thursday, because the request fell outside the organization's mission. United Nations platoons continue to defend Mr. Ouattara's headquarters in a hotel in one of Abidjan's well-to-do neighborhoods.
''There have already been a lot of deaths,'' Drissa Traore, head of a leading human rights group, the Ivorian Movement for Human Rights, said in a phone interview from Abidjan. ''In every neighborhood, the security forces are firing on people.''
The shooting was concentrated in neighborhoods loyal to Mr. Ouattara. In Cocody, a middle-class, largely residential neighborhood, the crowd was ''pushed back by tear gas,'' said Andre Kamate, head of another local human rights organization, the Ivorian Human Rights League. Near the disputed television station, ''I saw people stripped and beaten by the security forces,'' Mr. Kamate said.
Late Thursday, there was no indication that either side was backing down. The Ouattara camp had previously said it would take over government offices downtown on Friday. Mr. Soro called on Ivorians to ''mobilize, and not be distracted by this dictatorship of tanks.''
In Abidjan, worried observers see a dangerous endgame shaping up. ''The two camps have decided to finish it off,'' Mr. Traore said. ''Negotiation is finished. The battle is joined.''

HEADLINE: Higher Commodity Prices Dent General Mills's Profit

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
General Mills posted lower-than-expected second-quarter results, hurt by higher commodity costs and the effect of aggressive discounts.
The results are the latest to show how the nation's food industry is being squeezed by rising prices for ingredients like wheat and cocoa, and a fear that recession-weary consumers will resist the price increases needed to help cover those costs. 
''Consumers are now accustomed to reduced prices and getting them to pay a higher price may not be easy,'' said Erin Swanson, an analyst at Morningstar.
General Mills, usually one of the industry leaders in keeping its costs down, also faced a difficult comparison with strong earnings growth a year earlier.
Still, the company stood by its full-year forecast, saying that new products and cost-cutting, as well as price increases and a shift to more profitable products, should help the back half.
Net income was $613.9 million, or 92 cents a share, up from $565.5 million, or 83 cents a share, a year earlier.
Excluding a tax benefit and accounting for commodity hedges, earnings were 76 cents per share.
Analysts on average were expecting 78 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters.
Sales in the period, which ended Nov. 28 and was the second quarter of the company's fiscal year, rose 1 percent to $4.07 billion. The company actually sold 3 percent more food, but more of that came at lower prices, while it also had to rely on discounting to attract shoppers. Margins were also hurt by higher costs for dairy, resin-based packaging, fuel, cocoa and wheat.
The company still says it expects full-year earnings of $2.46 to $2.48 a share, excluding one-time items.
General Mills also distributes Yoplait yogurt in the United States. Industry watchers say General Mills could be a suitor for the 50 percent stake in Yoplait that a private equity fund, PAI Partners, wants to sell.
Shares in General Mills, which is based in Minneapolis, rose 21 cents, to $36.59 a share.

HEADLINE: Vendors at Aqueduct Flea Market Seek New Home as Closing Nears

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH A. HARRIS

 BODY:
Every Saturday and Sunday at 6 a.m., Aftabudeen Edun pulls his truck into an expansive parking lot in Ozone Park, Queens, and unloads tiny bottles of perfume and moisturizer, lip balm and deodorant, laying them out in neat rows on folding tables. For 16 years, Mr. Edun, a 46-year-old immigrant from Guyana who owns two cosmetic stores on Liberty Avenue, could be found, usually in the same spot, on scorching summer days and in the chill of early December mornings, selling his wares at the Aqueduct Flea Market.
But last month, after more than 30 years, the flea market, which fills the racetrack's north parking lot, lost its lease as the racetrack prepared to make room for thousands of slot machines, along with upscale restaurants. At the end of the year, the market's 500 or so vendors must pack up their tables and tents for good. 
''I make more money here than sitting in the store all day,'' Mr. Edun said. ''But the market is closing forever. I have to find someplace else.''
The flea market offers a hodgepodge of goods, like bedding, incense and pots and pans. A crochet hat can be had for $3, a pair of jeans for $12. The bargains attract loyal customers, some from as far away as Boston and Baltimore who roll in on tour buses.
Eve Breau, 59, a medical technician who lives in East Flatbush, has driven to the flea market from Brooklyn nearly every weekend for the last 10 years.
''Walking around here is like therapy,'' Ms. Breau said, strolling by a stall filled with pink and red paper flowers, their petals crinkling in a cold morning breeze. ''They have everything.''
The casino, which broke ground last month, will be a very different beast. The developer, Genting New York, a subsidiary of the largest gambling company in Malaysia and Britain, hopes eventually to turn the project into a destination resort, complete with upscale hotels. It says the casino may generate more than $1.5 million per day in tax revenue.
Genting said that keeping a flea market open during construction raised safety issues, and the State Division of Lottery, which regulates casinos, does not have a mechanism in place to administer a flea market. But there were other issues at play, as well.
''The casino operation is an attempt to go upscale, and a flea market is by nature sort of downscale,'' said Betty Braton, the chairwoman of Community Board 10, which represents the neighborhood, adding that there had been reports of counterfeit goods being sold at the market over the years. ''We're looking forward to the economic development that is going to come from the casino operation.''
While the project would create jobs, some fear they will not be available to the vendors who are being forced to make way, many of whom are immigrants.
''A lot of these people aren't formally educated, so it's difficult for them to transition to another job,'' said Richard S. David, the executive director of the Indo-Caribbean Alliance, a community organization based in Ozone Park.
The market closes down every January and February, since it is usually too cold for selling and browsing, but the vendors do not know what lies ahead for them in March. Carol DeSanto, the general manager of Plain and Fancy Shows, which operates the flea market, said last week that a search for a new location had so far been unsuccessful, and many of the vendors who have tried on their own to find a home at other flea markets have been rebuffed.
''There isn't space in other markets,'' said Savitri Harry, 47, who works as a baby-sitter for a family in Manhattan during the week and sells jewelry at Aqueduct on the weekends. ''I can't pay my bills without the market. I can't.''
The Indo-Caribbean Alliance is trying to find a new site where the vendors can contract directly with their new landlord, rather than going through an intermediary like Plain and Fancy. Mr. David said that they were looking at sites in Brooklyn and Queens, including a parking lot close to the Aqueduct site, but that they needed to move quickly so the vendors don't start to scatter.
''The success of the market relies on all the vendors' staying together,'' Mr. David said. ''It depends on that variety.''
But some of them have already made contingency plans, and the market has begun to break apart.
''I'll be O.K.; I'll go to another market,'' said Arturo Alonzo, 45, standing between rows of blue jeans and plastic mannequins. ''But this is a nice community. I'll be sad to see it go.''

HEADLINE: Housing Starts Increase; Jobless Filings Unchanged

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Housing starts in the United States rose slightly more than expected in November, but permits for future home construction fell to an 18-month low. 
Also on Thursday, the Labor Department reported that first-time claims for jobless benefits were essentially unchanged in the latest week, continuing a recent downward trend, but remaining too modest to bring down unemployment.
In the housing report, the Commerce Department said that housing starts rose 3.9 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 555,000 units. October's starts were revised up to a 534,000-unit pace from the previously reported 519,000 units, which was an 18-month low.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected housing starts to rise to a 550,000-unit rate.
Despite last month's pickup in residential construction, housing remains weak as a 9.8 percent unemployment rate weighs on demand and homeowners' ability to hang on to their properties.
New building permits fell 4 percent, to a 530,000-unit rate last month, the lowest since April 2009, after a 0.9 percent increase in October. Permits were dragged down by a 23 percent decline in the volatile multifamily segment. Permits for single-family homes rose 3 percent last month.
Analysts had expected building permits to rise to a 560,000-unit rate in November.
Groundbreaking last month was lifted by a 6.9 percent increase in single-family home construction. Starts for the multifamily segment, however, fell 9.1 percent. New home completions fell 14.1 percent to a record low 513,000 units in November.
In the jobs report, the Labor Department said that initial claims dipped slightly to 420,000 last week, matching the median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists, from a revised 423,000 in the previous week.
However, continuing claims, which exclude the millions of Americans relying on extended benefits, rose to 4.14 million in the week ended Dec. 4. That was far higher than the reading of 4.07 million analysts had expected, and the previous week's figure was also revised up considerably.
The total number of Americans claiming benefits, including those relying on a federal emergency program of extended benefits that has been the subject of heated political debate in Washington, rose by nearly 900,000, to 9.2 million on a nonseasonally adjusted basis in the week to Nov. 27.
In another report, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's Business Outlook Survey showed that manufacturing activity in the mid-Atlantic region continued to improve in December. All of the broad indicators remained positive and suggest an expansion of activity. The index increased to 24.3 in December from 22.5 in November.
Increases in input prices were more widespread this month, and more firms reported increases in prices for their manufactured goods.
The survey's broad indicators of future activity suggest that optimism among the region's manufacturing executives also continues to improve.

HEADLINE: Judge Hints He May Rule Against Health Law

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
PENSACOLA, Fla. -- A federal judge asserted on Thursday that it would be ''a giant leap'' for the Supreme Court to accept the Obama administration's defense of a central provision of the new health care law, suggesting he may become the second judge to strike it down as unconstitutional.
In a three-hour hearing, the judge, Roger Vinson of Federal District Court, said the law's requirement that most Americans obtain insurance, a provision that takes effect in 2014, would constitute ''a giant expansion'' of the court's traditional application of the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. 
''People have always exercised the freedom to choose whether to buy or not buy a commercial product,'' the judge said, noting that he had been uninsured and paid out of pocket when his first son was born.
The hearing came on dueling requests for summary judgment in a lawsuit brought by governors and attorneys general from 20 states, all but one of whom are Republicans. Because of the plaintiffs' prominence, the cases carry the most political weight of the roughly two dozen court challenges to the sweeping law.
The Supreme Court has held previously that Congress can use its Commerce Clause authority, which is among the powers assigned to the national government, to justify the regulation of ''activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.''
Ian H. Gershengorn, a deputy assistant attorney general who is defending the law, told Judge Vinson that the health care market was unique because getting sick was both unpredictable and potentially bankrupting. The economic consequences of not having insurance -- including cost-shifting to others -- justify its regulation by Congress, he said.
But lawyers representing the state officials argued that the insurance requirement was unconstitutional because it would, for the first time, require citizens to buy a commercial product.
If the government is allowed such power, said David B. Rivkin Jr., who represented the state officials, the health law ''would leave more constitutional devastation in its wake than any statute in our history.''
A similar argument was convincing to another federal district judge, Henry E. Hudson of Richmond, Va., who ruled Monday in a separate case that the health law left federal authority without ''logical limitation.''
Although two other district court judges had already upheld the insurance mandate, Judge Hudson rejected it, creating a conflict for appellate courts to resolve. He did not suspend any part of the act pending appeals, which are expected to end at the Supreme Court.
Judge Vinson, a senior judge appointed by President Ronald Reagan, has seemed somewhat more receptive than Judge Hudson to the states' argument that the entire health care law should fall if the insurance mandate is unconstitutional. He said the act was analogous to a watch with interlocking and interdependent wheels.
''It's also been compared to a Rube Goldberg invention,'' he remarked.
Judge Vinson said he would rule ''as quickly as possible.''
As in the past, the judge seemed unpersuaded by the plaintiffs' secondary argument that the health care act violated state sovereignty by imposing a vast expansion of Medicaid eligibility, also slated for 2014. The Medicaid health insurance program for the needy is a shared state and federal program, but the federal government sets minimum eligibility thresholds.
Although the law requires the federal government to absorb the full cost of the expansion initially, states eventually will pay 10 percent, and governors are fearful about the burden on their strained budgets.
Blaine H. Winship, special counsel to Florida's attorney general, Bill McCollum, argued Thursday that the expansion amounted to a coercive ''bait and switch.'' He said states had joined the Medicaid program, enticed by its limited initial scope and generous federal payments, only to watch helplessly as Washington expanded eligibility and the states' obligations.
Yet, he said, states are now so dependent on federal Medicaid dollars to treat the poor that withdrawing from the program is not realistic.
Judge Vinson seized on the fact that states can opt out of Medicaid. He noted that governors and lawmakers in several states had been discussing that very possibility, most notably in Texas, which is one of the plaintiffs.

PERSON: Maynard W. Glitman 

HEADLINE: Maynard W. Glitman, Arms Negotiator, Dies at 77

BYLINE: By MARGALIT FOX

 BODY:
Maynard W. Glitman, a diplomat who led the American side in negotiating the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty, signed by the United States and the Soviet Union in 1987, died on Tuesday in Shelburne, Vt. He was 77 and had homes in Fletcher and Burlington, Vt.
The cause was complications of dementia, his wife, Christine, said. 
The I.N.F. treaty, as it is known, represented a significant advance in United States-Soviet relations amid the cold war; from 1985 onward, Mr. Glitman, a respected veteran of the Foreign Service with expertise in arms control, was the United States' chief negotiator. The treaty was the first nuclear-arms agreement to mandate the reduction of weapons by both sides, rather than simply capping the number each was allowed to possess.
Signed by President Ronald Reagan and the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Dec. 8, 1987, the treaty banned all land-based medium- and shorter-range nuclear missiles -- that is, ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges from about 300 to about 3,400 miles.
The treaty was approved by the United States Senate in May 1988 and entered into force on June 1 of that year. It was the first major American-Soviet arms accord the Senate had approved since the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty of 1972.
For Mr. Glitman, a career diplomat who was later the United States ambassador to Belgium, the accord was the culmination of more than six years of negotiations. He chronicled their progress, frustrations, reversals and eventual resolution in a memoir, ''The Last Battle of the Cold War: An Inside Account of Negotiating the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty,'' published in 2006.
Maynard Wayne Glitman, known as Mike, was born in Chicago on Dec. 8, 1933. He earned a bachelor's degree in international affairs from the University of Illinois in 1955, followed the next year by a master's from Tufts University's Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.
Afterward, Mr. Glitman joined the State Department as an economist. In the late 1960s, he served on the staff of the National Security Council, and in 1976 he was named deputy representative to NATO in Brussels. His other foreign postings included the Bahamas, Canada and France.
In 1981, the I.N.F. talks began in Geneva, with Mr. Glitman as deputy negotiator under Paul H. Nitze. In November 1983, the Soviet delegation broke off the talks in response to NATO's deployment in Europe that month of American-made Pershing II and cruise missiles.
During the hiatus, President Reagan appointed Mr. Glitman chief negotiator for the mutual and balanced force reduction talks in Vienna.
The I.N.F. talks resumed in March 1985, with Mr. Glitman as the chief negotiator on medium-range forces. (Parallel talks were held on space and defensive arms, led by Max M. Kampelman for the United States, and on strategic arms, led by former Senator John G. Tower.)
By all accounts, Mr. Glitman was a steady, sobering presence. ''He is generally regarded as a solid professional but not the type who is likely to thump the table insisting on compromises,'' The New York Times wrote of him in 1985.
On May 27, 1988, the Senate approved the I.N.F. treaty by a vote of 93 to 5. As was reported at the time, applause swept not only the gallery but also the Senate floor, a highly unusual occurrence.
By June 1, 1991, as mandated by the treaty, the United States and the Soviet Union had collectively dismantled more than 2,600 missiles. After the Soviet breakup later that year, several former Soviet republics, including Belarus and Ukraine, joined Russia and the United States in carrying out the treaty.
In 2007, partly in response to American plans to deploy a missile shield in Eastern Europe, Russian military officials threatened to withdraw from the I.N.F. treaty. That October, however, the United States and Russia issued a joint statement affirming their continued support.
After serving as ambassador to Belgium from 1988 to 1991, Mr. Glitman taught political science at the University of Vermont and contributed articles to foreign-affairs publications.
Besides his wife, the former G. Christine Amundsen, whom he married in 1956, Mr. Glitman is survived by three sons, Russell, Erik and Matthew; two daughters, Karen Glitman and Rebecca Trieb; a brother, Joseph; a sister, Paula Glitman; and six grandchildren.
As ambassador, Mr. Glitman was on hand in December 1988 as the last cruise missiles were taken out of Belgium, making it the first country to be cleared of intermediate-range nuclear weapons.
''I don't feel very emotional about it now,'' he told The Times that day. ''Tonight I'll go home and say: 'Gosh. It really happened.' ''
This article is reprinted from Thursday's early edition.

HEADLINE: Tax Deal Hits Procedural Snag in the House

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Brian Knowlton and Janie Lorber contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON --The $858 billion tax cut package negotiated by the White House and Republican leaders hit a procedural snag on Thursday, as liberal Democrats skirmished with party leaders over its estate-tax provisions. At issue was whether the House would vote on an amendment to tax a larger proportion of wealthy estates and to apply a higher rate than was provided for in the compromise package.
An aide to the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, described the setback as temporary, and said that it would probably delay an overall vote on the tax plan until Thursday evening.
Liberal Democrats, many of them angry about the prospect of continuing the tax policies of President George W. Bush, complained that party leaders had structured the debate so that they could not vote in favor of amending the estate tax provision without also voting in favor of the entire package. 
Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York, said he supported the change in the estate tax, which he said would save $23 billion. But he complained, ''In order to do that, I would have to accept the remainder of the Senate bill.''
As a result, House Democratic leaders postponed a vote on the proposed rule laying out how the floor votes on the tax plan would be taken, to negotiate an alternate plan. Republicans, who are expected to vote for the overall tax plan in large numbers, were unlikely to support the rule, largely because Democrats control the entire process.
Many Republicans would like the opportunity to vote on a proposal to extend all of the Bush-era tax rates without the compromise provisions negotiated by the White House.
As the House opened debate on the tax plan on Thursday, lawmakers in both parties expressed unhappiness with aspects of it, but House leaders nonetheless said they expected the bill to be approved and sent to President Obama for his signature.
The Senate overwhelmingly approved the measure on Wednesday by a vote of 81 to 19. But if the House were to amend it by changing the estate tax provision or any other part, the bill would have to be approved anew by the Senate.
House Democrats had planned two votes on the tax bill in their chamber. The first would have been to approve the bill while altering it to tax more wealthy estates and at a higher rate. And if that failed, as expected, the House would have then voted to approve the package unchanged.
Republicans have said they will not accept any changes, and Mr. Obama has urged Congress to approve the bill as quickly as possible as is.
As debate began on the House floor, Democrats complained that the bill would give too many tax breaks to the wealthy and do too little for working-class Americans or for the economy as a whole. Republicans complained that the package was too expensive and would add to the nation's debt, which they say is already rising to dangerous levels.
''We can do better than this,'' said Representative James P. McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts. ''We must do better than this.''
Representative Thaddeus G. McCotter, Republican of Michigan, said, ''This bill will not end the suffering of the unemployed and economically anxious Americans, it will prolong it.''
But with the Bush-era income tax rates due to expire at the end of the month, thereby effectively raising taxes on everyone, the House seemed to see little option but to follow the Senate in adopting the measure, and accepting tough concessions for both sides.
With the Senate vote on Wednesday, Democrats yielded in their long push to end the lower tax rates on high incomes enacted under Mr. Bush, and Republicans agreed to back a huge economic stimulus package, including an extension of jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed and a one-year payroll-tax cut for most workers, with the entire cost added to the federal deficit.
It was the first concrete product of a new era of divided government and acid compromise.
In the House, some lawmakers said they recognized the need to act. ''If we don't pass the extension of the tax cuts now, every American will see smaller paychecks and higher taxes in January,'' Representative Gerry E. Connolly, Democrat of Virginia, said on Thursday.
House Democratic leaders predicted that the package would be approved one way or another. Speaking on MSNBC, Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, said that while he though the proposal to modify the estate-tax provisions had ''a decent shot,'' if the tax plan is put to a vote as is, ''I think my best guess is that it passes.''
Still, on Wednesday evening, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, was not ready to concede on the estate tax issue.
''We will make our point,'' Ms. Pelosi said at a news conference, repeating her opposition, shared by many Democrats, to the provision granting a tax exemption to estates of up to $5 million per person, or $10 million per couple. Republicans have said they will not accept any change.
Meanwhile, Representative Joseph Pitts, Republican of Pennsylvania, deplored the earmarks -- more than 6,000 of them -- in the Senate omnibus spending bill, calling it ''a legislative travesty.'' Saying that Americans were tired of paying taxes ''so $165,000 can pay for maple-syrup research,'' he added, ''We don't need to be growing the federal government, we need to be shrinking it.''
Other Democrats predicted that the tax plan would be passed as is on Thursday, making clear that their initial fury at the prospect of extending Bush-era tax rates even on the highest incomes had given way to acceptance that the White House, its leverage weakened by midterm election losses, had negotiated the best compromise it could. President Obama urged Congress again on Wednesday to pass the bill unchanged and without delay.
Mr. Obama praised the Senate action, calling the bill ''a win for American families, American businesses and our economic recovery,'' even as he nodded to the tough bargain he had struck, adding, ''It includes some provisions that I oppose.''
Some Democrats said they had concluded that the administration had won important concessions to help middle-income Americans as well as the unemployed while giving a short-term jolt to the struggling economy. Others said they simply could not be held responsible for allowing all of the Bush-era tax cuts to expire at the end of the month, raising taxes on everyone.
The Senate's overwhelming approval of the tax plan was a brief flash of bipartisan cooperation amid the deep partisan acrimony in the waning days of the 111th Congress. The tax plan was supported by 43 Democrats, 37 Republicans and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut. Opposed were 13 Democrats, 5 Republicans and Senator Bernard Sanders, independent of Vermont. Mr. Lieberman and Mr. Sanders caucus with the Democrats.
''A tremendous accomplishment,'' the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, declared shortly before the vote on Wednesday. ''Whether you agree with all the contents of the bill or not, everyone should understand this is one of the major accomplishments of any Congress where two parties, ideologically divided, have agreed on a major issue for the American people.''
The two-year tax measure will touch virtually every American -- poor and rich, old and young, married or single, with children or living alone, and even those who die. And, with a reprise of this year's contentious debate now slated for the height of the 2012 presidential campaign, the bill is likely to be a precursor to a broader effort by Mr. Obama to overhaul the nation's labyrinthine tax code and begin tackling the long-term deficit.
The tax plan would extend all of the lowered income tax rates enacted under President George W. Bush, as well as the 15 percent rate on capital gains and dividends, which were due to expire at the end of this month.
And it would set new estate tax parameters, including the exemption of $5 million per person, or $10 million per couple, and a maximum rate of 35 percent. All these provisions would last for two years. The estate tax lapsed entirely this year, but was set to return on Jan. 1 with an exemption of $1 million per person and a maximum rate of 55 percent.
The bill would also keep jobless aid flowing to the long-term unemployed for 13 more months, maintaining extended limits, which now range from 60 weeks in states with less than 6 percent joblessness to 99 weeks in states where the unemployment rate is more than 8.5 percent. Benefits normally last for 26 weeks.
The one-year payroll tax cut would reduce to 4.2 percent the 6.2 percent Social Security tax levied on income up to $106,800. For a family with $50,000 in annual income, the cut would yield tax savings of about $1,000. For a worker paying the maximum tax, it would provide savings of $2,136.
The bill also contains an array of other tax breaks for individuals and businesses, aimed at pumping up the economy. It continues a college tuition credit for some families, an expanded child tax credit and the earned income tax credit. It also includes a two-year adjustment to the alternative minimum tax to prevent as many as 21 million more households from being hit by it, and it contains a provision allowing businesses to write off certain expenses more quickly.
The tax deal was sealed in back-channel talks between Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. It offered a glimpse of a new power dynamic that is likely to characterize the next two years, as Republicans take control of the House and occupy six more seats in the Senate.
Democratic opponents of the plan said it would overly benefit the wealthiest Americans and not do enough for the working class and the poor, and that the money used to continue reduced tax rates on the highest incomes could be better spent on other steps to stimulate the economy. Before the vote on Wednesday, Mr. McConnell denounced the effort by Democrats to approve a $1.1 trillion spending bill that would finance the government through the end of the federal fiscal year on Sept. 30.
Mr. McConnell called on Democrats to approve a stop-gap spending measure that would last only through the early part of next year instead, and to abandon everything else on their agenda and adjourn for the year.
Democrats, however, are refusing to back down on any of their priorities, which include the omnibus spending bill, the New Start arms control treaty with Russia, a bill to repeal the military's ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy barring open service by gay men and lesbians, and an immigration measure that would create a path to citizenship for certain illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children.
The spending bill in particular has incited a contentious battle. Senator Daniel K. Inouye, Democrat of Hawaii and chairman of the Appropriations Committee, said he believed he had the votes to pass it. Senate Republicans have denounced the bill, which includes hundreds of lawmaker-directed spending items known as earmarks, only to face blistering questions about earmarks they themselves had requested.
Aides to Mr. Reid said they had mapped out a path to securing votes on all of the legislation, which would mean staying in session until next Thursday, two days before Christmas, and potentially returning the week before New Year's Day.

HEADLINE: Chinese Leader Hails India And Vows to Double Trade

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY

 BODY:
NEW DELHI -- China and India set ambitious new economic targets on Thursday by pledging to nearly double their trade in the next five years to $100 billion annually. But the two Asian giants appeared to make little progress on tough geopolitical differences over Pakistan, terrorism and their disputed border.
Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China, who is visiting India this week for the first time since 2005, spoke warmly about Indo-Chinese relations and how the two nations could mutually prosper without encroaching upon each other. ''We are friends, not rivals,'' Mr. Wen said during an afternoon speech at the Indian Council of World Affairs. ''We will always be friends and will never be rivals. This should be the firm conviction of every Chinese and every Indian.'' 
Mr. Wen's agenda in New Delhi has been twofold: expanding trade and trying to open India's markets to Chinese companies, while also offering reassurances that China does not represent a threat to India's own rise. It is a message that comes as growing Chinese assertiveness in the region has worried India and many other Asian nations. And it comes as the United States and India pledged to create a deeper partnership after last month's visit by President Obama.
Mr. Wen, who has cultivated an avuncular public image rare among Chinese leaders, has waged a charm campaign in India. He visited an international school in New Delhi, where he encouraged the students to call him Grandpa Wen and offered a lesson in Chinese calligraphy by writing the characters for China-India friendship.
During his speech on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Wen spoke of the great Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore, whose poetry is widely taught in Chinese schools, describing him as a ''household name'' in China. He also described his morning visit to the memorial of Mohandas K. Gandhi, the father of modern India and exemplar of Indian democracy, as a deeply emotional moment, saying that Gandhi ''has always lived in my heart.''
Despite such sentiments, Mr. Wen did not appear to offer any breakthroughs on the hardest issues. The two countries agreed to open a hot line between the two prime ministers and schedule regular visits between top leaders. Yet India had hoped that Mr. Wen might offer a clear endorsement of India's ambitions for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, as Mr. Obama did last month. Instead, Mr. Wen spoke in more vague language that fell short of an endorsement.
India also has been concerned about China's support of Pakistan and its reluctance to apply pressure on combating the terrorist groups operating on Pakistani soil. India's foreign secretary, Nirupama Rao, said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and other Indian leaders presented their concerns that Pakistan should do more to eradicate terrorist groups during high-level meetings on Thursday.
''We were able to express our concerns quite clearly,'' Ms. Rao told reporters in an afternoon briefing. ''The Chinese premier was given a very clear understanding.'' Asked if Mr. Wen's visit had essentially accomplished little except maintain the status quo, Ms. Rao said the relationship was slowly moving forward. ''I would say this is a gradual process,'' she said.
Mr. Wen arrived Wednesday with about 300 Chinese executives. The two countries cut business deals worth about $16 billion and signed agreements on Thursday that, among other things, would allow Chinese banks to open branches in India for the first time. Trade between the two countries has risen sharply in recent years and could approach $60 billion in 2010.
''The rapid expansion of our economic cooperation has been one of the major achievements of the last five years,'' Ms. Rao said. ''We are now creating an enabling environment to reach the next economic frontier.''
Yet it remains unclear if this optimism will be enough to ease other sharp differences.
India protested when Chinese officials began stapling a separate paper visa -- rather than the usual stamp -- for anyone from the state of Jammu and Kashmir applying to travel to China. To India, this was a deliberate challenge to Indian sovereignty over Kashmir, the Himalayan region long the subject of a territorial dispute between India and China's ally Pakistan. Ms. Rao said that Mr. Wen raised the stapled visa issue without prompting and recommended that the two sides establish an ''in-depth'' consultation to find a solution.
China's friendship with Pakistan is a source of growing discontent in New Delhi. Indian officials have criticized Chinese plans to build two nuclear reactors in Pakistan, fearing that nuclear materials could fall into the hands of terrorists who want to attack India. India also wants Beijing to join the United States and other nations in condemning the November 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai. ''This is a damage-limitation exercise,'' said a retired Indian diplomat, Lalit Mansingh. ''Wen Jiabao is coming to reassure India that all is well, that we are good friends and economic partners.''
Mr. Wen's 2005 visit was credited with improving relations as he and Mr. Singh agreed on a broad framework to address the two countries' longstanding border disputes. Yet five years later, little progress has been made, even as China has become more assertive in regard to the contested Indian border state of Arunachal Pradesh.
At the same time, water is another contentious issue, amid reports that China is undertaking hydro projects in Tibet that could affect water flow on the Brahmaputra River in India.
In his speech, Mr. Wen offered assurances that China would be responsible in any hydro projects in the Himalayas to ensure that downstream nations would not be affected. He also cited the border dispute and asked for patience, saying more time and more mutual trust were needed.
''The most important thing to do is press ahead along the right road, and narrow differences,'' he said.

HEADLINE: After Soft Sales, FedEx Counts on Holidays

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The FedEx Corporation raised its fiscal full-year outlook on record holiday shipments, sending shares higher even after its second-quarter profit missed Wall Street expectations.
''We're now more bullish about the remainder of the year based on our record-setting peak volumes and greater anticipated customer demand for our services,'' the company's chief executive, Frederick W. Smith, said Thursday in a conference call. ''We believe consumer and business sentiments are improving.'' 
Higher compensation costs cut into profit in the second quarter, while international volume lagged behind the company's expectations and fuel surcharges did not keep pace with rising costs, FedEx said.
''Raising guidance in the face of these headwinds, capturing market share and continuing to make inroads overseas are all positive,'' said Alan Lancz, president of the wealth management firm Alan B. Lancz Inc. in Toledo, Ohio, who owns FedEx shares.
The company's bright outlook trumps the profit miss, he said.
Momentum from holiday shipping is moderating, but high. The company expects that its business in Asia and growth from emerging markets should increase profit margins in the second half of this fiscal year and beyond.
The 223 million peak holiday season shipments that the company expects worldwide would be up 11 percent from a year ago, driven by online and catalog retailers. Books, clothing, consumer electronics and luxury goods account for the volume this year.
FedEx raised its full-year forecast to $5 to $5.30 a share from its previous estimate of $4.80 to $5.25. Its shares rose $1.83, or 2 percent, to $94.22.
The company's fiscal second-quarter net profit was $283 million, or 89 cents a share, compared with $345 million, or $1.10 a share, in the period a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, the company reported a profit of $1.16 a share. Analysts, on average, were expecting earnings of $1.31 a share, according to Thomson Reuters.
Revenue rose 12 percent, to $9.63 billion, compared with forecasts of $9.7 billion.
''This quarter was disappointing, there's no question about it,'' said a Sterne Agee analyst, Jeffrey Kauffman. ''But the volumes are there and getting better.''

HEADLINE: Is 'Triangulation' Just Another Word for the Politics of the Possible?

BYLINE: By MATT BAI

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- At a dinner for Iowa Democrats back in November 2007, Senator Barack Obama lobbed a less than subtle insult in the direction of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, seated just a few feet away. ''Triangulating and poll-driven positions because we're worried about what Mitt or Rudy might say about us,'' Mr. Obama said, referring to two of their Republican rivals, ''just won't do.''
Now the tax deal approved by the House late Thursday has given rise to an emotional debate among Democrats in Washington and online. Is President Obama himself a triangulator? Has he become the kind of compromiser he once disdained? 
Perhaps the better question might be: So what if he has?
The term ''triangulation,'' politically speaking, dates back to the days after President Bill Clinton lost control of Congress in 1994. Mr. Clinton sought the advice of the pollster Dick Morris, who used the term (primarily with the news media) to describe the way in which he thought Mr. Clinton might claw his way back into the public's esteem.
Think of a standing triangle with either party at the corners of its base -- Democrats on the left, Republicans on the right. The president, Mr. Morris argued, should occupy the third point, in the center and well above the partisan fray.
In truth, Mr. Clinton, who never actually used the term, probably didn't need the nice little diagram to point him in this direction. He had come to power in the party as a critic of liberal orthodoxy and had long argued -- at great political peril inside his party -- for fiscal discipline, welfare reform, free trade and a more moderate social agenda. What Mr. Morris called triangulation was really just a strategic frame for the policy goals that Mr. Clinton would most likely have pursued in any event.
Nonetheless, Mr. Morris's glib theory lent credence to the idea that Mr. Clinton had staked out the middle ground on issues like deficit reduction and welfare reform, while purposely antagonizing much of his party's base, primarily to recast his public image as a centrist.
In this relatively narrow sense, it's hard to portray Mr. Obama as a triangulator. Aside from one impromptu soliloquy at the end of a news conference last week, when he appeared to be venting his genuine frustration with the left over the tax agreement, he hasn't sought to highlight his disagreement with liberals to burnish his own credentials as a reformer.
''As I understand it, triangulation is the idea that you demonstrate to some set of swing voters that you are politically palatable by poking the extremes of both parties in the eye,'' says Dan Pfeiffer, the White House communications director. ''If that's what we wanted to do, we would be relishing the loud complaints of some in Congress and on the left. We would much prefer that everyone like this deal and just go forward.''
But of course, triangulation is no longer limited to such a narrow definition. During the Bush years, the new self-described progressives inside the Democratic Party became increasingly furious with the tendency of their politicians to cooperate with Republicans and acknowledge conservative arguments, rather than hold firm to a series of liberal litmus tests. Ultimately, triangulation became a broader term for compromise generally, even if the compromise in question went some way toward furthering progressive goals.
''Again and again, we have Democratic presidents who say, 'Don't make the perfect the enemy of the better,' and 'This is the best I can do,' '' says Robert Reich, the liberal economist and former labor secretary under Mr. Clinton. ''And over and over we have Republican presidents who say, 'I am going to hold out for my principles.' ''
In this more expansive sense of the epithet, one can reasonably tag Mr. Obama as a triangulator. In striking his tax deal -- which extended cuts for the highest income levels and reinstated the estate tax at a much lower rate than sought by liberals, while also extending unemployment benefits and establishing a new payroll tax holiday -- Mr. Obama effectively said that the perfect could not be the enemy of the better, and that this was the best he could do.
The problem with this definition of triangulation, though, is that it comes awfully close to an indictment of governing, generally. Some political compromises, of course, are craven or even disastrous; there's a reason that the words ''appeasement'' and ''Yalta'' remain part of the lexicon. But to disdain pragmatic compromise is to become unyielding and self-satisfied in the service of theory, rather than creative in the service of your agenda.
You could argue, in fact, that this is precisely what happened to George W. Bush. By contrast, one of the Clintonian compromises that most offended liberals -- the 1996 deal with Republicans to balance the budget -- is an achievement that Democrats routinely tout now while bemoaning the fiscal recklessness of the Bush years.
Perhaps Mr. Obama could have won a more progressive resolution to the tax-cut debate had he and Congressional Democrats taken up the issue earlier this year, when the deadline wasn't so close and when the president could have mounted a sustained public campaign. But as it stands, the deal Mr. Obama got, while no one's idea of perfect, will pump hundreds of billions of dollars in consumer and business tax breaks into a languishing economy, while also aiding the unemployed and easing the tax burden on a strained middle class.
On the other hand, had Mr. Obama held the line on principle and allowed all the cuts to expire, as some Democrats would have preferred, the public debate in January would most likely have come down to which of the two parties was responsible for letting middle-class taxes rise during a recession. It's an argument that Democrats, historically vulnerable on taxes and already fending off charges of expanding government, would probably have lost.
Such compromises, ideal or not, are the building blocks of responsible governance. If that makes Mr. Obama some kind of triangulator, then it could also make him a successful president.

HEADLINE: When Even Allies Seem Like Adversaries

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama's effort to forge a fresh start with Republicans is the talk of the capital these days. But on Thursday, Mr. Obama's increasingly complicated relationship with his own party was on full display as the two issues that most define his presidency -- the economy and the war in Afghanistan -- merged on the Washington stage.
With the House approving the tax-cut package Mr. Obama negotiated with Republicans, the president appears to have dragged Democrats into a bipartisan compromise, overcoming objections from the left that he had given up too much and showing that, on the economy at least, he is less inclined than he once was to let his party's Congressional leaders take the lead on big policy fights. 
Mr. Obama's Afghanistan strategy review similarly raised questions about the degree to which he will have to deal with Republicans to offset qualms about his approach among Democrats. In making clear that he intends to stick to his July 2011 date for beginning a troop withdrawal, while at the same time signaling that the military retain a presence until 2014, Mr. Obama seemed to be trying to placate uneasy Democrats, who are pressing for a clear exit strategy, while reassuring Republicans, whose support he will need, that he will not bring a rash end to the war.
As he moves closer to his 2012 re-election campaign, Mr. Obama's relations with Democrats on these issues and others will only grow trickier. Already, Democrats like Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont are openly urging the president not to forget his own party, and warning that if he does so, it will be at his own political peril.
''I think he should reach out to both Republicans and Democrats, but I would urge that they be willing to sit down quietly and listen to some of their friends, especially those who have had a lot of experience here, so that they don't repeat the same mistakes Jimmy Carter made dealing with Congress,'' Mr. Leahy said. He added, ''I don't want Barack Obama to be a one-term president.''
The positions taken by Mr. Leahy, a strong supporter of the president, underscore the challenges Mr. Obama will confront as he tries to prod his party where much of it does not want to go. The senator voted against the tax deal; he said he could not see adding hundreds of billions of dollars to the deficit for a tax break to help the wealthy. And he is deeply concerned about an extended military involvement in Afghanistan.
But as Mr. Obama tends to his Democratic base, he must also be mindful that his interests have diverged from those of Congressional Democrats. If he is to win re-election, some strategists say, he must appeal to independents and forge coalitions, in much the same way Bill Clinton did in the 1990s and Ronald Reagan did in the 1980s.
Mr. Reagan's former chief of staff, Kenneth M. Duberstein, said Thursday that Mr. Obama ''may be following in the Reagan model'' -- a model that, Mr. Duberstein said, would bring political as well as policy benefits to the president.
''What the country is asking for is presidential leadership. What the Democrats are asking for is for him to rebuild the Democratic Party in light of what happened in November,'' said Mr. Duberstein, who voted for Mr. Obama in 2008 but has since criticized him for failing to reach across the aisle during his first two years. ''What you're seeing is him trying to focus on what he has decided is in the best interest of the country, and he will bring along a sufficient number of them.''
On Afghanistan, much more so than taxes, Mr. Obama may have to work hard at bringing the country along. The economy is first and foremost on Americans' list of concerns, and the nation is behind Mr. Obama on the tax-cut deal. A Washington Post-ABC News poll published Thursday found 69 percent support the plan over all -- and support remained at 62 percent even when respondents were told it would drive up the deficit by as much as $900 billion.
Afghanistan, by contrast, barely registered on voters' minds during the recent midterm elections. With the war now in its 10th year, Americans have clearly soured on the conflict. Six in 10 say it is ''not worth fighting,'' the Post-ABC News survey found.
That could spell trouble for Mr. Obama next spring and summer, when he will have to flesh out the details of his troop withdrawal plan -- just as his re-election campaign is heating up. Mr. Obama left the specifics unclear on Thursday, saying his plans would be dictated by conditions on the ground. But at some point he will have to lay out a plan and make a clear case for it if he expects Americans -- and lawmakers in his party -- to get behind him.
''The key issue that has to be made clearly explicit is the connection between our presence there and the continuing threat of attacks by Al Qaeda in Europe and other places -- that if we do not successfully conduct operations to disrupt and degrade Al Qaeda they will come back at us,'' said Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island. ''I think that case has to be made over and over again, and there is an honest and serious debate about what's the best way to achieve that goal.''
Complicating Mr. Obama's task is the fact that many of the moderate Democrats who backed him on the war, like Representative Ike Skelton of Missouri, have lost their seats, leaving a House Democratic caucus that is more liberal -- and more likely to challenge Mr. Obama on Afghanistan next year. So the president may have to rely increasingly on Republicans for support. By keeping his troop withdrawal plans vague on Thursday, he avoided a fight he does not need to have just yet, said Steve Clemons of the New America Foundation, a research organization here.
''His bet is that Democrats aren't going to coalesce against him because it is not that big a deal to them right now,'' Mr. Clemons said. ''But my sense is that when they come into the new Congress, they are going to be ratcheting up a lot more pressure.''

HEADLINE: California Approves Stringent Pollution Curbs

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER; John M. Broder contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- California regulators on Thursday adopted the nation's most comprehensive rules to curb emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases, a move that will put the state far ahead of the rest of the country in energy reform.
The regulations, which reward industries most effective in achieving the cuts by allowing them to sell credits to polluters, will create the largest market for carbon trading in the country. Ten states including New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland and the New England states are participating in a less extensive system known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which covers only electric utilities. 
The California program, which will take effect in 2012, is designed to gradually reduce emissions to about 15 percent below 2012 levels by 2020. A state proposition that would have hobbled its enforcement was soundly defeated in November's election.
The California Legislature passed a law in 2006 setting the goals of the initiative and giving regulators until Jan. 1, 2011, to devise detailed rules to accomplish them.
The 9-to-1 vote, by the California Air Resources Board, comes at a time when most advocates have given up hope of a similar carbon-trading program being instituted at the national level. Cap-and-trade legislation failed in Congress this year. And most observers say that any renewed national effort to put a price on greenhouse gas emissions is at least three years away and would not necessarily include the cap-and-trade model that California has embraced.
President Obama, who, with Democratic leaders, had championed cap and trade, revised his stance after the midterm elections, which swept into office dozens of Republicans who are skeptical about global warming.
''Cap and trade was just one way of skinning the cat; it was not the only way,'' Mr. Obama said after the elections. ''It was a means, not an end. And I'm going to be looking for other means to address the problem.''
As long as Congress and the Obama administration shun cap and trade, California, instead of being the forerunner of a national movement, will remain part of a far-flung archipelago of states and provinces participating in a small carbon market.
Mary D. Nichols, the chairwoman of the Air Resources Board, said at Thursday's meeting, ''We are well aware that we in California are on a different path from many other states in our willingness to be at the front'' of the cap-and-trade movement.
She added, ''We do believe today's decision is an important step, even though a small step for the world as a whole.''
Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger made an appearance at the meeting to congratulate the board. Speaking of his pride in the 2006 law, he said, ''The people you see in front of you are those who make it reality.''
Under California's program, the board will oversee the distribution of allowances to power plants, refineries and other polluters. The program will eventually cover 360 businesses. The allowances will be mostly free for the first three years of the program, with the overall total of allowed emissions declining by 2 percent a year during that time.
Each allowance represents one ton of greenhouse gas emissions. Companies must either reduce their emissions to stay within the allotted allowances or buy credits from other polluters to cover their excess.
Investor-owned utilities like Southern California Edison, San Diego's Sempra Energy and Northern California's Pacific Gas and Electric must auction the free allowances they get and return the proceeds to customers, in the form of rebates for price increases stemming from the new rules or possibly as subsidies for energy-efficiency programs.
At the outset, most businesses will be given free allowances that cover roughly 90 percent of their emissions. But industries, like cement production, that are most likely to pull out of California and set up shop elsewhere as a result of the rules will be given 100 percent of allowances free. The state will create a reserve fund of allowances that can be distributed at a pre-set price to counteract sudden market spikes in the cost of these permits.
In the program's next three years, distributors of transportation fuels will be included but will get no free allowances. The number of annual allowances in the program will also more than double. Thereafter, until 2020, the number of allowances will decline by 3 percent annually.
The California program allows regulated industries to offset up to 8 percent of their own emissions by investing in programs like forestry management and agricultural manure management that reduce carbon emissions elsewhere.
By the time the program takes effect in 2012, California regulators plan to have created a framework for carbon trading with New Mexico, British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec -- some of its partners in the Western Climate Initiative.
Among the industries immediately affected by the rules will be producers of cement, an industrial process in which the release of carbon dioxide is an integral part. Steve Regis, vice president of CalPortland, said in an interview, ''We feel like we're really exposed because 60 percent of our direct emissions are from the process -- nothing we can do about them.''
The re-engineering of that process, he said, would entail major costs, if it is even possible. He added that some California plants had recently shut down and moved their production out of state.
Fred Krupp, the president of the Environmental Defense Fund and a longtime advocate of cap-and-trade policies to combat global warming, called the California program ''a very smartly designed policy mechanism that gets away from micromanaging the economy and instead leaves folks free to choose the best way to meet the requirement of lowering emissions.''
He added, ''Having California open its market in 2012 will be a huge signal to the rest of the country.''
But critics said it made no sense for California to institute a cap-and-trade system on its own.
''Californians maybe have too high an impression of themselves and how important they are,'' said David W. Kreutzer, an energy economist at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research organization in Washington. ''To me it just doesn't make sense to go it alone.''

HEADLINE: Politics at Two Levels In Fight With the E.P.A.

BYLINE: By KATE GALBRAITH. 
kgalbraith@texastribune.org

 BODY:
Every politician needs a villain. George W. Bush had Saddam Hussein; Barack Obama had George W. Bush. Gov. Rick Perry has the Environmental Protection Agency, which has had the audacity to order Texas to do more to keep its air clean.
The Obama administration's E.P.A. has aggressively crossed swords with Texas air-quality regulators -- especially since Al Armendariz, a hard-charging academic, took over the agency's south-central regional office a year ago. The E.P.A. has insisted that the state's air-pollution permitting system for big plants is too lax. It has told Texas and every other state to prepare for regulation of heat-trapping gases, a hated concept in these parts, where skepticism of global climate change as a man-made phenomenon runs deep. 
Last week, the E.P.A. took a swipe at the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates the oil and natural gas industry. The commission had failed to act to protect two homes in Parker County where the water wells have been contaminated by gas drilling, the agency said. So it stepped in over the commission and ordered the gas company (which claims no responsibility) to fix things.
Conservatives' political reaction to all of the above has been outrage.
The move is ''nothing more than grandstanding in an effort to interject the federal government into Texas business,'' said Michael L. Williams, a railroad commissioner, in a swiftly issued statement. Elizabeth Ames Jones, another commissioner, denounced the E.P.A.'s ''false claims'' against the Railroad Commission. The actions were ''premature,'' Ms. Jones said. The commission (which began looking into the residents' complaint in August) is still investigating.
For the governor, this is top-notch political theater. It is right where Mr. Perry -- a possible presidential candidate, although he insists he is not -- has positioned himself in recent years. As Mr. Perry writes in ''Fed Up!'', his new book, ''Our dispute with the EPA in particular illustrates how Washington's command-and-control environmental bureaucracy is destroying federalism and individuals' ability to make their own economic decisions.''
Besides talking tough about states' rights, Mr. Perry's administration has also sued the federal government. Attorney General Greg Abbott has filed two lawsuits challenging the E.P.A.'s permitting moves. In the coming legislative session, riled lawmakers may take up E.P.A.-related bills. Texas is also the only state actively refusing to carry out E.P.A. rules against heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide that begin taking effect in January. It has also sued to try to stop the rules.
Environmentalists in Texas, of course, applaud the E.P.A. The agency, they say, was weakened during Mr. Bush's presidency but has gotten its legs back under Mr. Armendariz, a Texas native on leave from his engineering professorship at Southern Methodist University. Before his appointment, Mr. Armendariz appeared in the muckraking film ''Gasland,'' about natural gas drilling, to criticize the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, the state's main pollution regulator, as being too slack.
Mr. Perry's chief argument is that Texas functions perfectly well without an extra blast of federal rules. Its air, for example, is improving. The governor cites a 22 percent reduction in ozone and a 46 percent drop in nitrogen oxide emissions over the past decade. Environmentalists say, however, that it is precisely because of stricter federal rules -- those that Texas does follow -- that air quality is getting better.
Expect more fireworks next year as the back-and-forth plays out. An interesting question will be how the state's muscular stance against tighter federal environmental regulations reverberates on the national stage, if Mr. Perry runs.
For now, it is hard to say. Being pro-business (or, better, ''pro-jobs'') plays well, especially in tough economic times. On the other hand, clean air and clean water are critical issues in plenty of swing states. Natural gas drilling in particular has stirred revolt in places like Colorado and Pennsylvania. The Railroad Commission's vitriolic intransigence could hurt Mr. Perry there.
Regardless, the show will go on because it must. The E.P.A., with its pollution crackdown, has stepped into Mr. Perry's gun sights. It provides a convenient focal point for his broader complaint against the federal government, which he says is too intrusive and should leave the states alone.

HEADLINE: Obama's Remarks on the Strategy in Afghanistan

 BODY:
Following is a text of President Obama's remarks on Thursday on his administration's report on the war in Afghanistan, as released by the White House:
Good morning, everybody. When I announced our new strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan last December, I directed my national security team to regularly assess our efforts and to review our progress after one year. That's what we've done consistently over the course of the past 12 months --- in weekly updates from the field, in monthly meetings with my national security team, and in my frequent consultations with our Afghan, Pakistani and coalition partners. And that's what we've done as part of our annual review, which is now complete.
I want to thank Secretary Clinton and Secretary Gates for their leadership. Since Joint Chief of Staff Chairman, Admiral Mullen, is in Afghanistan, I'm pleased that we're joined by Vice Chairman, General Cartwright.
Our efforts also reflect the dedication of Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, whose memory we honor and whose work we'll continue. Indeed, the tributes to Richard that have poured in from around the globe speak to both the enormous impact of his life and to the broad international commitment to our shared efforts in this critical region. 
I have spoken with President Karzai of Afghanistan as well as President Zardari of Pakistan and discussed our findings and the way forward together. Today, I want to update the American people on our review --- our assessment of where we stand and areas where we need to do better. I want to be clear. This continues to be a very difficult endeavor. But I can report that thanks to the extraordinary service of our troops and civilians on the ground, we are on track to achieve our goals.
It's important to remember why we remain in Afghanistan. It was Afghanistan where al Qaeda plotted the 9/11 attacks that murdered 3,000 innocent people. It is the tribal regions along the Afghan-Pakistan border from which terrorists have launched more attacks against our homeland and our allies. And if an even wider insurgency were to engulf Afghanistan, that would give al Qaeda even more space to plan these attacks.
And that's why, from the start, I've been very clear about our core goal. It's not to defeat every last threat to the security of Afghanistan, because, ultimately, it is Afghans who must secure their country. And it's not nation-building, because it is Afghans who must build their nation. Rather, we are focused on disrupting, dismantling and defeating al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and preventing its capacity to threaten America and our allies in the future.
In pursuit of our core goal we are seeing significant progress. Today, al Qaeda's senior leadership in the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan is under more pressure than at any point since they fled Afghanistan nine years ago. Senior leaders have been killed. It's harder for them to recruit; it's harder for them to travel; it's harder for them to train; it's harder for them to plot and launch attacks. In short, al Qaeda is hunkered down. It will take time to ultimately defeat al Qaeda, and it remains a ruthless and resilient enemy bent on attacking our country. But make no mistake -- we are going to remain relentless in disrupting and dismantling that terrorist organization.
In Afghanistan, we remain focused on the three areas of our strategy: our military effort to break the Taliban's momentum and train Afghan forces so they can take the lead; our civilian effort to promote effective governance and development; and regional cooperation, especially with Pakistan, because our strategy has to succeed on both sides of the border.
Indeed, for the first time in years, we've put in place the strategy and the resources that our efforts in Afghanistan demand. And because we've ended our combat mission in Iraq, and brought home nearly 100,000 of our troops from Iraq, we're in a better position to give our forces in Afghanistan the support and equipment they need to achieve their missions. And our drawdown in Iraq also means that today there are tens of thousands fewer Americans deployed in harm's way than when I took office.
With those additional forces in Afghanistan, we are making considerable gains toward our military objectives. The additional military and civilian personnel that I ordered in Afghanistan are now in place, along with additional forces from our coalition, which has grown to 49 nations. Along with our Afghan partners, we've gone on the offensive, targeting the Taliban and its leaders and pushing them out of their strongholds.
As I said when I visited our troops in Afghanistan earlier this month, progress comes slowly and at a very high price in the lives of our men and women in uniform. In many places, the gains we've made are still fragile and reversible. But there is no question we are clearing more areas from Taliban control and more Afghans are reclaiming their communities.
To ensure Afghans can take responsibility, we continue to focus on training. Targets for the growth of Afghan security forces are being met. And because of the contributions of additional trainers from our coalition partners, I'm confident we will continue to meet our goals.
I would add that much of this progress --- the speed with which our troops deployed this year, the increase in recruits -- in recruiting and training of Afghan forces, and the additional troops and trainers from other nations --- much of this is the result of us having sent a clear signal that we will begin the transition of responsibility to Afghans and start reducing American forces next July.
This sense of urgency also helped galvanize the coalition around the goals that we agreed to at the recent NATO summit in Lisbon --- that we are moving toward a new phase in Afghanistan, a transition to full Afghan lead for security that will begin early next year and will conclude in 2014, even as NATO maintains a long-term commitment to training and advising Afghan forces. Now, our review confirms, however, that for these security gains to be sustained over time, there is an urgent need for political and economic progress in Afghanistan.
Over the past year, we've dramatically increased our civilian presence, with more diplomats and development experts working alongside our troops, risking their lives and partnering with Afghans. Going forward, there must be a continued focus on the delivery of basic services, as well as transparency and accountability. We will also fully support an Afghan political process that includes reconciliation with those Taliban who break ties with al Qaeda, renounce violence and accept the Afghan constitution. And we will forge a new strategic partnership with Afghanistan next year, so that we make it clear that the United States is committed to the long-term security and development of the Afghan people.
Finally, we will continue to focus on our relationship with Pakistan. Increasingly, the Pakistani government recognizes that terrorist networks in its border regions are a threat to all our countries, especially Pakistan. We've welcomed major Pakistani offensives in the tribal regions. We will continue to help strengthen Pakistanis' capacity to root out terrorists. Nevertheless, progress has not come fast enough. So we will continue to insist to Pakistani leaders that terrorist safe havens within their borders must be dealt with.
At the same time, we need to support the economic and political development that is critical to Pakistan's future. As part of our strategic dialogue with Pakistan, we will work to deepen trust and cooperation. We'll speed up our investment in civilian institutions and projects that improve the lives of Pakistanis. We'll intensify our efforts to encourage closer cooperation between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
And, next year, I look forward to an exchange of visits, including my visit to Pakistan, because the United States is committed to an enduring partnership that helps deliver improved security, development, and justice for the Pakistani people.
Again, none of these challenges that I've outlined will be easy. There are more difficult days ahead. But as a nation, we can draw strength from the service of our fellow Americans.
On my recent visit to Afghanistan, I visited a medical unit and pinned Purple Hearts on some of our wounded warriors. I met with a platoon that had just lost six of their teammates. Despite the tough fight, despite all their sacrifice, they continue to stand up for our security and for our values that we hold so dear.
We're going to have to continue to stand up. We'll continue to give our brave troops and civilians the strategy and resources they need to succeed. We will never waver from our goal of disrupting, dismantling, and ultimately defeating al Qaeda. We will forge enduring partnerships with people who are committed to progress and to peace. And we will continue to do everything in our power to ensure the security and the safety of the American people.
So, with that, Vice President Biden and myself will depart, and I'm going to turn it over to Secretaries Clinton, Gates, as well as Vice Chairman Cartwright, and they will be able to answer your questions and give you a more detailed briefing.
Thank you very much.

HEADLINE: Cuomo's Inauguration Is Expected to Be a Low-Key Affair

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
There will be no serenades, no crowds and few other elected officials.
The Jan. 1 inauguration of Andrew M. Cuomo as New York's 56th governor will be a muted affair, the governor-elect said on Thursday, in tune with the economic uncertainty wracking New Yorkers, their unease about state government and Mr. Cuomo's own preference for a more private occasion.
Instead of addressing a throng of New Yorkers from the steps of the Capitol, as Eliot Spitzer did four years ago, Mr. Cuomo will address a smaller gathering inside, in a chamber near the governor's office known as the War Room for its murals depicting New York's participation in military conflicts through the years. (The choice of room was not intended to carry any symbolism, aides said, but was merely the right size for the event.) 
About 200 guests will be invited, aides said, most of them close friends and members of Mr. Cuomo's large extended family, as well as his lieutenant governor, Robert J. Duffy. Mr. Cuomo's father, former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, will be there. Mr. Cuomo's transition team said that the guest list had not been completed and could not say whether Gov. David A. Paterson or his predecessor, Mr. Spitzer, would attend.
Eric T. Schneiderman, the attorney general-elect, and Thomas P. DiNapoli, the comptroller, who was re-elected in November, will also be sworn in at the ceremony.
''This is not a time for the grand and expensive celebrations of the recent past,'' Mr. Cuomo said in a news release, ''it is the time to return dignity, integrity, and performance to state government and begin making real progress for the people of this great state.''
As is tradition, Mr. Cuomo's formal swearing-in will occur on Jan. 1, just after midnight, the moment when his four-year term in office technically begins, in a small ceremony at the Executive Mansion in Albany.
Later on New Year's Day, Mr. Cuomo will greet members of the public at the Executive Mansion, as Mr. Spitzer did four years ago.
Otherwise, however, the toned-down celebration will mark a departure from the so-called People's Inaugural thrown four years ago by Mr. Spitzer, featuring a series of receptions open to the public, a who's who of prominent elected officials, and his lofty promise on the steps of the Capitol that ''Day 1 of our time for change has arrived.''
Mr. Spitzer's inaugural was meant to break with the pomp and excess associated with the first inaugural of the previous governor, George E. Pataki, a three-day festival of food and celebration for thousands of supporters, paid for with money raised by a private corporation founded for that sole purpose and featuring a black-tie gala. The extravaganza ultimately provided the Pataki administration with its first touch of scandal after the new governor broke a promise to reveal the names of donors who had underwritten the events.
The difference with Mr. Spitzer may be more strategic: Mr. Cuomo has sought to lower expectations for his early months in office, which are likely to be marked by grueling battles with the Legislature that may or may not yield the kind of quick victories Mr. Spitzer envisioned when he took office.
Mr. Schneiderman and Mr. DiNapoli will also hold separate ceremonies later in the month. Jan. 1 falls on a Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath. A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo said that the governor-elect had consulted with Jewish religious leaders and with Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker and an observant Orthodox Jew. None had raised any objection to Mr. Cuomo's holding his event on the traditional day.

HEADLINE: In Marketing of a New Mortgage Fund, Pimco Lists Former Bush Officials

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When Pimco, the huge bond manager, approached investors recently to raise money for a new fund that would buy soured mortgage securities from ailing banks, it promoted its expertise by listing several former top Bush administration officials and Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman.
In a confidential presentation to investors, Pimco listed as either consultants or employees an all-star constellation of former federal officials, including Mr. Greenspan; Joshua B. Bolten, who was White House chief of staff under George W. Bush; and Neel T. Kashkari, who ran the Wall Street bailout program for the Treasury department. 
Those former officials, as well as others hired by Pimco, helped set national economic policy during the run-up to the financial crisis of 2008, which was prompted by the collapse of the housing market.
Now investment firms like Pimco are looking to profit by buying distressed mortgage debt from banks, which are under pressure to raise cash and hold more capital.
While Pimco did not create shoddy mortgages or contribute to the crisis, its presentation to investors, which was prepared in October, suggests that former senior officials are now poised to help investors benefit from the disastrous financial developments that occurred while they held power in Washington.
The presentation, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, also reflects Washington's revolving door where officials leave government to pursue lucrative opportunities working with industries they once dealt with while in public office.
''This highlights the all-too-close relationships between our largest financial institutions and the people who acted as their regulators,'' said Joshua Rosner, managing director of Graham Fisher & Company, which advises institutional investors, after the presentation was described to him. ''The 'too big to fail' concept is not just about assets. It's also about relationships.''
Mr. Greenspan, who led the Fed for 18 years until his retirement in January 2006, has been criticized for not using the central bank's regulatory powers to crack down on subprime mortgage lending. He has been a paid adviser to Pimco since May 2007.
Reached at his consulting firm, Mr. Greenspan expressed surprise on learning that he was listed as a ''special consultant to Pimco'' in a marketing presentation.
''Pimco has never asked me to assist in the marketing of any of their products, and I never have,'' he said. ''I am a consultant to them on global economic and financial issues.''
Another special consultant was Mr. Bolten, a former Goldman Sachs executive who worked in the White House for the eight years of the Bush administration.
As the chief of staff from 2006 to 2009, Mr. Bolten was intimately involved in economic policy. He helped lure Henry M. Paulson Jr., a fellow alumnus of Goldman Sachs, to serve as Treasury secretary, and was Mr. Paulson's main liaison to the White House in 2008, when the Treasury worked frantically with the Fed to avert a collapse of the capital markets.
Mr. Bolten, who is now a visiting professor in the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University, did not respond to phone calls and e-mails requesting comment.
The presentation also names two other Bush administration officials who are now executives at Pimco.
One is Mr. Kashkari, who was the assistant Treasury secretary charged with managing the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which Congress set up to rescue the financial services industry. The other is Richard H. Clarida, who was the top economist at the Treasury in 2002 and 2003. He is now an executive vice president at Pimco's New York office, as well as a professor of economics at Columbia University. Neither responded to requests for comment.
Officials at Pimco, which is based in Newport Beach, Calif., and is a subsidiary of the German insurer Allianz, declined to comment, saying their lawyers believed that rules set by the Securities and Exchange Commission prohibited them from discussing the investment offering.
Harold P. Reichwald, a banking and finance lawyer at Manatt, Phelps & Phillips in Los Angeles, who does not have a relationship with Pimco, said the use of policy experts was not surprising for the kind of investment Pimco was offering.
''It's not surprising that an issuer would surround itself with people with expertise in the field,'' he said. ''I think good practice would dictate that if you're going to name individuals in a prospectus, which is essentially a selling document, that you would clear it with them in advance.''
While some large Wall Street banks have been thriving in recent months after getting a lifeline from the government, other financial institutions, including smaller banks, have been teetering.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has seized and closed nearly 300 banks in the last two years. And some big banks are trying to get out of the business of servicing residential mortgages, an expensive and time-consuming task to which banks that focus on originating loans are not well-suited.
The presentation estimates that banks in the United States and Europe need to raise more than $550 billion in capital, partly because of pressure from regulators to strengthen their balance sheets, and partly in anticipation of new international bank capital standards known as Basel III.
In essence, the Pimco fund -- known as Bravo, short for Bank Recapitalization and Value Opportunities -- intends to buy a wide variety of distressed assets, including pools of nonperforming loans bundled into securities, at a discount, among other strategies. Pimco is believed to be trying to raise hundreds of millions of dollars for the fund.
Over the five-year life of the fund, it hopes to overhaul the servicing of the loans so that they generate a healthy cash flow. Then Pimco hopes to sell the assets, or the underlying real estate, for a profit.
The once high-flying market for mortgage-backed securities has been moribund since 2007, but the presentation states: ''Within the five-year term fund, Pimco believes is it reasonable to expect a securitized market will be functioning again, albeit smaller.''
The minimum investment is $500,000. The fund is a private placement, meaning it is aimed at sophisticated investors, like pension funds and other institutions, rather than ordinary investors.

HEADLINE: 'Things Are Coming Together'

 BODY:
Brenda Vigna is generous, even when there is not much to give. A single mother of four living in a trailer park, she adopted her daughter's pregnant classmate out of foster care in 2008. 
Ms. Vigna has always drawn strength from her family and worked hard to support them. Before the recession, she made enough to get by as a hairdresser, balancing work with care of her sick mother and son. The last two years have been hard, but she has never lost her drive: earning her G.E.D. and working as a part-time nursing aide. Her children have stocked shelves at a grocery store and bottled and sold their family marinara sauce to local pizzerias.
In spite of all that, in September, Ms. Vigna was unable to pay rent on her trailer's lot, and her family was facing eviction. The Catholic Charities of New York, one of seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, provided critical help, drawing $574 from the fund to subsidize one month's rent.
Since then, Ms. Vigna has continued hunting for full-time work, picking up part-time shifts, and keeping optimistic. ''It's been a long, dark hallway, but things are coming together,'' she said.
All donations made to The Times Neediest Cases Fund go to one of seven charities: The Children's Aid Society; Brooklyn Community Services; The Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York; Catholic Charities, Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens; The Community Service Society of New York; The Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies; and UJA-Federation of New York.
To help, please send a check to: The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, 4 Chase Metrotech Center, 7th Floor East, Lockbox 5193, Brooklyn, N.Y. 11245. You may also call (800) 381-0075 and use a credit card, or you may donate at: www.nycharities.org/neediest.

HEADLINE: Turn In Your Bin Ladens

BYLINE: By JONATHAN LIPOW. 
Jonathan Lipow is an associate professor of economics at the Defense Resource Management Institute at the Naval Postgraduate School.

 BODY:
THE 500-euro note is sometimes called the ''Bin Laden'' -- after all, Europeans may never see the 500 euro, but they know it is out there somewhere. Unfortunately, Al Qaeda's leader and the 500-euro bill are connected in another way: high-denomination bills make it a lot easier for terrorists to operate.
Organized crime has always been a cash industry. In 1969, the Treasury stopped issuing $500, $1,000, $5,000 and $10,000 bills specifically to impede crime syndicates -- the only entities that were still using such large bills after the introduction of electronic money transfers. 
Nowadays, terrorist networks have become important users of cash. No organization understands this better than the United States military. During the early years of coalition operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, American forces distributed cash liberally. From 2003 and 2008, about $19 billion in physical money was handed out to Iraqi suppliers and contractors.
But the military has gradually realized that the anonymity of cash makes it easy for terrorists and insurgents to smuggle in money and make purchases without a trace. That's why for the past few years the military has been striving to replace its cash transactions with electronic fund transfers and debit card payments in the hopes of achieving a ''cashless battlefield,'' in the words of Peter Kunkel, a former assistant secretary of the Army.
Of course, in an era of global terrorism and international crime syndicates, the whole world is a battlefield. Raids on drug traffickers in Mexico often turn up tens of millions of dollars in cash. One raid netted over $200 million, mostly in $100 bills. So, why not eliminate the use of physical cash worldwide -- not just a ''cashless battlefield'' but a ''cashless economy''?
From a technical point of view, such an initiative is entirely feasible. The trick is to lower the cost of making transactions to the point where even the smallest payments can be executed efficiently. For example, a Twitter application known as TwitPay allows you to use your cellphone and a PayPal account to transfer money. In Kenya, a mobile banking system known as M-Pesa allows six million people to execute small payments using SMS messages.
Unfortunately, cellular-based systems are unsuitable as a complete replacement for physical money, particularly in the developing world. Cellphone coverage doesn't yet extend to many rural regions or small urban centers; in addition, such systems remain too vulnerable to cybercrime and power grid or mobile service disruptions.
A better approach would be to use smart cards with biometric security features, like the Universal Electronic Payments System. In South Africa, the technology company Net1 now distributes social welfare grants to almost four million people. It's simple: with a battery-operated, point-of-sale device akin to a credit-card terminal, money is transferred from one person's card to another; during the process, the cards download and record each other's transaction records.
Every few days, employees from the payments system head out to the villages and make their own money transfers, downloading the transaction histories of the cards they come into contact with, which contain the histories of the cards they interacted with, and so on. That data is then downloaded into the company's mainframe, as a way of monitoring the flow of funds across the cards.
Best of all, the system can function offline and off the power grid, providing a secure means of payment under all conditions and without any geographic limitations. And the incremental cost of executing a transaction via this system is essentially zero. It is a promising model for the global economy.
In a cashless economy, insurgents' and terrorists' electronic payments would generate audit trails that could be screened by data mining software; every payment and transfer would yield a treasure trove of information about their agents, their locations and their intentions. This would pose similar challenges for criminals.
To help move to a global cashless economy, the Obama administration should push for an international agreement to eliminate the largest-denomination bills. Additionally, the United States Agency for International Development could make the promotion of electronic payments systems in developing countries one of its strategic objectives, much as the American military has done in Iraq and Afghanistan.
''Money's destiny is to become digital,'' announced a 2002 study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. In terms of public safety and national security, the sooner the world moves to a digital cashless economy, the better.

HEADLINE: Estate Tax Will Return Next Year, but Few Will Pay It

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
Almost no one will have to worry about paying the estate tax under the tax legislation just approved by Congress. By one estimate, from Alan Rothschild, the chairman of the American Bar Association's real property, trust and estate law section, less than one-half of 1 percent of people who die in 2011 will be hit by the estate tax. In contrast, 10.5 percent paid the estate tax in 1977.
And even for the very few who will be subject to the tax, the increase in the gift tax exemption will allow them to give their heirs tens of millions of dollars before the estate tax even comes into play. ''I think people will be seizing the opportunity for next year,'' said Carol Kroch, head of wealth and financial planning at Wilmington Trust.
The only caveat for the wealthy is that the tax compromise reached by Republican leaders and President Obama is set to expire in two years and revert to much lower exemption levels and a higher tax rate. 
''It seems like to me we're just setting ourselves up to repeat 2009 and 2010 all over again,'' Mr. Rothschild said. ''That's the most frustrating part to me.''
Still, it has been something of a roller coaster of a year for the estate tax, which expiredat the end of 2009 and, despite predictions, was never reinstated in 2010. So billionaires like Dan L. Duncan and George Steinbrenner died, and their wealth was not subject to an estate tax. And the not-so-wealthy fretted that the tax was going to hit more modest estates next year.
But that does not mean that wealthy people should ignore a host of short-term issues. Here are a few of the most important.
OPTIONS FOR 2010 Under the estate tax wording in the bill, the heirs of people who died this year will have two options for a tax bill. If they chose to treat the estate by the tax laws in place in 2010, they will have to calculate the capital gains on all assets in the estate to determine if the value is above a level the Internal Revenue Service is allowing. This ''artificial step-up in basis'' is $1.3 million to any heir and $3 million to a surviving spouse.
The other option is to apply the 2011 law, which would exempt the first $5 million of the estate and impose a rate of 35 percent on anything above that. This is far more generous than the 2009 law -- a $3.5 million exemption and a 45 percent tax rate -- which many people thought would be reinstated.
Ed Koren, a lawyer at Holland & Knight who represented Mr. Steinbrenner until his death in July, said that for estates larger than $10 million, it makes sense to calculate the capital gains since the tax rate is only 15 percent.
The estates that benefit the most from applying the 2011 law retroactively are those that would not have been subject to the estate tax under the 2009 regime but could have been forced to pay capital gains taxes this year.
Applying the 2011 law to estates in 2010 is also a gift to an individual estate that is worth more than $3.5 million but less than $5 million. That $1.5 million would have been taxed last year.
WHY PLAN NOW? Proper planning can do much more than minimize taxes. It can help you control what happens to your assets.
Mr. Koren declined to comment on the specifics of Mr. Steinbrenner's estate, but he said the family was never at risk of losing control of the New York Yankees to pay a tax bill. ''I can assuredly say that the Yankees wouldn't have been on the block this year if there was an estate tax,'' he said.
The reason was years of diligent planning. ''It has to be an aggressive and ongoing approach,'' he said. ''I represented George for 22 years.''
Yet without the specter of an estate tax, lawyers and accountants worry that people will not plan at all. They will leave what is known in the industry as ''I Love You'' wills, giving everything to the surviving spouse.
In taking this path, though, the wealthy lose control of how their estates will be distributed. ''Estate attorneys have hidden behind the estate tax to discuss leaving assets in trust to spouses,'' Mr. Rothschild said. ''There are other less pleasant reasons to leave assets in trust, such as remarriage and competency.''
GIFT BONANZA Much is being made of how low the estate tax rate is above the $5 million exemption. Dan Kesten, a lawyer at Davis & Gilbert in New York, pointed out that a $100 million estate would pay $20 million less in taxes in 2011 than it would have if Congress had not acted and the estate tax had reverted to its 2001 level -- a 55 percent tax rate for individual estates larger than $1 million.
But the problem is the law is set to revert to that 2001 level in 2013 if nothing is done to make the current numbers permanent.
The real benefit to the extremely rich is the increase in the gift tax exemption to $5 million from $1 million. To a couple who have given money away to the limit of the old exemption, this means they can pass an extra $8 million to their heirs free of tax.
''That's changing an awful lot of plans,'' said Kacy Gott, chief planning officer at Aspiriant, a wealth management firm. ''Now, with a two-year window, we're expecting a lot of gifts.''
But most very wealthy people would never write a check outright for $8 million when they could give assets to their heirs through complicated structures that can multiply the size of their gifts.
Lance Hall, president of FMV Opinions, which provides business valuation services, said he expected his business to boom for the next two years. For one, his firm determines the discount applied to shares in a privately held business. (This happens because such shares are presumed to be harder to sell than marketable securities.) And two, the values of those businesses themselves are still lower than they were before the recession.
If a couple were to give their heirs an $8 million stake in a company that had lost 30 percent in value and was discounted a further 35 percent because it was family-owned, the transfer could be worth two or three times the $8 million.
The other advantage comes from using sophisticated trusts that pass money on to heirs.
Setting up one of these vehicles, a grantor-retained annuity trust, for the two-year minimum has become an even more effective way to move tens of millions of dollars out of an estate tax-free. The reason is that the trusts are structured to use very little of the gift tax exemption.
Jere Doyle, wealth strategist at the Bank of New York Mellon, said he could envision using another strategy, called a sale to an intentionally defective grantor trust, to turn that $5 million gift tax exemption into a $50 million transfer tax-free.
He concedes, though, that it is going to be tougher to get people to think about these trusts, however beneficial they are to their heirs. ''The problem is you can't scare them into your office anymore by saying you've got a big tax you're going to pay,'' he said. ''You've got to come up with a different way to get them in.''

Harrison Ford, above left with Mr. Fraser, is Robert Stonehill, a University of Nebraska professor who just might have the answer to John's prayers. Soon the men have founded a drug company in the middle of the prairie. Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott said: ''The evolution of their business plan, along with the pursuit of the treatment that will save Megan and Patrick, is what holds 'Extraordinary Measures' together. This is not to say that the movie is a bloodless scientific procedural.'' Instead, he added, ''the film resists the temptation to turn into a full-blown family melodrama.''

While Ms. Aniston ''can fall back on her easy, nicely worn charm, Mr. Butler has only the opposite of charm to work with,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. ''His charisma is aggressively negative: a petulant, sneering, bullying disregard for other people (and for his own hygiene) that is meant, I guess, to represent a kind of rough-hewn, politically incorrect masculine honesty.'' Mr. Scott pondered, ''Do women go for this kind of thing?''

HEADLINE: Introduced By Video And Hired In N.F.L.

BYLINE: By ALAN SCHWARZ

 BODY:
Mike Tomlin and Rex Ryan surveyed the competition and ran their most instinctual plays.
Not from the sideline, where the two coaches will meet Sunday afternoon as Tomlin's Steelers face Ryan's Jets in a true attraction of opposites: Pittsburgh, winner of four straight games, and the Jets, losers of two straight. These particular stratagems are captured only in a tiny video drawer at N.F.L. headquarters in New York, where old tapes capture a younger Tomlin and Ryan vying for their first head coaching jobs.
''What is perceived to be tedious about football, from a playing standpoint and even from a coaching standpoint, I happen to enjoy,'' Tomlin tells a faceless interviewer, so stoic and steady that not one part of his body moves for minutes at a time. Tomlin, who was the defensive coordinator of the Minnesota Vikings, cites every coach's lineage, any team record, each personal motivation. ''I always wanted to be an architect,'' he explains.
Ryan lets it all hang out like his belly after Thanksgiving. 
''My younger son is a lot like me, except he's built like my wife,'' he jokes about his football family. How were his days at Southwestern Oklahoma State? ''Just turn a hair dryer on high, blow it in your face, and that's where I was going to school.'' It all flowed from his first words of the interview, after a voice thanked him for coming in: ''Ah, shoot,'' says Ryan, then the defensive coordinator of the Baltimore Ravens. ''My pleasure.''
Since 1998, the N.F.L. has encouraged every aspiring head coach and front-office executive to sit for what might as well be a dating service video: answering questions about passions, approaches, likes and dislikes.
The videos serve as snapshot histories of future leaders -- Tomlin, Ryan, the San Francisco 49ers' Mike Singletary, the Miami Dolphins' Tony Sparano and more -- in delightfully vulnerable moments. Tomlin, for example, is not sure whether to be proud or embarrassed about making the World Geography Olympiad team in high school.
The video program has helped distance the N.F.L. from its disastrous record in hiring black head coaches before 2003, when the Rooney Rule -- named after the Steelers chairman Dan Rooney, a key supporter -- began requiring teams to interview one minority during coaching searches.
In the decade before the Rooney Rule went into effect, the league had only two or three black head coaches each year; after the rule was adopted, it soon jumped to five and then seven, its current total. (Among them are Tomlin and Singletary.)
But mere totals do not prove the efficacy of the rule, according to a recent study in The Journal of Sports Economics. The analysis, conducted by Janice Madden and Matthew Ruther at the University of Pennsylvania, demonstrates that black head coaches from 1990 through 2002 had significantly better records (9.1 wins per year with 69 percent reaching the playoffs) than their white counterparts (8.0 wins per year and 39 percent reaching the playoffs). This, the authors argue, shows that only the best black coaching candidates were hired by teams during that period -- and that the only relatively ineffective coaches who were hired were white. That pattern has essentially disappeared, indicating a more level playing field.
''When a black coach does badly, I think, what a pleasant sign this is -- it didn't used to happen before,'' said Madden, no relation to the former N.F.L. coach John Madden. ''If whites are the only ones that fail, then blacks are held to a higher standard.''
Ray Anderson, who oversees the video program as the N.F.L.'s executive vice president for football operations, said that even though the program preceded the Rooney Rule, it had been crucial in allowing teams to encounter and then legitimately consider applicants it might not have looked at before -- something the Rooney Rule attempted to fix.
Anderson said that more than 120 coaching hopefuls of all races had sat for video chats, and the program had expanded to include 50 front-office candidates, too. Filmed during the off-season combine in Indianapolis, the videos last about 45 minutes and become available to any team that requests one.
A longtime agent who represented several coaches, Anderson said that if the video program existed 20 years ago, black clients like Tony Dungy would have been able to correct misconceptions that had fostered doubts, conscious or not, about their candidacies.
''One of the stories when things appeared to bog down, before Tony finally got his break with the Buccaneers, was frankly that people didn't see him as personable or dynamic,'' Anderson said. ''A program like this would have been a benefit to a guy like Tony.''
Having retired from coaching to become an analyst for NBC, Dungy himself has cited how the N.F.L.'s hiring progress over the past decade only highlights a far worse situation that still exists in college football. This season, only five head coaches in the Bowl Championship Series conferences were African-American, according to Richard Lapchick, director of the University of Central Florida's Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport.
Dungy has said that he recommended Tomlin, then with the Vikings, for an open college job several years ago, and Tomlin did not even get an interview. A month later the Steelers hired him -- and soon won the Super Bowl.
There was no false advertising in the video that the Steelers consulted before hiring Tomlin. He did have some fun noting that he served on the model United Nations and that geography team back in Newport News, Va. But he spent more time earnestly recounting how the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, where he had coached before Minnesota, disintegrated after their 2003 Super Bowl title.
''You've got to earn it on a day-to-day basis,'' Tomlin says in the video. ''We experienced some of the repercussions of maybe enjoying success a little too much. Maybe we could have handled success better as an organization, a football team. But we rolled our sleeves up and went back to work.''
And if the Jets listened carefully, they might have noticed Ryan's approach to controversy, which now is sticking to his team like burrs on alpaca. Why, he was asked, did Southwestern Oklahoma not go to the N.A.I.A. playoffs one year?
''Having an ineligible player in the N.A.I.A. is, like, unheard of, because I think you can play 10 years,'' Ryan said with a jolly bounce. ''But for some reason, we had one.''

HEADLINE: Christie Picks Klein Ally For New Jersey Schools

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
Gov. Chris Christie has selected as New Jersey's education commissioner a nationally known school administrator who drove some of New York City's most controversial education policies, a move that signals the governor's continued intent to upend the educational establishment and put his stamp on the state's schools.
In choosing Christopher D. Cerf as commissioner, Mr. Christie appears to have found a close ally in his efforts to remake a public school system that the governor has repeatedly said fails students, squanders taxpayer money and bows to demands from teachers' unions. 
Mr. Christie fired the previous commissioner, Bret D. Schundler, in August after the state lost $400 million in federal education aid in part because of a technical error.
Mr. Cerf, 56, declined to comment on the nomination in a phone interview on Friday, but he described himself as a ''very committed school reformer'' with a long interest in New Jersey's schools. He has served as an informal adviser to Mayor Cory A. Booker of Newark and is a board member of the KIPP charter schools in Newark.
''I believe that the achievement gap that separates economically disadvantaged children from their more advantaged peers is shameful,'' said Mr. Cerf, who lives in Montclair, N.J., ''and we should collectively take as direct, unapologetic and immediate approach as we can to address this challenge.''
In New York City's education department, where he was deputy schools chancellor from 2006 to 2009, he was seen as one of Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein's closest confidants and a stalwart advocate of Mr. Klein's most controversial education reforms: opening more charter schools; closing failing schools; using student test scores to evaluate and compensate teachers; and restricting some traditional benefits in teachers' contracts.
''The drive to make tenure more selective, to fire teachers more easily and to use merit and performance pay to compensate teachers all blossomed under him,'' said a former education official who would only speak on condition of anonymity. ''They were Joel Klein's ideas, but Chris oversaw their development.''
Mr. Cerf first came to national attention for his work in the late 1990s with the Edison Schools, now known as EdisonLearning, one of the world's largest for-profit operators of public schools. Mr. Schundler said that Mr. Cerf was a good choice because he had ''the same policy views'' as the governor and had the experience and skills to work with Republican and Democratic legislators in Trenton. Mr. Schundler said that he in fact had invited Mr. Cerf to become his deputy, but Mr. Cerf had declined. Mr. Cerf left the education department to work on Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's re-election campaign and is now chief executive officer of Sangari Global Education, which provides curriculum material to students worldwide.
Derrell Bradford, executive director of E3 (Excellent Education for Everyone), an advocacy group in Newark, who supports the choice of Mr. Cerf, said Mr. Christie ''made it pretty clear what the requirements are for state commissioner. You have to support school choice of all kinds; you have to understand the state cannot afford its schools; and you have to understand that we're at war with the status quo.''
School superintendents and teachers' union leaders said yesterday that they hoped to be able to work with Mr. Cerf.
''This governor has a very corporate approach to education,'' said Steve Wollmer, communications director for the New Jersey Education Association, the state's largest teachers' union. ''He openly talks about privatization, vouchers and more charters to audiences around the country, so we're not surprised he would name someone who has a connection to for-profit education.''
Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, who was president of New York City's teachers' union, said that while she did not always agree with Mr. Cerf's views on teacher accountability, they were able to reach agreements on, for instance, not releasing teacher data to the media.
''Clearly we came at issues from different perspectives, and he's no pushover,'' Ms. Weingarten said, ''but at the end of the day, you have to be willing to problem solve and work with teachers and their unions rather than engage in conflict, if your goal is student achievement.''
In New York City, Mr. Cerf also pushed for a tenure review process based on evidence of student learning rather than years of service, leading to an increase in tenure denial.
Mr. Cerf was questioned by the city's Conflicts of Interest Board in 2007 for asking for a contribution for a nonprofit organization from someone with ties to Edison while the company did business with the city. The investigation was closed without resulting in any action.
Mr. Cerf graduated from Amherst College in 1977 with a history degree and taught in a private high school in Cincinnati for four years.
A graduate of Columbia Law School, he was a clerk for Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. He met Mr. Klein in the 1980s when he joined his Washington law firm, Onek, Klein and Farr. He also worked in the White House counsel's office from 1993 to 1996.
His nomination, first reported in The Star-Ledger and The Wall Street Journal, has not been officially announced; the appointment must be confirmed by the State Senate. The job pays $141,000 annually.

HEADLINE: Economic Indicators Rose 1.1% In November

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
A gauge of future economic activity rose in November at the fastest pace since March, suggesting the economy will strengthen early next year. 
The Conference Board said its index of leading economic indicators rose 1.1 percent last month, the biggest increase since March, when the index jumped 1.4 percent.
The leading indicators rose 0.4 percent in October and 0.6 percent in November. The index has risen for five consecutive months.
A Deutsche Bank economist, Joseph LaVorgna, said the index's recent leap suggested that economic growth picked up significantly, to above 3 percent, in the October-to-December quarter and would continue to accelerate in the first three months of next year.
The economy grew at a rate of 2.5 percent from July through September.
Economists have said that the $858 billion tax deal passed by Congress this week will help the economy grow faster in 2011. Mark Zandi, an economic forecaster with Moody's Analytics, expects a 3.9 percent rate of growth in 2011, up from an earlier forecast of 2.8 percent.
The bill keeps in place tax cuts instituted by President George W. Bush for two more years. It also cuts Social Security taxes for workers and extends unemployment benefits for people who have long been out of a job.
The Conference Board, a private research group based in New York, measures data that has mostly already been released about real estate, manufacturing, employment, consumer confidence and financial markets.
Of the 10 measures the Conference Board uses to calculate the leading indicators, nine increased in November. Only sluggish building permits, a signal of future home construction, pulled down the measure.

HEADLINE: Protecting the Internet

 BODY:
The intensely competitive nature of the Internet is vital to the American economy and democracy. So we worry that rules proposed this month by Julius Genachowski, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, to guarantee the Internet's openness may not be able to guarantee the survival of that competition. 
Any new rules must prevent broadband service providers from foreclosing on competition. As proposed, the rules appear to come up short.
We supported an earlier attempt by the F.C.C. to classify access to broadband as a telecommunications service because it is the modern version of phone lines that carry our voices. This would have given the commission much more power to regulate broadband access than the current definition as an information service.
But an assault against this strategy led by the telephone and cable giants convinced the F.C.C. chairman to drop the reclassification and propose a more modest set of rules. It is important that the modest regulations be strengthened before the full commission votes on them on Tuesday.
The rules proposed so far have several weaknesses. For one thing, they forbid blocking Internet traffic or ''unreasonable'' discrimination against carrying some online content. But they do not ban the practice of paying to prioritize some Internet traffic over the rest.
Even more problematic is the treatment of the fast-growing new markets for mobile broadband access. While carriers will not be allowed to block Web sites or applications that compete with carriers' voice and video telephony, the proposal exempts wireless from the rule barring unreasonable discrimination on the grounds that wireless broadband is new and unsettled.
Absent a bar against anticompetitive discrimination, carriers could stop competing GPS or mapping applications from running on their networks. The rules might even allow carriers to block the application used by a company like Netflix to stream movies onto a mobile device to aid their own movie businesses.
Only consumers should be allowed to pay to get faster, prioritized services. If corporations could pay for faster carriage of their content nothing would stop them from divvying up the broadband capacity, condemning less well-financed sources to move at a snail's pace.
Fortunately, there is time to improve the proposal by Tuesday. It is virtually assured that the two Republican commissioners will vote against the rule. But the three Democratic commissioners should be able to close the gaps and protect open, competitive broadband.
Understanding that they can't foresee every eventuality, we suggest that they keep open a Plan B in case their new guidelines don't do the job: the F.C.C. should keep open its proceedings to redefine broadband as a telecom service. That's what it is.

HEADLINE: Explaining The Crisis With Dogma

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
What was that about?
I'm talking about that odd 13-page ''report'' issued on Wednesday by the four Republican members of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission. The F.C.I.C., of course, is the 10-member, supposedly bipartisan panel that was created by Congress last year and charged with examining the root causes of the financial crisis.
After a year and a half of hearings, including questioning over 800 witnesses, reviewing millions of pages of documents, and spending some $6 million in taxpayers' money, its final report is due to be delivered in a month.
Except that in Washington these days, there is no such thing as bipartisan. On every major issue facing the country, Democrats and Republicans have competing narratives. Why should anyone expect anything different when it comes to the origins of the financial crisis? 
Although commission members had long made a show of trying to work collaboratively, there was always a fair amount of underlying tension. Some of that tension had to do with the internal dynamics of the commission -- the general sense of chaos, for instance, and the supposedly autocratic style of its Democratic chairman, Phil Angelides.
But more recently, it has had to do with the growing tug of war between the commissioners over which financial crisis narrative would win out. The Republican minority, fearing their view would get short shrift, pre-emptively put forward a CliffsNotes version of their theory of the case. In other words, they responded to a report that hasn't even yet been written, much less read and voted on by the members.
Is there such a word as ''presponse?'' Perhaps we should coin it to describe what took place this week at the F.C.I.C.
It would all be pretty laughable if it didn't have serious consequences. But it does. First, with the commission's Republican members having now issued this public, partisan smoke signal, the final product, no matter how rigorous, will be inevitably dismissed as a Democratic document. As a result, it will have little impact and, once Bill O'Reilly has finished mocking it, will be consigned to the dustbin of history. By creating this partisan rift, the Republicans have succeeded in tarring the entire enterprise.
That is a genuine shame. When the commission was formed last year, there were high hopes that it could act as a modern-day Pecora investigation -- which rooted out Wall Street corruption in the wake of the crash of 1929, and helped create the political groundswell for such key reforms as the Glass-Steagall Act. That investigation was led by Ferdinand Pecora, who held the country spellbound through some two years of nonstop investigations. Clearly, this effort isn't going to come close to that one.
''I think we can officially stop comparing these guys to the Pecora Committee,'' said Michael Perino, author of an engaging recent book about Pecora, ''The Hellhound of Wall Street.'' Mr. Perino added, ''It is disparaging to Pecora.''
The second consequence is even more important. Next year, the House of Representatives will be in Republican hands. High on the agenda for the new majority is its own version of financial reform. The Republicans hope to minimize the impact of the Dodd-Frank bill while at the same attacking -- and fixing -- what they see as the ''true'' culprit of the financial crisis.
To fix a problem, though, it helps to know what the problem is. The F.C.I.C., with all those witnesses and documents, could have really helped here. But the paper released by the commission's Republicans this week reads as if they couldn't be bothered. It simply reiterates longstanding Republican dogma that could have been written without a $6 million investigation. None of which bodes particularly well for the next two years of ''financial reform.''
The problem the Republicans want to fix is the two government-sponsored entities, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Without question, Fannie and Freddie need fixing. A week before Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008, both entities were so troubled that they had to be taken over by the federal government. Since then, the G.S.E.'s, as they're called in Washington, have cost the taxpayer around $150 billion in losses, far more than, say, the American International Group.
They have also, though, served a critical purpose. With the private mortgage market essentially broken, virtually every mortgage made in America, postcrisis, has required a guarantee from Fannie, Freddie or the Federal Housing Administration. With the banks unwilling to make mortgage loans on their own, you simply cannot buy a house in America today without Fannie and Freddie's help.
The F.C.I.C. commissioner who has complained loudest about Fannie and Freddie is Peter Wallison, a former Reagan-era Treasury official who for the last two decades or so has been a fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. Long before it was popular to criticize Fannie and Freddie, they were Mr. Wallison's bugaboo. Back then, he was a lonely -- indeed a brave -- voice arguing that the enormous portfolios of mortgages of the G.S.E.'s -- combined with their quasi-governmental status -- created systemic risk.
He was right about this, though it's worth nothing that his precrisis prognosis of Fannie and Freddie's ills was wrong in a number of key ways. Like most Fannie and Freddie critics at the time, he believed the risk they posed was interest-rate risk, rather than credit risk, which is what actually brought the two companies low. He also argued that Fannie and Freddie were consistently ignoring their mission to help make affordable housing available to Americans.
As he wrote in 2004, ''Study after study have shown that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, despite full-throated claims about trillion-dollar commitments and the like, have failed to lead the private market in assisting the development and financing of affordable housing.''
After the crisis, his tune changed considerably -- as did that of many other Republicans, who tended to follow his intellectual lead on this issue. Now, he said, it was government policy aimed at increasing homeownership that essentially forced the private sector to make bad subprime loans.
And Fannie and Freddie, with their enormous power in the securitization market, were the government's vehicles in leading Wall Street and the other market participants down this garden path. ''Fannie and Freddie were in competition to reduce underwriting standards,'' Mr. Wallison told me when I spoke to him this week. This of course directly contradicts his criticism of six years ago, but never mind.
It is easy enough to understand why Mr. Wallison and his fellow Republicans would find this a comforting prism through which to view the financial crisis. If government housing policy is the chief culprit, it means that the market itself is off the hook. See, it was all the fault of wrong-headed government policy! Blaming it all on Fannie and Freddie also gives the Republicans a nice cudgel with which to beat Democrats, who for years defended the G.S.E.'s from even the most muted criticism.
The Republican document issued earlier this week did little more than regurgitate this theory of the case. ''Subsidizing mortgages through the G.S.E.'s was a particularly expedient way to increase the homeownership rate,'' they write at one point. At the same time, they tread lightly over the culpability of other nongovernmental culprits like the credit ratings agencies and Wall Street itself.
The only problem with Mr. Wallison's theory is that it's not, as they say, reality-based. Anyone who has looked at the role of Fannie and Freddie will discover they spent most of the housing bubble avoiding subprime loans, because those loans didn't meet their underwriting standards. (Indeed, for most of their existence, Fannie and Freddie didn't so much meet their affordable housing goals as gamed them.)
When Fannie and Freddie finally did get into the business, it was very late in the game. But the motivation wasn't pressure from the government; it was pressure from the marketplace. You see, the subprime companies and Wall Street had long used subprime loans as a way to do an end-run around Fannie and Freddie. By the mid-2000s, subprime underwriting and securitization had become so profitable -- and such a large part of the overall mortgage business -- that Fannie and Freddie felt they had no choice but to dive in. In other words, the G.S.E.'s were reacting to the realities of the market, not to the government. They were worried about losing market share.
Mr. Wallison said he had seen documents, not yet made public, as part of his work with the financial crisis commission that would prove that he's right and I'm wrong. Well, we'll see.
What is most troubling is that the Republicans are going to try to create new policy based on Mr. Wallison's analysis. The incoming chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Representative Spencer Bachus of Alabama, has vowed to make reform of the G.S.E.'s his top legislative priority, ending ''once and for all the disastrous government experiment in privatized profits and socialized losses.''
Without question, this is a laudable goal. But the diagnosis put forth by Congressional Republicans reads as if Mr. Wallison wrote it. Fannie and Freddie, they say (implausibly) in a recent position paper, ''were the proximate cause of the financial crisis'' and ''at the forefront of a relentless push to drive down lending standards,'' etc. etc.
The solutions they offered were nice-sounding but impractical -- ''Re-establish a housing financial market that has long-term stability in which private capital is the primary source of mortgage financing'' -- and utterly in denial about the fact that it's the private market that has gone AWOL. Just as the market failed during the bubble, so it is now failing again.
I'm all for reforming Fannie and Freddie. Who isn't? But at this stage of the game, you can't reform the G.S.E.'s without reforming the private market too. That may not be where the Republicans' theory of the case takes them. But it happens to be true.

HEADLINE: Economic Boom in Washington Leaves Gaping Income Disparities

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE and ROBERT GEBELOFF; Sabrina Tavernise reported from Washington, and Robert Gebeloff from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As incomes fell across America over the past decade, new census data show that one place registered a remarkable rise: the nation's capital.
Washington, long a symbol of the country's urban ills, is now among the national leaders in income growth. It ranks first among states with gains in median household income and third among the country's 100 biggest cities, surpassed only by Atlanta, and Arlington, Va., an affluent enclave.
There are more people in the city with graduate degrees than with just a high school diploma, and its share of graduate degree holders increased faster than in any other major city. The number of households earning more than $100,000 grew four times faster than overall population in the same period.
Though the federal government has always been a stable source of jobs here, the data show that the private sector -- including consultancies, contractors and lobbying and legal firms -- created most of the new jobs. Workers who identified themselves as managers and professionals jumped by nearly a third over the decade. 
The economic boom did not lift everybody. About a third of the census tracts, areas of between 3,000 and 5,000 residents, registered income declines during the decade, including many that were already poor to begin with.
Unemployment for residents with only a high school diploma more than doubled over the decade to 19 percent in 2009, the highest in 30 years, according to the D.C. Fiscal Policy Institute, an economic research group.
The decade also brought black employment to a grim low: By 2009, only 49 percent of black adults in the city were employed, down from 56 percent in 2000, according to the institute. That was down from 62 percent in 1988. The figure includes the elderly, so full employment would be around 80 percent.
''It's the classic story of a rising tide that is not lifting all boats,'' said Ed Lazere, policy director at the institute. ''There are a lot of residents not able to connect with the city's economic engine. And the city's becoming more expensive around them.''
The changes have aggravated the widespread disparities in a city that is both the American seat of power and home to some of its poorest neighborhoods. Among the nation's 100 most populous cities, Washington ranked seventh in income inequality in 2009, according to the Census Bureau.
The influx of affluent new residents has resulted in a sweeping pattern of gentrification of poor neighborhoods by a well-educated, mostly white class that fled cities en masse decades ago.
Over all, the city's white population is up by a quarter, while its black population declined by 7 percent. It was second only to Atlanta in terms of increase in the share of its white population over the last decade.
Similar transformations are happening in other major cities, but few with the pace of the capital's. One area in the city with a sharp influx of whites was around U and 14th Streets, a stretch of blocks that are important for African-American heritage. Duke Ellington's childhood home was nearby, as was the first luxury hotel for African-Americans.
In one tract in the area, the white population jumped by 1,500, while the black population stayed the same, according to census estimates. The bureau also estimated the tract's median household income rose nearly 80 percent, with the number of households earning at least $100,000 jumping from 250 to more than 900. Another tract a few blocks south and east had the city's largest gain of whites -- 794. It lost 350 blacks in the same period.
The decade brought change. First a Whole Foods moved in on P and 14th Streets. Then Starbucks. Today wine bars and fancy restaurants pulse with people, and glittering home furnishings stores replaced scruffy second-hand stores on 14th Street. Whole Foods now looks out onto a running-clothes shop, a designer eyeglasses store called Blink, and a gelateria.
''This used to be all black here,'' said Tom Fouche, 47, who lives at the Central Union Mission, a well-known homeless shelter on 14th Street. ''Now I call it upper Georgetown,'' he said, referring to an affluent, largely white neighborhood to the west. ''It's more preppy with more stuff to do.''
U Street's urban feel is its principal draw for many young people who have moved to Washington. John Grainger, a scientist from Britain, chose to live in the U Street neighborhood, instead of near his work at the National Institute for Health in Bethesda, Md., because, at 29, he wanted to experience the city.
''It's great,'' said Mr. Grainger, holding a container with his dinner at the Whole Foods salad bar. ''It's easier to socialize, and there's lots to do.''
But the development has come at a cost. Prices around the city are rising, making life for Mr. Fouche, who used to work finishing floors, more complicated.
''I'm broke,'' he said. ''Prices are so high. I have to eat.''
Mr. Fouche applied for many jobs recently, at Target, Safeway, Giant and Home Depot, but none of them called back. A cleaning company told him he was hired, but the contract was canceled a few days later.
His frustrations point to another effect of gentrification. With highly educated people flooding into the city -- the rise in the number of graduate degree holders outstripped the rate for new high school graduates by a factor of 10 in the decade -- less educated people are being displaced even from unskilled jobs, in a phenomenon Mr. Lazere calls the gentrification of the labor market.
Michael Beirne, 23, who graduated from the University of California, Santa Cruz with a music and math major, now works scooping gelato in the shop across from Whole Foods. A job in music, he said, would require practicing 10 hours a day, and a job in math would require a doctorate.
''I was lucky to find this,'' he said, standing in the shop on a frigid Thursday.
But the city is still a draw. Dukes Wooters, 28, moved to Washington from New York after losing his job at an insurance company that was associated with Lehman Brothers. He worked for a while as an intern for a congressman, but pays the bills with a job at a sportswear store. His dream, he said, is politics. And he is not leaving anytime soon.
''I don't want to move,'' he said. ''I've lived in a lot of cities in the Northeast. But this is the first city where I could see myself staying.''

HEADLINE: Best Buy Feels the Pressure of Rivals on the Web

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
At barely 10 a.m., holiday shopping was in full swing at a Best Buy on the Upper West Side. A harried father searched for a new Xbox for his children. A personal assistant picked up video game accessories for her boss's twins. One young woman fiddled with a coffeemaker, while another paid for a DVD player.
Outside, parked along the curb, a Best Buy van displayed the slogan ''to serve, install and repair.'' Inside, one of Best Buy's frontline salesmen, known as blue shirts for their uniforms, shouted to no one in particular across the vast showroom: ''Anybody have any questions?'' And moments later, to a couple trying out some laptops, he said: ''You guys O.K.?''
At a time when the nation's brick-and-mortar electronics retailers are increasingly feeling the squeeze from online sellers and discounters, the scene at the Best Buy store exemplified what the company hoped would keep customers pushing through its glass doors: the service support, the personal touch of its sales staff and the products on display that allow shoppers to see, touch and try. 
Its strategy, however, has not worked as well as envisioned in a recovering economy. The challenges faced by electronics stores were highlighted this week when Best Buy, the world's largest consumer electronics retailer in revenue, reported that third-quarter net income fell 4.4 percent, to $217 million, and sales fell 1.1 percent, to $11.9 billion. Sales at stores open for more than a year declined 5 percent.
The third-quarter results were below analysts' forecasts and affected other stocks. Shares of Best Buy fell 18 percent during the day Tuesday, after the results were announced. That was the biggest decline since August 2002, and other retailers like Hhgregg and RadioShack followed suit.
For the week, Best Buy shares lost 18 percent, Hhgregg fell 14 percent, and RadioShack 5 percent.
''The market, which is already weak, is dramatically shifting away from stores and toward online,'' said Colin A. McGranahan, a senior analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. ''The online share of the market is now a critical mass, and the discount stores are also fierce competitors and willing to sell the product at very low prices to get that customer through the door.''
''You are also seeing another factor where people are going into Best Buy, getting advice on the product and then using smartphones to scan the Web for better deals,'' he said.
With the shift toward online destinations, electronics retailers need to adapt to the changing landscape, analysts say, even as they continue to open storefronts. Online sales in the United States are forecast to account for 20 percent of total consumer electronics sales of $250 billion by the end of this year.
''Online has now gotten big enough to encroach on Best Buy,'' Mr. McGranahan said.
Best Buy reported for the first time this year that it had started to lose market share. Sales of televisions, computers and video game software were weaker than expected, Brian J. Dunn, Best Buy's chief executive, said this week.
Separately, in a e-mail he added that the company offered customers ''a place where they can talk to knowledgeable, unbiased and engaged salespeople who demonstrate the art of what's possible'' and help them make choices.
Even so, new technology, like 3-D televisions that often need specialists to answer the questions of consumers, was not moving as briskly as hoped. Analysts said the company did not promote lower-tier products as aggressively as it should have. In general, sales were going to Amazon, Wal-Mart, Target, Costco and Sears.
''The results certainly signify how much competition consumer electronic retailers are facing from mass merchants and larger online retailers,'' said R. J. Hottovy, director of consumer research at Morningstar. ''It is tough to see what the company is going to do,'' he said. ''I think that a lot of the worries lingering out there were exacerbated by the results.''
Morningstar said it was reducing its fair value estimate for the stock, raising questions about Best Buy's ability to defend market share from mass merchants, especially while major suppliers like Apple expanded their own outlets. ''These factors support the viewpoint that Best Buy lacks an economic moat, in our view,'' said the research note.
Analysts downgraded their expectations for the fiscal year.
''We whacked a billion in revenue out of our forecast,'' down to $50.2 billion in global sales, Mr. McGranahan said, adding: ''It was a pretty bad quarter. Sales declined more than we thought, and the outlook for the fourth is not great.''
And Best Buy said in its third-quarter earnings news release that it was lowering its per-share outlook for the year.
Even so, electronics and appliances retailers are still pressing ahead with new storefronts. Best Buy plans to open 50 to 55 stores by the end of February.
Hhgregg expects to open a store early next year in Pensacola, Fla., and up to 45 more in fiscal 2012. Company officials declined to be interviewed before the end of the current quarter on Dec. 31.
Analysts still question how the surviving electronics retailers can adapt in an industry that has already seen its share of bankruptcies, like Circuit City's. While Best Buy is testing new products, like fitness equipment and electronic scooters, it might have to shift to smaller stores, Mr. Hottovy said.
''They have got to change their business model,'' he said. ''They are throwing anything against the wall to see if it will work.''
A spokeswoman for Best Buy, Susan Busch, said the company planned to accelerate the use of its ''robust'' online offerings. ''Best Buy's online channel had more than 40 million site visits from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday,'' she said in an e-mail.
Analysts note that the company and other stand-alone retailers are banking on what they see as the competitive advantage of in-store expertise. But some fear customers will go to a store to get advice about a product, only to buy it online or at a better price with discounters.
Mr. McGranahan said he suspected there was still a market for the personal touch. ''I don't think 100 percent of consumer electronics are going to be sold online,'' he said. ''There are still a lot of people who want to see it, touch it, feel it, take it home today.''
On a recent morning, Gregory D. Shufro went to a RadioShack on Manhattan's Upper West Side to inspect a coaxial cable before buying it. ''That is something you can't do online,'' he said.
At Best Buy, Dinah Sternbach, 19, weighed down with school textbooks in her backpack, said it was still worth it to pick up a bulky new Keurig coffeemaker instead of ordering it online. ''There is something psychological about getting what I want now,'' she said.
And Jordan Miraglia, 24, a hospital intern, bought a DVD player for a local child. She said she would have ordered gifts online only for her family in Maryland, to avoid carrying them through Penn Station. Otherwise, she said she loved holiday shopping in stores.
''It reminds me people have people they care about,'' she said. ''Everyone looks at each other in the eyes.''

HEADLINE: Unease Grows About Future Of Financing For Pell Grants

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
With the lame-duck Congress winding down and a $5.7 billion gap in financing looming for next year's Pell grants -- and a further $8 billion gap for the following year -- there is growing uncertainty about the future of the grants, the nation's most significant financial-aid program for college students.
After months of wrangling, Congress grappled Friday with stopgap financing to keep the government in business after the budget expires this weekend. But the temporary measures, probably extending to mid-February, will most likely continue the current budget without providing extra Pell money. 
Earlier this year, Congress passed legislation that provided an extra $36 billion over 10 years to the Pell grant program and increased the maximum grant to $5,550, up from $4,050 five years ago. But with a new Congress arriving in January and determined to cut spending, it is unclear whether that expansion is sustainable.
If Congress does not cover the gap in financing, millions of students could see their Pell grants reduced by more than 15 percent, with the maximum grant shrinking by about $845.
Financial aid officers are starting to worry about a program that is supposed to provide more than $30 billion next year to college students.
''Our students count on that money, and we don't have the resources to try to make that up,'' said Alice Murphey, director of financial-aid management at the City University of New York. ''There's always been a lot of support in Washington for Pell, and enough people on our side. This is the first time it's ever looked like there wouldn't eventually be a solution.''
Most students and parents are unaware of the uncertainty regarding the grants, Ms. Murphey said, but if they were cut, the reaction would be intense.
''I think there would be a huge rebellion,'' she said.
Bigger Pell grants have been a priority of the Obama administration, part of its commitment to expanding access to college and building a better-educated work force. But with the recession sending more students back to school, the number of unemployed and low-income students eligible for Pell grants has grown rapidly -- and with it, the gap in financing.
''Next year, there will be 8.7 million Pell recipients, and the cost of the program will be about $34 billion,'' said Terry Hartle, senior vice president at the American Council on Education, who is lobbying for full financing for Pell grants. ''It's more than doubled in five years. Congress has two choices now: they can add $5.7 billion more and keep the maximum award, or they cannot provide it and let the Pell for next year fall.''
Rich Williams, the higher-education associate for U.S. Public Interest Research Group, said extending the current budget into next year without fully financing the Pell program would be ''the worst possible scenario'' in avoiding major disruptions in financial aid.
''Congress promised students and families a $5,550 maximum Pell grant next year,'' Mr. Williams said, ''but if it isn't funded by the end of this year, given the political situation, it's going to be much, much harder. Next year the discussion in D.C .will be about reducing overall funding levels.''

HEADLINE: Laid-Off OTB Employees Face the Future Apprehensively

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
The ceiling of the union hall was festooned for the holidays with red and green streamers, but a gloom hung over the room on Friday morning as a few hundred former employees of the New York City Off-Track Betting Corporation trudged in.
Having been abruptly laid off last week after spending much of their lives taking bets on horse races, they collectively wondered what the odds were of finding other work to pay the bills anytime soon. Some expressed faith in their skills at dealing with customers who might not be welcomed everywhere, but others feared that their long service to an outfit whose reputation was far from sterling might not carry much value. 
''I've been out of the labor market for 33 years, so I'm wondering, what can I do?'' said Joyce Quarles, 58, who started working for the OTB in 1977. ''It's just that the economy is so bad right now. It's scary.''
For Ms. Quarles, who lives in Long Branch, N.J., the OTB was a family affair. Her mother was one of its first employees, and her boyfriend and older son also lost jobs when the OTB shuttered its betting parlors across the city on Dec. 7. She could not talk about the closing -- and the elimination of more than 800 jobs -- without tearing up.
''It's a sad day,'' Ms. Quarles said. ''It's just a horrible thing to do at this time of year.''
She said she had encouraged her son, who is 33, to improve his computer skills and seek work in a technology field ''because his unemployment check won't even cover his rent.''
The meagerness of unemployment benefits -- the maximum weekly payout is $405, before taxes -- was just part of the sobering news the laid-off betting clerks and their former colleagues heard on Friday from state and union officials. Many were over 55 and eligible to retire and collect pensions. But Mike Riggio, an official of their union, Local 2021 of District Council 37, told those who attended the information session that all health care benefits for retirees would end on Dec. 31.
''Happy new year,'' one person in the crowd muttered.
As Mr. Riggio spoke, relating parts of his most recent discussions with OTB officials and state lawmakers, tension snaked around the hall. The mere mention of Greg Rayburn, the chief executive of the OTB, elicited boos and hissing.
Mr. Riggio assured the workers that the union was still fighting to resurrect the betting parlors in some form and pledged to sue the city and state governments, as well as the OTB, to save the workers' health benefits. But as he spoke, an air of resignation spread across the rows of blue plastic chairs.
Soon the discussion turned back to the forms the workers needed to fill out to collect what was due them as former employees of the OTB and former members of the union. Then, inevitably, the subject reverted to their prospects as unemployed betting clerks in a city with no betting parlors for the first time in almost 40 years.
''I don't know what I'm going to do now,'' said Dennis Ferington, 46, who had been taking bets from low and high rollers since he was 18. ''It's been so sudden. I worked every day, six days a week, and we were back-stabbed.''
Mr. Ferington, of West Hempstead, on Long Island, said he was angry that lawmakers had shut down the OTB even after he and some of his co-workers took a cut in annual pay to $45,000 from $55,000. Already, he said, he and his wife had started cutting back, canceling their cable TV service and heavily reducing their Christmas spending. He said that continuing his family's health coverage, at about $1,100 a month, was out of the question.
Still, he was proud of the work that he had done.
''I love what I'm doing,'' Mr. Ferington said, a black cap on his head sporting the OTB logo. ''And I know I'm the best at what I do.''
But he summed up the predicament of his peers by recounting a conversation last week with a regular customer he described as a heavy bettor. ''He said: 'There's no place in New York City? You cannot bet in the whole city?' '' Mr. Ferington recalled.
Another laid-off clerk, Angela Page, said she was still in shock and had not come to grips with having to look for work again after 11 years at the OTB.
''I thought I was going to make a life out of this, and I was stunned,'' said Ms. Page, 46, a newly divorced grandmother from Brooklyn. ''They just left us destitute, straight up.''
Ms. Page said she had to tell her adult children that she would not be able to help them financially with the holidays this year. She said she was contemplating taking her three grandchildren out of school on Monday to go to the union's holiday party, where she was sure they would receive at least one gift each.
After that, she said, she would have to find another job soon because merely maintaining her health insurance would cost almost $500 a month. ''I'm good at everything,'' she said, rattling off her qualifications. ''I can serve food. I can run a register. I can stack boxes. I can baby-sit kids.''

HEADLINE: The Postman Always Pings Twice

BYLINE: By MICHAEL RAVNITZKY. 
Michael Ravnitzky is the chief counsel to the chairman of the Postal Regulatory Commission.

 BODY:
Washington
THE Postal Service recently announced it had lost $8.5 billion in the last year, despite cutting more than 100,000 jobs. Without new revenue and other changes to get it back on a firm financial footing, it said, it could face insolvency by the end of 2011.
Fortunately, the service has a unique asset that could allow it to make money by collecting valuable data that would contribute to the country's safety and economic health: its far-reaching network of trucks. 
The service's thousands of delivery vehicles have only one purpose now: to transport mail. But what if they were fitted with sensors to collect and transmit information about weather or air pollutants? The trucks would go from being bulky tools of industrial-age communication to being on the cutting edge of 21st-century information-gathering and forecasting.
After all, the delivery fleet already goes to almost every home and business in America nearly every day, and it travels fixed routes along a majority of the country's roads to get there. Data collection wouldn't require much additional staff or resources; all it would take would be a small, cheap and unobtrusive sensor package mounted on each truck. (This idea is mine alone, and does not necessarily reflect the views of the Postal Regulatory Commission.)
The key elements for the project already exist, including tiny, inexpensive G.P.S. receivers and radio uplinks, features found in today's smart phones. The sensors would operate without distracting the drivers from their primary responsibilities. The service could also minimize startup costs by teaming up with a company to develop, install and operate the equipment. One company under contract with the National Weather Service is already installing environmental sensors on long-haul commercial buses to enhance weather forecasting.
The data gathered by these truck-mounted sensors would establish a baseline map of ordinary conditions, making it significantly easier to spot a problem or anomaly. Such a system could aid in homeland security by rapidly detecting chemical agents, radiological materials and, eventually, biological attacks; it could also collect detailed data to improve weather forecasts. And it could assess road quality, catalog potholes and provide early warning of unsafe road conditions like black ice.
A system like this could also detect gaps in cell-tower coverage, weak radio and television signals and sources of radio frequency interference. This data could help provide uninterrupted communication services and promote more efficient use of the broadcast spectrum.
One logical way to start would be for the service to work with other federal agencies, or to lease space on certain trucks to permit testing of smart sensors by businesses, nonprofits or university researchers.
True, other types of vehicles, like taxis or buses, could also carry sensors. But such vehicles typically don't follow as many regular routes. Nor are they managed by a single organization that could readily coordinate nationwide or regional data collection.
There are a few obvious objections. For starters, there are privacy concerns regarding certain types of data. But a review panel could be set up to monitor the use of the network and ensure safeguards for handling the data.
There's also the question about marketplace competition from a federal agency monopoly, an issue that has led Congress to limit the types of non-postal services the agency is allowed to provide. But in this case, the service wouldn't be competing; rather, it would be providing a platform that a business could never afford. If anything, by offering access to a wide range of data and thereby being a catalyst for business innovation, the service would be promoting competition, not hindering it.
Over the next few years the Postal Service must figure out what role it will play in a world where new modes of communication and information-gathering seem to emerge every few years. Postal delivery trucks that go everywhere nearly every day are positioned to fill that role -- without sacrificing the vital task of delivering the nation's mail.

HEADLINE: The Euro's Uneven Benefit in Europe

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy on his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
THE euro has been good for German exporters, and seems likely to get even better in the coming year. It has also been good for the Netherlands, which was the fourth-largest exporter in the euro zone in 2000 and now ranks second. But France and Italy suffered during the last decade as their shares of euro zone exports declined.
The relative changes are shown in the accompanying charts, which detail the shares of the four major countries in total exports of the 16 countries now in the euro zone, from 2000 through 2009. 
German exports account for more than a quarter of the trade within the euro zone, and rose during the last decade. Its share of exports by euro zone countries to the rest of the world is even larger, and has been growing more rapidly. It now is at 36 percent.
Creating a large area with a common currency was supposed to stimulate trade within the zone because companies could sign contracts without worrying about currency changes, just as companies in Massachusetts can deal with firms in California.
That effect does seem to have helped some countries that joined the euro during the decade, particularly Slovenia and Slovakia. Neither is a large exporter, but their shares of the total have risen sharply in recent years.
The export share of Ireland, an original member, fell as its economy came to be based more on a property boom and less on manufacturing. Exports have begun to pick up, after the crash forced wage cuts and a new emphasis on trade.
Greece's exports, also small, lost market share during the period as costs rose. Spain held its own, and while Portugal lost market share within the euro zone, it gained a little on exports to other countries.
Europe's economic growth lagged during much of the last decade, and the figures show that exports to countries outside the zone rose faster than exports within the zone. In 2000, the euro zone countries shipped 1.06 trillion euros in products to one another, worth about $975 billion at then-current exchange rates, and just 999 billion euros worth to other countries. By 2008, the figures were 1.55 trillion euros, or about $2.3 trillion, for trading within the zone, and 1.57 trillion for exports outside. In 2009, both figures fell by about 18 percent, but the decline in trade within the zone was slightly larger.
The figures are based on a new statistical yearbook released by Eurostat, the European Union's statistical agency, giving details of bilateral trade for members of the E.U.
The changing exports of the major countries reflect to some extent the changing competitiveness of countries during the period. Costs rose more rapidly in some countries than others, hurting exports and encouraging imports. France's share of exports within the euro zone fell to just 13.4 percent in 2009, from 17 percent in 2000. Italy's share fell to 10.1 percent, from 11.9 percent. Italy used to periodically improve its competitiveness by devaluing the lira, but such a move is not possible now that it uses the euro.
Germany may be in position to continue gaining market share. The well-publicized problems confronting some European countries -- caused, in part, by their lack of competitiveness -- have infuriated Germans who fear they will have to pay for bailouts. But those problems have also cut the value of the euro relative to the dollar and other currencies, and thus made German exports even more competitive.

HEADLINE: Chinese Premier Visits Pakistan to Reinforce Ties

BYLINE: By SALMAN MASOOD

 BODY:
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao arrived in Islamabad on Friday for a three-day visit that Pakistani officials said was aimed at strengthening the strategic partnership and economic cooperation between the two neighboring countries. 
Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani and members of his cabinet welcomed Mr. Wen at Chaklala Air Base in neighboring Rawalpindi on Friday afternoon. A red carpet was rolled out and elaborate ceremonies were held to signify the importance Pakistan attaches to China, which is considered a close ally.
''Friendship with China is a matter of pride for our nation,'' Mr. Gilani was quoted as saying by local media as he welcomed his Chinese counterpart.
Apart from holding meetings with Mr. Gilani and President Asif Ali Zardari, Mr. Wen was scheduled to address a special joint session of the Parliament on Sunday.
Pakistan's military ties with China are strong and China has assisted Pakistan in tank production, fighter aircraft manufacturing and naval technology. But since the late 1990s, economic concerns have gained increased importance. Trade and energy have taken precedence in Pakistan's relations with China.
Mr. Wen was accompanied by 260 business executives.
Pakistani officials say there is a need to enhance trade between the countries that stands around $7 billion a year. But there also are concerns here that the trade deficit is growing heavily in favor of China.
''The relationship is undergoing a qualitative change,'' said Mansoor Ahmad, an independent security analyst based in Islamabad. ''This change is manifested in China's relationship with emerging markets and developing countries, which is essentially based on forging and enhancing trade linkages and securing new markets for Chinese investment.''
The Chinese are also cooperating with Pakistan in developing its civil nuclear energy program despite discontent from Washington and New Delhi.
Mr. Wen, the Chinese prime minister, arrived here after completing a two-day tour of India, the estranged neighbor of Pakistan.
China would have to undertake a fine balancing act regarding enhancing its cooperation with both India and Pakistan, said Mr. Ahmad. China and India would forge economic ties despite their continuing territorial disputes, given India's huge market, he said. Tensions between India and Pakistan worsened after the terrorist attacks in Mumbai in 2008, which India and the United States blamed on Lashkar-e-Taiba, a militant Islamic group based in Pakistan.
The Pakistan government sees China as a counterweight to India, and officials said that closer Chinese cooperation with India would not affect Pakistani ties with China.
Nonetheless, Mr. Wen's visit to India this week yielded greater immiediate progress on the economic front than toward resolving the more complicated geostrategic issues.
''In Pakistan's case, we have already had a longstanding strategic partnership which is now being supplemented by increasing Chinese investment in infrastructural development, civil nuclear cooperation and establishing rail and road linkages between the two countries,'' Mr. Ahmad said.

HEADLINE: Citi Deals A New Deck Of Credit Cards

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER

 BODY:
It can't be much fun to be a credit card marketer right now.
The bosses are desperate for new revenue after a couple of years of writing off bad loans. President Obama signed legislation making it harder to raise interest rates and impose fees.
Meanwhile, many customers are paying down high-interest debt and have sworn off the companies' products in favor of debit cards. Oh, and they mostly hate that card companies cut many of their credit limits in a time of need and then reduced perks on some cards as if to rub salt in their wounds.
So now a couple of companies want to throw you a small bone. American Express announced Friday that it would soon get rid of its dreaded currency conversion fees for transactions that begin outside of the United States, though only for people who have its Platinum or Centurion (a k a Black) personal and small-business cards.
Two new Citigroup cards will also drop the fees. The new cards are part of an overhaul of much of Citigroup's credit card operations. The company will discontinue a number of cards, including its PremierPass, Diamond Preferred Rewards, Simplicity Rewards, Home Rebate and Driver's Edge Options cards. (The popular cards that earn American Airlines miles are not part of the changes.) 
Starting early next year, Citi will replace these cards with one of four cards: ThankYou, ThankYou Preferred, Premier and Prestige.
As part of the overhaul, Citi will take away some perks that many cardholders like and add others that weren't there before. Many new customers will be paying strikingly higher annual fees than they may have paid for Citi's discontinued cards (though at least for the moment, current customers won't be affected).
Citi isn't the only company making changes to its card lineup; most other issuers have been experimenting with new fees and rules for at least a year in an attempt to test the limits of the new card legislation and stop the bleeding in their card businesses.
What's unusual with Citi is that it's doing so much at once. The fact that Citi is getting rid of the card formerly known as Simplicity Rewards is telling. The blizzard of all of Citi's additions and subtractions defies tidy analysis, which is probably just the way the company likes it. It's a pretty safe bet, however, that Citi wouldn't be making these moves unless its spreadsheets predicted big gains in revenue and profit.
That doesn't mean that current Citi customers will all be losers. It does, however, mean that people with one of the discontinued Citi cards need to think about what sort of plastic they want to be carrying. And anyone else shopping for a new card ought to take a look as well, if only to kick the tires on the first of the 2011 card models.
Some of you may be wondering what all this fuss is about. Cash still works in most places, after all. And debit cards can help you track your spending and keep you from charging more than you have in your account.
Millions of affluent people are hooked on credit card rewards, however, for better or for worse. Chase has already overhauled aspects of its card operation to better pursue those individuals.
So Citi is a bit late to the game here. Then again, some of its new effort is built on a unique change it made in 2004.
That was when Citi introduced PremierPass cards. Users earned one point in Citi's proprietary ThankYou program for every dollar they spent. Then, they redeemed those points for merchandise or free plane tickets on multiple airlines.
The twist was this: When you bought a plane ticket for yourself or others with the cards, you also earned separate ''flight'' points for every mile that you or they flew. Those points could add up quickly. So Citi wouldn't let people redeem the flight points until they had an equal number of ''purchase points,'' which were all the ThankYou points people earned for every card purchases.
Because many people racked up flight points faster than purchase points, the not-yet-redeemable flight points turned into an anchor that kept many cardholders paying annual fees year after year.
For some affluent customers, this was such a bonanza that Citi had to repeatedly tweak the redemption rules for plane tickets in its ThankYou program. These changes served to keep the points from being so valuable that the program would become unsustainable. Today, you get a penny per point to spend on airline tickets when you redeem a ThankYou point.
And herein lies the challenge in analyzing a card like this, one that most consumers don't think through. When card companies advertise double points or flight points or triple miles, it is utterly meaningless until you know exactly what those points or miles will buy.
This can be confusing. Really confusing. In fact, it's confusing for Citi's own employees, who included some language in the terms and conditions on its new cards that strongly suggested that the company was changing the earning rules for these flight points. In fact, the rules will remain the same.
Some of the other point-earning rules are changing, though. Many Citi customers now earn at least two points for every dollar they spend at gas stations and grocery and drug stores. With the new cards, that will fall to 1.2 points per dollar spent for the Premier card and 1.3 points for the Prestige one.
That said, customers can earn an unlimited number of points each year, and they won't expire in most instances. Points on discontinued Citi cards are supposed to transfer to the new ones the company will send out in the first half of 2011.
Citi says it has no plans to further restrict redemptions. This is true until it isn't, and as with any loyalty program, the rules can and will change.
On the Premier and Prestige cards, Citi is also throwing in some new perks. One that appears to be new to the card industry is a 15 percent discount on domestic plane tickets. You have to book through a Citi partner travel agent, and the terms and conditions for this benefit are rife with anxiety-producing bits about the partner determining the airline and routing, limited availability, airline participation (or lack thereof) and the possibility of earning no airline miles.
I tested the program for a New York-to-Chicago trip in February 2011 and found that the discount was real and that most airlines on the route participated. But I suspect that this will be much harder to use around Easter and Thanksgiving.
As for the new annual fees, they are aggressive. Two of the new cards have none, but the perks-laden Premier card has a $125 annual fee while the Prestige card requires $500. The Prestige card also include access to certain airport lounges through the Priority Pass program.
Current PremierPass and other Citi customers who are paying lower annual fees will continue paying the existing fees for now. Despite my best efforts, I could not extract a promise from Terry O'Neil, Citi Cards executive vice president, that he would never raise them.
''There is no plan in place to increase annual fees for those customers,'' was the best he would offer. Throughout Cardland, that's often code for ''We'll raise them next year.'' I would like nothing more than to be wrong about that.
The company has also added annual fees for any and all supplemental cards, say for your spouse and children. New customers will pay $50 for each extra Premier card every year; Prestige cardholders will pay $175 for each authorized user. Why? The card and its benefits are worth it, Mr. O'Neil said. (Current cardholders will not have to pay annual fees for their authorized users' cards for now.)
Maybe they are and maybe they aren't. Never has the phrase ''your mileage may vary'' been more appropriate than it is with Citi's credit card reboot. So much depends on what, where and how you spend and which rules Citi changes in the future (and when).
The experts figure that consumers will be skeptical. ''I just don't think that people will have a lot of confidence,'' said Dennis Lefebvre, who moderates or co-moderates several credit card forums on FlyerTalk.com, where many of the savviest travelers and credit card users hang out and swap tips. ''They have tinkered with the way you earn and redeem ThankYou points so many times over the last half dozen years that I think it's very difficult for a person to make a decision to accumulate those points towards a spectacular reward that takes years to save for.''
And now, the company proposes to take away people's cards and hand them something new and shiny and supposedly better. ''A certain number will say, 'Well, I wasn't using it anyway' or 'I don't believe you,' '' Mr. Lefebvre added.
But many more will dive in and hope for the best. Which means Citi's card unit is on probation until further notice, until it becomes clear that the rules won't change any more and the benefits are worth the new high prices.

HEADLINE: Size Protects Government Contractors That Stray

BYLINE: By RON NIXON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Weeks into the largest oil spill in American history, government officials met in Washington to discuss ways to compel BP, which leased the drilling rig, to move faster in stopping the spill.
One proposal called for suspending the company from getting government work under a federal law aimed at protecting taxpayers against unscrupulous contractors.
But there was a snag. BP, the regulators knew from experience, might be too big to ban. They recalled that last year, before the spill in the Gulf of Mexico, officials at the Environmental Protection Agency wanted to stop BP from getting government contracts until it addressed various environmental and safety violations. Then, according to a lawyer involved in the debarment process at the agency, the Pentagon objected: BP was its biggest supplier of fuel.
As the case of BP illustrates, the largest companies often escape the stiffest penalties because government agencies are too dependent on them. And even when there are suspensions or debarments they usually affect individuals or a business unit within the company, not the whole company. 
The top 100 government contractors have paid more than $19 billion in cases of fraud, bribery, falsifying records and other violations over the past 15 years, but only four of them have been suspended from government contracting, and none have been debarred, according to a database from the Project on Government Oversight, a group based in Washington. The database is based on the contractor rankings for the 2009 fiscal year.
The issue of how to deal with these big companies has gained currency in recent months because of the BP case and allegations that Iraqi officials were bribed by Blackwater Worldwide, now called Xe Services, in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In the case of Blackwater, State Department officials pledged to pull its contracts, only to find that no other security companies were big enough to do the work.
While small companies are often debarred, the biggest ones, like BP, have become the equivalent of ''too big to fail,'' Senator Russ Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, said at a Congressional hearing this year.
''We need to hold government contractors to a high standard,'' Mr. Feingold said, ''and I do not think that large corporations should be given a free pass for behavior that would typically result in the debarment of a smaller corporation.''
Some government officials concede there are problems. During a recent conference, inspectors general from the Departments of Transportation and Homeland Security and the General Services Administration said the system was plagued by inconsistent standards, a reluctance to act in many cases, and other issues.
Numerous audits by the Government Accountability Office and federal agencies have pointed to shortcomings. One last year by the inspector general of the Agency for International Development found that the agency has not used contractor suspension and debarment to adequately protect the public interest.
Only three agencies in the federal government have full-time debarment officials, the E.P.A., the Air Force and the Navy. The rest have part-time officials who are typically part of the procurement office, creating a potential conflict because these officials are also trying to arrange contracts for their agencies.
Representative Luis V. Gutierrez, Democrat of Illinois, has pushed through an amendment to the military authorization bill requiring the secretary of defense to review whether BP is a ''responsible'' contractor, with a ''satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics.'' If not, the legislation would require Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates to bar the oil giant from military contracts, said Mr. Gutierrez's spokesman, Douglas Rivlin.
Last month, the House of Representatives passed a debarment bill, introduced by Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont, that would ban contractors guilty of violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act from government contracts. It was aimed at Xe Services, which has not been charged with or convicted of a crime, but it would also affect large government contractors like BAE Systems, Daimler AG, and Innospec Inc., which all pleaded guilty this year to making illegal payments to foreign officials.
Both measures passed with bipartisan support.
Alan Chvotkin, executive vice president and counsel of the Professional Services Council, a Washington trade group that represents large contractors, said he thought the current system worked well.
Large corporations, Mr. Chvotkin said, are often better able to identify and correct misconduct, and that may account for the low rate of suspensions and debarments for the largest contractors.
At small companies, Mr. Chvotkin said, the person responsible for the misconduct might be the company leader who is also critical to making or providing what the government needs. ''If you remove or isolate him, you isolate the expertise, and the company can't really provide a service to the government,'' he said.
He added that ''since there are more small companies with government contracts than larger ones, it makes sense that they would be represented more in the database.''
Government debarment officials say they aggressively pursue companies regardless of size, citing the suspension of International Business Machines in 2008 after an E.P.A. employee provided proprietary information to I.B.M. employees that was used to try to win a government contract, Boeing in 2004 for illegally obtaining proprietary information from a competitor, and more recently L-3 Communications after it admitted to monitoring e-mails of its workers, workers for other contractors and United States government employees.
Two units of BP have also been banned from government contracts because of environmental and safety violations that resulted in the death of several workers. More recently, the government suspended GTSI, a big contractor, but reinstated it after the chief executive and the general counsel resigned. It recently won a share of a $30 billion contract from the F.B.I.
''I have always been empowered to do the right thing, regardless of the impact that a debarment would have on the ability to obtain specific goods or services,'' said Steven Shaw, a debarment official with the Air Force, who was responsible for L-3's suspension.
Debarment officials say agencies can be tough in ways other than suspension and debarment, including agreements in which companies agree to corrective measures with oversight by the agencies.
The government has suspended some big companies, but critics note that these cases usually involve individual units and not the entire company, unlike cases involving smaller businesses.
In the case of the Boeing suspension six years ago, they point out that it applied to two business units and that the government granted them a waiver and gave them contracts worth more than $50 million because of ''compelling needs in the national interest,'' according to the Air Force.
Scott Amey, general counsel of the Project on Government Oversight, said that although the Justice Department had gone after contractors for fraud and other crimes, its efforts had not been enough of a deterrent.
He noted that in May, the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Representative Edolphus Towns of New York, wrote to Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. expressing concerns that criminal and civil settlements between the Justice Department and federal contractors were preventing federal agencies from suspending or debarring poorly performing contractors.
In certain instances, Mr. Amey noted, contractors subject to civil and criminal settlements with the department continue to rack up violations.
Mr. Amey rejected the notion that the inclusion of so many small companies on the government's list of banned companies was simply a matter of numbers. ''When you look at the fact that the bulk of federal dollars going to contractors are going to large companies, that argument doesn't hold up,'' he said.

HEADLINE: With New Tax Bill, A Turning Point For the President

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With the stroke of a pen, President Obama on Friday enacted the largest tax cut in nearly a decade and, in the process, took a big step toward reinventing himself as a champion of compromise in a politically fractured capital.
When he first struck the deal two weeks ago, a sour Mr. Obama announced it by himself, lamented his own agreement and testily denounced his Republican partners as ''hostage takers'' and his liberal critics as ''sanctimonious.'' By the time he signed it into law on Friday, little more than six weeks after an electoral debacle for him and his party, he stood with the Senate Republican leader and celebrated the package as a hallmark of cooperation.
''The final product proves when we can put aside the partisanship and the political games, when we can put aside what's good for some of us in favor of what's good for all of us, we can get a lot done,'' Mr. Obama said buoyantly at a bill-signing ceremony in the White House complex. ''I'm also hopeful that we might refresh the American people's faith in the capability of their leaders to govern in challenging times.'' 
One leader in particular. Mr. Obama's embrace of compromise comes as he tries to find his footing after midterm elections that cost the Democratic Party control of the House and pared its majority in the Senate. As the weeks have passed, the president who has emerged appears increasingly more confident than chastened, eager to revive his campaign image as a postpartisan leader who can work across party lines even at the cost of alienating his own supporters.
Such an identity is hardly new to Mr. Obama, but it has largely eluded him in his first two years in office. As a candidate, he managed to come across as diametrically opposite to different supporters, the leader of a new progressive movement to some and a reasoned pragmatist who could bridge the divide in Washington to others. If the first identity dominated his opening two years, the second may come to the fore in his next two.
''These two aspects of his persona have existed side by side from the very beginning,'' said Geoff Garin, a Democratic strategist who in 2008 worked for Mr. Obama's opponent for the presidential nomination, Hillary Rodham Clinton. However imperfect, the tax deal ''spoke to a deep feeling in the country about the need to work across party lines to get things done,'' he said.
It remained unclear whether Mr. Obama can, or would want to, sustain such an approach. The tax deal may be a one-off situation where a looming end-of-the-year deadline forced action to avoid tax cuts expiring across the board. And in reality, of course, it is much easier for politicians to agree about cutting taxes and adding the bill to the national debt than, say, cutting spending or other much tougher choices to come.
''Sometimes the lessons take a while to sink in, particularly if you're a person of great arrogance, as he is,'' said Peter H. Wehner, who was a top White House aide to President George W. Bush and is now a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington. ''But he's not suicidal, and it's beginning to kick in.''
Still, Mr. Wehner said, ''it may be seen as an anomaly rather than the beginning of a trend.''
Indeed, Mr. Obama has made it clear that he will press advantages where he sees them, and he has chosen an energetic agenda for a lame-duck session beyond taxes and other issues that had to be addressed because of deadlines.
He decided to wage a full-fledged fight to push his arms control treaty with Russia through the Senate before it returns next month with five more Republicans. And he has given no ground in the legislative battle to end the ban on gay men and lesbians serving openly in the military.
''His strong resolve was we were not going to meekly limp out of this year not having accomplished what he needed to accomplish,'' David Axelrod, the president's senior adviser, said in an interview.
But Friday's tableau of the Democratic president flanked by Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader and his prime nemesis on Capitol Hill, served as a portrait of the change in his presidency. While Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and both George Bushes advanced top priorities in tandem with the opposition party, this was the first time in Mr. Obama's presidency that he forged a major bipartisan compromise on a signature issue -- and it was Mr. McConnell's first time at a major White House bill signing under this president.
The $858 billion package Mr. Obama signed extends Bush-era tax cuts for two years, pares back payroll taxes for a year, lowers the scheduled tax rate for the largest estates, extends jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed for 13 months and continues a series of other tax cuts benefiting businesses, parents and students.
The entire cost will be added to the federal debt, and arguably Mr. Obama has succeeded mainly in buying a temporary truce by delaying a final reckoning on the fundamental questions of who deserves to pay how much in taxes. But for the moment, the plan has polled well and the White House has fended off protests from Mr. Obama's party.
Mr. Axelrod, who once referred to the parts of the tax plan benefiting the wealthiest Americans as ''odious,'' said this was not a day to focus on the negatives. ''This is something to celebrate,'' he said. ''The fact that we got this done is something to celebrate.''
At the ceremony, Mr. Obama gave a nod to criticism from the left, noting that ''there are some elements of this legislation that I don't like.'' But, he added, ''that's the nature of compromise,'' and focused on what he considered the benefits of the accord, particularly the expectation that it will stimulate economic growth.
''It's a good deal for the American people,'' the president said. ''This is progress. And that's what they sent us here to achieve.''
He added, ''There will be moments, I am certain, over the next couple of years in which the holiday spirit won't be as abundant as it is today.'' But, reviving a phrase used on the campaign trail, he said, ''I don't believe that either party has cornered the market on good ideas.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Plays Down Tensions With Yemen

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Even as the United States and Yemen increasingly battle a common Qaeda enemy, relations between the two allies are often punctuated by tensions, differing views and ''strong frustration,'' a top White House official said Friday.
But the official, John O. Brennan, President Obama's top counterterrorism adviser, said the occasional quarrels were ''healthy'' and ''a hallmark of true friendship.'' 
He also said they had not impeded growing cooperation between the two countries to fight Al Qaeda's offshoot in Yemen, which is responsible for trying to bring down United States-bound cargo planes with printer cartridges packed with explosives as well as a plot to blow up an airliner near Detroit last Dec. 25.
Mr. Brennan's remarks at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace underscored the Obama administration's continuing efforts to tamp down the diplomatic fallout from the release of the WikiLeaks cables.
Washington's relationship with Yemen's mercurial president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, has had its ups and down over the years. But the release of the cables has added new strain. Many of the cables released by WikiLeaks and obtained by five news organizations, including The New York Times, reveal Mr. Saleh to be at times accommodating and at other times resistant to American counterterrorism requests.
In one cable, Mr. Saleh agrees to a proposal by Gen. David H. Petraeus, then the American commander in the Middle East, that future airstrikes against extremists in Yemen be carried out by American aircraft rather than cruise missiles launched from United States Navy ships. But Mr. Saleh denied General Petraeus's request to send American advisers along on Yemeni counterterrorism operations.
Without confirming the authenticity of the WikiLeaks cables, Mr. Brennan condemned their release as ''despicable criminal activity,'' and said he called Mr. Saleh the day before their release in late November to apologize.
''I told President Saleh that it was most unfortunate that these releases would be taking place and that I hoped that they would not cause problems for him, the Yemeni government or the Yemeni people,'' Mr. Brennan said.
Without commenting directly on the impact of the cables on relations with Yemen, Mr. Brennan sought to play down the frustrations and tensions that he said were part of the normal diplomatic give-and-take with any important ally.
''We frequently push the Yemenis to move further and faster along the path of economic and political reform,'' Mr. Brennan said, ''and to be more aggressive in the actions they take against Al Qaeda.''
Mr. Brennan continued, ''For their part, the Yemenis complain that our security and development assistance flows are too slow and encumbered by bureaucratic requirements and complications, that we expect economic and political reforms virtually overnight without understanding the implications of such reforms on Yemeni society and stability, and that we are more interested in fighting Al Qaeda than in helping the Yemeni people.''
All this is nothing more than ''a healthy tension,'' Mr. Brennan said.
He emphasized that while the United States had short-term goals to help Yemen improve its counterterrorism forces, its intelligence gathering skills and its security screening processes, these aims were part of a broader long-term strategy to foster political, economic and social changes to improve the lives of Yemeni citizens and rob Al Qaeda and other extremist groups of recruiting fodder.

HEADLINE: Games vs. Governing

 BODY:
The Senate still has two major tasks ahead in the remaining days of the lame-duck session: allowing open military service by gay and lesbian soldiers and ratifying the vital New Start nuclear arms treaty with Russia. In both cases, approval will have to come from a solid majority of Democrats and a handful of Republicans who are willing to set aside destructive partisanship.
Those Republicans need to resist the obstructionism preached by their leadership and realize that the public wants the two parties to do their jobs and grapple for ways to vote together. There are still many Republicans who have not heard that message. 
On Friday, Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee said that the Democratic push for military equality for gays and lesbians could ''poison the well'' for New Start. The two matters are related only because they are both important for this country's security.
America's top military leaders say that because of ''don't ask, don't tell,'' the services have lost far too many highly trained members. New Start, the first arms control agreement with Russia in a decade, would modestly reduce the deployed weapons of both sides and guarantee continued insight into Russia's arsenal. Failure to ratify would seriously undermine American credibility as it tries to contain Iran's nuclear ambitions.
Mr. Corker's remarks showed that to preserve discrimination, some Republicans are even willing to endanger the nation's security.
All members of Congress have two models to consider in the coming days and months. They could pursue more disingenuous brinkmanship -- like that practiced by the Republicans on the omnibus spending bill -- guaranteeing that none of the nation's urgent problems will be addressed. A far more promising path would be the sort of negotiation that led to the tax deal signed into law on Friday by President Obama.
Many on the left and right would have preferred taking the expiring tax cuts to the brink, rejecting Mr. Obama's compromise with the Republicans. Though the deal is flawed, and certainly is far too generous to the rich, it extends unemployment insurance and middle-class tax cuts, and it could stimulate the economy.
That's what made the Republican filibuster of the spending bill so dispiriting. Both parties had worked for months on setting spending targets, and the resulting bill was hardly bloated, coming in $27 billion below the president's requests. It provided needed funds for securing nuclear weapons in Russia, preventing Head Start classrooms from closing and staving off cuts to Pell grants, among scores of other worthy programs.
It was tripped up by ridiculous posturing over earmarks, which amount to less than 1 percent of the bill. Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, forced supportive Republicans to back down when it became apparent that the bill included many Republican earmarks, violating the party's histrionic pledge to stop them.
Now both chambers will have to approve a series of continuing resolutions to carry forward current spending levels until February. And the new crop of House Republicans will have a better chance to make good on their reckless pledge to cut far below current levels.
While all lawmakers need to think hard about how they want to move ahead, Republicans have a particular choice to make, in the next few days and over the next two years. Should they follow the path of bipartisanship, which is leading to solid results in the lame duck, or the obstruction that led to the death of the spending bill?
If they choose the second path, it will be up to President Obama and Congressional Democrats to take a firm stand, refusing to give ground in advance and making certain that voters understand the cost of choosing game-playing over governing.

HEADLINE: U.S. Cable Released by WikiLeaks Shows Nations Going Easy on Cuba

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Andrew W. Lehren contributed reporting from New York, and Scott Shane from Washington.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Cuba is getting a free pass on its human rights abuses from many of the world's leading democracies, with visitors from Canada, Australia and Switzerland failing to criticize the Castro regime or meet with dissidents while on the island, according to a confidential diplomatic cable sent to the State Department from Havana.
The cable, transmitted in November 2009 and signed by Jonathan D. Farrar, the top American diplomat in Cuba, hinted that there were economic motives behind the accommodating approach. But if so, the cable concluded, these countries were not getting much of a payoff. 
The rewards for acquiescing to Cuban sensitivities, it said, were ''risible: pomp-full dinners and meetings, and for the most pliant, a photo-op with one of the Castro brothers.''
The cable added, ''In terms of substance or economic benefits they fare little better than those who stand up to'' the government.
And yet, in a cable sent six months earlier, the United States Interests Section in Havana also lamented that the Cuban dissidents supported by Washington for decades were old, out of touch and so split by internecine squabbles that the United States should look elsewhere for future leaders.
While that cable, also signed by Mr. Farrar, said dissidents deserved continued American support, it said that some groups had been infiltrated by Cuban intelligence. ''We see very little evidence that the mainline dissident organizations have much resonance among Cubans,'' it said.
A trove of cables made public by WikiLeaks attests to the strained nature of the Cuban-American relationship, at a time when Cuba's revolutionary leader, Fidel Castro, is in failing health and his ideological feud with Washington has little relevance for other countries eager to build bridges. The United States, by contrast, clings to a trade embargo and a policy of isolating Cuba.
''On the one hand, the U.S. is saying the dissidents are hopeless and aging,'' said Julia Sweig, a senior fellow and expert on Cuba at the Council on Foreign Relations. ''On the other hand, the same interests section is saying that the Canada and E.U. engagement is not helping progress on human rights.''
Pointing to Cuba's release of political prisoners and the economic reforms being championed by Fidel Castro's brother Raul, Ms. Sweig said the engagement of the European Union and other countries appeared to be more fruitful than the implacable cold shoulder from Washington.
The United States operates an interests section, rather than an embassy, in Havana because the two countries have not had diplomatic relations for five decades. The office sends a steady stream of analysis to Washington, with vivid dispatches on Fidel Castro's health problems and sober speculation about how Cuba might change after he finally leaves the scene.
There is also evidence that Raul Castro, the president, has reached out to the United States. In a cable dated December 2009, Mr. Farrar reported that Mr. Castro sought a ''political channel'' to the White House. The Cuban president raised the issue with the Spanish foreign minister, Miguel Angel Moratinos, who passed it on to Mr. Farrar via Spain's ambassador to Cuba, Manuel Cacho.
On Thursday, the State Department spokesman, Philip J. Crowley, ruled out high-level contacts without major political changes. ''We have not seen anything approaching fundamental change in Cuba at this point,'' he said. The administration has held only technical talks about Cuban migration.
A senior State Department official said the United States was encouraged by the release of political prisoners, but noted that most of those people were immediately exiled from the country.
In the cable about how other countries deal with Cuba on official visits, American officials classified those approaches on a scale from kowtowing to confrontational: ''best-friends-forever,'' ''keep-it-private,'' ''we-respectfully-disagree'' and, in rare cases, ''take-your-visit-and-shove-it.''
A large majority of countries with diplomatic posts in Havana, it said, do not raise human rights issues with the Cuban government in public or private. A handful of countries -- including Britain, Germany and the Czech Republic -- have refused to send senior officials to Cuba, rather than accept the government's restrictions on who they can meet while there.
Other countries fall somewhere in between, agreeing to restrictions but broaching the topic of human rights, mostly behind closed doors. A senior Canadian minister, Peter Kent, broached the issue of political prisoners with officials, but left Havana without voicing public criticism.
Another offender, the cable said, was the European Union, which takes a softer line toward Cuba than many of its member states. Officials at the European mission, it said, told American diplomats they looked forward to Spain's assuming the rotating presidency of the union because it was more moderate than the ''radical'' Swedes and Czechs.
The cable singles out the Vatican for praise, noting that one of its representatives, Archbishop Claudio Celli, called for ''greater information and Internet access for all Cubans.'' He even praised Cuban bloggers, angering his hosts, though he later softened his comments back in Rome.
It is not exactly clear what quid pro quo countries hope to get for their friendly behavior, but analysts said Europeans were eager to forge commercial ties with Cuba, in part because they feared that if relations between Havana and Washington thawed, Americans would have an edge.
In addition to human rights issues, cables from Havana kept a close eye on Fidel Castro's deteriorating health. A March 2007 cable, signed by Mr. Farrar's predecessor, Michael E. Parmly, sought to debunk official claims of a ''Castro comeback'' after his long absence from the public stage.
Based on a report from an opposition figure, it said Mr. Castro became critically ill with a perforated intestine while on a plane in July 2006. His condition was complicated because he refused to have a colostomy. A Cuban doctor familiar with the case said that Mr. Castro could not be cured, and that he would ''progressively lose his faculties and become ever more debilitated until he dies.''
Nearly two years later, another cable reported the latest rumors of Mr. Castro's death. It concluded that his death would have little immediate effect. ''We do not believe the announcement of Fidel's death would spark either violent demonstrations or a quick surge in migration,'' it said.

HEADLINE: A BUDGET BATTLE LOOMS NEXT YEAR

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The collapse of a government-wide spending package in the final days of this Congressional session sets up a politically charged fiscal showdown early next year, testing the determination of Republicans about to take over the House with promises to slash an array of domestic programs.
As Congress struggled to assemble a stopgap measure to finance the government at least into the first months of 2011, House and Senate Republicans on Friday hailed their ability to derail a $1.2 trillion spending measure put forward by Senate Democrats, and promised to use their new Congressional muscle to respond to public demands to shrink government. 
''Beginning in January, the House is going to become the outpost in Washington for the American people and their desire for a smaller, less costly and more accountable government,'' said Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the incoming House speaker.
''I will tell you,'' he added, ''we are going to cut spending.''
With the lame-duck session entering its final days, there was an air of partisan chaos on Capitol Hill as both parties scored important legislative victories and events changed on an almost hour-to-hour basis as the end of Democratic control of the House approached.
Both President Obama and Congressional Republicans claimed credit for the package of tax cuts and unemployment pay the president signed into law Friday. Democrats also appeared poised to repeal the ban on gay and lesbian troops serving openly in the military, a long-sought goal of the party and its progressive constituency.
The House advanced a major Pentagon policy measure that had previously been tied up in the fight over the military's ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy. At the same time, a major immigration measure championed by Democrats and the White House seemed headed toward defeat as early as Saturday.
Republicans celebrated their blockade of the spending package, which Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, had to abandon after Republicans denied him the handful of votes from their side of the aisle that he was counting on to break a filibuster.
Republicans said their determination to kill the omnibus spending package even when top party lawmakers had inserted pet spending projects demonstrated that they were heeding the fervor of voters who were fed up with giant spending measures slipping through Congress in the final hours.
''The defeat of the omnibus should reassure every American that their voice is making a difference in Washington,'' said Senator Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican and an outspoken foe of increased federal spending.
But the collapse of the Senate measure, which like its House counterpart would have financed government agencies through the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, means Republicans could begin the new Congress with an immediate need to resolve the spending stalemate.
With the Senate making slow progress toward a stopgap measure, the House on Friday approved a plan to keep the government open through Tuesday and the Senate later followed suit to prevent a government shutdown after Saturday.
Aides said that behind closed doors, White House officials and some Democratic lawmakers were still trying to strike a deal to finance the government through September. But the officials said it was much more likely that government financing would be extended only into February or March.
Republicans say that timeline will allow them to quickly put their stamp on the budget for the current fiscal year, and Mr. Boehner and his leadership team have vowed to eliminate about $100 billion in spending out of about $400 billion in domestic programs.
Both sides say reaching that goal will mean very difficult choices and Democrats, promising to resist Republican efforts, say Republicans may find it easier to talk about cutting than actually doing it.
''They have been really good about talking about the need to cut this and cut that, but they are never specific,'' said Representative James P. McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts. ''I think it is going to be tough.''
The 2011 spending fight could be complicated by the need to raise the federal debt limit to avoid a federal default -- a vote that many new Republican lawmakers have indicated they would not make.
Republicans say the debt limit vote could also present an opportunity, allowing them to tie a package of spending reductions to the debt increase to make it more palatable.
Another complicating factor is that since Democrats retain control of the Senate, House Republicans must reconcile their spending proposals with those crafted by the Senate Appropriations Committee under the leadership of Senator Daniel K. Inouye, Democrat of Hawaii. Senator Inouye is unlikely to agree easily to Republican spending cuts, creating a climate for gridlock as the two parties face off.
On Friday, Mr. Inouye chastised Congress for jettisoning the spending package crafted by his committee, saying that simply extending current funding levels left the government on autopilot and could lead to disruptions. He said it also left too much discretion for determining spending priorities to the executive branch.
''And in two months we will find ourselves having to pass another 2,000-page bill that will cost more than $1 trillion or once again abdicate our authority to the Obama administration to determine how our taxpayer funds should be spent,'' he said.
Mr. Boehner has made changing the culture of the Appropriations Committee a top interest of the new Republican majority, pressing new leaders of the panel to turn it into a center for budget cutting and stocking it with a few anti-spending advocates.
On Friday, he indicated that he would prefer that Republicans next year break up the enormous spending package that died in the Senate and pass a dozen spending bills individually to allow for better scrutiny -- a process that could consume considerable time and subject the measures to multiple attacks on the floor.
''I do not believe that having 2,000-page bills on the House floor serves anyone's best interests, not the House, not for the members and certainly not for the American people,'' Mr. Boehner said.
Aides to Mr. Boehner later said the speaker-designate was referring to his desire to have an orderly appropriations process later in 2011 and was not referring to the spending package Republicans would have to quickly assemble in the opening weeks of the new Congress.
Lawmakers on both sides were running out of energy and patience as the session dragged on with no certain conclusion in sight. Even House Democrats who would be turning over control to Republicans seemed ready to call it quits.
''A lot of us just want to go home,'' said Representative John B. Larson of Connecticut, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus.

HEADLINE: A Milwaukee Bank Is Sold To BMO Financial of Canada

BYLINE: By CHRIS V. NICHOLSON

 BODY:
The BMO Financial Group, parent company of Bank of Montreal, said Friday that it had agreed to buyMarshall & Ilsley, a bank based in Milwaukee, for $4.1 billion - the latest acquisition of a troubled United States firm by an international bank. 
Canadian and other foreign banks have been a critical source of capital for United States lenders since the financial crisis.
The TD Bank Financial Group, which is based in Toronto, bought Commerce Bancorp of New Jersey for $8.6 billion in 2008, and this year picked up three failed banks in Florida. Foreign firms have accounted for nearly 37 percent of this year's bank acquisitions in the United States, according to Thomson Reuters.
''There are a number of smaller banks that are walking wounded,'' said David Cockfield, portfolio manager at MacNicol & Associates Asset Management in Toronto. ''All they need is an infusion of capital.''
BMO's bid represents a 34 percent premium to Marshall & Ilsley's $5.79 share price at Thursday's close.
On Friday, Marshall & Ilsley stock rose 18 percent to close at $6.85, while BMO dropped 6.5 percent to end at 58 Canadian dollars.
''The market is taking a negative view,'' said Mr. Cockfield. ''Canadian banks have not been that successful expanding south of the border, so there's a show-me attitude.''
The new capital helps Marshall & Ilsley. In November 2008, the bank received $1.7 billion as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. While some regional players have been paying back the money, Marshall & Ilsley has been struggling financially. In the third quarter, the firm reported a $169.2 million loss, a moderate improvement over a $248.4 million loss in the period a year earlier.
BMO plans to pay off Marshall's TARP cash in full before the acquisition closes. The deal is expected to close before the end of July 2011.
''This transaction is good news,'' Mark Furlong, chief executive of Marshall & Ilsley, said in a statement. ''It will position us with the capital strength and scale to enhance our commitment to customers and communities.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Grandfather's Legacy

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
BRUCE HAYNES was never told much about his grandfather George Edmund Haynes, who died in 1960, 10 months before he was born.
''When I was growing up, my father rarely spoke about Pop Haynes or even about his own childhood,'' recalled Dr. Haynes, who was raised in Harlem. ''The subject brought up too many hurts and resentments that he still held tight.''
But hidden in the attic of the Haynes family home on Convent Avenue was a weighty portrait of George Haynes, painted by Laura Wheeler Waring, a Harlem Renaissance artist. It sat untouched until 1995, when Dr. Haynes's father was dying. 
''He passed it on to me like a torch that I had finally earned the right to carry,'' Dr. Haynes recalled recently. ''My father's parting gift set me on a quest to learn more about George Haynes.''
Dr. Haynes knew that his grandfather had been involved with the National Urban League, the venerable civil rights organization that is celebrating its centennial this year. But, in fact, he soon realized that George Haynes was one of the league's founders and its first executive director. And his grandfather had also been a prominent scholar in fields in which blacks were largely invisible.
''My grandfather, a black migrant from Pine Bluff, Ark., and Mrs. Ruth Standish Baldwin, a white philanthropist and social activist, stepped across the color line to challenge the status quo for Negro workers,'' Dr. Haynes said. Mrs. Baldwin worked with George Haynes to start the league.
''Many political and business leaders of the day focused on rural solutions, such as agricultural training, to alleviate the labor problems of blacks,'' Dr. Haynes said, ''but Haynes understood that the movement of blacks away from the farm was more than a temporary phenomenon and that economic empowerment in the industrial labor force was the key to their future success.''
The National Urban League, headquartered in New York and with affiliates in 36 states, works to provide direct services and conduct research and advocacy ''to provide economic empowerment, educational opportunities and the guarantee of civil rights for African Americans.''
''I had majored in sociology,'' Dr. Haynes said, ''without even knowing that my grandfather had been one of the first black urban sociologists in the country and the first Negro to serve in a sub-cabinet post.'' (George Haynes directed the Division of Negro Economics in the United States Department of Labor from 1918 to 1921, Dr. Haynes said in an e-mail.) He added, ''I was amazed to discover that he had written about race relations and cities.''
In 2001, after receiving a doctorate from the City University of New York and working as an assistant professor of sociology and African-American studies at Yale University, Dr. Haynes, along with his wife, Syma Solovitch, a former public school teacher in Harlem, moved to California, where he is an associate sociology professor at the University of California at Davis. Dr. Haynes, with his wife, is writing a book about his grandfather.
''I learned that Haynes had been a protege of W. E. B. Du Bois, who used to visit our house,'' he said, adding: ''He was also the first prominent black labor economist and one of the first black urban sociologists in the country. I learned that he was the first scholar to examine the Great Migration in sociological terms and to predict the flood of Southern Negro migrants to the urban North, and that he founded the Social Sciences Department at Fisk University.''
George Haynes was born in Arkansas in 1881, but spent most of his adult life in New York. In his doctoral dissertation at Columbia University, he wrote that the plight of blacks in the city in 1912 was similar to that of other rural migrants, but that it was ''made more acute'' because blacks had greater handicaps because of their ''previous condition of servitude'' and ''the prejudiced opposition of the white world.'' He was also heavily involved in the Harlem Renaissance, helping to connect black artists and writers to important benefactors.
As a trustee of the State University of New York and later when he was teaching at City College, George Haynes championed higher education for working people -- ''making a life is even more important than making a living,'' he once wrote -- and also warned that in a world that was predominantly composed of people of color, Americans might be jeopardizing their own democracy because of prejudice.
Bruce Haynes said his grandfather had become a footnote to the very institution he helped create. ''I hope to restore George Haynes to his rightful place in history,'' he said.

HEADLINE: 9/11 Health Bill Wins Support From G.O.P.

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand said Saturday that she and other sponsors of a stalled 9/11 health bill had won new Republican support for the measure and intended to try again to pass it before the end of the 111th Congress. 
Following the Senate's vote to repeal the ban on gays serving in the military, Ms. Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, said Democrats intended to resurrect the health initiative in the coming days after falling three votes short of breaking a filibuster against it earlier this month.
''We have the votes we need,'' Ms. Gillibrand said. ''We have indications from several Republicans that they very much want to vote for this bill.''
The $7.4 billion measure is intended to provide medical care to workers and others who had become ill as a result of being exposed to toxic debris and fumes at the site of the World Trade Center attack in 2001.
Republicans have raised concerns about how to pay for the program, and Ms. Gillibrand said the bill's authors have identified ways to cover the costs through new federal fees that are acceptable to enough Republicans to advance the measure. It stalled on a party line vote of 57 to 42 when 60 votes were required.
She said the Senate could consider the measure after it concludes debate over a nuclear weapons treaty. But with Congress trying to adjourn before Christmas, time is running short, and it is unclear how many additional bills can reach the floor. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, has indicated that he is open to allowing another vote on the health plan before Congress adjourns.
The bill, formally known as the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, calls for providing $3.2 billion over the next eight years to monitor and treat injuries stemming from exposure to toxic dust and debris at ground zero. New York City would pay 10 percent of those health costs. The bill would also set aside $4.2 billion to reopen the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund to provide payments for job and economic losses.

HEADLINE: LETTER; Networker On a Mission

 BODY:
Most political activism requires some simplification of the issues to garner public support. The question is whether John Prendergast's simplifications undermine the causes to which he is dedicated. I think they do. They understatethe scale of the interventions neededto effect change, even as they exaggerate the potential of American clout, and they understate the complexity of the problems facing these countries, which can lead him to champion potentially disastrous ideas. Underlying these simplifications is a deeply American faith in our own capacity -- for doing good, for getting things done -- a faith that Hollywood has always been happy to indulge. I wish that Prendergast would focus more on the capacity of local people, many of whom are working at extraordinary personal risk to bring peace to their lands. The question shouldn't be ''What can we do to end the suffering in these countries?'' but rather ''What can we do to help people within their societies overcome the enormous political and economic challenges they face?'' The difference is all in where you place the emphasis.

HEADLINE: Reasons to Smile (for Now)

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
EVEN some market bears are no longer sounding entirely gloomy.
Consider David Rosenberg. Now based in Toronto with Gluskin, Sheff and formerly an economist at Merrill Lynch in New York, he was an outspoken critic of Wall Street's excesses in the years leading to the 2008 financial crisis. Mr. Rosenberg still has many cogent reasons for worrying about the markets and the economy.
Among them, he cites the mounting United States debt burden, cutbacks by local and state governments, the protracted European debt crisis, a Federal Reserve monetary policy he considers overly expansive, and the prospect of currency wars and incipient inflation in China. And that's just a start. 
He says he believes that the stock market will retrench eventually, contending that we are in a long-term, or secular, bear market.
Nonetheless, he wrote last week in a newsletter that ''for now, the equity markets are clearly enjoying a Santa rally.'' And, in an interview, he said that for the short term, investors who are ''overwhelmingly exuberant'' are propelling a cyclical bull market.
They certainly are. The tax package enacted last week in Washington is enhancing the festive mood, which has sent the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to its highest levels since late 2008, before Lehman Brothers' collapse. For the year so far, the index has risen 11.6 percent, and the S.& P. 600, which tracks small-cap stocks, is up 24.8 percent. In December alone, both indexes are up more than 5 percent.
The tax package, which contains a grab-bag of provisions including an extension of Bush-era cuts for all taxpayers, has helped fuel the markets for two apparent reasons. First, in addition to the income tax cut and a patch that will prevent the alternative minimum tax from ensnaring an additional 21 million taxpayers, it contains features that are directly beneficial to investors and businesses. It will, for example, extend the 15 percent rate on capital gains and dividends, which was due to expire at the end of this month, and would let businesses accelerate depreciation of capital expenditures.
It also contains other provisions that should have a directly stimulative effect on the economy: extending jobless benefits to the long-term unemployed, and cutting the 6.2 percent Social Security payroll tax, producing net savings of up to $2,136 for a worker next year.
While the extension of the Bush-era tax cuts was widely anticipated, the payroll tax cut was not. For example, Ray Fair, the Yale economist whose econometric models have predicted strong growth in 2011 and 2012, did not include the effects of that payroll cut in his calculations. Nor were they factored into his prediction of a consequent Obama election victory -- a forecast I described in a recent column.
Without factoring in the payroll tax cut, the model forecasts real annualized growth in gross domestic product of 3.69 percent for the first three quarters of 2012. ''As it's turned out, the actual tax package would make the outcome marginally more bullish, and marginally better for Obama,'' he says.
If bears like Mr. Rosenberg are acknowledging a certain zing in the markets now, many of those who started out with a more bullish disposition are now positively buoyant. In fact, for Wall Street forecasters as a group, the tax package, on top of the Republicans' midterm election victory and the Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary policy, has helped to produce quite sunny forecasts.
A Bloomberg survey last week of strategists at major Wall Street brokerage firms found an average year-end 2011 prediction of 1,379 for the S.& P. 500. That would be a gain of nearly 11 percent, not including dividends. The consensus called for earnings per share of $92, versus less than $80 a share now.
Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at BlackRock, the big asset management firm, said last week that he ''hasn't yet firmed up an S.& P. number for 2011,'' but that it was likely to be in the consensus range, perhaps about 1,350, ''with the risks more to the upside than the downside'' -- the reverse of this year's situation. In other words, despite the risk of continuing financial crises in Europe and the probability of volatile markets for some time, he thinks it's more likely that the S.& P. will end 2011 above 1,350 than lower.
A year ago, the economy was still staggering from a credit shock, he says, and Washington policy wasn't friendly to capital markets. Now, by contrast, he says, the political climate has shifted and corporate America has vastly ''increased amounts of cash on its balance sheets and free cash flow in its income statements.'' In addition, he says, investor confidence levels ''are slowly and surely improving.''
In his view, the stock market is likely to rise along with corporate earnings, but may climb even faster if improved investor sentiment leads to higher valuations. Furthermore, he says, corporate America can use its cash hoard in ways that benefit investors: by returning cash through buybacks and higher dividends and by ''actually hiring some more useful workers, and by making productive capital investments.''
ETHAN HARRIS, chief North American economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, likewise says that the tax package has helped make him cautiously upbeat for the short term. But over the longer haul, he says, ''the big downside in all of this is that it's clear there really is no plan in Washington for dealing with the budget deficit.''
''There is no immediate crisis but we are playing with fire,'' he adds.
For his part, Mr. Rosenberg is projecting a moderate market correction, with a 2011 year-end target for the S.& P. 500 of 1,100 to 1,200. And he says that because the economy is still shaky, it's premature to declare the long-running bond rally over.
He favors defensive, classic hedging strategies. Eventually, there will be a deeper decline in the stock market, he says, but perhaps not yet. There may be too much enthusiasm at the moment.

Re ''Lee Accepts Late Bid by Phillies,'' Dec. 14: As a Yankees fan living in Philadelphia, I can see some good news in this signing: the Phillies faithful will no longer be able to whine about how the Yankees buy their way to World Series titles. 
The Phillies have just done exactly that, and anything less than the title would have to be regarded as a major disappointment and an economic miscalculation. John Culhane

People are surprised that Cliff Lee took less money to sign with the Phillies. When you are saying $50,000 is substantially less than $100,000, that is meaningful. But $140 million is really no different to a person's life than $120 million unless we are distributing the money to the unemployed.

HEADLINE: A PHYSICIST SOLVES THE CITY

BYLINE: By JONAH LEHRER

 BODY:
Geoffrey West doesn't eat lunch. His doctor says he has a mild allergy to food; meals make him sleepy and nauseated. When West is working -- when he's staring at some scribbled equations on scratch paper or gazing out his office window at the high desert in New Mexico -- he subsists on black tea and nuts. His gray hair is tousled, and his beard has the longish look of neglect. It's clear that West regards the mundane needs of everyday life -- trimming the whiskers, say -- as little more than a set of annoying distractions, drawing him away from a much more interesting set of problems. Sometimes West can seem jealous of his computer, this silent machine with no hungers or moods. All it needs is a power cord.
For West, the world is always most compelling at its most abstract. As a theoretical physicist in search of fundamental laws, he likes to compare his work to that of Kepler, Galileo and Newton. ''I've always wanted to find the rules that govern everything,'' he says. ''It's amazing that such rules exist. It's even more amazing that we can find them.'' 
But the 70-year-old West, who grew up in Somerset, England, is no longer trying to solve the physical universe; he's not interested in deep space or string theory. Although West worked for decades as a physicist at Stanford University and Los Alamos National Laboratory, he started thinking about leaving the field after the financing for the Texas superconducting supercollider was canceled by Congress in 1993. West, however, wasn't ready to retire, and so he began searching for subjects that needed his skill set.
Eventually he settled on cities: the urban jungle looked chaotic -- all those taxi horns and traffic jams -- but perhaps it might be found to obey a short list of universal rules. ''We spend all this time thinking about cities in terms of their local details, their restaurants and museums and weather,'' West says. ''I had this hunch that there was something more, that every city was also shaped by a set of hidden laws.''
And so West set out to solve the City. As he points out, this is an intellectual problem with immense practical implications. Urban population growth is the great theme of modern life, one that's unfolding all across the world, from the factory boomtowns of Southern China to the sprawling favelas of Rio de Janeiro. As a result, for the first time in history, the majority of human beings live in urban areas. (The numbers of city dwellers are far higher in developed countries -- the United States, for instance, is 82 percent urbanized.) Furthermore, the pace of urbanization is accelerating as people all over the world flee the countryside and flock to the crowded street.
This relentless urban growth has led to a renewed interest in cities in academia and in government. In February 2009, President Obama established the first White House Office of Urban Affairs, which has been told to develop a ''policy agenda for urban America.'' Meanwhile, new perspectives have come to the field of urban studies. Macroeconomists, for instance, have focused on the role of cities in driving gross domestic product and improving living standards, while psychologists have investigated the impact of city life on self-control and short-term memory. Even architects are moving into the area: Rem Koolhaas, for one, has argued that architects have become so obsessed with pretty buildings that they've neglected the vital spaces between them.
But West wasn't satisfied with any of these approaches. He didn't want to be constrained by the old methods of social science, and he had little patience for the unconstrained speculations of architects. (West considers urban theory to be a field without principles, comparing it to physics before Kepler pioneered the laws of planetary motion in the 17th century.) Instead, West wanted to begin with a blank page, to study cities as if they had never been studied before. He was tired of urban theory -- he wanted to invent urban science.
For West, this first meant trying to gather as much urban data as possible. Along with Luis Bettencourt, another theoretical physicist who had abandoned conventional physics, and a team of disparate researchers, West began scouring libraries and government Web sites for relevant statistics. The scientists downloaded huge files from the Census Bureau, learned about the intricacies of German infrastructure and bought a thick and expensive almanac featuring the provincial cities of China. (Unfortunately, the book was in Mandarin.) They looked at a dizzying array of variables, from the total amount of electrical wire in Frankfurt to the number of college graduates in Boise. They amassed stats on gas stations and personal income, flu outbreaks and homicides, coffee shops and the walking speed of pedestrians.
After two years of analysis, West and Bettencourt discovered that all of these urban variables could be described by a few exquisitely simple equations. For example, if they know the population of a metropolitan area in a given country, they can estimate, with approximately 85 percent accuracy, its average income and the dimensions of its sewer system. These are the laws, they say, that automatically emerge whenever people ''agglomerate,'' cramming themselves into apartment buildings and subway cars. It doesn't matter if the place is Manhattan or Manhattan, Kan.: the urban patterns remain the same. West isn't shy about describing the magnitude of this accomplishment. ''What we found are the constants that describe every city,'' he says. ''I can take these laws and make precise predictions about the number of violent crimes and the surface area of roads in a city in Japan with 200,000 people. I don't know anything about this city or even where it is or its history, but I can tell you all about it. And the reason I can do that is because every city is really the same.'' After a pause, as if reflecting on his hyperbole, West adds: ''Look, we all know that every city is unique. That's all we talk about when we talk about cities, those things that make New York different from L.A., or Tokyo different from Albuquerque. But focusing on those differences misses the point. Sure, there are differences, but different from what? We've found the what.''
There is something deeply strange about thinking of the metropolis in such abstract terms. We usually describe cities, after all, as local entities defined by geography and history. New Orleans isn't a generic place of 336,644 people. It's the bayou and Katrina and Cajun cuisine. New York isn't just another city. It's a former Dutch fur-trading settlement, the center of the finance industry and home to the Yankees. And yet, West insists, those facts are mere details, interesting anecdotes that don't explain very much. The only way to really understand the city, West says, is to understand its deep structure, its defining patterns, which will show us whether a metropolis will flourish or fall apart. We can't make our cities work better until we know how they work. And, West says, he knows how they work.
West has been drawn to different fields before. In 1997, less than five years after he transitioned away from high-energy physics, he published one of the most contentious and influential papers in modern biology. (The research, which appeared in Science, has been cited more than 1,500 times.) The last line of the paper summarizes the sweep of its ambition, as West and his co-authors assert that they have just solved ''the single most pervasive theme underlying all biological diversity,'' showing how the most vital facts about animals -- heart rate, size, caloric needs -- are interrelated in unexpected ways.
The mathematical equations that West and his colleagues devised were inspired by the earlier findings of Max Kleiber. In the early 1930s, when Kleiber was a biologist working in the animal-husbandry department at the University of California, Davis, he noticed that the sprawlingly diverse animal kingdom could be characterized by a simple mathematical relationship, in which the metabolic rate of a creature is equal to its mass taken to the three-fourths power. This ubiquitous principle had some significant implications, because it showed that larger species need less energy per pound of flesh than smaller ones. For instance, while an elephant is 10,000 times the size of a guinea pig, it needs only 1,000 times as much energy. Other scientists soon found more than 70 such related laws, defined by what are known as ''sublinear'' equations. It doesn't matter what the animal looks like or where it lives or how it evolved -- the math almost always works.
West's insight was that these strange patterns are caused by our internal infrastructure -- the plumbing that makes life possible. By translating these biological designs into mathematics, West and his co-authors were able to explain the existence of Kleiber's scaling laws. ''I can't tell you how satisfying this was,'' West says. ''Sometimes, I look out at nature and I think, Everything here is obeying my conjecture. It's a wonderfully narcissistic feeling.''
Not every biologist was persuaded, however. In fact, West's paper in Science ignited a flurry of rebuttals, in which researchers pointed out all the species that violated the math. West can barely hide his impatience with what he regards as quibbles. ''There are always going to be people who say, 'What about the crayfish?' '' he says. ''Well, what about it? Every fundamental law has exceptions. But you still need the law or else all you have is observations that don't make sense. And that's not science. That's just taking notes.'' For West, arguments over the details of crustaceans were a sure sign that it was time to move on. And so, in 2002, he began to think seriously about cities.
The correspondence was obvious to West: he saw the metropolis as a sprawling organism, similarly defined by its infrastructure. (The boulevard was like a blood vessel, the back alley a capillary.) This implied that the real purpose of cities, and the reason cities keep on growing, is their ability to create massive economies of scale, just as big animals do. After analyzing the first sets of city data -- the physicists began with infrastructure and consumption statistics -- they concluded that cities looked a lot like elephants. In city after city, the indicators of urban ''metabolism,'' like the number of gas stations or the total surface area of roads, showed that when a city doubles in size, it requires an increase in resources of only 85 percent.
This straightforward observation has some surprising implications. It suggests, for instance, that modern cities are the real centers of sustainability. According to the data, people who live in densely populated places require less heat in the winter and need fewer miles of asphalt per capita. (A recent analysis by economists at Harvard and U.C.L.A. demonstrated that the average Manhattanite emits 14,127 fewer pounds of carbon dioxide annually than someone living in the New York suburbs.) Small communities might look green, but they consume a disproportionate amount of everything. As a result, West argues, creating a more sustainable society will require our big cities to get even bigger. We need more megalopolises.
But a city is not just a frugal elephant; biological equations can't entirely explain the growth of urban areas. While the first settlements in Mesopotamia might have helped people conserve scarce resources -- irrigation networks meant more water for everyone -- the concept of the city spread for an entirely different reason. ''In retrospect, I was quite stupid,'' West says. He was so excited by the parallels between cities and living things that he ''didn't pay enough attention to the ways in which urban areas and organisms are completely different.''
What Bettencourt and West failed to appreciate, at least at first, was that the value of modern cities has little to do with energy efficiency. As West puts it, ''Nobody moves to New York to save money on their gas bill.'' Why, then, do we put up with the indignities of the city? Why do we accept the failing schools and overpriced apartments, the bedbugs and the traffic?
In essence, they arrive at the sensible conclusion that cities are valuable because they facilitate human interactions, as people crammed into a few square miles exchange ideas and start collaborations. ''If you ask people why they move to the city, they always give the same reasons,'' West says. ''They've come to get a job or follow their friends or to be at the center of a scene. That's why we pay the high rent. Cities are all about the people, not the infrastructure.''
It's when West switches the conversation from infrastructure to people that he brings up the work of Jane Jacobs, the urban activist and author of ''The Death and Life of Great American Cities.'' Jacobs was a fierce advocate for the preservation of small-scale neighborhoods, like Greenwich Village and the North End in Boston. The value of such urban areas, she said, is that they facilitate the free flow of information between city dwellers. To illustrate her point, Jacobs described her local stretch of Hudson Street in the Village. She compared the crowded sidewalk to a spontaneous ''ballet,'' filled with people from different walks of life. School kids on the stoops, gossiping homemakers, ''business lunchers'' on their way back to the office. While urban planners had long derided such neighborhoods for their inefficiencies -- that's why Robert Moses, the ''master builder'' of New York, wanted to build an eight-lane elevated highway through SoHo and the Village -- Jacobs insisted that these casual exchanges were essential. She saw the city not as a mass of buildings but rather as a vessel of empty spaces, in which people interacted with other people. The city wasn't a skyline -- it was a dance.
If West's basic idea was familiar, however, the evidence he provided for it was anything but. The challenge for Bettencourt and West was finding a way to quantify urban interactions. As usual, they began with reams of statistics. The first data set they analyzed was on the economic productivity of American cities, and it quickly became clear that their working hypothesis -- like elephants, cities become more efficient as they get bigger -- was profoundly incomplete. According to the data, whenever a city doubles in size, every measure of economic activity, from construction spending to the amount of bank deposits, increases by approximately 15 percent per capita. It doesn't matter how big the city is; the law remains the same. ''This remarkable equation is why people move to the big city,'' West says. ''Because you can take the same person, and if you just move them to a city that's twice as big, then all of a sudden they'll do 15 percent more of everything that we can measure.'' While Jacobs could only speculate on the value of our urban interactions, West insists that he has found a way to ''scientifically confirm'' her conjectures. ''One of my favorite compliments is when people come up to me and say, 'You have done what Jane Jacobs would have done, if only she could do mathematics,' '' West says. ''What the data clearly shows, and what she was clever enough to anticipate, is that when people come together, they become much more productive.''
West illustrates the same concept by describing the Santa Fe Institute, an interdisciplinary research organization, where he and Bettencourt work. The institute itself is a sprawl of common areas, old couches and tiny offices; the coffee room is always the most crowded place. ''S.F.I. is all about the chance encounters,'' West says. ''There are few planned meetings, just lots of unplanned conversations. It's like a little city that way.'' The previous evening, West and I ran into the novelist Cormac McCarthy at the institute, where McCarthy often works. The physicist and the novelist ended up talking about Antarctic icefish, the editing process and convergent evolution for 45 minutes.Of course, these interpersonal collisions -- the human friction of a crowded space -- can also feel unpleasant. We don't always want to talk with strangers on the subway or jostle with people on the sidewalk. West admits that all successful cities are a little uncomfortable. He describes the purpose of urban planning as finding a way to minimize our distress while maximizing our interactions. The residents of Hudson Street, after all, didn't seem to mind mingling with one another on the sidewalk. As Jacobs pointed out, the layout of her Manhattan neighborhood -- the short blocks, the mixed-use zoning, the density of brownstones -- made it easier to cope with the strain of the metropolis. It's fitting that it's called the Village.
In recent decades, though, many of the fastest-growing cities in America, like Phoenix and Riverside, Calif., have given us a very different urban model. These places have traded away public spaces for affordable single-family homes, attracting working-class families who want their own white picket fences. West and Bettencourt point out, however, that cheap suburban comforts are associated with poor performance on a variety of urban metrics. Phoenix, for instance, has been characterized by below-average levels of income and innovation (as measured by the production of patents) for the last 40 years. ''When you look at some of these fast-growing cities, they look like tumors on the landscape,'' West says, with typical bombast. ''They have these extreme levels of growth, but it's not sustainable growth.'' According to the physicists, the trade-off is inevitable. The same sidewalks that lead to ''knowledge trading'' also lead to cockroaches.
Consider the data: When Bettencourt and West analyzed the negative variables of urban life, like crime and disease, they discovered that the exact same mathematical equation applied. After a city doubles in size, it also experiences a 15 percent per capita increase in violent crimes, traffic and AIDS cases. (Of course, these trends are only true in general. Some cities can bend the equations with additional cops or strict pollution regulations.) ''What this tells you is that you can't get the economic growth without a parallel growth in the spread of things we don't want,'' Bettencourt says. ''When you double the population, everything that's related to the social network goes up by the same percentage.''
West and Bettencourt refer to this phenomenon as ''superlinear scaling,'' which is a fancy way of describing the increased output of people living in big cities. When a superlinear equation is graphed, it looks like the start of a roller coaster, climbing into the sky. The steep slope emerges from the positive feedback loop of urban life -- a growing city makes everyone in that city more productive, which encourages more people to move to the city, and so on. According to West, these superlinear patterns demonstrate why cities are one of the single most important inventions in human history. They are the idea, he says, that enabled our economic potential and unleashed our ingenuity. ''When we started living in cities, we did something that had never happened before in the history of life,'' West says. ''We broke away from the equations of biology, all of which are sublinear. Every other creature gets slower as it gets bigger. That's why the elephant plods along. But in cities, the opposite happens. As cities get bigger, everything starts accelerating. There is no equivalent for this in nature. It would be like finding an elephant that's proportionally faster than a mouse.''
There is, of course, a very good reason that animals slow down with size: All that mass requires energy. Because the elephant has to eat so much to feed itself, it can't afford to run around like a little rodent. But the superlinear growth of cities comes with no such inherent constraints. Instead, the urban equations predict a world of ever-increasing resource consumption, as the expansion of cities fuels the expansion of economies. In fact, the societal consumption driven by the process of urbanization -- our collective desire for iPads, Frappuccinos and the latest fashions -- more than outweighs the ecological benefits of local mass transit.
West illustrates the problem by translating human life into watts. ''A human being at rest runs on 90 watts,'' he says. ''That's how much power you need just to lie down. And if you're a hunter-gatherer and you live in the Amazon, you'll need about 250 watts. That's how much energy it takes to run about and find food. So how much energy does our lifestyle [in America] require? Well, when you add up all our calories and then you add up the energy needed to run the computer and the air-conditioner, you get an incredibly large number, somewhere around 11,000 watts. Now you can ask yourself: What kind of animal requires 11,000 watts to live? And what you find is that we have created a lifestyle where we need more watts than a blue whale. We require more energy than the biggest animal that has ever existed. That is why our lifestyle is unsustainable. We can't have seven billion blue whales on this planet. It's not even clear that we can afford to have 300 million blue whales.''
The historian Lewis Mumford described the rise of the megalopolis as ''the last stage in the classical cycle of civilization,'' which would end with ''complete disruption and downfall.'' In his more pessimistic moods, West seems to agree: he knows that nothing can trend upward forever. In fact, West sees human history as defined by this constant tension between expansion and scarcity, between the relentless growth made possible by cities and the limited resources that hold our growth back. ''The only thing that stops the superlinear equations is when we run out of something we need,'' West says. ''And so the growth slows down. If nothing else changes, the system will eventually start to collapse.''
How do we avoid this bleak fate? Constant innovation. After a resource is exhausted, we are forced to exploit a new resource, if only to sustain our superlinear growth. West cites a long list of breakthroughs to illustrate this historical pattern, from the discovery of the steam engine to the invention of the Internet. ''These major innovations completely changed the way society operates,'' West says. ''It's like we're on the edge of a cliff, about to run out of something, and then we find a new way of creating wealth. That means we can start to climb again.''
But the escape is only temporary, as every innovation eventually leads to new shortages. We clear-cut forests, and so we turn to oil; once we exhaust our fossil-fuel reserves, we'll start driving electric cars, at least until we run out of lithium. This helps explain why West describes cities as the only solution to the problem of cities. Although urbanization has generated a seemingly impossible amount of economic growth, it has also inspired the innovations that allow the growth to continue.
There is a serious complication to this triumphant narrative of cliff edges and creativity, however. Because our lifestyle has become so expensive to maintain, every new resource now becomes exhausted at a faster rate. This means that the cycle of innovations has to constantly accelerate, with each breakthrough providing a shorter reprieve. The end result is that cities aren't just increasing the pace of life; they are also increasing the pace at which life changes. ''It's like being on a treadmill that keeps on getting faster,'' West says. ''We used to get a big revolution every few thousand years. And then it took us a century to go from the steam engine to the internal-combustion engine. Now we're down to about 15 years between big innovations. What this means is that, for the first time ever, people are living through multiple revolutions. And this all comes from cities. Once we started to urbanize, we put ourselves on this treadmill. We traded away stability for growth. And growth requires change.''
While listening to West talk about cities, it's easy to forget that his confident pronouncements are mere correlations, and that his statistics can only hint at possible explanations. Not surprisingly, many urban theorists disagree with West's conclusions. Some resent the implication that future urban research should revolve around a few abstract mathematical laws. Other theorists, like Joel Kotkin, a fellow in urban futures at Chapman University, in Orange, Calif., argue that the working model of Bettencourt and West is already obsolete and fails to explain recent trends. ''In the last decade, suburbs have produced six times as many jobs,'' Kotkin says. And these aren't just unskilled service jobs. Kotkin says the centers of American innovation are now low-density metropolitan areas like Silicon Valley and Raleigh-Durham, N.C. ''For a supposedly complete theory'' of cities, Kotkin says, ''this work fails to explain a lot of what's happening right now.''
The theoretical physicists aren't discouraged by these critiques. While they admit their equations are imperfect, they insist the work remains a necessary first draft. ''When Kepler found the laws that govern planetary motion, he didn't get the laws exactly right,'' West says. ''But the laws were still good enough to inspire Newton.'' In the meantime, West and Bettencourt continue to search for new statistics (they have just received a data set from the I.R.S.) that they hope to feed back into the model. Nevertheless, West says they believe that their essential theory -- those superlinear and sublinear laws -- will remain intact. The math is scientifically sound.
In fact, West is so satisfied with his urban research that he's already becoming a little restless. Recently, he and Bettencourt, led by this impatience, began exploring yet another subject: the corporation. At first glance, cities and companies look very similar. They're both large agglomerations of people, interacting in a well-defined physical space. They contain infrastructure and human capital; the mayor is like a C.E.O.
But it turns out that cities and companies differ in a very fundamental regard: cities almost never die, while companies are extremely ephemeral. As West notes, Hurricane Katrina couldn't wipe out New Orleans, and a nuclear bomb did not erase Hiroshima from the map. In contrast, where are Pan Am and Enron today? The modern corporation has an average life span of 40 to 50 years.
This raises the obvious question: Why are corporations so fleeting? After buying data on more than 23,000 publicly traded companies, Bettencourt and West discovered that corporate productivity, unlike urban productivity, was entirely sublinear. As the number of employees grows, the amount of profit per employee shrinks. West gets giddy when he shows me the linear regression charts. ''Look at this bloody plot,'' he says. ''It's ridiculous how well the points line up.'' The graph reflects the bleak reality of corporate growth, in which efficiencies of scale are almost always outweighed by the burdens of bureaucracy. ''When a company starts out, it's all about the new idea,'' West says. ''And then, if the company gets lucky, the idea takes off. Everybody is happy and rich. But then management starts worrying about the bottom line, and so all these people are hired to keep track of the paper clips. This is the beginning of the end.''
The danger, West says, is that the inevitable decline in profit per employee makes large companies increasingly vulnerable to market volatility. Since the company now has to support an expensive staff -- overhead costs increase with size -- even a minor disturbance can lead to significant losses. As West puts it, ''Companies are killed by their need to keep on getting bigger.''
For West, the impermanence of the corporation illuminates the real strength of the metropolis. Unlike companies, which are managed in a top-down fashion by a team of highly paid executives, cities are unruly places, largely immune to the desires of politicians and planners. ''Think about how powerless a mayor is,'' West says. ''They can't tell people where to live or what to do or who to talk to. Cities can't be managed, and that's what keeps them so vibrant. They're just these insane masses of people, bumping into each other and maybe sharing an idea or two. It's the freedom of the city that keeps it alive.''

HEADLINE: Junkyard Architecture

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
THE economic downturn and a shift to recycled and repurposed material have brought out the creative side of architects and builders.
How about a bay window made of an old truck body, or a closet made of red wine barrels? Or even a home framed in steel from melted-down submarines. That time may be fast approaching.
At 25 Carroll Street, an industrial building converted to 17 condominiums in the Columbia Street waterfront area of Brooklyn, the developer Alex Barrett of Barrett Design and Development lowered two shipping containers onto the rooftop in October to serve as a bulkhead housing a stairway, an elevator shaft and mechanical space. 
Mr. Barrett said the idea had come to him as he had gazed from 25 Carroll's rooftop over a shipyard full of hundreds of such containers just 200 feet away.
''As long as we're importing more goods than we're exporting,'' he said, ''we always have a net surplus of these giant steel boxes. They're wonderful little pieces of engineering, but just because of the laws of supply and demand, they're practically worthless in this country. So the opportunities to reuse them are great.''
The shipping containers provide access to 25 Carroll's rooftop. The building, which went on the market in October, received offers on all its units in five days; the last contract was signed Nov. 23, Mr. Barrett said. The units sold for $550 to $730 a square foot, depending on the floor and the views; they range in size from 800 to almost 2,000 square feet.
Mr. Barrett installed the shipping containers in a matter of minutes, then added insulation, drywall, and lighting and electrical. He said that he wasn't certain how much of a cost savings he had achieved but that he had saved time.
''We could have made the bulkhead out of any number of different types of construction -- masonry, steel framing, wood,'' he said. ''That would probably be two to three weeks of work. This took an hour and a half.'' The containers cost him about $2,400 each.
He has also turned timbers removed in the building's conversion into furniture for common areas. He used old pipe and rail fittings for bathroom fixtures like towel bars.
Mr. Barrett said he first encountered shipping containers as architectural elements in 2004, when he worked for Urban Space Management, a company specializing in urban renewal, with offices in New York and London.
''There's not yet a container city in New York -- but there will be,'' said Eldon Scott, the president of Urban Space Management, which is working with the architecture firms Young Woo & Associatesand LOT-EK on a restoration of the city's Pier 57 off West 15th Street, which will be a nearly 300,000-square-foot structure composed largely of hundreds of shipping containers.
Giuseppe Lignano, a partner in LOT-EK, said that while most green architecture focused on energy conservation and resource consumption, his firm centered on sustainability at the physical level, using salvaged objects.
LOT-EK has drawn attention for repurposing truck bodies in its buildings. The Weiner Residence at 297 West Fourth Street in Greenwich Village, originally a town house built around the turn of the 20th century, was renovated using parts from commercial trucks. Bay windows protruding from the brick facade are inside the steel frames of truck bodies, which help to create a bench, a conference nook and a bed platform. Even the penthouse is made of truck parts.
''These pre-existing objects are just like any other type of prefabricated object in a way,'' Mr. Lignano said, ''so it's just the provenance that is a little bit different.''
Over the past 17 years, LOT-EK has designed buildings that incorporate jet fuselages, oil tankers and water tanks among other items, but until now the economy has not been particularly ripe for their construction. Mr. Lignano says he believes that is changing.
''We're talking with a bunch of residential property developers'' in New York, he said. ''This economy is forcing everybody to be smarter and more reasonable with their budgets, while at the same time still producing high design.''
Mr. Lignano said residential developments with salvaged items often took their cue from more experimental institutional or commercial projects. One example might be the Southern California Gas Company Energy Resource Center in Los Angeles, which used steel from a retired submarine in its frame and recycled newspapers in wall paneling.
Ole Sondresen of Ole Sondresen Architect used Southern yellow pine salvaged from a renovated SoHo building in paneling and tables in the Bird fashion boutique in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. He also used it in an apartment renovated by his firm on Laight Street in TriBeCa -- in paneling, shelving and an entire kitchen pantry.
At a bar and flower shop in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn, called Sycamore Mr. Sondresen crushed wine bottles and poured resin over the glass in a wood frame to create a terrazzolike countertop, lighted from below to dramatic effect. ''This would make a fantastic application for residences as well,'' he said.

HEADLINE: THE NEEDIEST CASES; When Children Are Caught in the Cycle of Poverty

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MASCIA

 BODY:
The economic collapse has taken a toll on vast segments of society, but it has affected some groups disproportionately. Among those are children.
The Institute for Children, Poverty and Homelessness reports that nationwide, 1.35 million children are homeless. Most of them are black or Latino. Children make up a quarter of the nation's population, but account for 36 percent of all people in poverty, according to a report from the National Center for Children in Poverty, at Columbia University. 
In New York City, 30 percent of children are living in poverty. One out of every five children relies on local food banks or pantries for sustenance, and of these children, 79 percent rely on the National School Lunch Program.
Poverty stymies performance in school and negatively affects mental and physical health, experts say. Poor children have higher rates of asthma, are more likely to suffer a higher rate of cognitive delays and developmental disorders.
Absent intervention, these children will face great difficulty in transcending the disadvantages of their early lives and, as adults, are likely to perpetuate a cycle of poverty that has consumed generations in areas like East New York, Brooklyn; Jamaica, Queens; Morrisania in the Bronx; East Harlem; and Port Richmond on Staten Island.
Such an outcome is not acceptable to advocates like Richard R. Buery Jr., president and chief executive of the Children's Aid Society, who said, ''Those who love our country, and believe in its ideals, cannot be satisfied until the promise of equal opportunity is made true for all of our children.''

HEADLINE: Whose Square Feet?

BYLINE: By MARC SANTORA

 BODY:
THE tape measure does not lie.
But when it comes to measuring the square footage of New York City apartments, the tale told by the tape can be exaggerated, massaged, misrepresented and manipulated.
There are willful -- and legal -- tactics to make a space appear bigger on paper, like including common spaces and elevator shafts in the calculation of an apartment's size. There are also honest mistakes that derive from historical inaccuracies, differences in how condominiums and co-ops are measured, advances in measuring technology, changes in measuring standards, and unusual layouts. Then there are outright misrepresentations.
It can all add up to confusion or worse.
Buyers may be saddled with an apartment that the bank finds to be less valuable than assumed, because it is smaller than was thought. Deals can be delayed or even denied if lenders calculate a square footage different from the one listed, which can lower the appraised value. And developers who grossly overestimate square footage in an offering plan may find themselves being sued or losing deposits if the attorney general finds they acted in bad faith. 
''There is an implied precision,'' said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the Miller Samuel appraisal firm. He prepares the quarterly market reports for Prudential Douglas Elliman, which track prices per square foot, among other indicators. In reality, he said, the measurements are anything but precise.
Mr. Miller, who said he had calculated square footage for more than 7,000 New York City apartments, estimates that measurements vary by about 10 percent industrywide. Dimensions are generally taken with a laser device, the latest in a long line of tools used to gauge the size of apartments. But the laser is only as good as the person wielding it. And sometimes the stated square footage is a willful exaggeration.
''I remember seeing a condo unit and being told it was 600 square feet,'' Mr. Miller said. ''And I immediately thought, if this is 600 feet, I am blind.''
Brokers are often accused of overestimating. Bank assessors, on the other hand, are widely thought to underestimate. Even when estimates are in agreement, owners are likely to resist any change that will decrease the size, and therefore the value, of an apartment.
Official oversight of square footage measurements is limited, real estate lawyers said. Condo developments are required to say how they calculate square footage in their offering plans, which are filed with the state Office of the Attorney General. But there is no similar requirement for co-ops. And even in newer condos, as the property changes hands over the years, small inflations may morph into architectural tall tales.
Brokers are often careful to say they take no responsibility for listed square footage, and owners may honestly not know how large their home is. So, often, there is no obviously responsible party when discrepancies are found.
Steven Wagner, a real estate lawyer, says he encourages anyone thinking about buying an apartment in a new building to hire a lawyer to read the offering plan closely in order to determine whether the square footage measurements include common space like elevator shafts and hallways -- adding them in is legal in some cases, but that is not common knowledge. He said buyers of resales would be wise to have an architect or engineer measure the place before any contract is signed.
Mr. Wagner said it was more than two decades ago, when many buildings were being converted to co-ops, that he began noticing that the square footage numbers were being cooked.
''Some of the sponsors converting the buildings started measuring not from the interior wall, but from the exterior wall,'' he said. ''Of course, that does not work very well unless you plan on living inside the brick wall itself.''
While a certain amount of variation is tolerated, Mr. Wagner said, ''the standard for fraud is a misrepresentation of material fact.''
''There comes a point where it is not O.K.,'' he said. ''But I can't tell you whether it is 2 percent or 20 percent.''
One buyer, Glenn Evans, a senior vice president of Estee Lauder, is sure that he was defrauded. When Mr. Evans and his partner, Calvin Poon, moved back to New York from Shanghai in 2009, they told their broker that they wanted a place with more than 2,000 square feet.
''I must have showed them 40 or 50 apartments,'' said Robert Beacham, a broker at the Real Estate Group of New York.
But it was not until they walked into a two-bedroom co-op apartment at 1200 Broadway, a former hotel built just after the Civil War, that they knew they had found their new home. The building's mansard roof, ornate windows and high ceilings were all part of the draw. But so was the price per square foot. Mr. Evans said that the apartment was listed at 2,170 square feet.
''We did all our calculations based on the price per square foot,'' he said. At the time, the broker representing the seller -- who could not be reached recently for comment -- insisted that the price per square foot was well below market value.
The seller was asking for $1.749 million, and Mr. Evans countered with an offer of $1.65 million, which was accepted. But as part of the loan-approval process, the bank did two appraisals, both of which flabbergasted Mr. Evans. The bank found that the apartment was either 1,634 square feet or 1,741 square feet. Admittedly, the place has an odd layout that makes it difficult to measure. But nobody was coming up with anything near 2,170 square feet. Mr. Evans hired an architect to check again. The third measurement came in at nearly 1,800 square feet, convincing him that he had been deceived.
When Mr. Evans tried to negotiate a lower price based on the bank's assessment, the seller refused. Mr. Evans said he was told he would lose his 10 percent deposit if he backed out.
He sued the seller and the brokerage firm, Prudential Douglas Elliman. Mr. Evans claimed that the selling broker knew the apartment was not 2,170 square feet -- a size given in past transactions -- but continued to use the inflated figure.
''We just felt we were misled,'' he said. ''There was a deliberate, coordinated action by these people to rip us off.''
The case against the seller was dismissed when a judge determined that the seller had had nothing to do with the marketing of the apartment. Prudential Douglas Elliman contested the suit, which Mr. Evans recently dropped because it would have been too costly to continue, he said. A spokeswoman for Prudential Douglas Elliman said it never comments on litigation involving the company.
Mr. Evans and Mr. Poon went through with the deal. Although they say they love the apartment, they are still bitter about the experience.
''They were fighting this like a class-action suit,'' Mr. Evans said of the brokerage. ''It would open a whole Pandora's box of liability.''
Because brokers are generally careful to list square footage as an ''estimate'' or ''approximation,'' there is often little recourse for buyers.
For that and other reasons it is unwise to place too much emphasis on square feet as a basis for comparison, said Douglas Heddings, the president of the Heddings Property Group.
''First and foremost,'' Mr. Heddings said, ''I think all the weight that is put on price per square foot, especially in Manhattan, is ludicrous.'' He is particularly skeptical of comparing apartments in different buildings based on their listed square footage.
''Very rarely can you compare two units unless they are units that are in the same building and were measured using the same standards,'' he said.
Frances Katzen, an executive vice president of Elliman, said a number of her clients had bought apartments that turned out to be smaller than they had been told. She counsels her clients to focus not on square footage, but on what similar properties in the same building have sold for in the past.
She is currently showing a duplex apartment at 468 West 23rd Street. The owners, who have moved to Australia, bought the place several years ago without the help of a broker. They paid $2.1 million, thinking that the apartment had 2,100 square feet. The size estimate included the 700-square-foot backyard.
When they went to sell, Ms. Katzen said, the owners were disappointed to learn that outdoor space is not typically counted as part of overall square footage. So instead of 2,100 square feet, the apartment is listed at 1,400 square feet, and priced at $1.85 million.
Renters are often swayed by square-footage figures, said Clifford Finn, the managing director for new developments at CitiHabitats.
''Renters don't necessarily calculate the rent based on price per square foot,'' he said. ''But often, they will come in with a very specific idea of how much square footage they need.''
However, more often than not, neither the renter nor the landlord in older buildings has any idea of the true size of an apartment.
''In more than half the walk-up apartments in Manhattan,'' he said, ''no one knows the true square footage. And renters will come in saying they cannot live in less than 750 square feet, but will have no idea what 750 square feet is. You show them something that is 640 feet and they are like, 'This is great.' ''
Even for professionals, square footage can still hold surprises.
Pamela Liebman, the chief executive of the Corcoran Group, said that when her company was renewing its lease on office space in SoHo, the landlord came to her with unexpected news.
''We were paying rent based on 12,000 square feet,'' Ms. Liebman recalled. ''He said, 'Your space is now measured at 14,000 square feet.' ''
The landlord wanted to charge more based on the new calculation. Ms. Liebman replied that the space had not magically grown 2,000 feet overnight.
''We had a war over it,'' she said. The landlord eventually relented.
Although it was commercial real estate -- which has a different set of rules when it comes to measuring square footage, as well as its own, often more egregious, variations in measurements -- it offered a reminder of just how unreliable size estimates can be.
''I think we have all become too obsessed with dollars per square foot,'' Ms. Liebman said. ''Smart buyers should look carefully at the offering plans or have the apartment measured themselves.'' And, she added, always keep in mind that ''everyone seems to have a different tape measure.''

HEADLINE: Sara Tenenbein, Steve Hofstetter

BYLINE: By ROSALIE R. RADOMSKY

 BODY:
Sara Michal Tenenbein and Steve Hofstetter are to be married Sunday by Rabbi Isidoro Aizenberg at the Jumeirah Essex House Hotel in Manhattan.
The bride, 28, is the director of planning and business development for Audience Rewards, a theatrical trade organization in Manhattan. She graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and received an M.B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania. 
She is a daughter of Marian Newborn Tenenbein and Aaron Tenenbein of Manhattan. Her father is a professor of statistics and actuarial science and the faculty director of executive programs at the Stern School of Business at New York University. Her mother retired as a computer consultant in Manhattan.
The bridegroom, 31, is a comedian who has appeared on ''The Late Late Show With Craig Ferguson'' and other television shows. He is the chief executive of Next Round Entertainment, an agency in Brooklyn that provides management for comedians. He graduated from Columbia.
His mother, Ellen A. Jaffe of Rego Park, Queens, is an education consultant. His father, Martin H. Hofstetter of Bellerose Manor, Queens, retired as a chemist at the Crompton Corporation in Tarrytown, N.Y.
The couple were introduced through JDate in July 2009, when Mr. Hofstetter decided he was ready to meet ''someone substantial.''
Ms. Tenenbein ''seemed really smart and really witty,'' he said, ''and her picture wasn't bad either.''
Ms. Tenenbein, who had been on the dating site just a week, was a bit apprehensive. ''Oh God, he's a comedian,'' she recalled thinking after seeing his profile. ''I just assumed he was unemployed.''
They exchanged instant messages for three hours that afternoon. Then she contacted him again that evening, catching him off guard.
''So do you want to meet?'' he recalled her asking him before they had even had a telephone conversation. They met 18 hours later, after Ms. Tenenbein had finished work and just an hour before he started work -- at the Gotham Comedy Club. He invited her to see his act.
''Please, please let him be funny,'' she said to herself, hiding in a back corner; while he said to himself, ''Oh God, please let me have a good set.''
After the show they walked across the Brooklyn Bridge to his favorite place -- the Brooklyn Heights Promenade -- and they kissed on the bridge on the way back. ''I was so swept up I don't know if it was technically Brooklyn or technically Manhattan,'' he said.
He proposed 51 days after their first date, and shared the news with his audiences. ''If you get engaged after 51 days,'' one of his gags went, ''it's a scary thought that you've known your condiments in your refrigerator longer than your fiancee.''

HEADLINE: The U.S.S. Prius

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
As I was saying, the thing I love most about America is that there's always somebody here who doesn't get the word -- and they go out and do the right thing or invent the new thing, no matter what's going on politically or economically. And what could save America's energy future -- at a time when a fraudulent, anti-science campaign funded largely by Big Oil and Big Coal has blocked Congress from passing any clean energy/climate bill -- is the fact that the Navy and Marine Corps just didn't get the word.
God bless them: ''The Few. The Proud. The Green.'' Semper Fi. 
Spearheaded by Ray Mabus, President Obama's secretary of the Navy and the former U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia, the Navy and Marines are building a strategy for ''out-greening'' Al Qaeda, ''out-greening'' the Taliban and ''out-greening'' the world's petro-dictators. Their efforts are based in part on a recent study from 2007 data that found that the U.S. military loses one person, killed or wounded, for every 24 fuel convoys it runs in Afghanistan. Today, there are hundreds and hundreds of these convoys needed to truck fuel -- to run air-conditioners and power diesel generators -- to remote bases all over Afghanistan.
Mabus's argument is that if the U.S. Navy and Marines could replace those generators with renewable power and more energy efficient buildings, and run its ships on nuclear energy, biofuels and hybrid engines, and fly its jets with bio-fuels, then it could out-green the Taliban -- the best way to avoid a roadside bomb is to not have vehicles on the roads -- and out-green all the petro-dictators now telling the world what to do.
Unlike the Congress, which can be bought off by Big Oil and Big Coal, it is not so easy to tell the Marines that they can't buy the solar power that could save lives. I don't know what the final outcome in Iraq or Afghanistan will be, but if we come out of these two wars with a Pentagon-led green revolution, I know they won't be a total loss. Wars that were driven partly by our oil addiction end up forcing us to break our oil addiction? Wouldn't that be interesting?
Jackalyne Pfannenstiel, the assistant secretary of the Navy for energy, installations and environment, used to lead the California Energy Commission. She listed for me what's going on:
On April 22, Earth Day, the Navy flew a F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet powered by a 50-50 blend of conventional jet fuel and camelina aviation biofuel made from pressed mustard seeds. It flew at Mach 1.2 and has since been tested on biofuels at Mach 1.7 -- without a hiccup. I loved the quote in Biofuels Digest from Scott Johnson, general manager of Sustainable Oils, which produced the camelina: ''It was awesome to watch camelina biofuel break the sound barrier.''
The Navy will use only ''third generation'' biofuels. That means no ethanol made from corn because it doesn't have enough energy density. The Navy is only testing fuels like camelina and algae that do not compete with food, that have a total end-to-end carbon footprint cleaner than fossil fuels and that can be grown in ways that will ultimately be cheaper than fossil fuels.
In October, the Navy launched the U.S.S. Makin Island amphibious assault ship, which is propelled by a hybrid gas turbine/electric motor. On its maiden voyage from Mississippi to San Diego, said Mabus, it saved $2 million in fuel.
In addition, the Navy has tested its RCB-X combat boat on a 50-50 blend of algae and diesel, and it has tested its SH-60 helicopter on a similar biofuel blend. Meanwhile, the Marines now have a ''green'' forward operating base set up in Helmand Province in Afghanistan that is testing in the field everything from LED lights in tents to solar canopies to power refrigerators and equipment -- to see just how efficiently one remote base can get by without fossil fuel.
When you factor in all the costs of transporting fuel by truck or air to a forward base in Afghanistan -- that is, guarding it and delivering it over mountains -- a single gallon of gasoline ''could cost up to $400'' once it finally arrives, Mabus said.
The Navy plans in 2012 to put out to sea a ''Great Green Fleet,'' a 13-ship carrier battle group powered either by nuclear energy or 50-50 blends of biofuels and with aircraft flying on 50-50 blends of biofuels.
Mabus has also set a goal for the Navy to use alternative energy sources to provide 50 percent of the energy for all its war-fighting ships, planes, vehicles and shore installations by 2020. If the Navy really uses its buying power when buying power, and setting building efficiency standards, it alone could expand the green energy market in a decisive way.
And, if Congress will simply refrain from forcing the Navy to use corn ethanol or liquid coal -- neither of which are clean or efficient, but are located in many Congressional districts -- we might really get a green revolution in the military. That could save lives, money and the planet, and might even help us win -- or avoid -- the next war. Go Navy!

HEADLINE: The Health Care Balance

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Following the Money, Doctors Ration Care'' (Economic View, Dec. 12), in which Tyler Cowen predicted that inequality in health care will only grow if we stay on our current course: 
At the end of his column, he remarked that ''if you hear of a new solution to the health care puzzle, put aside the politics and instead think about the end result.'' But it's laughable to try to ''put aside the politics'' when the mega-corporate health care business has such sway over Washington.
It numbs the mind to fathom why the single-payer system is hardly given a single thought these days as a viable option to the current rat's maze of health care. When I visit my son in Europe, I see how people there accept with glee the tax systems that fund socialized medicine.
In our country, it's almost amusing to see the opponents of socialized medicine attending rallies for their cause, then running off to their Medicare-paid doctor's appointments. A single-payer system for all is workable -- and it's fair and affordable. First, however, our country must realize that in a for-profit health care system, profit will be the top priority.
Patricia Green
Columbia, Mo., Dec. 15
To the Editor:
In describing reimbursement rates for doctors, the column didn't take into account the high costs that physicians face from all their years of training -- years when others of their age are already gainfully employed. A doctor often enters her profession with huge debts to pay, including the cost of four years of expensive education after college, as well as much training beyond that. In order to lead a remotely normal life, and to meet the expenses of her practice, she has very little choice as to the minimum fees she can accept.
All discussions of health care costs should also consider patients' responsibility for their own well-being. Much is made of ''preventive care,'' but the patient is the only one who can effect it. A doctor can advise someone not to smoke, for example, but only the patient can take action. Until some way is found to factor this concept into costs, there will be no progress.
Recently, when I bought a car, I also bought an extended-warranty program. Should my car have a mechanical failure, I must demonstrate that I provided the necessary maintenance to make a claim. Our health care system could learn from that.

HEADLINE: City Opera Faces Hard Times With Daring

BYLINE: By ANTHONY TOMMASINI

 BODY:
IN the face of severe economic challenges many performing-arts institutions are panicking. But this is exactly the wrong time for an institution to compromise its mission. Staffs may have to be trimmed; offerings may have to be scaled back. But why the institution matters must come through more than ever in its programming.
For a model of how to respond with purpose, look to the New York City Opera under George Steel, now in his second season as general manager and artistic director. Not long ago this essential company, grappling with accumulated financial problems, came close to going under. The situation was worsened when the board, prodded by its chairman at the time, Susan L. Baker, courted the impresario-provocateur Gerard Mortier to head the company. 
Though an intriguing idea, the Mortier gambit was a debacle. City Opera was essentially shut down for a season, and it watched its endowment dwindle, as funds were tapped for operating expenses. Concessions from the unions representing the orchestra and chorus were crucial to moving the company forward.
Though things are still dicey, Mr. Steel has brought renewed energy and vision to the company, as was demonstrated this fall by a revelatory production of Bernstein's overlooked opera''A Quiet Place,'' inventively directed by Christopher Alden, with a strong, committed cast and a dynamic young American conductor, Jayce Ogren.
Instead of playing it safe, City Opera championed a work that had been dismissed as a hopeless, pretentious hodgepodge. The production aimed high, hoping to change the perceptions of those who thought they knew the piece and to introduce it to newcomers. For all these reasons City Opera's ''Quiet Place'' was for me the most inspiring event of 2010.
If the company has not curtailed its mission, it has certainly cut back its offerings, which both this season and last were down to five operas, though the 2010-11 schedule is supplemented with five concerts. Putting productions onstage is what an opera company is supposed to do. Mr. Steel is a least trying to make each one consequential. He opened his first season in 2009 with an important revival of Hugo Weisgall's ''Esther,'' a thorny, urgent and musically gripping work. This was followed by an updated, mysterious and sexy new production of Mozart's ''Don Giovanni,'' another Christopher Alden staging.
This fall there was also a terrific revival of City Opera's charming 1999 production of Strauss's wry domestic comedy ''Intermezzo,'' a hardly veiled portrait of his own marriage. I would have thought that opera buffs and interested newcomers would not want to miss this show.
Yet miss it many did. And the houses for ''A Quiet Place,'' while not terrible, were also disappointing, despite strong reviews and extensive promotion. Mr. Steel would seem to be doing everything right to present opera as a living, breathing form of theater and offer works that you are not likely to see next door at the Metropolitan Opera.
In a recent telephone interview Mr. Steel blamed the economy.
''Ticket sales are down all over New York,'' he said. ''At the same time people who came to 'A Quiet Place' were blown away. This production was critical in building the image of the company and in rebuilding a subscriber base.''
Though moving and unconventional, ''A Quiet Place'' is an awkward conflation of two Bernstein operas: a one-act from 1952, ''Trouble in Tahiti,'' a satirical look at the marital woes of a quarrelsome suburban couple, with a libretto by Bernstein; and ''A Quiet Place,'' an ambitious sequel from 30 years later with a libretto by Stephen Wadsworth, which shows what happens to the bitterly unhappy couple and their two troubled children. In the final three-act version of ''A Quiet Place,'' ''Trouble in Tahiti'' is folded into Act II as flashbacks. The resulting score is an eclectic blend of jazz, musical theater, Mahlerian angst, wistful Coplandesque harmonies and jagged atonal outbursts.
But Mr. Alden's production brought a consistent, humane tone to the whole. It uncovered the darkness of the ''Trouble in Tahiti'' episodes and found the bittersweet humor of ''A Quiet Place.'' The stylistic juxtapositions in the score emerged as pulsing, skillfully wrought extensions of Bernstein's embracing musical voice.
Bernstein probably does not mean to new generations what he does to those of us who grew up watching Uncle Lenny explain the musical world. It will be revealing to see the turnout in the spring for City Opera's production of ''Seance on a Wet Afternoon,'' the first opera by another composer associated with Broadway, Stephen Schwartz. And perhaps longtime opera buffs will join the new-music crowd for ''Monodrama,'' a triple bill of one-act works by Schoenberg, Morton Feldman and John Zorn, another daring Steel project.
Mr. Steel sounded positive about the future. Of course he must. That's his job. He said that eight people have joined the board since his arrival, including the returning Charles R. Wall, as the new chairman. Next month Mr. Steel will announce some major financial initiatives. He plans to bring back ''Don Giovanni'' and ''A Quiet Place'' in coming seasons, he said, if there are coming seasons. Right now that seems a good bet.

HEADLINE: Zimbabwe Health Care, Paid With Peanuts

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
CHIDAMOYO, Zimbabwe -- People lined up on the veranda of the American mission hospital here from miles around to barter for doctor visits and medicines, clutching scrawny chickens, squirming goats and buckets of maize. But mostly, they arrived with sacks of peanuts on their heads.
The hospital's cavernous chapel is now filled with what looks like a giant sand dune of unshelled nuts. The hospital makes them into peanut butter that is mixed into patients' breakfast porridge, spread on teatime snacks and melted into vegetables at dinnertime.
''We literally are providing medical services for peanuts!'' exclaimed Kathy McCarty, a nurse from California who has run this rural hospital, 35 miles from the nearest tarred road, since 1981.
The hospital, along with countless Zimbabweans, turned to barter in earnest in 2008 when inflation peaked at what the International Monetary Fund estimates was an astonishing 500 billion percent, wiping out life savings, making even trillion-dollar notes worthless and propelling the health and education systems into a vertiginous collapse. 
Since then, a power-sharing government has formed after years of decline under President Robert Mugabe, and the economy has stabilized. Zimbabwe abandoned its currency last year, replacing it with the American dollar, and inflation has fallen to a demure 3.6 percent. Teachers are back in their classrooms and nurses are back on their wards.
But a recent United Nations report suggests how far Zimbabwe has to go. It is still poorer than any of the 183 countries the United Nations has income data for. It is also one of only three countries in the world to be worse off now on combined measures of health, education and income than it was 40 years ago, the United Nations found.
For many rural Zimbabweans, cash remains so scarce that the 85-bed Chidamoyo Christian Hospital has continued to allow its patients to barter. Studies have found that fees are a major barrier to medical care in rural areas, where most Zimbabweans live.
''It's very difficult to get this famous dollar that people are talking about,'' said Esther Chirasasa, 30, who hiked eight miles through the bush to the hospital for treatment of debilitating arthritis. Her son, Cain, 13, walked at her side carrying a sack of peanuts to pay for her care.
Mrs. Chirasasa said her family of seven was nearly out of the food they grew on their small plot, so she needed to get her pain under control to work in other farmers' fields to feed her children.
Bartering helps plug some of the holes. A May survey of more than 4,000 rural households found that each of them, typically a family of six, spent an average of only $8 for all their needs in April, the cost of a couple of cappuccinos in New York. To help them get by, more than a third of households surveyed in September 2009 had used bartering.
Still, United Nations agencies estimate that 1.7 million of Zimbabwe's 11 million people will need food aid in the coming months. And Mr. Mugabe's continued domination of political life, along with persistent violations of the rule of law and human rights, have deterred foreign aid and investment needed to rebuild the nation's shattered economy, analysts say.
Here in this rustic outpost with no phone service and often no electricity, the Chidamoyo hospital and the people who rely on it have entered an unwritten pact to resist the tide of death that has carried away so many. Life expectancy in Zimbabwe, plagued by AIDS and poverty, has fallen to 47 years from 61 years over the past quarter century.
Patients provide the crops they grow and the animals they raise -- food that feeds the thousands of patients who use the hospital -- and the hospital tends to their wounds, treats their illnesses and delivers their babies. Its two doctors and 15 nurses see about 6,000 patients a month and have put 2,000 people with AIDS on life-saving antiretroviral medicines.
Even during the hyperinflation of 2008, when government hospitals ceased to function as the salaries of their workers shriveled, the Chidamoyo hospital stayed open by giving its staff members food that patients had bartered.
''People are helped very well and the staff cares about the patients,'' said Monica Mbizo, 22, who arrived with stomach pains and traded three skinny, black-feathered chickens for treatment.
The hospital, founded over four decades ago by American missionaries, from the Christian Church and Churches of Christ, receives limited support from a government that is itself hurting for revenue. The hospital also gets up to $10,000 a month from American and British churches, enabling it to charge patients far less in cash or goods than the fees at most government facilities. The hospital charges $1 to see the doctor -- or a quarter bucket of peanuts -- while a government hospital typically charges $4, in cash only.
Short of cash like the people it serves, the hospital practices a level of thrift unheard of in the United States. Workers and volunteers steam latex gloves to sterilize them for reuse, filling the fingers with water to ensure against leaks. They remove the cotton balls from thousands of pill bottles to swab patients' arms before injections. And they collect the tissue-thin pages of instructions from the same bottles for use as toilet paper.
But there are limits to what even stringent economies can achieve. For most of the past year, the hospital did not have enough money to stock blood. Ms. McCarty said women who hemorrhaged after giving birth or experiencing ruptured ectopic pregnancies were referred to bigger hospitals, but often they had no blood either. Eight women died, she said. Just recently, the United Nations has begun paying for blood at the hospital to improve women's odds of surviving.
Standing over an anesthetized woman before a Caesarean section, Dr. Vernon Murenje recalled how frightening it was to operate without blood in stock. ''You're operating,'' he said, ''but then at the back of your mind, you'll be thinking, 'What if we have significant blood loss?' ''
As he prepared to make the incision, the hospital was in the midst of almost two weeks without power. Its old generator, already used when the hospital bought it 20 years ago, lacked enough juice to run the X-ray machine or to keep the florescent lights from flickering. It was turned on just before the Caesarean section. The air-conditioner coughed weakly to life in the stifling room.
When a boy emerged, Ms. McCarty cried, ''Welcome to Zimbabwe!'' But the newborn made no sound. She pounded his back and suctioned his nose until he let out a cry like a quavering baby bird.
''Oh, you finally realized you were born in Zimbabwe,'' she said. ''He thought he was born in South Africa, and he was happy.''
Postscript: The Community Presbyterian Church of Ringwood, N.J., has raised $24,000, and the Rotary Club of Sebastopol, Calif., contributed $7,000 to buy the hospital a generator.

HEADLINE: Old Mint

BYLINE: By HANK PELLESSIER. 
hpellissier@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Built in 1874, the indestructible Granite Lady at Mission and Fifth fought off staggering earthquakes and scorching infernos in its time. While money production and storage ceased in 1937, plans are afoot to make the structure a museum dedicated to the history of San Francisco. 
Big and Busy
The 100,000-square-foot Old Mint encloses a huge courtyard that provides abundant sunlight to its offices, chambers and factories. Up to 200 employees once worked there around the clock, primarily in the production of coins.
Wealth of a Nation
By 1880, the Old Mint was producing 60 percent of the nation's silver and gold coins and contained about one-third of the United States' gold reserves -- $300 million, or $6 billion adjusted for inflation.
Cooking for Carats
Raw gold at the mint was melted and refined to remove impurities. Then, it was poured into a mold to produce a shape that was placed on a roller. ''Blanks'' were then cut out with a machine and stamped on the presses.
Access Denied
Gold and silver bars and ingots were generally kept in the basement's brick vaults. Bags of silver dollars were typically held in the even-more-secure steel-lined vaults. Each vault was protected by two sets of metal doors secured with combination locks with codes known to only two or three employees.
Guarding the Treasure
The Old Mint was a fortress with 24-hour armed security. It sits on a huge concrete-and-granite foundation and its brick walls are two-and-one-half-feet thick. Workers counted hundreds of bags of coins twice daily.
Chaos Control
After the 1906 earthquake, Gen. Frederick Funston, commander of the Presidio, feared that criminal gangs from the Barbary Coast would exploit the city's anarchy by looting the Old Mint. He sent 10 soldiers to protect the building, which was undamaged by the quake, due to reinforced masonry and a floating foundation.
White-Collar Crime
Thieves never ransacked the Old Mint, but there were occasional inside jobs. After fixing the books, a senior clerk is said to have walked out with two bags of silver, worth $30,000, in 1901.
Paying for Itself
San Francisco bought the Old Mint from the federal government in 2003 for one dollar -- a silver coin pressed here in 1879. The San Francisco Museum and Historical Society offers rooms for day-use rental.

HEADLINE: A Platform For Dancers To Mix It Up

BYLINE: By GIA KOURLAS

 BODY:
WHEN Judy Hussie-Taylor became the executive director of Danspace Project in 2008, she was a relative outsider whose career was mainly allied with arts organizations in Colorado. But her brief tenure has proven that having a high profile is overrated.
In 2010 Ms. Hussie-Taylor transformed Danspace Project into a vibrant destination for experimental dance and performance with the inauguration of her Platform series. Without simplifying her programming, she shaped it with the care and sensitivity of a sculptor, trusting herself to trust others, and in the process created a framework for a fresh way to look at what many consider to be an esoteric art form. 
For each Platform -- and so far there have been three -- Ms. Hussie-Taylor selected an artist to organize a series of performances based on a theme, as well as auxiliary events, including discussions, open rehearsals, screenings and an accompanying catalog. The series made it possible to view a range of work by way of Ralph Lemon's ''i get lost,'' Juliette Mapp's ''Back to New York City'' and Trajal Harrell's ''certain difficulties, certain joy.''
An artist-driven curatorial process may not be a new endeavor, but Ms. Hussie-Taylor's approach is flexible and personally designed; she offers the opportunity, for both audiences and artists, to explore why particular themes in dance and performance persist and matter. In the multiweek format Ms. Hussie-Taylor addresses the future of dance by nurturing the present, and in a short period she's created something out of nothing, showing that other producers have little excuse for a lack of innovation, even in a challenging economic climate.
Of course not every individual Platform performance was a success, but it's telling that several of the year's finest were presented under its auspices, including -- from Mr. Harrell's entry -- Emmanuelle Huynh with Nicholas Floc'h (''Numero''), D D Dorvillier (''No Change or 'freedom is a psycho-kinetic skill' '') and Cecilia Bengolea and Francois Chaignaud (''Sylphides'' and Paquerette'').
For her Platform, which generally focused on female choreographic voices, Ms. Mapp brought an important artist back to New York City: Deborah Hay, now based in Austin, Tex., performed the premiere of a masterful solo, ''No Time to Fly.'' And while Paige Martin's ''Panorama'' was an unwieldy disaster, its opening number is still etched in the mind: under a dusky sky, a group dance graced the space's adjoining garden with a vivid, mystical force.
In advance of his Platform, Mr. Lemon spoke about getting lost and finding grace. States of transcendence -- some frenetic, some utterly still -- were explored with fierce focus, notably in David Zambrano's ''Soul Project'' and in Maria Hassabi and Robert Steijn's collaborative duet ''Robert and Maria.'' But it was just as profound to see the way Mr. Lemon got lost and found grace in his own evening-length work presented at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in October, ''How Can You Stay in the House All Day and Not Go Anywhere?''
With her Platform series Ms. Hussie-Taylor, intentionally or not, is creating a conversation that extends far beyond Danspace Project's stage. And starting in January there's more to come.

HEADLINE: A Time Traveler With Tailfins

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
TWO thousand miles into the trip, with another 1,000 yet to go, it was a 30-cent fuse that finally stopped us. But maybe that's the sort of trouble you have to anticipate when trying to cross the continent in an old car.
Accompanied by my co-driver and longtime photographer-friend, Terry Moore, I started out last fall with a simple goal: drive a classic convertible coast to coast, mostly following U.S. Route 50 because it is one of the most intact, Interstate-skirting east-west roads still on the maps. Just two middle-age guys, wives and worries left behind, the open sun-struck road ahead.
And not in just any old car, but a 1958 Cadillac Eldorado Biarritz, a long-neglected castoff that I bought in South Jersey three years ago and had hauled to Vermont for a rebuild of its engine, transmission and brakes. Otherwise, it remained original -- the black paint worn, its red leather tuck-and-roll seat covers splitting at various seams, and whatever mysteries and ailments haunting the wiring, the cooling system and the drivetrain waiting to reveal themselves. 
Our hope was for a trip that would reacquaint us with the delights of auto journeys from the days before the anomie of Interstate travel, before cruise control, cup holders and satellite radio became ubiquitous. Radial tires, a portable GPS unit and a third brake light mounted above the trunklid were our only concessions to modernity; a dashboard hula girl named Hulia provided a touchstone to the Eldorado's era.
We knew that the car would also attract attention -- it is not small or subtle -- and create opportunities to meet people with stories to tell. It did not take long for the adventures to unfold.
''That's a rare car,'' said Jim Fuccello, manager of Fuccello's Custom Exhaust in Trenton, N.J., after his shop corrected mistakes made by the installer of the dual muffler system.
''A very rare car,'' he added for emphasis. It sounded like a warning -- that setting off for California in such an unusual car might not be the wisest plan.
Only 815 Biarritz convertibles were made in 1958, the year of a deep recession. Quad headlights were a recent innovation, and tailfins were reaching new heights. Still, compared with the egregious fins of the 1959 models, tacked on over the objections of Cadillac stylists as G.M.'s panicked response to the 1957 Chrysler line, our car seemed quite subdued.
Mr. Fuccello's comment was well-founded: as romantic as it may sound to drive off into the sunset in a 1958 Eldorado, it would be an unusual use of the car. For starters, insurers of collector cars limit how many miles the cars may be driven -- typically a few thousand a year -- and restrict the use to club meets, ''parades, cultural and educational events,'' to quote a typical policy, and Sunday drives with the family.
Additionally, the rarity of the Eldorado meant that it was more than just another valuable car; in the case of an unrestored original like mine, it would be essentially irreplaceable. Little wonder, then, that when I wrote 6,000 miles on the insurance application as my intended driving distance, the company called to ask why it was so high.
I replied that I wanted to take a cross-country trip, starting in Ocean City, Md., the eastern terminus of U.S.Route 50. The highway ends 3,000 miles west, in Sacramento.
''For club events and meets?'' I was asked.
''Um, yes,'' I answered.
Lars Kneller, a family doctor in LaPorte, Ind., who is also president of the Cadillac & LaSalle Club, agreed that owners typically used their cars for collector gatherings .
''For most of us, it's just local,'' Dr. Kneller said. ''We do have some members who drive to meets all over the country. But others are just on and off a trailer, or drive to church on Sundays.''
He added: ''We don't drive them much, and we're pretty careful when we do.''
Our plan, by contrast, called for lots of driving -- in a car that had not made a long trip since its mechanical overhaul. Sure enough, on our first day the quirky magic of the old Cadillac asserted itself: it breaks down, but when it does, people are really nice to you.
The first repair adventure began as an intermittent but tortured rattle and bang, coming from under the floor, that made the big car buck and stumble. With visions of the trip ending even before reaching our starting point, we limped into what was reputedly the best garage in Berlin, Md. But we were turned away -- an old car could be nothing but problems, we guessed, and the shop had a full datebook.
Desperate, we drove to a local Goodyear tire outlet. The service manager heard my pleading and said, sure, Frank could look at it in a few minutes.
Frank Digiacomo, a motorist's friend, put the Caddy on a lift and immediately spotted the problem: the driveshaft's center support -- it is a two-piece design -- had come loose, and the shaft was flopping around, slapping the crossbraces of the frame. Mr. Digiacomo secured the support with strong bolts, corrected a loose universal joint, checked the tires and said we were good to go.
I said I'd go settle the bill. Mr. Digiacomo smiled.
''That's O.K.,'' he said. ''We got you.''
What?
''We got you,'' he repeated, meaning there would be no charge. We were obviously crazy, he said, and he approved.
This would happen again. However much it might fly in the face of discretion to take an unproven old car on the open road, it certainly struck a chord in the hearts of car-loving Americans we met along the way.
On day two, in Romney, W.Va., we noticed that a front turn signal bulb had burned out, a potentially dangerous condition. The local parts store staff had never seen a bulb with a base of that type, completely unlike a modern bayonet mount. But by then Chad Benson, owner of a hot rod shop, Trioxin Kustoms, had parked his enormous Lincoln next to us in the parts store lot.
Back at his garage, Mr. Benson soldered a new bulb to the old base and installed it. ''What do I owe you?'' I asked.
''Nothing,'' Mr. Benson said, refusing my offer of $20. ''It's a Cadillac,'' he said, explaining nothing -- and everything.
Jerry Steiner, a retired engine builder in Dillsboro, Ind., gave the same response -- no charge -- after he corrected a misfire by adjusting the gap of the distributor points.
''We all said we were going to do something like this someday, just take off and go,'' he said. ''You guys are actually doing it.''
Actually doing it required making adjustments to our driving habits, starting with remembering that on the transmission gear indicator, the R for reverse was all the way to the right, where low gear is normally. We puzzled over cryptic heating and cooling controls: DEFR and VENT seemed clear, but what about the settings for ICE and FOG?
We relearned the habits of our teenage years, listening for unfamiliar sounds. We sniffed the air. Is that smell coming from outside, or is it us? Bits of mouse nests blew out of the heater vents, an occurence most drivers never get to experience.
But with each adjustment -- including new distributor points in St. Louis, where Bob's Transmission and Automotive Service took us before people with appointments -- the car ran stronger and quieter. And as the speed limits on western two-lane roads climbed from 55 to 65 and then to 70, the car seemed to find its groove -- the snapping of the canvas top against its steel supporting ribs quieted, the soft ride sat more firmly on the roadway and the miles flew by. Mileage on the rebuilt engine began creeping up, too, and reaching a respectable 14 miles per gallon on 91-octane gasoline.
We waved back at the thumbs-up signs from other motorists, and politely declined the vague offers to buy. We corrected guesses about its year that ranged from 1950 to 1970, and we showed off the engine, a common request, so fans could admire ''the six-pack'' -- three 2-barrel carburetors, good for an extra 25 horsepower over the 4-barrels of non-Eldorado Cadillacs that year. Old men and young boys were our biggest fans. ''Awesome car, mister,'' was a typical salute.
We had climbed out of corn country and into the dry wheat fields of the High Plains west of Dodge City, Kan., when we noticed that the fuel and temperature gauges had stopped working, and that the generator light was glowing. The service manager at Lewis Cadillac in Garden City had a mechanic wheel out diagnostic equipment and polarize the voltage regulator; he assured us that whatever the problem was, the battery was being charged as it should. The dealership did not charge, however.
But by then the Rockies and the deserts of the Great Basin lay before us, and our planned 10 days on the road had already stretched to two weeks. Counting caution as the better part of valor, we drove the Cadillac to Fort Collins, Colo., and finished the U.S. 50 trek in my sister's utterly reliable, predictable, practical and fin-free Subaru.
Five days later, I was back in Fort Collins, seeking a diagnosis for the generator lights. It took Gilsdorf Garage half an hour to find the blown fuse causing the problem. The tab: 30 cents for parts, $30 for labor.
Alone now, I turned east and powered over the western Interstates at 80 miles an hour, hour after hour, for a 2,000 mile homeward run. A side trip to see friends in Detroit included a stop on Clark Street, where the multistory assembly plant that built my car once stood.
The Cadillac ran flawlessly, the bugs of the westbound trip finally exorcised. At last, my Eldorado was ready for a long road trip.

HEADLINE: IN PURSUIT OF THE PERFECT BRAINSTORM

BYLINE: By DAVID SEGAL. 
David Segal is a business reporter for The New York Times.

 BODY:
Last month, in a small room on the fifth floor of a high-rise building in San Mateo, Calif., three men sat around a table, thinking. The place was wallpapered with Post-it notes, in a riot of colors, plus column after column of index cards pinned to foam boards. Some of the cards had phrases like ''space maximizers'' or ''stuff trackers'' written on them. Many had little three-dimensional ink drawings and titles, like ''color-coded Tupperware horizontal stacker.'' It looked as if these guys had been locked in and told they couldn't leave until they dreamed up 1,000 of the wackiest home-storage items they could imagine.
Which was pretty much what happened. ''We're in our third month,'' said one of the men, Clynton Taylor, ''so we're at about the halfway point.'' 
This was a project room at Jump Associates, a company with 50 employees that comes up with ideas to solve what it calls ''highly ambiguous problems.'' Exactly what problem was being solved in the room, and which client asked Jump to solve it, the company wouldn't say. But Jumpsters, as its employees call themselves, are chattier about closed cases. Procter & Gamble asked Jump to study the future of water and what it portends for a company that makes water-dependent products like soap and laundry detergent. Mars, the candy maker, asked Jump to define the current meaning of ''indulgence,'' on the theory that it now conjures pampering rather than stuffing your face. General Electric has retained Jump for at least 10 different projects.
Jump's work has elements of management consulting and a bit of design-firm draftsmanship, but its specialty is conceiving new businesses, and what it sells is really the art of innovation. The company is built on the premise that creative thinking is a kind of expertise. Like P.&G. and Mars, you can hire Jump to think on your behalf, for somewhere between $200,000 to $500,000 a month, depending on the complexity and ambiguity of the question you need answered. Or you can ask Jump to teach your corporation how to generate better ideas on its own; Jump imparts that expertise in one- and five-day how-to-brainstorm training sessions that can cost $200,000 for a one-day session for 25 employees.
This was a pretty exotic business model when Jump opened in 1998, but it isn't today. In the last decade, a quirky legion of idea peddlers has quietly invented what might be a new discipline and is certainly an expanding niche. How and why this happened is, naturally, a subject that everyone in the field theorizes about. What's clear is that in recent years, much of corporate America has gone meta -- it has started thinking about thinking. And all that thinking has led many executives to the same conclusion: We need help thinking.
A few idea entrepreneurs, like Jump, Ideo and Kotter International, are companies with offices and payrolls. But many are solo practitioners, brains for hire who lecture at corporations or consult with them regularly. Each has a catechism and a theory about why good ideas can be so hard to come by and what can be done to remedy the situation. Eric Haseltine, who has worked for both Disney and the National Security Agency, draws on the findings of evolutionary psychologists to explain to corporations why they are often unable to see opportunities that are right in front of them. ''Although we like to believe we know what is going on in our brains, we know almost nothing about what is going on inside them,'' he says. ''We're not only blind to certain things, but we're blind to the fact that we're blind to them.''
Though they offer different messages, idea entrepreneurs have plenty in common. Nearly all are superhigh energy. (''I'm octotasking,'' said one, speaking on the phone.) Many are just eccentric enough to straddle the line between crank and visionary. (In his spare time, Haseltine is inventing a communication system designed to work in the event of an apocalyptic disaster.) Quite a few of them have published books with the word ''innovation'' in the title. All of them hate to be called consultants. ''I like to position myself as a thought leader,'' says Vijay Govindarajan, a professor at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business and co-author of ''The Other Side of Innovation.'' ''A consultant solves problems,'' Govindarajan says. ''That is not my role. What I want is for companies to self-diagnose their problems and self-discover their own solutions through my thought leadership.''
You often hear this from idea entrepreneurs: Don't ask us for the answers. Let us help you frame the questions, so you can answer them yourself.
When I visited Jump Associates in San Mateo in early November, it was conducting a one-day boot camp, attended by a couple of dozen executives from the region. The morning session started at 8:30 and was led by a handful of Jumpsters, most of whom were in their 30s. Dressed in identical T-shirts, they seemed plucked from the Apple Store. Some of them were M.B.A.'s and former management consultants, but nearly everyone's resume had a polymathic twist. One Jumpster was a former U.S. forest ranger and Korean foreign-ministry staff member. Another had an undergraduate degree in civil engineering and a master's in visual criticism.
The tone of the day was buoyant and rah-rah in a summer-camp kind of way; it began on a sunlit terrace, where everyone stood in a circle for a few yogalike warm-up exercises, to ease our way to cogitation. Our goal, we soon learned: to conceive business plans that would improve the experience of commercial air travel. (This was a pure, Platonic exercise in innovation, since none of the executives hailed from the airline industry.) For the next few hours, we were schooled in Jump 101, which amounted to a series of interactive lectures, interrupted by small-group sessions in other rooms.
Despite the Up With People tenor, there was serious thought about how ideas are born and nurtured, and why some great ideas die after just a few gulps of oxygen. Like many of its competitors', Jump's core offering is an assortment of refinements to old-fashioned brainstorming. The analogy to weather built into that term is apt, it turns out, because Jump and others contend that without the right atmospheric mix, no brainstorming session will produce the cognitive version of lightning. Dev Patnaik, a sunny, kinetic co-founder and the chief executive of Jump, notes that even under ideal circumstances, traditional brainstorming can devolve into a kind of competitive idea tennis. You think of a new use for pencil. Then me. Then you. Then me. Somehow, the unstated goal is winning, however ill defined victory might seem, instead of ginning up virtuoso concepts.
At Jump, they prefer to brainstorm with a variation of a technique pioneered in improv theater. A comic offers the first sentence of a story, which lurches into a (hopefully funny) tale, when someone else says, ''Yes, and?'' then adds another sentence, which leads to another ''Yes, and?''-- and back and forth it goes. In the context of brainstorming, what was once a contest is transformed into a group exercise in storytelling. It has turned into a collaboration.
One of Jump's first megaclients was Target, in 2001. Still early in its spiffy-design phase, Target was selling home products by the designers Michael Graves and Phillipe Starck. Kmart was teamed up with Martha Stewart. Robyn Waters, then Target's vice-president of trend, design and product development, was worried that the company's famous-designer-on-a-budget success was being mimicked in categories that Target considered strongholds. One such category was back-to-college. Using a variety of methods, including ''Yes, and?'' brainstorming and having anthropologists analyze video footage of collegebound kids shopping for kitchenware, Jump helped devise a product called Kitchen in a Box, a collection of dozens of different utensils, pans, pots and a kettle, later designed by Todd Oldham. Sales took off. ''It worked phenomenally well,'' Waters says.
Why now? Why did innovation-mania take hold in the last decade or so?
One school of thought holds that corporations both rise and die faster than ever today, placing a premium on the speedy generation of ideas. The dot-com boom accelerated the process, Govindarajan says. ''In the late '90s, people started to say strategy isn't about stability, it's about change,'' he says.
Other ideas entrepreneurs offer a ''great man'' theory, pointing to the enormous influence of Clayton M. Christensen, a Harvard Business School professor and an author of books including ''The Innovator's Dilemma''and ''Innovation and the General Manager.'' Christensen coined the term ''disruptive innovation'' in 1992 to describe the kind of technological and marketing ideas that blindside established and seemingly well managed businesses. Think of Netflix, which reinvented the way videos are rented and crushed Blockbuster. Or Sears, a titan of retail for decades, which was poleaxed by discounters like Wal-Mart. Christensen has plenty of suggestions for avoiding the fate of the disruptees; for instance, he urges corporations to wall off a division that is built to think creatively and is small enough to be excited by small profits. But all of his prescriptions can be boiled down to three words: Innovate or die.
Dev Patnaik of Jump has his own answer to the why-now question. He contends that advances in technology over the past three decades have gradually forced management to reconceive its role in the corporation, shifting its focus from processing data to something more esoteric. ''My dad was a midlevel manager for I.B.M.,'' Patnaik explains, ''and I remember him in the '70s, sitting there with plastic 3M transparencies, by hand, with marker, to make presentations. For years, the good manager was one who had data at their fingertips. What's our sales in Peoria? 'It's actually 47 percent above last year.' People say, 'Oh, he's a good manager.' '' By the early '90s, though, companies like Microsoft and SAP were selling software that digitized this task. The days when a manager at, say, the Gap could earn a bow just for knowing how many sweaters to ship to Seattle were over. ''When that happens, what is the role of the manager?'' Patnaik asks. ''Suddenly it's about something else. Suddenly it's about leadership, creativity, vision. Those are the differentiating things, right?'' Patnaik draws an analogy to painting, which for centuries was all about rendering reality as accurately as possible, until a new technology -- photography -- showed up, throwing all those brush-wielding artists into crisis. ''Then painters said: 'Well, wait, you can tell what is but you can't tell me my impression of what is. Here's how it looks to me, like Seurat. Or the Cubists who said, 'You can't capture what is going on from multiple angles.' '' Technology forced painters to re-evaluate, which transformed their work. Something similar has happened in corporate America. As Patnaik puts it, ''We're in the abstract-expressionist era of management.''
Of course, as expressionistic as this era may be, it is far from an ideal moment to sell innovation. The recession caused many companies to pare back the number of consultants they retain. Meantime, giant consulting firms like Bain and Booz Allen Hamilton are peering down at this relatively tiny industry with an eye to co-opting it, says Ram Mudambi of Temple University's Fox School of Business. ''The traditional consulting firms have talked and advised about innovating for years,'' he says, ''but the advice was usually that it was dangerous for a large company to innovate from within. The mantra was: 'When you want new ideas, buy them. Find a small company and acquire it.' ''
Precisely how Jump's business model could work in a management firm with a vastly larger payroll is unclear. ''But what Jump and others are doing is squarely in the management-consultants' space,'' Mudambi says. ''So believe me, they're watching.''
For the competition part of the day at Jump's boot camp, we were divided into groups of three. Our first job, a Jumpster informed us, was to come up with an idea that would make air travel completely unbearable.
One team thought of a doozy. ''A reverse auction,'' explained Brad Oberwager, the founder of Sundia, which sells premium fruit cups. ''Everyone buys a cheap ticket for, say, $200, and then at the gate, an airline employee stands up and says: 'O.K., who wants to get on the plane for $400 more? You can sit anywhere you like.' And so on until all the seats are sold.''
A nightmare, everyone agreed. Now, we were told, take that terrible idea and turn it into something that you actually like. After a few minutes of mental jujitsu, the group conjured this: Why not allow, say, a college kid in need of some extra cash to sell his prime window seat to someone willing to part with money to avoid being squished in the middle? If you had the kid's e-mail address, a company, acting as a middleman, could send him or her a message: Would you take $200 to move to 22F?
Airfair was born. After the group spent some time fine-tuning the business model, what was needed, as the deadline for presentations neared, was a catchy motto. People tossed out ideas, one after another.
''How about Airfair: Seat exchange in the air?''
''Exchange your seats in the air.''
''Airfair. Your seat choice.''
''Airfair: Upgrade in the air''?
''Maybe a play on fair trade.''
''Just 'fair trade.' ''
''Fair trade in the air?''
This, of course, is the animated and slightly chaotic sound of brainstorming, the term popularized by Alex F. Osborn. In 1948, Osborn, the man who put the O in BBDO, the legendary advertising firm, wrote ''Your Creative Power,'' a jaunty, history-filled book that argued that creativity was essentially a muscle that, with enough exercise, anyone could develop. Especially if that exercise happened in groups, like the ones he started organizing at BBDO in 1939. The key to these sessions, he stated, was creating an atmosphere in which judgment about the quality of any idea is suspended. If participants worry about criticism, they edit themselves, which undermines the process. ''The crazier the idea, the better; it's easier to tone down than to think up.''
Most idea entrepreneurs offer what could be described as Osborn deluxe. Govindarajan, the Dartmouth professor, presents companies with what he calls the three-box framework. In Box 1, he puts everything a company now does to manage and improve performance. Box 2 is labeled ''selectively forgetting the past,'' his way of urging clients to avoid fighting competitors and following trends that are no longer relevant. Box 3 is strategic thinking about the future. ''Companies spend all of their time in Box 1, and think they are doing strategy,'' he says. ''But strategy is really about Box 2 and 3 -- the challenge to create the future that will exist in 2020.'' He recommends to clients what he calls the 30-30 rule: 30 percent of the people who make strategic decisions should be 30 years old or younger. ''The executives who've been there a long time, they grew up in Box 1,'' he says. ''You need voices in the room that aren't vested in the past.''
Eric Haseltine, the entrepreneur who has married management consulting and evolutionary psychology, says he walks his clients through a series of exercises intended to demonstrate how little they know about their brains. One of his favorites is the ''cocktail-party phenomenon,'' in which he asks participants to eavesdrop on a single conversation in a crowded room. It's possible only if you manage to ignore every other sound. ''Tuning in requires tuning out,'' he says, ''but few people realize how much they are tuning out at any given moment so they can focus on whatever they are focusing on.'' Tuning out is adaptive, he says -- it helped our hunter ancestors to focus on their prey and avoid starvation. But his job is to point out to clients how that adaptation can also limit their perspectives without them realizing it, and to offer them practical strategies to deal with these unconscious limitations.
To Patnaik, the traditional groupthink session -- even with modifications -- misses something crucial about how great ideas are often generated. A lot of breakthroughs are born in meditative states, he says, the mind-set you're in when alone and driving, for instance. In the past 20 years, he says, neuroscience has found, with the aid of devices like EEGs and fMRIs, a link between the slower rhythms associated with zoning out and creativity. ''Why do you have great ideas when you're in the shower?'' Patnaik asks. ''You're at ease. Your sense of judgment is quieted, you're making nonlinear connections, you're more likely to come up with great ideas. A shower is basically meditation for amateurs.''
They don't put employees or boot campers in showers at Jump, but they sometimes avoid the sort of directed group thinking that Osborn championed. At a five-day course for G.E. employees, the goal was to come up with a new revenue source for the company's aircraft-engine division. But Jump didn't just conduct brainstorming discussions. As the week neared its conclusion, and as the participants started becoming increasingly antsy, Jump sent them shopping. ''We sent some to a cooking store, we sent some to a toy store, some to a hardware store,'' Patnaik says. ''And we told them, 'We want you to buy something that is a metaphor for the solution.' ''
One of the participants returned with a model jet, which was sitting on a pedestal that was a black square, painted to look like a small bit of runway. When Patnaik checked in, they were contentedly staring at the model jet and already had a motto for their solution: take the tarmac with you. Private jets, they explained, are generally based in a handful of airports near big cities, but they land in out-of-the-way places that often lack parts and mechanics. Which means the jets are frequently idled, waiting to be fixed. For a subscription fee, G.E. could guarantee jet owners speedy service in, say, 40 different airports. ''That didn't happen from a brainstorming session,'' Patnaik says. ''If you read Osborn, he tells you to stay focused on the question.''
At the final event of the camp I visited, the results of Jump's techniques were on display. Nine different business pitches for air-travel improvements were presented, each to the entire room. Some were cockamamie (Skyloft, which turns the cargo section of the jet into a gym). Others were goofy (Paciflier, a pacifier that miraculously quiets babies). Every idea was vigorously applauded, but the crowd favorite, in a kind of clap-off that wrapped up the event, was Airfair. By then, the three attendees who imagined it were talking seriously about looking for investors. ''I hope you're not planning to write about this,'' one of them told me with surprising gravity, ''before we have a chance to run with the idea.''

HEADLINE: The Bipartisanship Racket

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
JEEZ, can't we all just get along? Can't we be civilized? Can't we reach across the aisle, find common ground and get things done? Can't we have a new Morning in America as clubby and chipper as MSNBC's daily gabfest, ''Morning Joe''?
This is actually the manifesto of the new political organization called No Labels. It's no surprise that its official debut last week prompted derisive laughter from all labels across the political spectrum, not to mention Gawker, which deemed it ''the most boring political movement of all time.'' But attention must be paid. In its patronizing desire to instruct us on what is wrong with our politics, No Labels ends up being a damning indictment of just how alarmingly out of touch the mainstream political-media elite remains with the grievances that have driven Americans to cynicism and despair in the 21st century's Gilded Age. 
Although No Labels sounds like a progressive high school's Model U.N., its heavy hitters are serious adults -- or at least white male adults. Among the 16 billed speakers at last week's official launch in New York, there were three women and no blacks, notwithstanding an excruciating No Labels ''anthem'' contributed by the Senegalese-American rapper Akon. (Do find on YouTube.) The marquee names on hand included Michael Bloomberg; Senate Democrats (Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, the incoming Joe Manchin of West Virginia); moderate Republicans drummed out of office by the Tea Party (Charlie Crist, Mike Castle); and no fewer than four MSNBC talking heads. Despite Bloomberg's denials, some persist in speculating that No Labels is a stalking horse for a quixotic 2012 presidential run. At the very least the organization is a promotional hobby horse for MSNBC.
''Morning Joe'' plugged No Labels with an alacrity to match Fox News's Tea Party boosterism (if not Fox's decibel level). The No Labels slogan -- ''Not Left. Not Right. Forward'' -- even echoes MSNBC's advertising tagline, ''Lean Forward.'' Presumably No Labels ditched ''lean'' because it's too muscular a verb for a group whose stated goals include better schools, affordable health care and more jobs -- as long as they can be achieved ''in a fiscally prudent way.'' To proselytize for such unimpeachable verities, no leaning is required -- you can do it frozen in place, and just possibly in your sleep.
The notion that civility and nominal bipartisanship would accomplish any of the heavy lifting required to rebuild America is childish magical thinking, and, worse, a mindless distraction from the real work before the nation. Sure, it would be swell if rhetorical peace broke out in Washington -- or on cable news networks -- but given that American politics have been rancorous since Boston's original Tea Party, wishing will not make it so. Bipartisanship is equally extinct -- as made all too evident this month by the pathetic fate of the much-hyped Simpson-Bowles deficit commission. Less than a week after the panel released its recommendations, the Democratic president and the Republican Congressional leadership both signed off on a tax-cut package that made a mockery of all its proposals by adding another $858 billion to the deficit. Even the Iraq Study Group -- Washington's last stab at delegating tough choices to a blue-ribbon bipartisan commission -- enjoyed a slightly longer shelf life before its recommendations were unceremoniously dumped into the garbage.
The No Labels faith in kumbaya as an antidote to what ails a polarized Washington isn't derived from any recent historical precedent but from the undying Beltway anecdotes about how Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill used to bury the hatchet over booze in times of yore. Bipartisanship is also a perennial holy grail in Beltway punditry -- as typified by David Broder, who hailed the Simpson-Bowles commission as ''historic'' in The Washington Post just hours before its findings were voted down by commission members on both the left (Representative Jan Schakowsky of Illinois) and right (Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin).
Beltway conventional wisdom is equally responsible for another myth promoted by No Labels: that the Move On left and the Tea Party right are equal contributors to America's ''hyperpartisanship.'' In the real world, no one could seriously believe that activists on the left have the sway over Democratic leaders, starting with President Obama, that the Tea Party has over the G.O.P. Nor, with all due respect to MSNBC, does the left have a media megaphone to match the Tea Party's alliance with the Murdoch empire, as led by Fox News, and the megastars of talk radio.
Besides, polls consistently show that hyperpartisanship is more prevalent among Republican voters than Democrats. When Democrats were asked in a Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey released last week if they wanted their leaders in Washington to stick with their positions rather than compromise with Republicans, only 29 percent said yes. When Republicans were asked the equivalent question, the no-compromise number jumped to 47 percent.
Yet what's most disturbing about No Labels is that its centrist, no doubt well-intentioned leaders seem utterly clueless about why Americans of all labels are angry: the realization that both parties are bought off by special interests who game the system and stack it against the rest of us. Indeed, No Labels itself is another manifestation of this syndrome. Its two prime movers are a political consultant, Mark McKinnon, a veteran of the Bush and McCain campaigns known for slick salesmanship; and a fund-raiser, Nancy Jacobson, who, along with her husband, the pollster and corporate flack Mark Penn, helped brand the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign as a depository for special-interest contributions.
No less depressing is the No Labels veneration of Evan Bayh, the Democratic senator from Indiana who decided to retire this year rather than fight for another term. For months now, Bayh has been positioning himself as a sacrificial lamb to broken Washington; when he made the rounds plugging No Labels last week, he was greeted as a martyr on MSNBC. What goes unmentioned in the Bayh morality tale is that in quitting the Senate without a fight, he became part of the problem rather than the solution: his exit facilitated the election of a high-powered corporate lobbyist, Dan Coats, as his Republican successor. Then again, Bayh's father -- another former liberal Democratic senator -- is also a lobbyist. (Evan Bayh has so far been mum about his own post-Senate career plans.)
This is exactly the kind of revolving-door synergy between corporate power and governance that turns off Americans left, right and, yes, center. Oblivious to this taint, No Labels named a few fat-cat donors who have ponied up $1million-plus. But like those shadowy outside groups invented by Karl Rove and his cronies for the 2010 campaign, No Labels has registered as a 501 (c) (4) and is not legally bound to release information about its contributors.
WHAT America needs is not another political organization with a toothless agenda and less-than-transparent finances. The country will not rest easy until there are brave leaders in both parties willing to reform the system that let perpetrators of the Great Recession escape while the rest of us got stuck with the wreckage. As Jesse Eisinger of the investigative journalistic organization ProPublica summed up in The Times this month: ''Nobody from Lehman, Merrill Lynch or Citigroup has been charged criminally with anything. No top executives at Bear Stearns have been indicted. All former American International Group executives are running free.'' For No Labels to battle this status quo would require actual political courage -- true bipartisan courage, in fact.
To say there's been no accountability for the crash is an understatement. In yet another spectacular display of failed bipartisanship last week, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, charged by Congress with unearthing the roots of the financial meltdown, split apart in sectarian warfare. The panel's Republican members issued their own rump report eliminating all mention of derivatives, executive compensation, failed regulatory agencies and even the words ''Wall Street'' so the whole debacle could be pinned solely on government (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac) and deadbeat Americans who took on predatory mortgages.
Our political leaders seem more inclined to hasten the next bust -- and perhaps cash in on it -- than prevent it. Massachusetts Republicans can't be blamed if they react with anger, not civility, to The Boston Globe's new revelations that Scott Brown raked in off-the-charts donations from the finance industry while toiling to weaken the financial regulatory bill. Democrats are equally entitled to be outraged that Obama's former budget director, Peter Orszag, has followed the egregious example of his mentor, Robert Rubin, by moving from the White House to a job at Citigroup -- and only four months after leaving government service.
As The Times reported, Citi is now marketing all-new lines of loosey-goosey credit cards to debt-prone Americans much as it stoked the proliferation of no-money-down mortgages during Rubin's tenure in the housing bubble. It can do so with impunity, since the incoming chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Spencer Bachus, has already guaranteed institutions like Citi a pass. As Bachus's instantly notorious pronouncement had it, ''My view is that Washington and the regulators are there to serve the banks.''
In truth, this congressman's view has been the prevailing view in Washington under both parties since the Reagan administration. If No Labels is the best our centrist political establishment can come up with to address the ills eating away at America, its culture is as bankrupt as Citigroup would be if taxpayers had been allowed to let it fail.

HEADLINE: Getting Help For a Modification

BYLINE: By LYNNLEY BROWNING

 BODY:
STRUGGLING homeowners can sometimes benefit from hiring a lawyer to try to modify a mortgage or avert foreclosure, but avoiding scam artists and sketchy practices requires vigilance.
Carefully vetting lawyers to weed out the good from the bad can mean the difference between saving tens of thousands of dollars in fees and actually having a loan modified -- and being out the cash, with your home in foreclosure and a radioactive credit score.
''It's difficult for consumers to differentiate between the bad actors and the ones who can help, because they're so inundated with scams these days,'' said William Mackin, a bankruptcy lawyer in Woodbury, N.J. 
So what are some of the potential red flags?
According to PreventLoanScams.org, a new online site operated by the nonprofit Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, homeowners should be cautious about: any guarantees that a loan will be modified, since not all can be; requests for an upfront fee or that the property title be signed over to a third party; and offers to redirect the monthly mortgage payments to a third party who will forward them to the lender or mortgage servicer.
''My best advice is, be wary of the too-good-to-be-true remedies,'' Mr. Mackin said.
Brian E. Sullivan, a spokesman for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, says homeowners may want to contact a HUD-approved housing counseling agency before hiring a lawyer. A list of nonprofit counselors -- some of which offer free loan-modification services, and others that refer clients to outside loan-modification lawyers -- can be found on HUD's Web site.
One benefit of using lawyers is that they typically know the ins and outs of the welter of government homeowner-assistance programs. Those homeowners who decide to hire one should contact their local bar association to ensure they find ''an ethical law firm'' that does loan modifications, said Thomas Martin, president of America's Watchdog, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group.
Lawyers typically charge $1,500 to $2,000, and up, for a loan modification. But they might be reluctant to accept clients who have lost their jobs and have no other outside income, as arguing with the bank or servicer in that situation can be pointless.
A lawyer will typically ask for your last two federal income tax returns, two most recent W-2 forms, six months' worth of pay stubs, evidence of other income and a letter explaining your predicament. The lawyer puts those documents into a loan-modification application -- intricate paperwork that varies by lender and servicer -- and follows that up with repeated calls to the loan officer. It may take weeks or months before an applicant learns whether his or her mortgage rate will be lowered or the principal amount reduced (lawyers say the latter is less likely).
Some states govern how lawyers can work with for-profit foreclosure-prevention and debt-recovery firms and other non-lawyers when helping a homeowner; state bar associations typically ban lawyers from instructing non-lawyers on how to perform legal services.
New Jersey permits a lawyer to work with foreclosure and loan-modification consultants only if the lawyer: has found and retained the homeowner as a client; supervises the consultant's work; and compensates the consultant with a salary or per-case fee. Allowing the client to pay the consultant directly is forbidden.
New York bans lawyers from paying referral fees to third-party consultants who bring clients to the lawyer. All payments by the lawyers to the consultants must be disclosed to and agreed by the client.
In Connecticut, lawyers cannot pay referral fees to the consultants or split fees with them.
Max L. Rosenberg, a consumer-protection lawyer in Stratford, Conn., said that ''anytime a lawyer farms out something to a nonlawyer for a loan mod, the hair on the back of my neck stands up. ''It's the Wild West out there,'' he said, ''and you have to be really careful.''

HEADLINE: Curtailing Air Pollution

 BODY:
To the Editor:
There is a much stronger economic case for curtailing highly toxic air pollution from old and outdated industrial boilers than there is for allowing the emissions to continue (''E.P.A. Delays Tougher Rules on Emissions,'' front page, Dec. 10). 
After two decades of analysis, the E.P.A. has found that cutting these emissions has billions of dollars of economically quantifiable public health benefits, far in excess of compliance costs. Among them: reductions in premature mortality, lower asthma rates and higher productivity thanks to less risk of illness.
Delaying this rule imposes huge costs on the public to save private industry a much smaller amount: hardly a good deal for the American people.
Michael A. Livermore New York, Dec. 13, 2010
The writer is executive director of the Institute for Policy Integrity at N.Y.U. School of Law.

HEADLINE: Big Bucks and Been-There Fare

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
IN 2010 average Americans worried about trying to make ends meet. At the upper levels of the art industry, anxiety centered on where to park surplus cash. How did the high rollers manage their stress? Retail therapy. Auctions turned into fireworks. Big galleries did big business. For the art market 2010 was a very therapeutic year.
It was, however, a dull and cautious one for art itself: tons to see but little to hold the eye or mind. 
With some notable exceptions museums offered been-there fare; Chelsea, even when full, felt empty. Some of the more memorable art-related events were at a distance from New York -- in Washington, China and Haiti. Here are some of the lows and highs of the year. Leading with the lows; they were what the year was really about. The highs were just lights in the tunnel.
LOWS
AUCTIONS To keep the game humming along, more bucks must be spent each year than were spent the year before, and at least one household name must sell for his (always his) all-time high. The formula worked like a charm this year. In May, Picasso's ''Nude, Green Leaves and Bust'' sold at Christie's for $106.5 million, the highest price for any painting by anybody at auction, ever. Everybody benefited. Christie's made out like a bandit. The press had news. The market was pronounced recession proof. So no one was in the mood to say that maybe the whole auction business is a rigged game, rich people playing big shot in public, or even that as paintings go, ''Nude, Green Leaves and Bust'' wasn't all that hot.
MUSEUMS Nor, apparently, was anyone in the mood to voice doubts when the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles hired a gallery dealer, Jeffrey Deitch, as its director, or when the billionaire Eli Broad bought himself the title of the city's emperor of art. In some circles it is considered smart to see the marriage of art and money as, if not fabulous, at least very adult; only pathetic schnooks do not. Ask why so much of the money always lands in the same art-world hands, and the smart answer is: Who said life was fair? One more tiny question: Does it mean anything that so many of these smart people have high-level art jobs and eat so many free meals?
MEALS Speaking of which, the ''food artist'' Jennifer Rubell, daughter of big-deal collectors Don and Mera Rubell, continued to draw big art crowds to her eatable installations. Slaughterhouses-worth of animals have been tortured and killed to enable Ms. Rubell's career, and everyone smiles and digs in. The Brooklyn Museum, which these days snaps up any bone it's tossed, recently hosted one of these things.
CULTURE WARS They're back. Last month a conservative religious group demanded that a video by the artist David Wojnarowicz (1954-1992) with an image of ants crawling on a crucifix be removed from a show called ''Hide/Seek: Difference and Desire in American Portraiture'' at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington. Adhering to a now-standard liberal response to right-wing pressure, the museum instantly caved and pulled the piece. Looking for a bright side, some noted that although the exhibition itself was largely about gay art, the complaint was made about religious matters. So maybe homosexuality is no longer the target it was 20 years ago? Dream on.
HIGHS
CULTURE WARS II There was a bright side: Someone in Washington fought back about the Wojnarowicz dust-up. When word got around about the censorship, one of the city's tiny nonprofit spaces, Transformer Gallery, instantly swung into action. It organized a protest at the National Portrait Gallery and screened the video for 48 hours straight in its storefront window, reminding us what ''alternative space'' once meant.
THE WHITNEY BIENNIAL Organized by Francesco Bonami and Gary Carrion-Murayari, the 2010 biennial took plenty of knocks. But in a gaseous art moment it was gratifyingly modest and solid: small, no theme; tight catalog; spartan display, divided about equally between neo-formalist and political work. People complained that the art was too hermetic, too insider-game. Why expect everything to jump up and lick your face? We have Jeff Koons for that.
UNKNOWN ASIA''Arts of Ancient Vietnam: From River Plain to Open Sea'' at the Asia Society brought us evidence of a great art tradition from a country that to many Americans still means little more than the memory of a nightmare war. From the moment you entered the galleries, you saw things you'd never seen before -- a bronze drum as big as a bathtub or a wooden Buddha, dark, Giacometti-thin -- on loan from 10 Vietnamese museums.
HAITI When the earthquake struck Haiti last January, some of the country's proudest cultural monuments were destroyed or damaged. But in the midst of catastrophe art struggled on. The sculpture collective known as Atis Rezistans continued to work in the Port-au-Prince neighborhood called Grand Rue, where they made figures from cast-off automobile parts. And rumor came that Myrlande Constant, a celebrated maker of sequined voodoo (or vodou) flags, was back at work in a borrowed studio after camping with her family in a tent city for more than a month. This is a story very much in progress.
REBEL Another story to follow as we move into a new year is that of the artist Ai Weiwei. It was exhilarating in 2010 to watch him continue to push major political buttons in China, even after officialdom pushed back. Severely beaten by government police last year, this year he was put under house arrest in Beijing. He has been forbidden to leave China. The international art world should be monitoring his situation closely and be prepared to mobilize quickly in his defense.

HEADLINE: Bonds and Lofty Goals Fail to Lift Arts School

BYLINE: By JENNIFER GOLLAN. 
jgollan@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
More than a decade ago, the San Francisco Unified School District pledged to move the city's top magnet arts school to the performing arts hub at the Civic Center. 
District officials and parents said the school's gifted students deserved state-of-the-art performance spaces -- art studios with natural light, quiet theaters to screen films and dance studios for ballerinas.
Voters passed two bond measures to pay for the project, but the district's lofty goals, including raising additional private money to complete the financing, have run into the recession.
Today, the Ruth Asawa San Francisco School of the Arts still languishes in a largely windowless facility in Diamond Heights. The new project is $100 million underfinanced. The 620 or so students make do, gathering for jazz band practice in the cafeteria and riding the bus downtown to practice in dance studios.
''There needs to be clarity on why the bond money hasn't been put to work to move the school,'' said Gary J. Pacini, the school's assistant principal.
Roughly a decade ago, there was a lot of optimism about the project, said Novella Smith, a parent who worked to help pass the first of two bond measures in 2003.
''There was a communitywide desire to move the school,'' said Ms. Smith, whose two children graduated from there in 2004 and 2006. ''The bond money would be part of it. And private funding would pay for the rest.''
Soon after the second bond measure passed in 2006, the economy faltered and project costs soared. ''As the years have progressed and the economy has gotten progressively worse, no one is pushing it anymore,'' said Nan McGuire, who has served on the district's Citizens' Bond Oversight Committee since spring 2004.
The district cannot sell the $30 million in bonds that voters approved until the scope of the project is defined and more construction financing is secured, district officials said. Project supporters have failed to raise any additional money through private donations, a requirement under the 2003 bond.
David L. Goldin, the district's chief facilities officer, said in an e-mail that the district had not determined that ''sufficient funds exist, in total, for the project'' from federal, state, local and other sources.
Project supporters say school officials lack political will. A controversial report by the 2008-9 San Francisco civil grand jury supports their view. ''S.F.U.S.D.,'' jurors wrote in their report, ''has demonstrated no consistent intent of ever moving SOTA to 135 Van Ness Ave.,'' which would give students easy access to the city's foremost cultural institutions, such as the San Francisco Opera and the Asian Art Museum.
But Jill Wynns, a school board member, said the inertia was tied to high turnover among school leaders and parents, and wavering support among some board members.
''We never told voters we could complete it with $15 million in 2003, and $15 million in 2006,'' Ms. Wynns said. ''We always told them that it will take a long time.''
She added, ''It's very complicated.''

HEADLINE: Machinations, Criminal And/or Familial

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
BOARDWALK EMPIRE (HBO) This drama about the machinations -- criminal, political, social, sexual -- in Atlantic City during Prohibition combines themes of HBO's two best series. Like ''The Sopranos,'' ''Boardwalk'' examines the conflicted ethics of New Jersey racketeers. Like ''The Wire,'' it explores the charcoal-gray territory where cities are forced to operate. Like those series, ''Boardwalk Empire'' boasts a rocking credit sequence, affecting direction that doesn't intrude and a cast that never seems to be ''acting.''
MAD MEN (AMC) Set as 1964 turned into 1965, the fourth season of ''Mad Men'' chronicled the difficult birth of Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce, the upstart advertising agency that was taking shape as the young and rebellious -- nationwide -- were taking over. The season addictively captured the era's divided cultural psyche: the repressed versus the psychologically attuned, the drunks versus the sober, the budding feminists versus the traditionalists, the right-wingers versus the emerging left. Through all of this turnaround was our hero, Don Draper (Jon Hamm), clinging to the old ways and desperately grasping for a piece of the new order. 
DAMAGES (FX) The third season of this legal thriller that stars Glenn Close as a morally dubious trial lawyer who has a ferocious populist streak, banked on its timeliness and the effort paid off. Setting the story around the saga of Bernard Madoff, the writers created a fictional counterpart to him and his brand of debased profiteering. The Tobins came complete with a twisted family consigliere whose sickness was idiosyncratically delivered to us each week by Martin Short. Equally outstanding and well cast, against type: Lily Tomlin as the Tobins' wealth-obsessed and social-climbing matriarch. (The fourth season will move to DirecTV from FX.)
DEXTER (Showtime) Having foreclosed Dexter Morgan's options for assimilating into a routine suburban life with last season's finale, the series paired this vigilante serial killer (Michael C. Hall) with a woman seeking exactly his skills. In Lumen (Julia Stiles) Dexter got a partner in crime, a ray of light, a protege, a lover and a soul mate in whose eyes he felt at peace. Viewers got an unusual take on the elusive splendors and miseries of being truly known by another human being.
RAISING HOPE (Fox) Steeped in eccentricity, Greg Garcia's satire about bringing up baby sends up our culture of fetishistic child rearing while providing subtle instruction in the ways that working-class life has changed since Archie Bunker. Playing a housecleaner who barely seems to be getting by, Martha Plimpton presides over a household of affectionately portrayed lunatics, one of whom is a son who stumbles haphazardly into fatherhood. As much as it is an acerbic comedy, ''Raising Hope'' is also an economics lesson.
PUBLIC SPEAKING (HBO) Martin Scorsese's entertaining documentary about New York's least prolific writer, Fran Lebowitz, casts its subject as a city institution and a semi-legend of comic commentary. But it never loses sight of an ego so grandiose that it becomes, above all, a powerful agent of paralysis. Filmed as Ms. Lebowitz pontificates -- on strollers, Times Square, James Baldwin and what she says are the trumped-up side effects of secondhand smoke -- at the Waverly Inn, a Manhattan restaurant owned by one of the film's producers, Graydon Carter, the film evokes both the drag and sideshow of breathtaking narcissism.
SONS OF ANARCHY (FX) Part ''Hamlet,'' part ''The Wild Bunch,'' Kurt Sutter's drama uses biker-gang life to explore ethnic factionalism, filial angst, male solidarity, suburban provincialism, romantic ambivalence and the dark trials and tribulations of parental responsibility. Set in an eerily still and arid patch of Northern California -- as much a character as the Harley-Davidson riders in full force -- ''Sons of Anarchy'' is a believer in equal opportunity despite its machismo allegiances. This past season the scariest presence of all was a pretty blonde with a job at the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms.
MEN OF A CERTAIN AGE (TNT) Created by the comedian Ray Romano and Mike Royce, ''Men of a Certain Age'' is ''Sex and the City'' for the other sex. A funny, contemplative and methodical look at three friends making their way into the Viagra generation, the series features intensely realistic performances from its stars (Mr. Romano, Scott Bakula and Andre Braugher) and sits with us as the ultimate paean to the average guy.
Correction: December 26, 2010, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A listing last Sunday of Ginia Bellafante's favorite television shows of 2010 omitted one of the creators of the series ''Men of a Certain Age.'' Besides Ray Romano, the series was also created by Mike Royce.

HEADLINE: Is Going to an Elite College Worth It?

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

 BODY:
AS hundreds of thousands of students rush to fill out college applications to meet end-of-the-year deadlines, it might be worth asking them: Is where you spend the next four years of your life that important?
The sluggish economy and rising costs of college have only intensified questions about whether expensive, prestigious colleges make any difference. Do their graduates make more money? Get into better professional programs? Make better connections? And are they more satisfied with their lives, or at least with their work?
Many college guidance counselors will say, find your own rainbow. But that can sound like pablum to even the most laid-back parent and student.
Answers to such questions cannot be found, typically, in the sort of data churned out annually in the U.S. News and World Report rankings, which tend to focus on inputs like average SAT scores or college rejection rates. Handicappers shy away from collating such information partly because it can be hard to measure something like alumni satisfaction 5 to 10 years out. Moreover, in taking a yardstick to someone's success, or quality of life, how much can be attributed to one's alma mater, versus someone's aptitude, intelligence and doggedness? 
But economists and sociologists have tried to tackle these questions. Their research, however hedged, does suggest that elite schools can make a difference in income and graduate school placement. But happiness in life? That's a question for another day.
Among the most cited research on the subject -- a paper by economists from the RAND Corporation and Brigham Young and Cornell Universities -- found that ''strong evidence emerges of a significant economic return to attending an elite private institution, and some evidence suggests this premium has increased over time.''
Grouping colleges by the same tiers of selectivity used in a popular college guidebook, Barron's, the researchers found that alumni of the most selective colleges earned, on average, 40 percent more a year than those who graduated from the least selective public universities, as calculated 10 years after they graduated from high school.
Those same researchers found in a separate paper that ''attendance at an elite private college significantly increases the probability of attending graduate school, and more specifically graduate school at a major research university.''
One major caveat: these studies, which tracked more than 5,000 college graduates, some for more than a decade, are themselves now more than a decade old. Over that period, of course, the full sticker price for elite private colleges has far outstripped the pace of inflation, to say nothing of the cost of many of their public school peers (even accounting for the soaring prices of some public universities, especially in California, suffering under state budget crises).
For example, full tuition and fees at Princeton this year is more than $50,000, while Rutgers, the state university just up the New Jersey Turnpike, costs state residents less than half that. The figures are similar for the University of Pennsylvania and Pennsylvania State University. (For the sake of this exercise, set aside those students at elite colleges whose financial aid packages cover most, if not all, of their education.)
Despite the lingering gap in pricing between public and private schools, Eric R. Eide, one of the authors of that paper on the earnings of blue-chip college graduates, said he had seen no evidence that would persuade him to revise, in 2010, the conclusion he reached in 1998.
''Education is a long-run investment,'' said Professor Eide, chairman of the economics department at Brigham Young, ''It may be more painful to finance right now. People may be more hesitant to go into debt because of the recession. In my opinion, they should be looking over the long run of their child's life.''
He added, ''I don't think the costs of college are going up faster than the returns on graduating from an elite private college.''
Still, one flaw in such research has always been that it can be hard to disentangle the impact of the institution from the inherent abilities and personal qualities of the individual graduate. In other words, if someone had been accepted at an elite college, but chose to go to a more pedestrian one, would his earnings over the long term be the same?
In 1999, economists from Princeton and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation looked at some of the same data Professor Eide and his colleagues had used, but crunched them in a different way: they compared students at more selective colleges to others of ''seemingly comparable ability,'' based on their SAT scores and class rank, who had attended less selective schools, either by choice or because a top college rejected them.
The earnings of graduates in the two groups were about the same -- perhaps shifting the ledger in favor of the less expensive, less prestigious route. (The one exception was that children from ''disadvantaged family backgrounds'' appeared to earn more over time if they attended more selective colleges. The authors, Stacy Berg Dale and Alan B. Krueger, do not speculate why, but conclude, ''These students appear to benefit most from attending a more elite college.'')
Earnings, of course, and even graduate school attendance, are but two of many measurements of graduates' success post-college.
Earlier this year, two labor and education professors from Penn State, along with a sociologist from Claremont Graduate University in California, sought to examine whether graduates from elite colleges were, in general, more satisfied in their work than those who attended less prestigious institutions.
Writing in April in the Journal of Labor Research, the three researchers argued that ''an exclusive focus on the economic outcomes of college graduation, and from prestigious colleges in particular, neglects a host of other employment features.''
Mining a sample of nearly 5,000 recipients of bachelor's degrees in 1992 and 1993, who were then tracked for nearly a decade, the authors concluded that ''job satisfaction decreases slightly as college selectivity moves up.'' One hypothesis by the authors was that the expectations of elite college graduates -- especially when it came to earnings -- might have been higher, and thus more subject to disappointment, than the expectations of those who graduated from less competitive colleges.
Still, one of those authors, Scott L. Thomas, a sociologist who is a professor of educational studies at Claremont, said high school students and their parents should take any attempt to apply broad generalizations to such personal choices with a grain of salt.
''Prestige does pay,'' Mr. Thomas said in an interview. ''But prestige costs, too. The question is, is the cost less than the added return?''
His answer was one he said he knew families would find maddening: ''It depends.''
For example, someone who knew he needed to earn a reliable salary immediately after graduation, and as a result chose to study something practical like business or engineering, might find the cost-benefit analysis tilted in favor of a state school, he said.
''Students from less affluent backgrounds are going to find themselves in situations where college is less about 'finding themselves,' and more about skills acquisition and making contacts that will lead straight into the labor market,'' Mr. Thomas said. For such a student, he said, a state university, particularly a big one, may also have a large, passionate alumni body. It, in turn, may play a disproportionate role in deciding who gets which jobs in a state in a variety of fields -- an old-boy (and increasingly old-girl) network that may be less impressed with a job applicant's Ivy league pedigree.
''If you've attended a big state school with a tremendous football program,'' Mr. Thomas said, ''there's tremendous affinity and good will -- whether or not you had anything to do with the football program.''
In the end, some researchers echo that tried-and-perhaps-even-true wisdom of guidance counselors: the extent to which one takes advantage of the educational offerings of an institution may be more important, in the long run, than how prominently and proudly that institution's name is being displayed on the back windows of cars in the nation's wealthiest enclaves.
In this analysis, one's major -- and how it aligns with the departmental strengths of a university -- may be more significant than the place in the academic pecking order awarded to that college by the statisticians at U.S. News.
''Everything we know from studying college student experiences and outcomes tells us that there is more variability within schools than between them,'' said Alexander C. McCormick, a former admissions officer at his alma mater, Dartmouth College, and now an associate professor of education at Indiana University at Bloomington.
''This is the irony, given the dominance of the rankings mentality of who's No. 5 or No. 50,'' Professor McCormick added. ''The quality of that biology major offered at School No. 50? It may exceed that at School No. 5.''

LENGTH: 762 words

HEADLINE: Leslie Wohlman Himmel

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
Ms. Himmel, 56, is a managing partner at Himmel + Meringoff Properties, which owns and operates more than two million square feet of office and retail space in New York City, including 521-33 West 57th Street and 729 Seventh Avenue. Ms. Himmel is active on the Real Estate Board of New York, serving as chairwoman of its Economic Development Committee, which she founded in 1992.
Q What are your main responsibilities at Himmel + Meringoff? 
A Stephen Meringoff and I have been partners for 26 years -- as of January -- and we both can substitute for each other in the business. But I take more of the outside role, working with brokers and lenders to bring in deals. Steve is the in-house person. He does the work with the leasing and the management and the renovation; he helps organize the strategic thinking for the repositioning of the properties.
Q How did you and Mr. Meringoff meet?
A We met at a class that Larry Silverstein taught at N.Y.U. Harry Helmsley was a guest speaker and going on and on about his buildings. And when he asked if there were any questions, I raised my hand first and I asked about his greatest accomplishment, to which he replied, ''What are you doing later tonight?'' After that, Steve came over to me and thought I had a lot of moxie and we struck it up.
Q Did Harry Helmsley later serve as sort of a mentor?
A A lot of the long-term owners in real estate were my mentors, and they all took me under their wing. Larry Silverstein was and continues to be a mentor.
But getting back to Harry Helmsley, I went on a vacation to Barbados a year after my partnership with Steve, and who was at the same hotel? Harry and Leona. My husband and I got very close with them -- we had lunch and dinner with them almost every day -- and Harry told me stories the entire week. Coming back home on the plane I wrote them all down.
Q Like many of the family real estate businesses, your firm is conservative with financing.
A We're very conservative. Our L.T.V., or loan to value, is probably 50 to 60 percent, at most, maybe only 30 or 40 percent. We do like to finance our properties, because taxwise it's the smart thing to do to have interest as a deduction. With interest rates today at 4.5 to 5 percent, it's really smart to refinance everything.
Q And your firm also tends to buy and hold properties.
A We typically hold for a long term, similar to the real estate families. However, from 2000 to 2009 we did sell a number of properties. We believe there's a time to buy and there's a time to sell -- and at this point we're back in the buying mode.
Q Are you working on any distressed opportunities?
A I have over 20 properties that we're working on now -- some with lenders, some are net leases, some are pure purchases. I'm in different stages on a lot of deals.
Q Tell me about some of the deals for this year.
A In the spring we extended a net lease on 411 Lafayette Street, off Astor Place, by another 25 years, to 2061. Originally it was 49 years, and it was expiring in 2036. It's a beautiful 90,000-square-foot building that was built in 1898. We also refinanced three properties. And we just signed a contract on a secondary office building in Manhattan. I'm under a confidentiality statement. We were chosen because of the ability to close all-cash and close quickly.
Q Do you have any favorites in your property portfolio?
A People say never fall in love with your real estate. I do have a lot of very interesting -- highly complicated and structured -- transactions.
There's one building at 1356 Broadway -- it's now Gotham Hall -- that took me 10 years to buy. It was through four transactions: I bought the fee from an Integrated Resources interest; we bought the lease and the mortgage from Republic; and we bought a remainder interest that had the air rights from another entity. We ended up selling the property but retain the air rights.
Q Let's put your Rebny hat on and talk about New York.
A New York has been really lucky in seeing a recovery, in large part because Wall Street had a banner year this year. I do believe that New York City also has this fantastic intellectual capital, and as much as it may be cheaper to do business in other places, there's this wonderful synergy here.
We are really trying to get New York City to have better tax and economic incentives to compete with places like North Carolina to get businesses here.
Q So you're to receive a Rebny lifetime leadership award next month.
A It was my dream to follow in the footsteps of these huge leaders. So is it time to retire?

HEADLINE: Greene, With Curiosity

BYLINE: Interview by DEBORAH SOLOMON

 BODY:
This interview is for our annual Ideas Issue, and because you're a physicist at Columbia University who specializes in string theory and the secret life of invisible particles, let mestart by asking you this: Do you think the fieldof physics is continuing to provide the world with big, important, Einstein-level ideas? Absolutely. Physics grapples with the largest questions the universe presents. Wheredid the totality of reality come from? Did time have a beginning?
Wasn't that already answered by the Big Bang theory? Is that outdated now? I wouldn't say it's outdated. It's been enhanced into another version called inflationary cosmology, which has a bang that is bigger than the originalBig Bang's. In fact, there may have been many big bangs, one of which created our universe.The other bangs created other universes. 
Right. In your forthcoming book, ''The Hidden Reality,'' you ponder the possibility of a ''multiverse'' composed of many universes.But what kind of worlds are we talking about? Clumps of subatomic particles in space?Or universes with restaurants and museums? Some might have museums and restaurants. Some might have copies of you and me havinga conversation similar to this one. Yet other universes would be vastly different. They could involve a gigantic expansive space that might be filled with other forms of matter governed by other kinds of physical laws. In one such universe, when the apple is released by a tree, it might go up instead of down.
All of this speculation seems so devoid of practical application. Why not just use your time to try to improve life on earth by coming up with a new source of fuel? Which is vital,but I think that these ideas are just as vital in a different sense, because it's these kinds of pursuits that ultimately allow us to understand how we fit into the cosmic scheme.
You grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, across the street from the Museum of Natural History. I still live on the UpperWest Side. I've moved 40 blocks in 40 years.
What did your dad do for a living? He was mainly a composer. To make money he played the bass fiddle at weddings and bar mitzvahs. He co-wrote a song called ''Turn Around'' with Harry Belafonte. He dropped out of high school to be a performer. He liked to say he was anS.Ph.D. -- Seward Park High School Dropout -- although he was passionately self-schooled in the big ideas of the universe.
And what about your mom? Does she expect you to win a Nobel Prize soon? My mother worked on 74th Street for Dr. Stern, the veterinarian, and has since become something of a real estate mogul. She is still not over me not being a doctor. I tell her I am a doctor. And she says, ''Well, not that kind of doctor.'' With mybook, ''The Elegant Universe,'' she got as faras the dedication, which is to her and my father.She tried to read on but told me that it gaveher a headache.
Do you think SAT scores define intelligence? No. They define the capacity to answer questions on an SAT test.
How would you define intelligence? Intelligence is the ability to take in information from the world and to find patterns in that information that allow you to organize your perceptions and understand the external world.
What is your goal in life? I would say in one sentence my goal is to at least be part of the journey to find the unified theory that Einstein himself was really the first to look for. He didn't find it, but we think we're hot on the trail.
Why is that so hard? Here's a unified theory: Everything in the world will get worse. That may well be true, but our goal is to find theories that make precise numerical predictions that we can test, and that's a hard theory to test precisely.
Do you think physicists have been unfairly maligned as eggheads? Is it maligning to be called an egghead? I strive for it. We're on this planet for the briefest of moments in cosmic terms, and I want to spend that time thinking about what I consider the deepest questions.

HEADLINE: Shopping And Giving: The App

BYLINE: By AUSTIN CONSIDINE

 BODY:
In a holiday giving season ruled by economic uncertainty, it's tempting to skip the charity bin this year. But what if you could contribute to the cause just by shopping?
Turns out shoppers can now give to charity without actually giving, with check-in applications like Foursquare, Gowalla, Loopt and the latest major player to join the ranks, Facebook Places. The applications allow users to broadcast their locations using their mobile devices.
For example, each time someone checks in to a Hard Rock Cafe in the United States using Facebook Places, Hard Rock International donates a dollar to WhyHunger, a charity fighting global poverty and hunger. The effort continues through the end of the month, or up to $100,000. 
Bill Ayres, a talk radio host who is executive director and a founder of WhyHunger, said the development was an exciting for charities like his.
''This promotion signifies a new direction for organizations like ours to embrace social technologies and reach a wider audience with an easy way to get involved and give back,'' he said.
Charity apps are nothing new. But the concept of giving with no money from the user has only recently built steam. The idea takes its cue from CauseWorld, which began around this time last year. Users check in to common shops and grocery stores to earn ''karma'' points, which are later donated to dozens of select charities of the user's choice, like the National Breast Cancer Foundation or the American Red Cross. Sponsors like Kraft, Citi and Proctor & Gamble match the karma with money.
Other check-in apps have proved fertile ground for charitable partnerships. Melanie Mathos, a manager at Blackbaud, which provides fund-raising technology to about 24,000 nonprofit groups, pointed to Foursquare's efforts at last spring's South by Southwest music and film festival in Austin, Tex. Each time someone checked in on Foursquare from any business in Austin, or sent a specific hashtag on Twitter, Microsoft and PayPal 25 cents combined together donated 25 cents to Save the Children's Haiti relief effort.
Within two days, the effort counted 371,804 check-ins, saw 2,683 Twitter messages and raised $15,000.
''It is definitely a concept that many nonprofits are embracing,'' Ms. Mathos said. ''With the explosive growth of Foursquare and with Facebook's new check-in feature, it is sure to go mainstream.''
Because the applications are open and accessible to users and businesses, and because of how the applications work, partnerships can evolve freely. Foursquare and Facebook Places, for example, do not arrange relationships between businesses and charities. Business owners simply join the network and promote special deals at will, some of them charitable.
At the Gap, customers who check in get 30 percent off purchases. But for every check-in, the Gap also donates a dollar to CampInteractive, a charity that helps poor children explore nature and technology (donations will be made through Dec. 25).
Bridget Forney, a marketing executive from Baltimore, said she had no idea she was donating to charity when she checked in at the Gap this month. When employees told her about it, she was thrilled.
''I'm spending money at the Gap, but they're taking care of the donation, so it takes out the guesswork and I don't have to do as much work,'' Ms. Forney said. ''I just have to spend money and shop.''

HEADLINE: How the Study Was Conducted

 BODY:
The study by scholars at Northwestern University and the University of Chicago -- Lee Epstein, William M. Landes and Judge Richard A. Posner -- relies on a database of Supreme Court decisions and votes that was created by Harold J. Spaeth with the support of the National Science Foundation about 20 years ago. 
The database includes a category called ''economic activity,'' which covers decisions on matters like securities law, consumer protection, mergers and punitive damages. That category, supplemented by separate ones for employment discrimination and labor arbitration, encompasses 1,447 decisions since 1953, and provides a reasonable proxy for ''business cases.''
The database codes each decision as liberal or conservative. Liberal decisions, for these purposes, are ''antibusiness, antiemployer, pro-liability, pro-competition, pro-consumer, etc.,'' according to the study.
''These are conventional definitions in the political science literature, but they are nonetheless imperfect,'' the study cautioned. Whatever their imperfections, they were applied neutrally across rulings for more than a half-century under four chief justices, and the Roberts court emerged as the most pro-business by a statistically significant margin.

HEADLINE: Asees Sethi, Harpreet Anand

BYLINE: By ROSALIE R. RADOMSKY

 BODY:
Asees Sethi, a daughter of Khiven Sethi and Ravinder S. Sethi of Pasadena, Calif., was married there Saturday to Harpreet Singh Anand, a son of Amarjit K. Anand and Inderjit S. Anand of Huntington, N.Y. Gajinder Shah Singh, a Sikh priest, officiated at the Pasadena Convention Center. 
Mrs. Anand, 26, was, until last year, a public affairs consultant at GPlus Europe, a consultancy in Brussels. She graduated magna cum laude from George Washington and received a master's in politics and government of the European Union from the London School of Economics.
Mr. Anand, 28, is a vice president at the New York investment firm Oak Hill Advisers. He covers the automotive, mining and aerospace industries. He graduated with high distinction from the University of Michigan.
The couple first came to know one another in May 2009 by way of a mysterious e-mail -- a contact arranged by their fathers. The matchmaking had been set off by a friend of Ms. Sethi's family, who had heard that she would be returning from Belgium and who also knew that Mr. Anand's family had a suitable son.
Up until then, the couple had been completely in the dark. ''I was going through my work e-mails,'' Mr. Anand said. ''I saw the word 'matrimonial,' and I almost fell off my chair. My father wrote a biography and attached pictures of me, and had already sent it off to her dad.''
The covert matchmaking irritated Mr. Anand. He forwarded the e-mail to his brother, and deleted the original. But his brother urged a closer look.
Mr. Anand was pleasantly surprised to discover that Ms. Sethi was attractive. He resolved to get in touch with her, but not without firmly, but respectfully, advising his parents to stay out of it.
Ms. Sethi, still in Brussels, learned of the arrangements from her father. At first she, like Mr. Anand, was annoyed and said that she told her father, ''A, that I don't like sending pictures around because it's superficial; and B, it was an unattractive one at that.''
The couple told each other that they would humor their families by meeting in New York for coffee during her next visit that July. ''We can still do the right thing and tell our parents we met and didn't like each other,'' she recalled telling him. And yet they kept in touch constantly.
By July, when Mr. Anand picked her up at the airport, with flowers, he was ''in awe,'' he said.
She added, ''When things are supposed to happen, they pop into your life, and you have to go for it.''

HEADLINE: The Tax-Cut Deal

 BODY:
As it became clear last week that Congress would pass the tax-cut deal he made with Republicans, President Obama said it ''proves that both parties can in fact work together to grow our economy and look out for the American people.'' It proves no such thing.
Mr. Obama himself described the talks that led to the $858 billion deal as a hostage negotiation. The Bush-era ''middle class'' tax cuts were extended for two years, along with other tax cuts that both sides wanted; the cost is high -- $485 billion -- but the breaks will support consumer spending while the economy is weak. 
Mr. Obama knows, however, that significant parts of the deal -- especially the two-year, $139 billion extension of the high-end Bush-era tax cuts and the generous new estate tax provisions for multimillionaires and billionaires -- will generate relatively little new growth. And because excessive tax cuts worsen the deficit, they actually threaten Americans by creating pressure to cut spending on other programs that actually are needed.
In exchange for high-end tax breaks, Mr. Obama won a 13-month extension of federal jobless benefits, a modest one-year cut in payroll taxes and other temporary measures for businesses and low-income families. All other things being equal, those measures could help to raise economic growth by as much as a percentage point. All other things, however, will not remain equal.
New stimulus spending is undermined if it is offset by cuts in existing spending -- and, in the next Congress, Republicans will clamor for immediate budget cuts. Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader, praised the tax-cut deal last week, precisely because he believes it will begin to force spending cuts. John Boehner, the incoming House speaker, has called for a spending level in 2011 that is more than $100 billion lower than President Obama wanted, though he has not said which programs he would cut to achieve those savings.
So the fight has just begun, and only one thing is sure. Unless Mr. Obama finds his voice and develops a plan to rebut calls for premature spending cuts, the tax-cut deal will not do as much good as he says it will.
For starters, he needs to say ''no'' to spending cuts that would undermine the stimulus in the tax-cut deal. If genuine compromise requires cuts in 2011, they must come from programs that serve a marginal public purpose. Among the first on our list would be subsidies for corn ethanol and other farm products, which have long been untouchable but no longer can be.
Through it all, Mr. Obama must explain that deficits are a serious, long-term problem. They have exceeded $1 trillion a year for the past three years, largely because of the recession, and will shrink in the near term as the economy recovers. But by the end of the decade, they will breach the $1 trillion mark again, even if the economy is performing well, mainly because of chronically low taxes and rapidly rising health care costs.
Deficits are not as pressing a problem as economic recovery. A stronger recovery must not only come first, but is the best way to begin to heal the budget. Fighting to uphold health care reform is also crucial, because, in the long run, that is key to taming the deficit.
Further, near-term stimulus must be paired with a credible plan to reduce deficits as the economy recovers -- including tax reform that raises revenue through various changes, like a simplified income tax, a new value added tax and a financial transactions tax. Even though he agreed to extend the Bush tax cuts through 2012, Mr. Obama must educate the public on their ruinous effects: They account for roughly 40 percent of today's deficit, a share that will grow over time.
When deficit reduction begins in earnest, tax increases and cuts in big-ticket programs -- Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and defense -- will be the focus. Before that, Mr. Obama must not be drawn into nickel-and-dime cuts that will not solve the deficit problem -- and will impede recovery. He made a deal with the Republicans. Now he has to get them to live with it.

HEADLINE: THE ROBERTS COURT; Justices Offer Receptive Ear to Business Interests

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Almost 40 years ago, a Virginia lawyer named Lewis F. Powell Jr. warned that the nation's free enterprise system was under attack. He urged the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to assemble ''a highly competent staff of lawyers'' and retain outside counsel ''of national standing and reputation'' to appear before the Supreme Court and advance the interests of American business.
''Under our constitutional system, especially with an activist-minded Supreme Court,'' he wrote, ''the judiciary may be the most important instrument for social, economic and political change.''
Mr. Powell, who joined the Supreme Court a year later in 1972 and died in 1998, got his wish -- and never more so than with the court led by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. 
The chamber now files briefs in most major business cases. The side it supported in the last term won 13 of 16 cases. Six of those were decided with a majority vote of five justices, and five of those decisions favored the chamber's side. One of the them was Citizens United, in which the chamber successfully urged the court to guarantee what it called ''free corporate speech'' by lifting restrictions on campaign spending.
The chamber's success rate is but one indication of the Roberts court's leanings on business issues. A new study, prepared for The New York Times by scholars at Northwestern University and the University of Chicago, analyzed some 1,450 decisions since 1953. It showed that the percentage of business cases on the Supreme Court docket has grown in the Roberts years, as has the percentage of cases won by business interests.
The Roberts court, which has completed five terms, ruled for business interests 61 percent of the time, compared with 46 percent in the last five years of the court led by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who died in 2005, and 42 percent by all courts since 1953.
Those differences are statistically significant, the study found. It was prepared by Lee Epstein, a political scientist at Northwestern's law school; William M. Landes, an economist at the University of Chicago; and Judge Richard A. Posner, who serves on the federal appeals court in Chicago and teaches law at the University of Chicago.
The Roberts court's engagement with business issues has risen along with the emergence of a breed of lawyers specializing in Supreme Court advocacy, many of them veterans of the United States solicitor general's office, which represents the federal government in the court.
These specialists have been extraordinarily successful, both in persuading the court to hear business cases and to rule in favor of their clients. The Supreme Court's business docket has stayed active in the current term, which began in October. In a single week this month, the court heard arguments in a case brought by the chamber challenging an Arizona law that imposes penalties on companies that hire illegal workers, and it agreed to hear two cases that could reshape class-action and environmental law.
The chamber had urged the court to hear both cases. It said one of them, an enormous sex-discrimination class-action lawsuit against Wal-Mart, posed ''grave risks for American business.'' It said the other, a suit by eight states against power companies over carbon dioxide emissions, ''has potentially disastrous implications for the U.S. business community.''
The court's docket is studded with other important business cases as well, including ones concerning consumer class-action suits and claims of employment discrimination and securities fraud. The chamber has filed supporting briefs in all of them. In AT&T Mobility v. Concepcion, for instance, the chamber urged the court to allow companies to use standard-form contracts that in essence forbid consumers who sign them from pursuing class-action suits. In Thompson v. North American Stainless, the chamber asked the court to forbid some employment discrimination claims, saying that ''it costs, on average, over $120,000 just to defend a wrongful-discharge claim.''
Next month, the court will hear arguments in 11 cases. The chamber says it will file briefs in seven of them.
The Chamber's Success
The Chamber of Commerce spent tens of millions of dollars in the recent midterm elections, mostly to help Republican candidates. It says that it has 300,000 members, businesses and organizations ''of every size, sector and region,'' and that its spending furthered the interests of some three million businesses, most of them small ones.
But the chamber's mission is by no means limited to the elected branches of government. ''A central function of the chamber,'' it told the Supreme Court in a recent brief, ''is to represent the interests of its members in important matters before the courts.''
The vehicle for that is the litigation unit that was envisioned by Mr. Powell, the National Chamber Litigation Center, which says it is ''the voice of business in the courts on issues of national concern to the business community.''
Its board includes executives from some of the nation's biggest companies, including Ford, Verizon, Lockheed Martin, Viacom and GlaxoSmithKline.
On the center's 30th anniversary in 2007, Carter G. Phillips, who often represents the chamber and has argued more Supreme Court cases than any active lawyer in private practice, reflected on its influence. ''I know from personal experience that the chamber's support carries significant weight with the justices,'' he wrote. ''Except for the solicitor general representing the United States, no single entity has more influence on what cases the Supreme Court decides and how it decides them than the National Chamber Litigation Center.''
A study prepared by the Constitutional Accountability Center, a liberal group, examined the center's success rate in the Supreme Court. It found that the positions supported by the chamber prevailed 68 percent of the time in the Roberts court, compared with 56 percent in the last 11 years of the Rehnquist court, a period without changes in the court's membership. Robin S. Conrad, executive vice president of the chamber's litigation unit, said the center's analysis was flattering but superficial, and she questioned its comparisons.
The chamber does not participate in all business cases, she said. The mix of cases before the court has changed over time. And the chamber has become more active. But Ms. Conrad acknowledged her group's exceptional track record. ''Why have we been successful?'' she asked. ''I'd like to think it's because of the quality of the arguments and the briefs we present to the court.''
''The court is looking for reliable voices to confirm its decisions, and I'd like to think it's looking to the chamber because it tells a straight story, and we try not to be shrill or ideological,'' Ms. Conrad said. ''The chamber has earned a reputation for being a credible voice of business.''
Doug Kendall, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, drew a different conclusion, saying the numbers proved that the Roberts court increasingly sided with corporate interests. He also said the study documented ''a sharp ideological divide that did not exist before 2005.'' In the last 11 terms of the Rehnquist court, the five more conservative justices voted for the chamber's position 61 percent of the time, while the four more liberal justices voted for it 48 percent of the time.
In the first five terms of the Roberts court, the corresponding bloc of five more conservative justices voted for the chamber's position 74 percent of the time, and the four more liberal justices 43 percent of the time.
But counting votes is not the same thing as assessing results, Ms. Conrad said. ''Our research has shown that the vast majority of business decisions are decided by a lopsided majority of 7 to 2 or more,'' she said.
Over the Roberts court's first five terms, Ms. Conrad said, only 10 percent of the business docket was decided by the classic 5-to-4 split, with Justice Anthony M. Kennedy joining the court's four more conservative members in the majority.
The idea that the Supreme Court reflexively rules for the chamber and other business interests is too simplistic, many legal scholars and practitioners say. If the court favors business, they say, it is as part of a broader orientation toward free markets and a wariness of many kinds of lawsuits.
''The Roberts court appears to be a mainstream, traditional, modern Republican, conservative court,'' said Bradley W. Joondeph, a law professor at Santa Clara University and a former law clerk to Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. ''Part of its constellation of commitments is against the regulation of business and, in particular, the regulation of business through litigation.''
A prominent Supreme Court advocate who often represents businesses, Maureen E. Mahoney, chose her words carefully when asked at a chamber news briefing in September whether the Roberts court was especially receptive to the kinds of arguments pressed by corporations.
''The best court for getting a fair hearing on those issues,'' she said, ''is the Supreme Court.''
Government Experience
An additional explanation for the recent successes of business interests in the Supreme Court may lie in the rise of specialized practice groups at major law firms led by veterans of the solicitor general's office.
Turning service as United States solicitor general into a career at a commercial firm is a relatively new phenomenon, according to a recent article by Matthew L. Sundquist in The Charleston Law Review.
From 1952 to 1981, he wrote, former solicitors general usually became judges, joined law schools or worked as public servants. In the next 15 years, they split their time between academic and legal work, often consulting with law firms with specialized Supreme Court practices.
Starting in 1996, every former solicitor general, with one exception, has gone on to supervise a Supreme Court practice at a major law firm, earning as much as $5 million a year. The exception is Justice Elena Kagan, who joined the court in August.
These specialists make their livings representing business interests, and they have used the skills they honed in government service to achieve notable successes in the Supreme Court. They had a particularly good run, for instance, in environmental cases in the term that ended in 2009.
''For the first time, a series of industry clients last term turned repeatedly to the expert Supreme Court bar for assistance in a host of cases arising under federal pollution control laws,'' Richard J. Lazarus, a law professor at Georgetown, wrote in The Yale Law Journal Online last February. ''The result was palpable and formed the basis of the best term that industry has ever enjoyed before the court in environmental cases.''
Among these lawyers were some of the most prominent members of the specialized Supreme Court bar. Though the odds of obtaining Supreme Court review are about one in 100, these lawyers persuaded the court to hear four cases that ''would not have seemed to have a remote chance of review,'' Professor Lazarus wrote. They won every time.
In one of the cases, Theodore B. Olson, who had served as solicitor general in the administration of President George W. Bush, persuaded the court not only to hear the case but also to rule for his client, making it easier to dump mining waste into an Alaskan lake.
In another big environmental case, Miguel A. Estrada, also a veteran of the solicitor general's office, persuaded the Supreme Court not to hear a case, though the lower courts were split on the question it presented and the federal government had implored the justices to resolve it.
Mr. Estrada's client, McWane Inc., a pipe manufacturer in Alabama, had been convicted of discharging untreated industrial pollutants into a creek. An appeals court threw out the conviction and a $5 million fine, saying the creek was not covered by the Clean Water Act. Mr. Estrada's skill in persuading the court to let that decision stand was the term's coup de grace, Professor Lazarus wrote.
But a broader look at the Roberts court's environmental cases by Jonathan H. Adler, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University, found no pro-business trend. ''The Roberts court's environmental decisions issued to date suggest neither a disposition toward business nor a hostility toward environmental regulation,'' Professor Adler wrote in his article, published last year in The Santa Clara Law Review. ''The 'pro-business' position has prevailed in some cases, and lost in others. If the relative magnitude of the cases is taken into account, it is even more difficult to argue that the Roberts court has been 'pro-business' in this area.''
There has been less dispute about the victories business groups have recently enjoyed in other areas of the law.
David L. Franklin, a law professor at DePaul University, wrote in another article in The Santa Clara Law Review last year that the chamber had been quite successful in the Roberts court in four of what he considered five main categories of cases -- punitive damages, arbitration of consumer and other disputes, the standards for early dismissal of lawsuits, and federal pre-emption of state laws governing injury and other suits. The ''conspicuous exception,'' he said, was employment discrimination.
The numbers support Professor Franklin's conclusions, but they are small and not statistically significant.
Even in employment discrimination cases, however, the available numbers are subject to two interpretations. True, the Roberts court's 16 decisions have been evenly divided, according to an analysis by Professor Epstein at Northwestern. But the Rehnquist court ruled in favor of people claiming discrimination more often -- 64 percent of the time.
All of this is to say that determining whether the Supreme Court is ''pro-business'' or ''anti-business'' can be difficult. There will always be exceptions.
''The story of a conservative, activist, pro-corporatist Roberts court may sound compelling at first blush, particularly with its repetition and regrettable distortion of the cases involved, but it is just a story -- and a fictional one at that,'' Robert Alt, a lawyer with the Heritage Foundation, a conservative group, testified at Justice Kagan's confirmation hearings last summer.
He listed several major cases in which the Roberts court had ruled against business interests, including a drug maker and a tobacco company. He also noted that some of the court's more important pro-business cases, including ones casting doubt on the conviction of an Enron executive and cutting the punitive damages in the Exxon Valdez oil spill, were written by liberal justices.
It is clear, though, that the Supreme Court these days is increasingly focused on business issues. ''The fraction of business cases on the docket has grown from 21 percent in the last five years of the Rehnquist court to 27 percent during the Roberts years,'' Professor Epstein said. ''This isn't a small jump.''
Ms. Conrad, of the chamber, said part of her group's role was to keep its agenda before a court that is deciding about half as many cases as it did in the 1980s.
One way to do that, she said, is by filing briefs urging the court to hear particular cases, an effort that is ordinarily a 1-in-100 long shot. But the chamber has succeeded about 30 percent of the time in persuading the Roberts court to take its cases, Ms. Conrad said.
''There has been a return on investment, not to sound too crass,'' she said.
The Roberts Court: Articles in this series are exploring the workings of this Supreme Court and the little- understood forces that influence it.

 Agreement With the Chamber of Commerce: The Roberts court has ruled in favor of the position taken by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce more than two-thirds of the time, according to a study by the Constitutional Accountability Center, a liberal group. This rate is higher than it was in the previous decade, and there is a greater divide between the court's more liberal and more conservative justices.

HEADLINE: We Said It, 2010

BYLINE: By SAM SIFTON and GRANT BARRETT


HIGHLIGHT: Grant Barrett is a lexicographer specializing in slang and new words. He is a host of the public radio program ''A Way With Words'' and vice president of the American Dialect Society, devoted since 1889 to the study of English in North America.

 BODY:
There are buzzwords and there are great words. (Retweet.)
Vuvuzela is a great word, one of the best to enter American popular culture in 2010, though it sounds nothing like an actual vuvuzela. A vuvuzela sounds like a long, droning moan, a sound full of garbage and tennis balls.
The vuvuzela's long, plastic barrel provided Americans with the junk shot of sounds this year, the sort of noise you could hear even through a containment dome placed over a gushing underwater oil well owned by BP. (Though if you take a vuvuzela to the airport, you're going to get an enhanced pat-down, sure as we could be entering a double-dip recession.)
Close your eyes while someone blows a vuvuzela and you can see all this clearly, as if it were playing on a spill-cam over your Web browser at work. Open them and it's just a World Cup game highlight (speaking of great words: Uruguay vs. Ghana). 
And the oil kept coming, all summer long, and with it new words -- top kill, statickill, bottom kill -- that meant failure, until at bottom they didn't. (There may be put-backs for mortgage bonds. It doesn't work so well with oil.)
Everyone was glad that the fish kill wasn't as bad as it might have been. Dispersants may have worked. But the blowout preventer did not.
Refudiate is almost a better word than vuvuzela, because it's not so much a real word as a neologism, one much of America attributes to Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska, who used it in a Twitter message in July. (She took a real shellacking for that.) The Oxford University Press called it the word of the year.
But refudiate was not Ms. Palin's word first, even if she unpacked the portmanteau all by her lonesome. David Segal of The New York Times had it in print in late June, in an article about people who sell marijuana for a living. They are not easy to interview.
''Simple yes-or-no questions yield 10-minute soliloquies,'' he wrote. ''Words are coined on the spot, like 'refudiate,' and regular words are used in ways that make sense only in context.''
It's like a halfalogue, talking to those guys.
Speaking of, did you see ''Inception''? (Can Ms. Palin refudiate a claim that she took the word refudiate from a sleeping marijuana salesman?) Did you i-dose on Justin Bieber videos (I'm a Belieber!) or contemplate becoming one of the Hollywood star whackers who sent Randy Quaid around a bend and up to Canada to seek asylum? Did you weep along with HungryBear's double rainbow on YouTube, then seek double rainbows yourself?
Most important of all, did you stand for or against the ground zero mosque near the ground zero Century 21, some blocks away from ground zero itself but almost directly next door to a bar?
G.Z.M. was a big word for 2010, until it was not. On that subject, there was quantitative easing as soon as the midterm elections were over.
QE2! -- Sam Sifton
The Words That Made the Year
The old and new puns, slang and jargon that we lived with this year. Compiled by Grant Barrett.
Pop Culture
belieber: A fan of Justin Bieber, the Canadian pop singer who also spawned ...
the Justin Bieber: A haircut also known as the flip and switch, the flow, or the twitch. Now driving parents crazy everywhere.
G.T.L.: For ''gym, tan, laundry,'' the life philosophy of the Situation, otherwise known as Mike Sorrentino of the reality TV program ''Jersey Shore.'' You laugh, but it's worked for him.
i-dosing: A supposed digital drug. Certain soundwaves, the claim goes, give listeners a high. Skeptics abound, watchful parents are everywhere.
star whacker: The latest in celeb coinage. In October, the actor Randy Quaid and his wife, Evi, begged for asylum in Canada, claiming fear of star whackers, people who had already killed other famous people and were out to get them, too.
Communicating
coffice: In South Korea, a coffee shop habitually used as an office by customers, who mooch its space, electricity, Wi-Fi and other resources. Presumably, they pay for the coffee.
halfalogue: Half of a conversation, like an overheard phone call. The term was coined in the research paper ''Overheard Cell-Phone Conversations: When Less Speech is More Distracting'' in the journal Psychological Science.
sofalize: A British marketing term created for people who prefer to stay home and communicate with others electronically.
mansplainer: A man compelled to explain or give an opinion about everything -- especially to a woman. He speaks, often condescendingly, even if he doesn't know what he's talking about or even if it's none of his business. Old term: a boor.
social graph: The structure of personal networks, who people know and how they know them, especially online. The term probably came from the internal lingo at Facebook, but it has spread widely among technology companies.
Politics
demon sheep: The political ad that captured critics everywhere for being ''baaad,'' as The Wall Street Journal put it. The Senate campaign of Carly Fiorina used and retired the ad, but other campaigns quickly created their own parodies.
mama grizzly: Coined by Sarah Palin, ''mama grizzly'' is the conservative woman's battle cry, referring to mothers who ferociously defend their children or policies that benefit them. Often used with humor. In her new book, Ms. Palin wrote that it's ''bear propaganda'' to insist that these bears are cute and cuddly.
poutrage: False outrage, usually put on for personal, financial or political gain.
refudiate: Another Palinism, this time a blend of refute and repudiate. Now used with an eyebrow raised.
shellacking: President Obama's preferred way to describe what happened to Democrats in the midterm elections. Some might call it a knock-down punch.
Travel
cuddle class: Economy-class airplane seats that unfold into a bed or couch, as proposed by Air New Zealand, which calls them ''Skycouch'' seats.
porno scanner: A full-body security scanner that provoked outrage at airports and on blogs. Also called strip-search scanners and, more politely, by the Transportation Security Administration, advanced imaging technology.
enhanced pat-down: Frisking in which security workers slide the palms of their hands down a person's body in a search for contraband or weapons.
Economy
double-dip recession: What economists talked about, and what every Obama administration official feared.
flash crash: The mystery of the financial markets this year: a May 6 market drop of almost 1,000 points.
peak water: Like ''peak oil,'' a theory that humans may have used the water easiest to obtain, and that scarcity may be on the rise.
QE2: Not the ocean liner, but the abbreviation for the Fed's latest round of quantitative easing, its purchase of Treasury bonds. The term is usually used by critics derisively, and often in combination with another disaster, the sinking of the Titanic.
robo-signer and put-back: Even for people who never read their mortgage documents, these terms became inescapable as the foreclosure crisis hit. For the record, a robo-signer approves mortgage foreclosure notices without verifying its contents. A put-back is a mortgage sold back to an institutional seller because of problems with documentation.
The Oil Spill
containment dome: After the April 20 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon, everyone became an engineer. The containment dome? Yes, that seals the leak.
junk shot: Plugging the leak with old tires, golf balls and other debris.
static kill: Sealing the well by pumping in a synthetic mud from the top.
bottom kill: The same technique, only many thousands of feet further down the well through a relief well. How we got this education: the 24-hour spillcam that broadcast the leak.
Things
inception: Popularized by the movie ''Inception,'' the word expanded from its usual meaning and now refers to ideas planted in the dreams of other people.
double rainbow: A phrase from the hugely popular YouTube video by Paul Vasquez, featuring his breathless amazement at the sight of two rainbows at Yosemite National Park. It spawned parodies, television commercials, dance mixes, Auto-Tune versions, parties and Halloween costumes, and is now used to refer -- ironically and not -- to something amazing.
E.V.: An electric vehicle. While the term has been around for decades, there are now more cars like the Nissan Leaf and the Chevy Volt, which makes it more than an environmentalist's pipeless dream.
G.Z.M.: An acronym for ground zero mosque -- the shorthand term for a controversial Muslim community center proposed near the site where the World Trade Center was attacked.
vuvuzela: The South African plastic trumpet that invaded, like locusts, the World Cup matches in Johannesburg. Television viewers, as well as participants, couldn't escape the buzzzzz.
Weird: Western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic, an acronym and criticism of the typical subjects in studies by behavioral scientists. That is, they tend to be the easiest to recruit: undergraduates.

HEADLINE: Globalism and Chicago: A Link We Can't Ignore

BYLINE: By JAMES WARREN. 
jwarren@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
James Warren writes a column for the Chicago News Cooperative
It may surprise Chicago's mayoral candidates, but Chris Kennedy, lord of a showroom and convention empire, urges that we all think inside the box.
Mr. Kennedy, president of Merchandise Mart Properties Inc., was in his Mart office last week explaining the global context from which to view Chicago's present and future -- notwithstanding the encroaching deluge of budget deficits and pension liabilities.
''Chair designs,'' he said simply. 
I harked back to the scene in ''The Graduate'' in which a boyish Dustin Hoffman is counseled by a smug businessman: ''I just want to say one word to you. Just one word. 'Plastics.' ''
Chairs.
''There have been enormous changes in chair designs,'' said Mr. Kennedy, 47, who runs one of the world's largest producers of trade and consumer shows, itself a source of his famous family's good fortune. ''And I'd submit that incredibly influential decisions in design have to do with how a chair fits into the cubes in shipping containers.''
Globalism thus affects ''your tush,'' said Mr. Kennedy, a son of former Senator Robert F. Kennedy, but it also affects the Mart and all of Chicago.
I wanted to sit down -- on any chair -- and talk after hearing him here at a worldwide gathering of elected officials, planners and businessmen. Introducing both a United Nations under secretary general and a former mayor of Sao Paulo, Brazil, Mr. Kennedy had been so intriguing in alluding to the nuts-and-bolts nexus of the world economy that I wanted him to elaborate.
Twenty years ago, he said, the Mart's real estate competitors were mostly along LaSalle Street or Wacker Drive, and its trade shows competed with those in Dallas, Atlanta and Las Vegas. Now its real estate rivals are huge real estate investment trusts in Boston and New York, as well as funds in Canada and California and real estate firms as far away as Australia.
Since Chicago's predictably anticlimactic faux news of the week -- Rahm Emanuel's residency hearing -- which included Mr. Emanuel's mention of his wife's wedding gown being stored in their basement here, bridal gowns were a coincidentally relevant topic. At the Mart, the gowns issue is a much more serious and global matter.
The granddaddy of bridal gown shows is held at the Mart each fall. Two years ago, American companies, which were importing much from China, hit the limit on the finished-goods fabric products that could enter the United States without stiff tariffs. That meant those companies could not participate in the two annual bridal trade shows.
Then there was the recession's impact on the falling price of nylon. As a result, Koch Industries, a conglomerate that has gained notice for huge contributions to Republicans, closed a chunk of its European nylon extrusion business central to making carpets.
Koch became more cautious about adding showroom space at the Mart, as well as retail space on Clybourn Avenue and back-office space in the South Loop. Delaying decisions, shortening lease spans and decreasing build-outs meant less work for carpenters, painters, electricians and Mr. Kennedy.
Mr. Kennedy seemed as prepared for me as Tom Brady was for his evisceration of the Bears last Sunday. He took out photos of landmark steel high-rises -- the Willis Tower, Hancock Center and Lake Point Tower -- and then led me to a corner window looking east.
He pointed toward new, mostly residential, high-rises largely built of concrete. Chinese demand for iron ore and steel affects the way we design. We've abandoned our Mies van der Rohe ''roots,'' Mr. Kennedy said, and our city looks different.
There are inevitable family mementos in his office, including a poster from a 1968 fund-raiser for his dad's presidential campaign at which Sonny and Cher and the Byrds performed. He is, after all, a genetically political animal who toyed with running for President Obama's old Senate seat last year.
His father even cast a shadow on his chairmanship of the University of Illinois board of trustees. In September, the board denied William Ayers, the 1960s radical, emeritus faculty status after Mr. Kennedy argued that Mr. Ayers had dedicated a book to, among many others, the man who killed his father in 1968.
It was a fervent, if debatable, decision. But Mr. Kennedy appears to be a smart and passionate fellow -- and droll about idiosyncratic family members we know in common. He cares about the city and wonders if we just don't understand our place in a global environment.
He cited the ''cheap shots'' of politician critics of Mayor Richard M. Daley who chide his extensive overseas travels. Mr. Kennedy's implicit point was obvious and inarguable: It's a big world out there.

HEADLINE: When the Art Stared Back And Other Trends

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:
WHAT a long, strange year it has been. As disillusion with the Obama presidency took hold in many quarters, and a Republican majority prepared to take control of the House in January, it seemed only fitting that the specter of the 1980s culture wars should rear its cynical, bigoted head.
A few harsh words from the conservative Catholic League and a handful of congressmen caused the secretary of the Smithsonian Institution to order the removal of a truncated version of a 1987 video by the activist-artist David Wojnarowicz from an exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery. The piece included 11 seconds of ants crawling over a plastic and wood crucifix that, it was said, would offend Christians. This institutional crumbling in the face of what was after all only criticism (hello!) showed a shocking lack of intellectual spine. Heaven forfend that art should challenge people with its intense emotions or with thoughts they don't already think.
Buoyant auction prices followed by brisk sales at Art Basel Miami maintained the illusion that the art world was somehow immune to the recession. But there are growing signs that the second shoe has yet to drop. 
A telling detail: In New York many galleries started extending exhibitions. An unusually high number mounted only two in the four-month fall season. Six-month shows became more frequent among smaller museums like the American Folk Art Museum, the Museum of Arts & Design and the Neue Galerie, as well as others around the country. This contributed to the feeling that some of the city's more fragile museums and non-blue-chip art galleries were barely scraping by.
In museums participatory art was noticeably on the rise, creating an illusion of egalitarianism. Visitors to the retrospective of the performance pioneer Marina Abramovic at the Museum of Modern Art could enter the exhibition by walking between closely spaced nude performers standing at attention, and hold staring contests with Ms. Abramovic in the museum's atrium. In the Whitney Museum's Christian Marclay exhibition visitors wrote musical notes (and lots of other stuff) on a wall for pianists to improvise from.
Things were taken further at the Guggenheim Museum, where Tino Sehgal combined the participatory and the invisible. He demonstrated that it is possible to have an engaging art exhibition involving nothing but walking and talking. It helped to have Frank Lloyd Wright's spiraling rotunda serving as an architectural metaphor for the path of life. (Another blow for the nonvisible was struck by Susan Philipsz, the first sound artist to win the Tate Britain's prestigious Turner Prize.)
One of the bigger and better participatory ventures of the year occurred atop the Metropolitan Museum of Art, of all places. There the artist twins Mike and Doug Starn -- best known for large, taped-together photo-objects -- extended their piecemeal assembly technique to engineer an enormous, thatchlike bamboo scaffolding that seemed to erupt from the museum's decorous roof garden. Tied together with rock-climbing cord in a manner used in construction sites around South America and Asia, ''Big Bambu'' offered visitors breathtaking views of the city from an elevated labyrinth of passageways, porous tunnels and lookout points that creaked and swayed in the wind.
Not all viewer participation worked out as planned. The Chinese provocateur Ai Weiwei covered much of the floor of the Tate Modern's immense Turbine Hall with several inches of hand-painted porcelain sunflower seeds. They were intended to be walked on, sat on and handled by visitors, as a kind of crunchy, tactile surrogate for China's 1.3 billion people. But after two days ceramic dust stirred up by the public also raised alarm about respiratory hazards; standard viewing procedures -- look, don't touch -- were imposed for the duration of the seven-month installation.
On other occasions thinking big went exactly nowhere. Given the run of the Park Avenue Armory Drill Hall and a sizable budget, the veteran filmmaker Peter Greenaway basically came up empty with ''Leonardo's Last Supper.'' Subtitled ''A Vision by Peter Greenaway,'' this glitzy, tedious exercise in high-tech imaging alternately magnified the fresco's flaking surface into desertlike landscapes and imbued its figures with the dimensionality of a carved tourist souvenir. Perhaps attempting to compensate for the virtual visual harassment of Leonardo's masterpiece, Mr. Greenaway actually compounded the fiasco by adding a cannibalized version of his digital meditation on Veronese's immense painting ''The Wedding at Cana.'' It was an entertainingly site-specific spectacle in the summer of 2009 when projected in a lavish Benedictine refectory in Venice for which the work, now at the Louvre, was painted. Here it merely contributed to a flop so spectacular that it almost made you feel sorry for its creator. Almost.
One of the year's brighter signs was the visibility of female artists on all fronts. In the scrum of exhibitions surrounding the Frieze Art Fair in London, the small survey of Klara Liden's architectural interventions and re-creations at the Serpentine Gallery, the forward-looking alternative space in Regent's Park, was a standout. Back in New York a newly refurbished Artists Space showed work by the overlooked German Minimalist Charlotte Posenenske; and the Elizabeth Dee Gallery rented a floor of the building formerly known as the Dia Center for the Arts to amount a spacious Dia-like survey of the work of the influential Conceptual artist Adrian Piper.
At the Metropolitan Museum of Art the exhibition ''Playing With Pictures: The Art of Victorian Photocollage'' proposed that the onset of collage be moved back nearly half a century and across the English Channel, out of the studios of the Cubists and into the drawing-rooms of upper-class British women making tableaus from cut-up photographs. At the Modern ''On Line: Drawing Through the Twentieth Century'' teems with work by little-known or under-shown women. The Neuberger Museum or Art in Purchase, N.Y., resurrected Faith Ringgold's staunch early paintings, and the Brooklyn Museum added a roster of women to the history of Pop Art. And in New York galleries substantial shows by women have been abundant, including those by newcomers like Liz Magic Laser, Shio Kusaka, Keltie Ferris and Tatiana Trouve, as well as better-known artists like Sarah Sze, Anya Kielar, Huma Bhabha, Claire Pentecost, Rineke Dijkstra, Mika Rottenberg, Siobhan Liddell, Pipilotti Rist and Joan Snyder. Diverse in age, style and medium, the girls are all right, and getting better all the time. Too bad they don't run Washington yet.
Correction: December 26, 2010, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A credit last Sunday with a picture of a construction by the sculptor Huma Bhabha misidentified the gallery that provided the photograph. It was Salon 94 -- not Peter Blum Gallery, New York.

TIMOTHY EGAN It's when John Boehner talks about how he rose from his humble past -- the son of a bar owner, one of 12 children who grew up in a small home with a single bathroom -- that he starts to weep. ''Making sure these kids have a shot at the American Dream like I did is very important,'' he said, choking up, when asked on ''60 Minutes'' about his crying.
But a look at Boehner's record during his two decades in Congress shows a man who has voted against nearly every boost for the working stiff. There's no empathy for those with the longest shots at the American Dream in his voting pattern. Instead, we see a politician who is hard-hearted in his legislative treatment of the people now coping with the kind of economic conditions in which the Boehner family grew up.

LINDA GREENHOUSE It has been 15 years since the Rehnquist court began applying the constitutional brakes to assertions of federal power that had seemed unassailable since the New Deal. Its first target was modest, a five-year-old federal statute called the Gun-Free School Zones Act that most people had never heard of, which made it a federal crime to possess a gun within 1,000 feet of a school.
The vote in United States v. Lopez was 5 to 4. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote the court's opinion, observing that the Constitution's commerce clause did not confer on Congress a general police power disconnected from the regulation of economic activity. To uphold this statute, he said, would be to blur the ''distinction between what is truly national and what is truly local.'' For the first time since 1936, the Supreme Court struck down a federal law as exceeding Congress's commerce power.
In dissent, Justice David H. Souter warned that ''it seems fair to ask whether the step taken by the court today does anything but portend a return to the untenable jurisprudence from which the court extricated itself almost 60 years ago.''
Thus began the Rehnquist court's federalism revolution.

''The Revolution Next Time?''
STANLEY FISH A few weeks ago at a conference, I listened to a distinguished political philosopher tell those in attendance that he would not be speaking before them had he not been the beneficiary, as a working-class youth in England, of a government policy to provide a free university education to the children of British citizens. He walked into the university with little knowledge of the great texts that inform modern democracy and he walked out an expert in those very same texts. It goes without saying that he did not know what he was doing at the outset; he did not, that is, think to himself, I would like to be come a scholar of Locke, Hobbes and Mill. But that's what he became, not by choice (at least in the beginning) but by opportunity.
That opportunity, which he might otherwise have been barred from by class and a lack of funds, is not likely to be extended to young men and women in England today, especially if the recommendations of the Browne report, ''Securing a Sustainable Future for Higher Education,'' are implemented by a government that seemed to welcome them and, some suspect, mandated them.
-- Excerpt from ''The Value of Higher Education Made Literal''
THE STONE A wave of scientists and philosophers are working in the areas known as ''embodied cognition'' and ''the extended mind.'' Uniting these fields is the thought that evolution and learning don't give a jot what resources are used to solve a problem.
Brains play a major role, of course. They are the locus of great plasticity and processing power. But spare a thought for the many resources whose task-related bursts of activity take place elsewhere, not just in the physical motions of our hands and arms while reasoning, or in the muscles of the dancer or the sports star, but even outside the biological body -- in the iPhones, BlackBerrys, laptops and organizers that transform and extend the reach of our processing in so many ways.
This activity may sometimes be best seen as bio-external elements in an extended cognitive process: one that now crisscrosses the conventional boundaries of skin and skull.

HEADLINE: The President and the Passions

BYLINE: By MARK LILLA. 
Mark Lilla is professor of humanities at Columbia University.

 BODY:
Shortly before his party's crushing defeat in last November's elections, President Obama ruminated about why he and his policies had become so unpopular and offered the following thought. ''The reason that our politics seems so tough right now, and facts and science and argument does not seem to be winning the day all the time, is because we're hard-wired not to always think clearly when we're scared.'' On another occasion, admitting that his administration ''probably spent much more time trying to get the policy right than trying to get the politics right,'' he concluded that ''anybody who's occupied this office has to remember that success is determined by an intersection in policy and politics and that you can't be neglecting of marketing and P.R.'' 
If this is the way the president and his party think about human psychology, it's little wonder they've taken such a beating. Their assumption seems to be that we are basically rational creatures who, left to our own devices, have little trouble discerning what our interests are and how to serve them. It's only when our passions get the better of us, when we are angry or fearful or exuberant, that we make bad decisions. That's really what's the matter with Kansas, and with the Tea Party activists. So the administration has to work harder to ''get the message out'' and ''sell'' its program; to calm people it needs to give them clearer, more complete and more attractively packaged information about how it is working in their interests. Bring in the pie charts, by all means, but print them on glossier paper.
The wisdom of this approach depends on whether the underlying assumption about human nature is right. But is it? Not, at least, according to virtually every Western philosopher and theologian from antiquity to the 18th-century. From Plato to St. Augustine to Thomas Hobbes, the shared assumption was that human beings are fundamentally passionate creatures and that reason alone is too weak to contain our drives. In the ''Republic,'' Socrates makes the point by developing an image of the soul as being inhabited by three creatures: a multiheaded hydra of desires, a ferocious but tameable lion and a rational little man. On the face of it, the man looks outnumbered 2 to 1. But Socrates tries to persuade his interlocutors that the man can train the passionate lion, not by explaining things (lions are without speech) but by training him to be loyal as you would any animal. Then the lion will protect the man against the hydra. St. Augustine had a more pessimistic view of the passions, considered most sinful, and believed that only divine grace can help us restrain them. Hobbes was more pessimistic still, because he didn't believe in grace. He said that human beings would become reasonable only when they ceased fearing one another, and that would happen only if they were more fearful of a powerful absolute sovereign who kept them all in check.
That's pretty much where matters stood until the 18th century. As the economist Albert Hirschman explained in his classic, and again timely, book, ''The Passions and the Interests'' (1977), it was then that leading figures of the Enlightenment began exploring the idea of ''interests.'' Having witnessed the destruction caused by religious zeal and the chivalric ideal of honor in Europe, thinkers like Montesquieu in France and David Hume in Scotland began to consider how our drives, which they considered more essential to our nature than reason, might be channeled in less violent, more productive directions. They conjectured that if a third psychological force, a universal desire to improve our condition, were allowed to operate freely, it would be enough to bring individuals' reason and passions into harmony.
This drew them to economics, not because they cared much about business but because they thought commercial activity and the promise of gain could indirectly make people more foresighted and restrained. They had no utopian illusions about creating a world of rational, affectless machines. Like Adam Smith, they simply thought that if the pursuit of private interest were treated as legitimate (not sinful) and were properly regulated (crucial), you could create a society in which military valor was less prized than business acumen, in which capturing a market was more attractive than looting a village.
That was the idea. But as Hirschman pointed out, this balance between enlightened self-interest and moderated passions disappeared in the rapid industrialization of the 19th century. Once self-interest was blessed, there arose a capitalist ideology justifying the limitless accumulation of wealth, and in response to it a socialist ideology justifying the violent defense of class interests. The passions of greed and resentment were excited and set against each other, causing violent conflicts that disturbed Western countries well into the following century. Contrary to Enlightenment expectations, the uncontrolled pursuit of interests, whether by an individual or a class, proved just as proficient at disturbing social peace as the mindless pursuit of glory. Neither reason, grace, nor considerations of self-interest could settle the problem of the passions once and for all. The lesson to be drawn is that the art of politics must be the art of engaging the passions, first by exciting them, then by moderating and directing them to a worthy end, one that reason may reveal but cannot achieve.
That also seems to be the lesson of recent American history. If we look beyond the jockeying of interest groups, parties and politicians, it's apparent that the shape of American politics over the past half-century has been determined by two great waves of passion: the first running from the Kennedy and Johnson administrations through the '70s, the second running from the Reagan administration to the departure of George W. Bush. What dominated during the first wave was excitement about a New Frontier, hope for a just and Great Society, fear of nuclear war, a desire for greater social freedom -- and confidence that government could accomplish much. In the next era the same passions, nearly as intense, would be successfully redirected by Ronald Reagan. Now the excitement was about privatization, hope was invested in economic growth, fears centered on the family and the greatest desire was for freedom from government.
The Great Recession and the Tea Party's ire, directed at Democrats and Republicans alike, suggest that this second political dispensation is coming to an end and that Americans' passions are ready to be redirected once again. Having been dealt a bad hand, President Obama may have only a slim chance of doing that, but he has absolutely none if he limits himself to appealing to people's interests. That's not been the American experience of change. In our politics, history doesn't happen when a leader makes an argument, or even strikes a pose. It happens when he strikes a chord. And you don't need charts and figures to do that; in fact they get in the way. You only need two words.
George Plimpton used to tell the story of Muhammad Ali going to Harvard one year to give an address. At the end of his speech, someone called out to him, ''Give us a poem!'' He paused, stretched out his arms to the audience and delivered what Plimpton said was the shortest poem in the English language:
ME [pause]
WE!
The students would have followed him anywhere.

HEADLINE: What's a Quiet Guy Doing on Real Estate's A-List?

BYLINE: By JANET MORRISSEY

 BODY:
WHEN General Growth Properties buckled under a mountain of debt and filed for bankruptcy last year, deal watchers assumed that Simon Properties, the nation's largest mall owner, would swoop in and buy it. So many people were stunned when Brookfield Asset Management, a lesser-known company that is based in Toronto, beat out Simon last May and snagged a major ownership stake.
The victory catapulted B.A.M. -- and its chief executive, Bruce Flatt -- onto the A-list of United States real estate investors.
Mr. Flatt, often dubbed the Warren Buffett of Canada, is hailed as a numbers guru with an eye for spotting distressed assets and a knack for negotiating deals that deliver big, industry-beating returns and stable cash flows. He's also been called a ''benevolent dictator'' for his hands-on approach. 
His company, though not unscathed by the recession, escaped without major debt problems during the credit crisis, unlike many of its peers. So while many rivals were struggling to refinance expiring loans, Brookfield was raising billions in hopes of picking up attractive assets at fire-sale prices.
Mr. Flatt is ''among a handful of the smartest people in Canada,'' says David Peterson, a former premier of Ontario and a senior partner and chairman of the law firm Cassels Brock & Blackwell, -- as well as a neighbor of Mr. Flatt in Toronto.
The publicity-shy Mr. Flatt, 45, is modest when asked about his role in his company's success. ''This organization is not really about me,'' he says in a rare interview while sitting in an 11th-floor conference room at the World Financial Center in Manhattan, the headquarters of Brookfield Office Properties, a B.A.M. spin-off. ''Many organizations are built upon one person, but this organization could survive tomorrow morning without me -- I truly believe that.''
Analysts agree that Brookfield Asset Management has a deep and highly talented management team, but they also say Mr. Flatt was responsible for assembling it. Many of the senior executives, including him, are accountants by trade.
''These are well-scrubbed M.B.A. types as opposed to lift-them-up-by-the-bootstrap developers,'' says Jim Sullivan, a managing director and senior analyst at Cowen & Company, an investment banking and advisory firm.
Mr. Flatt, a lean 6 feet tall, shuns the flamboyant persona adopted by real estate moguls like Donald Trump. Divorced and in a long-term relationship with the art adviser and socialite Lonti Ebers, he works 12-hour days and is constantly traveling between his homes in Toronto and New York, as well as making trips around the world to scout new deals.
Mr. Flatt is animated when talking about his businesses but terse when questions turn to his personal interests. (''How do you relax?'' ''I read business books.'' ''What's your favorite one?'' ''I don't have one.'' ''Do you listen to music?'' ''No.'')
BEFORE he took over in 2002, Brookfield Asset Management was a complicated conglomerate with holdings that included a beer company and Brazilian cattle ranches. Mr. Flatt led a restructuring that simplified B.A.M. by focusing on just three sectors: real estate, renewable power and infrastructure assets like ports.
Mr. Flatt sees himself as investing in the ''backbone infrastructure'' of the economy. ''We're not a retail brand, but we rent space in malls to companies,'' he says. ''We don't sell coal to anybody, but we own their coal terminal and ship coal out of our coal terminal. And we don't sell natural gas but we transport natural gas in our pipelines.''
The company now has $110 billion in assets under management, having bought assets and controlling interests in businesses with a combination of equity capital, private equity funds and debt. By raising money alongside big-name partners like sovereign wealth funds and pension funds, it squeezes out bigger returns on its equity.
B.A.M.'s stock has generated average annual returns of 23 percent over the last 10 years, outpacing the 1.35 percent average for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, and the nearly 11 percent return of the real estate sector, according to Morningstar.
Its shares sold off with the broader market in 2008, even though experts now say its fundamentals were solid. While other companies were struggling with debt issues, B.A.M. was able to raise $1.2 billion in 2008 and $14 billion in 2009.
It holds controlling stakes in several publicly traded companies, including Brookfield Office Properties, which was spun off from the parent in 1997 and owns such prestigious properties as the World Financial Center towers. Brookfield Properties was known for falling a few dollars short of the winning bid for the World Trade Center lease -- just months before the Twin Towers came crashing down -- and for the lightning-speed clean-up and reopening of the four damaged properties it owned adjacent to the trade center.
Brookfield Office Properties (it recently changed its name from just Brookfield Properties) is a real estate operating company for tax reasons but competes head-to-head with office real estate investment trusts. It has been a star in its own right. It posted total returns of 68 percent in 2009 and is up an additional 45 percent this year. It managed to refinance $2.5 billion in expiring debt in 2008 and 2009, and raised about $1 billion in equity despite the credit crisis.
Ric Clark, the C.E.O. of Brookfield Office Properties, says lenders opened their wallets because of its high-quality properties in major markets, its long-term leases and healthy cash flows.
Among its peers in the office real estate sector, Brookfield Office Properties has by far the strongest average two-year performance in stock returns, occupancy levels and operating income growth, says Mr. Sullivan at Cowen & Company. It has outperformed rivals like Vornado and Boston Properties.
But in recent months, a crack has appeared in B.A.M.'s sturdy armor. Investor unrest erupted in late July, when Brookfield Properties unveiled plans to acquire an Australian portfolio of office properties owned by B.A.M. and sell its residential business to a unit of B.A.M. without an auction.
Brookfield Properties' stock fell 13 percent as concerns about conflicts arose. Analysts questioned who benefited more from the deal -- the parent or the real estate stepchild. The news made many analysts wonder whether Mr. Flatt was running the show behind the scenes and dictating what Brookfield Properties and other B.A.M.-controlled companies could be bought or sold, and when. (The issue is further complicated because Brookfield's C.E.O., Mr. Clark, also holds an executive position at B.A.M.)
It was this episode that prompted Michael Knott, a managing director at Green Street Advisors, to call Mr. Flatt a benevolent dictator. ''Investors expressed their concerns with their feet by getting out of the stock,'' says Mr. Knott, adding that this was the first time potential conflicts had become an issue.
The stock rebounded a few weeks later, though. Investors saw the potential upside in turning Brookfield Properties into a pure-play international office company and having it invest in the Australian market, where the economy is growing and rental rates are rising much faster than they are in the United States.
Mr. Flatt bristles at being dubbed a benevolent dictator, emphasizing his company's team approach. There may be some who question the relationship and potential conflicts between the two companies, he says, but an equal number of investors are bullish about Brookfield Office Properties precisely because of B.A.M.'s ties to it.
He acknowledges that he takes a hands-on approach to the companies in which B.A.M. invests, but he makes no apologies. ''Look, we're an active investor in businesses,'' he says.
BORN in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Mr. Flatt grew up in a financial environment. His father, Ian, was a senior executive at the Investors Group mutual fund empire for 43 years.
Mr. Flatt flexed his entrepreneurial muscles early on. While many college students were taking jobs at bars and restaurants, he started his own business -- a lawn-cutting enterprise -- that won him an ''entrepreneur of the year'' award at the University of Manitoba, where he was studying to be an accountant.
After his graduation in 1985, his congenial personality and acumen with numbers convinced Scott Wotherspoon to hire him at Clarkson Gordon (later bought by Ernst & Young). ''He was very social -- a party guy -- that you'd like to go out and have a beer with,'' Mr. Wotherspoon says. At work, ''he was articulate, knowledgeable and quick-thinking in his answers to questions -- his brilliance shone out,'' Mr. Wotherspoon says. ''He had a personality that drew people to him.''
Mr. Flatt passed his accounting exam with the second-highest marks in the province, then joined the conglomerate Brascan, later renamed Brookfield Asset Management. There, he distinguished himself early on.
In 1993, at 28, he led B.A.M.'s bid to acquire a chunk of prime office properties from the United States unit of the debt-ridden Olympia & York Developments in bankruptcy court. That bankruptcy was among the largest and most complicated insolvencies in the pre-Enron era, recalls Tom Falus, now C.E.O. of Sienna Capital, who worked for Olympia & York at the time.
Mr. Flatt ''was really, really young -- I don't want to call him a kid -- but he was the youngest kid on the block by a lot,'' Mr. Falus says. Yet, he recalls, Mr. Flatt had no trouble going head-to-head with real estate heavyweights like Jerry Speyer of Tishman Speyer Properties, who sat across the negotiating table.
The deal, which took about four years to hammer out, gave Brookfield Properties control of 11 million square feet of premium office properties, including three of the four World Financial Center towers and 245 Park Avenue in New York as well as an office building in Boston -- all at low prices.
To put this in perspective, 245 Park Avenue, which was valued at $400 million in 1996, is worth more than $1.6 billion today, Mr. Flatt says.
After that victory, Mr. Flatt was promoted to chief executive of Brookfield Properties in 2000 and then C.E.O. of B.A.M. in 2002.
IT is Mr. Flatt's friendly yet tenacious negotiating style that drives much of his success at the deal table, people who have sat across from him say. Unlike some real estate titans, ''he doesn't care about bragging rights or making the other guy look bad or crushing his skull under his boot,'' says Jim Corl, a managing director at Siguler Guff & Company, a private equity investment firm.
His persuasiveness is evident outside the boardroom, too. On the day of the 2001 terrorist attacks, a distraught Mr. Flatt hired a car to take him from Toronto to Manhattan. Even though all the bridges into Manhattan were closed, he talked his way through all the security checkpoints to check on his employees. ''We had a lot of people here and we didn't know what had happened to them,'' he recalls. ''There was literally no communications with people for days.''
Brookfield Properties didn't lose faith in its investments in Lower Manhattan after the attacks. In 2002, it acquired Lehman Brothers' ownership stake in one of the World Financial Center towers as frightened tenants were leaving Manhattan. Brookfield bought Lehman's interest for $128 a square foot, says Mr. Clark, and today a similar Class A building slightly north of the area, 111 Eighth Avenue, recently fetched more than $600 a foot.
Mr. Flatt's specialty is pulling off complex deals -- as was clear during the Olympia & York negotiations, and more recently during his showdown with the Simon Property Group for General Growth Properties.
The General Growth battle wasn't the first time Mr. Flatt butted heads with Simon. In 2007, B.A.M. made a bid for the Mills Corporation, a retail real estate investment trust, but was later trumped by Simon (although Brookfield did pocket a $71 million profit related to a debt investment and breakup fee).
So when B.A.M. made a play for General Growth and Simon tried to jump into the fray again, Mr. Flatt was ready. B.A.M. had begun to lay the groundwork two years earlier, in 2008, when it offered to inject $1 billion into General Growth when it was first showing signs of debt trouble. By the time General Growth filed for Chapter 11 in 2009, he had cozied up to the board and earned its trust along with a seat at the negotiating table.
Mr. Flatt then fired off a letter to the board, saying Simon's only interest was in swallowing up the company so it could control about a third of the country's shopping malls, and that B.A.M. would simply recapitalize it, letting it remain a stand-alone company.
He also warned that Simon's bid would set off antitrust issues that could delay or even scuttle the deal's close. As a result, even when Simon offered a higher bid this year, the board threw its hat in with Brookfield. Simon declined to comment for this article.
''Mr. Flatt played a smart hand,'' says Jan Svec, a senior director in the REIT group at Fitch Ratings.
So far, it looks that way. Since General Growth resumed trading after the restructuring, B.A.M.'s equity investment has already doubled in value.

HEADLINE: While Families Lose Homes to Foreclosure, State Agency Delays Federal Aid

BYLINE: By AARON GLANTZ. 
aglantz@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Benjamin Chavarria, an unemployed construction worker, has fallen $20,000 behind on his mortgage. If he does not pay the full amount by Jan. 6, his lender, the California Housing Finance Agency, said it will seize his four-bedroom home in Richmond, which is fast becoming the epicenter of the region's foreclosure crisis.
Since February, the state-run finance agency has received nearly $2 billion from the federal government to help people like Mr. Chavarria avoid losing their homes. But nearly a year after President Obama announced the delivery of the first $700 million installment for the Keep Your Home California initiative, the Housing Finance Agency, which administers the program, has not taken applications or compiled a waiting list for qualified borrowers.
''It's terrible; usually government doesn't act the day after, but for it to take this long is surprising,'' said Orson Aguilar, executive director of the Greenlining Institute, a nonprofit organization that promotes nondiscriminatory lending. ''Had they put out the money sooner, it wouldn't have solved the foreclosure crisis, but it would have helped a few thousand families by now.'' 
Since the initial allocation of $699.6 million to the Housing Finance Agency in February, the Treasury Department has twice granted additional money to the state. In August, the agency received $476.3 million through an expansion of the Troubled Asset Relief Program's Hardest Hit Fund to support states with unemployment greater than the national average.
In September, the Housing Finance Agency received $799.5 million more to expand the program, even though the agency had yet to modify a single loan.
Diane Richardson, legislative director of the Housing Finance Agency, said the federally-funded program -- which is designed to subsidize mortgage payments for unemployed borrowers and to reduce debt for people whose homes significantly declined in value during the housing crisis -- is scheduled to accept applications next month. Ms. Richardson said her agency, which issues loans and works with private lenders to provide financing for low-income borrowers, is running a limited test with 300 troubled homeowners.
If the test is successful, Ms. Richardson said, the agency will begin accepting applications with the goal of eventually delivering assistance to more than 100,000 borrowers.
''You wouldn't want to launch a program and then have lots of problems,'' Ms. Richardson said.
The effect of the delay is visible on the streets of Contra Costa County, where homes are falling into foreclosure at alarming rates. The county recorder reports more than 10,000 such cases since Mr. Obama announced the assistance program 10 months ago at a news conference with Senator Harry Reid.
Over all, the number of foreclosures in Contra Costa County has ballooned to more than 12,200 in 2010 from 777 in 2005.
Many of those foreclosures are in new developments on the urban fringe of Antioch and Brentwood, where people purchased tract homes with subprime mortgages, then walked away when the interest rates reset, creating higher payments they could no longer afford. Others are in inner-city neighborhoods of Richmond, where longtime residents took equity out of their homes when the market was at its peak, only to see their home values plummet when the market collapsed.
A city report released in April found that more than 2,000 homes and apartments in Richmond were in some stage of foreclosure. In the city's hardest-hit ZIP code, 94801, which encompasses much of the central and northern sections of the city, almost half of all homes were ''in foreclosure or financed with subprime mortgages and thus as at risk for foreclosure.''
In two other central Richmond ZIP codes, 94806 and 94804, where Mr. Chavarria lives, the city estimated that more than a third of all homes are at risk.
''We're talking about the postal worker who's lived in this community for 20 or 30 years,'' said Lynette Gibson McElhaney, the executive director of Neighborhood Housing Services of the East Bay, a nonprofit organization that helps troubled borrowers negotiate with their lender. ''These are not greedy people.'' Some families needed money to pay medical bills, repair their homes or bail their relatives out of jail, she said, while others are simply out of work.
From her front porch on Hoffman Street, just north of Interstate 580 in Richmond, Rosalind McMiller can point out a half-dozen homes that have recently been lost to foreclosure. ''Everyone's depressed and drained physically and emotionally because they don't see a breakthrough coming,'' Ms. McMiller, 52, said.
The neighborhood feels empty, Ms. McMiller said, and is not as friendly as it once was.
''The fact that there's so much suffering and they're just sitting on this money, how can they sleep at night?'' she said of the California Housing Finance Agency.
On Oct. 26, United States Representative George Miller, a Democrat whose district includes Richmond, initiated a letter signed by 27 California House Democrats to L. Steven Spears, the agency's director, demanding a briefing ''about how exactly you intend to carry out this important program and ensure its success.''
The letter stated, ''It is critical that this program begin helping homeowners as expeditiously as possible, given that many of our constituents have been struggling for over two years.''
On Dec. 7, officials from the finance agency flew to Washington and promised to begin the program in early 2011. But Representative Miller said he is still disappointed. ''There's no sense of urgency,'' he said.
During the delay, the agency has foreclosed on borrowers at a record rate. Between January and November, the Housing Finance Agency foreclosed on 2,244 homes, up from 1,515 for all of 2009, and 491 in 2008, the agency reported.
Andrea Risotto, the Treasury Department spokeswoman, said California is not alone. Of the 18 states and the District of Columbia that received TARP money to fight foreclosures, only five -- Arizona, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio and Rhode Island, -- have their programs fully operating. ''The mortgage industry wasn't set up to help struggling homeowners,'' Ms. Risotto said.
Dustin Hobbs, communications director for the California Mortgage Bankers Association, agreed that the delays were not surprising. ''You're creating a brand new dynamic and a brand new relationship between a government agency and private sectors that never existed before.''
Lender participation in the program is voluntary, Mr. Hobbs noted. Many of the nation's largest banks, including its largest mortgage originator, Wells Fargo, have yet to sign on.
''We are anticipating that we will participate but these issues are complicated,'' said Tom Goya, a Wells Fargo spokesman.
In the meantime, homeowners like Mr. Chavarria, 38, have watched their homes slip away.
''The hardest part is letting go,'' said Mr. Chavarria, who came to the United States from Mexico when he was 16 and has lived in Richmond for most of the last 22 years.
In 2007, after decades of renting, his family put $90,000 down on the $425,000, four-bedroom house where Mr. Chavarria lives with his wife and children, 12 and 6. His wife, who teaches at a local nonprofit group that helps low-income children, has had her salary cut and her hours reduced.
Mr. Chavarria said work has been sporadic, causing him to fall behind on his mortgage payments and preventing him from saving enough money to pay off his $20,000 debt. ''Today I worked two hours, yesterday I didn't work, the day before I worked four hours,'' he said.
''I keep telling myself it's only material,'' he added. ''I guess it can be rebuilt. That's why I'm resigned.''

HEADLINE: Oprah's Highest Hurdle

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
BEFORE Oprah Winfrey jetted off this month to Washington for the Kennedy Center Honors, then to Sydney for overseas tapings of her talk show, she had a simple request for the security staff at her house near Los Angeles:
''Can you all make sure that I have the capabilities to get my own channel on my own TV?''
It would be a tad embarrassing, she teased, if she had to dash to a neighbor's house to see the start of OWN, her new cable channel.
Indeed. 
After all, Ms. Winfrey is about to make history by ending her blockbuster, one-hour talk fest, ''The Oprah Winfrey Show,'' and starting OWN, short for the Oprah Winfrey Network, that will speak for her 24 hours a day. OWN makes its debut on New Year's Day, and its success hinges on fans being able to track down Ms. Winfrey on the upper reaches of the cable dial. On the DirecTV setup in Ms. Winfrey's own home, her network will be on Channel 279, a big leap from Channel 7, where the current show is shown in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and other major cities.
Ms. Winfrey's move from broadcast to cable is a transformative moment for the television business, marking the first time a talk-show host has taken over an entire channel. The stakes couldn't be higher for Ms. Winfrey and the coterie of television veterans that has assembled around her. For someone who has enjoyed outsize victories in almost every venture she has pursued, OWN will be the ultimate test of her power.
''I'm prepared for all the critics, I'm prepared for all the naysayers and the ya-da-ya's,'' Ms. Winfrey says by telephone from Sydney. ''The real truth is this: Everything I've ever done has prepared me for this moment, for this launch.''
''I look at this launch as the birthing of a baby, not the raising of a child,'' she continues, managing expectations about the sure-to-be-low-rated early days of OWN. Child-rearing will mostly have to wait until after she tapes her final episode of ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'' in May.
''It's a long-term process,'' she says, ''and I have the vision to see what this network can be in 3 years, in 5 years, in 10 years, as an institution of hope and inspiration.''
At its core, OWN will try to embody Ms. Winfrey's ''live your best life'' philosophy, and it will aim at the same audience as her current show -- women from the ages of 25 to 54, says Christina Norman, the channel's chief executive.
But OWN's three-year gestation has been unusually arduous. Early on, Ms. Winfrey's partner in the joint venture, Discovery Communications, grew frustrated, and as boardroom tensions boiled over early last year she considered backing out altogether. The relationship has improved markedly since then. But as recently as late November, some producers working with OWN still doubted that the channel would actually come to life in January.
Now, without a doubt, it's coming. But it brings clear risks for Ms. Winfrey. She is swapping her broadcast stage -- where nearly seven million fans watch her every day -- for a cable platform that will be, at least at first, much smaller. For a time, she says, she lived in fear about the channel, even though she had fostered the idea for OWN for the better part of 20 years. And questions linger among some observers -- like OWN's future competitors at Bravo, Lifetime, WE tv and elsewhere -- about her level of commitment to the channel.
Ms. Winfrey says she's worried only about how well OWN is doing in ''letting people know where the channel is.'' (This month, Oprah.com features an OWN countdown clock and a channel-finder tool.)
That aside, she says she's pleased with her lineup of shows and the energy of OWN's 140-odd workers.
''I'm about as calm as a person who's about to give birth to such a humongous baby can be,'' she says.
TECHNICALLY, Ms. Winfrey is adopting, not giving birth. With the flip of a control-room switch, OWN will replace the Discovery Health Channel in almost 80 million homes. OWN is hoped to be everything that Discovery Health was not: widely known, well supported and highly rated.
In the winter of 2007, the new chief executive of Discovery Communications, David Zaslav, surveyed the dozen channels that Discovery owned -- he liked to call it beachfront real estate -- for areas of growth. He concluded that the Discovery Health Channel should be first in line for remodeling. ''For a couple of months, we were walking in circles,'' he recalls. '' 'What do we put on this great platform?' The home run was, could we find something to put on that would break through the noisy and cluttered marketplace.''
''If it was really strong,'' he adds, ''then we could also get a subscriber fee.''
Subscriber fees, which cable and satellite carriers pay to channels and then pass along in bills to their customers each month, have turned channel owners like Discovery, NBC Universal and Viacom into much-envied media powerhouses. But Discovery was earning only 2 to 7 cents a month per subscriber for Discovery Health, analysts estimate, making it merely a shack on Mr. Zaslav's beachfront. By contrast, of Discovery's three big assets, the flagship Discovery Channel earned about 33 cents a month per subscriber, according to the research firm SNL Kagan; TLC, about 16 cents; and Animal Planet, 9 cents.
Mr. Zaslav started contemplating a partnership. Benjamin Swinburne, a media analyst at Morgan Stanley, says that this strategy was unique. ''Very few other media companies,'' he says, ''are willing to take chips off the table and admit that they can do more with a partner than on their own.''
Mr. Zaslav's epiphany for an Oprah-branded channel came at his suburban New York home, while he was flipping through his wife's copy of O: The Oprah Magazine, the hugely successful joint venture between Ms. Winfrey and Hearst. His wife, Pam, had a habit of attaching Post-it notes to its pages, which got Mr. Zaslav thinking about Ms. Winfrey's enduring brand.
''Oprah and her magazine stand for this idea -- a shared idea we all have -- a shared hope we all have,'' he says, ''of living your best life.'' He could think of no equivalent on cable television. After barely three months on the job, he requested a meeting with Ms. Winfrey through her agents at the Creative Artists Agency.
''I've got a big idea,'' he recalls telling them.
At that first meeting, in April 2007, Ms. Winfrey shared the origin of her own big idea. The name OWN, she recalls, first came up in a 1992 conversation with her life partner, Stedman Graham. Ms. Winfrey was bemoaning the confrontational talk shows that were in vogue at the time, ''and Stedman was saying, 'If you don't like it, you should start your own network.' '' He wrote down ''Oprah Winfrey Network,'' and she noticed that the initials spelled the word ''own.''
Ms. Winfrey has given herself to cable once before, in a much more limited way. Ten years ago, she was a co-founder of Oxygen, an ambitious channel for women that also counted Geraldine Laybourne, Marcy Carsey, Tom Werner and Caryn Mandabach as backers. The channel couldn't find a voice or a loyal audience, and in 2007 was sold to NBC Universal, where it is now best known for reality shows like ''The Bad Girls Club.''
''As we all know, that didn't work out for me,'' Ms. Winfrey says of Oxygen. ''It was a great lesson for me: don't partner when you're not allowed to be in charge and make a decision.''
At Oxygen, she was an investor; at OWN, she is the chairwoman. The partnership with Mr. Zaslav, she says, ''has been ideal.''
(Discovery has entered into two other joint ventures since OWN was conceived -- one with Hasbro for a children's channel called the Hub and another with Sony and IMAX for a 3-D television network.)
FOR the 50-50 joint venture with Ms. Winfrey, which was announced in January 2008, Discovery proffered its health channel and $100 million in start-up cash. Ms. Winfrey contributed her brand name, her 25-year library and her Web site, Oprah.com.
Crucially, the deal did not call for Ms. Winfrey to give up ''The Oprah Winfrey Show,'' the syndicated cash cow that had her under contract. Though the daytime pie was shrinking, Ms. Winfrey still had the biggest slice by far.
Once the partnership began, a long, hard slog ensued. Executives came, executives went. So, too, did concepts for shows. A vague 2009 premiere date was pushed back, and then the partners stopped giving a premiere date at all. The channel was paralyzed.
All the while, Ms. Winfrey kept her distance. She had 130 hours of her talk show to tape each year, so she had committed to only 35 hours of original programming on OWN. Investors wondered if her heart was in it -- and sometimes she wondered the same. ''The first year, I'd go to meeting after meeting and I'd see all these sorts of promo materials put together of what OWN could be,'' Ms. Winfrey recalls. ''Finally I said: 'I'm tired of talking about what it can be; I want us to actually do something.' ''
Ms. Winfrey persuaded the former Viacom chief Tom Freston to be an adviser. Amid an executive reshuffling at OWN at the end of 2008, Mr. Freston helped to bring in Ms. Norman as the chief executive. Together, they became Ms. Winfrey's cable television tutors -- and the building blocks for the channel that viewers will see in January. (Mr. Freston, who is fond of exotic travel, is working for OWN part time, giving rise to a joke at the network that ''the only person living their 'best life' is Tom.'')
''It takes a while to get a team right,'' says Ms. Norman, playing down the false starts.
Mr. Freston reiterated that in a separate interview. ''I don't think it's unlike what would happen at a normal start-up,'' he said.
OWN's lowest point was in April 2009, when the joint venture was almost scuttled. In another Chicago meeting with Ms. Winfrey, Mr. Zaslav painted a bleak picture of the advertising market, which had deteriorated during the recession. Then, turning more rosy, he proposed that OWN could be a much bigger business if she was accessible to viewers only on cable. In essence, he pressed her to commit or quit.
''I think what Zaslav would have wanted, ideally, was for me to take the 'Oprah' show to cable,'' Ms. Winfrey says. ''But I felt like the show had its day, its moment, its time.''
IN the fall of 2009, as Ms. Winfrey began another season of her talk show, OWN still lacked a premiere date. Backstage, there was a gnawing suspicion in the television industry that OWN was doomed. But, undeterred, Ms. Norman's team was working on pilots for reality programs of all stripes, all of them with themes that would fit right in on an afternoon of ''Oprah'': take charge of your life, look beyond yourself, and ''dream it, do it.''
''This brand and this network are really about asking people to fulfill themselves,'' Ms. Norman said in August 2009.
Then, in November, everything changed. More than anything else, what OWN needed was someone who understood Oprah and her audience, and in the first week of that month, that's what it added: one of Ms. Winfrey's most trusted producers at Harpo Productions, Lisa Erspamer, was named chief creative officer. That was a tremor on the broadcasting landscape. The earthquake came two weeks later, when Ms. Winfrey told her adoring audience that she would be ceasing her daytime talk show.
Now OWN would be quite literally her next act -- and her only act.
Looking back, Ms. Winfrey says, ''I would have wanted to bring more people from my Harpo team'' to OWN, Ms. Erspamer among them. ''I think if I had been able to do that, I think this process would have gone a lot faster.''
But, she continues, ''I had the 'Oprah' show to finish; I had obligations, responsibilities; I wanted to end it in the best possible way.''
Discovery promptly rewrote its contract with Ms. Winfrey. She would not recreate her talk show on cable, but she would appear for at least 70 hours a year, up from 35 in the original contract. She would travel the world for an interview series called ''Oprah's Next Chapter,'' to be shown in prime time, and she would pop in to other shows, like ''Your OWN Show'' -- a reality competition to groom the next Oprah, with the winner getting a gig on OWN, naturally. The channel would start on Jan. 1, 2011, allowing for nine months of overlap between the talk show and the cable channel.
Overnight, OWN had become a much more ambitious endeavor. ''The kind of programming we are producing is certainly different from what the original expectation was,'' Ms. Norman says now, citing her plan for 600 hours of original programming in 2011 and another 600 hours of acquired programming, like old episodes of ''Trading Spaces.'' The original plan, she acknowledges, called for a lot less of each.
IN the short run, that ambition ended up costing Discovery, but executives there are confident that Ms. Winfrey's deeper commitment will make the asset more valuable over time. In August, the company lent OWN a further $89 million, which is to be paid back with interest as soon as the channel turns a profit. Five years from now, Ms. Winfrey can start to sell parts of her stake in OWN, in 10 percent increments -- up to a certain level, while maintaining a minimum ownership stake -- according to three people with direct knowledge of the deal who requested anonymity because the terms had not been made public.
More immediately, after 25 years on free over-the-air television, the Queen of All Media is effectively prying open the cable cash register. ''By putting a subscriber fee together with this 80-million-subscriber platform, we have a chance to create some real value -- big value,'' Mr. Zaslav says.
Ms. Norman, who worked at MTV and VH1 for 17 years, put it another way: fees, she says, are ''the mother lode.''
Years ago, Discovery executives imagined earning 50 cents per subscriber for OWN. That could happen someday if Ms. Winfrey's viewers flock to the channel, some analysts say, but expectations have been tempered for the time being. In current negotiations with carriers, OWN is offering a free year or two before starting a 20- to 30-cent fee per subscriber, according to the people with direct knowledge of the terms.
Some distributors have agreed to those terms, but others are balking, at least at the moment. While OWN could turn a profit by 2013, Mr. Swinburne said, ''this is going to take five years to become really meaningful to Discovery's stock.'' His current forecast for OWN has the channel posting $220 million in revenue at a 34 percent profit margin by 2015.
For OWN, the priority now is getting the programming right -- finding the channel's ''voice,'' in television-speak. ''It will take us a while,'' Mr. Zaslav says. Discovery Health ranked No. 41 among women 25 to 54 this year, and he would like to see its replacement creep up that chart each year.
So Ms. Winfrey's baby will start out taking baby steps.
As if to rebut concerns about her commitment, all the parties involved say that she has been intimately involved in the programming. The tent-pole series, on Week One, will be ''Master Class,'' a series of profiles of moguls and personalities like Jay-Z and Diane Sawyer that features Ms. Winfrey in each episode, and ''Season 25: Oprah Behind the Scenes,'' a weekly documentary about the making of her existing talk show. But she ''will not be on in a substantial role until September,'' Mr. Freston cautions, echoing other executives who say the channel should be judged not by its first week, but by its first year -- or its second. Or its third.
''By 2013, we should be cracking,'' Ms. Winfrey says when reminded that 2012 would be her first full year of ''Oprah's Next Chapter.'' Because of her talk show, she says, ''I have not been able to devote the amount of time and energy that I could and should be able to do in the future.''
Already, the ''Oprah'' show has been a test-bed of sorts for OWN, as it was in May when Ms. Winfrey was interviewing Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, who had been caught on camera a month earlier selling access to her former husband, Prince Andrew. Ms. Ferguson's reputation was in shatters, and she was nearly in tears.
''I just had this epiphany,'' Ms. Winfrey said to Ms. Ferguson. ''You on that tape -- that is a spiritually, morally bankrupted person.''
''That's genius,'' Ms. Ferguson responded, moved by the encounter.
Ms. Winfrey almost immediately imagined an OWN show about Ms. Ferguson rebuilding her life. She recalled calling up Ms. Norman and saying, ''I don't want to ask her, but I think that this would make a really great TV show.''
The resulting documentary series, which Ms. Winfrey named ''Finding Sarah,'' is upbeat and inspirational. And, importantly, it features two of Ms. Winfrey's friends, Dr. Phil McGraw and Suze Orman, helping Ms. Ferguson piece together her life.
OWN will also feature repeats of the syndicated ''Dr. Phil'' and, come September, reruns of ''The Oprah Winfrey Show.'' Other ''Oprah'' regulars like Gayle King, Peter Walsh and Dr. Laura Berman have their own shows on the cable channel's schedule, and in September, the former talk show star Rosie O'Donnell will return to daytime with an as-yet-untitled OWN talk show.
Amid this talent hunt, Ms. Winfrey has become a roving ambassador for the network, and has further cemented her link to its success -- or failure.
For a moment in the telephone interview, she sounded as if she was giving away TV shows as if they were Pontiacs, as she so famously did for an entire studio audience in 2004.
''I look at everything now through the prism of, 'This could make a very good TV show!' '' she says. At a recent dinner, she says, that's what she kept thinking as she chatted up Bono of U2.
''Would you like a TV show?'' she asked him.

HEADLINE: POLITICS IN IRAQ RAISES QUESTIONS ON U.S. PRESENCE

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS, THOM SHANKER and JACK HEALY; Steven Lee Myers and Thom Shanker reported from Baghdad, and Jack Healy from Diyala Province.

 BODY:
This article was reported by Steven Lee Myers, Thom Shanker and Jack Healy and written by Mr. Myers.
BAGHDAD -- The protracted political turmoil that saw the resurgence of a fiercely anti-American political bloc here is casting new doubt on establishing any enduring American military role in Iraq after the last of nearly 50,000 troops are scheduled to withdraw in the next 12 months, military and administration officials say.
Given Iraq's military shortcomings, especially in air power, intelligence coordination and logistics, American and Iraqi officials had long expected that some American military presence, even if only in an advisory role, would continue beyond 2011. That is the deadline for a troop withdrawal negotiated under President George W. Bush more than three years ago and adhered to, so far, by President Obama.
Even as contingency planning for any lasting American mission has quietly continued in Baghdad and at the Pentagon, however, the shifting political landscape in both countries has made it increasingly possible that the 2011 withdrawal could truly be total, the officials said. Both Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq and Mr. Obama, struggling to retain the support of their political bases, have repeated their public vows to adhere to the deadline. 
The military and administration officials emphasized in interviews that the White House had made no final decision on whether any troops might remain beyond the scheduled withdrawal -- and that it would not even consider one unless asked by Mr. Maliki's government.
The question is so politically delicate -- here and in Washington -- that officials would speak only on condition of anonymity. Further, they say the topic has not been broached in detail even in recent private meetings between senior Iraqi and American officials, including one in Baghdad last week between Mr. Maliki and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen.
''Maliki can't start asking right now for a large, extended American footprint,'' a senior administration official said. ''First of all, there is no Maliki government. And second, it would introduce a hugely controversial issue just when he doesn't need it.''
It could remain so for many more months, even after Mr. Maliki completes his cabinet of ministers and submits it to the new Parliament, now scheduled to happen within a week. That has raised anxieties among American officials and military commanders presiding over what the Obama administration calls a ''responsible drawdown'' to end the American war here.
They are already planning a steady reduction of troops and bases, which will begin in earnest by spring and is to reach zero by this time next year. Those plans have been complicated by the uncertainty over what troops will replace them -- or whether any will at all.
''They're going to have to sort their way through that,'' Maj. Gen. Terry A. Wolff, the departing commander of American forces in central Iraq, said in an interview, referring to administration officials. ''At this point, I just don't know. I don't know how that's going to look in 2012.''
After parliamentary elections in March led to a protracted period of deadlock and deal-making, Mr. Maliki now leads an unwieldy coalition with parties pursuing conflicting agendas, including lawmakers allied with Moktada al-Sadr, a Shiite cleric in exile whose fighters actively battled against American and Iraqi forces until they were routed in 2008.
Their new partnership, which propelled Mr. Maliki's nomination to a second term, will make it politically risky for him to now reverse himself. Even Ayad Allawi, the leader of a multisectarian bloc who has long been supportive of the Americans, said in an interview last week that there was not yet any consensus among Iraqi leaders to request an extension of the American military presence.
A growing confidence in Iraq's security forces, coupled with national pride, has also become a factor. Mr. Maliki and others have adamantly ruled out the need for foreign troops to help the country protect itself.
That may reflect a degree of political posturing, but officials in both militaries point to the maturing capabilities of Iraq's army and federal police, which now conduct day-to-day security without a great deal of direct American involvement.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, Maj. Gen. Mohammed al-Askari, said in an interview that the American military role in Iraq ''must take another shape,'' providing training and weaponry, but not necessarily American boots on the ground.
''We are different than Afghanistan,'' the general said, noting the comparative maturity of Iraq's government ministries, including those overseeing security.
Among Iraqis, the question of the American military presence is deeply conflicted, and often nuanced. Many loathe what they view as a foreign occupying force, even as some consider the Americans a reassuring bulwark against insurgent attacks and simmering ethnic disputes.
Along the internal border between Iraq's Kurds and Arabs, for example, American soldiers continue to operate checkpoints jointly with troops from both sides, defusing potential clashes.
Assad Ismail, a local council president in Sadiya, a village along the disputed territories northeast of Baghdad, said that only the Americans were able to settle a recent dispute that flared when Iraqi soldiers trying to restrict the movement of insurgents closed off local farmers' access to their date palms, tomatoes and peanuts.
''Thank God, the American Army was with us,'' Mr. Ismail said. ''We want them to stay for 5 or 10 years.''
The administration has already drawn up plans for an extensive expansion of the American Embassy and its operations, bolstered by thousands of security contractors. The embassy in Baghdad, two satellite offices in Mosul and Kirkuk, and two consulates in Erbil and Baghdad are scheduled to take over most of more than 1,000 tasks now carried out by the American military.
Militarily, at a minimum, the administration plans to create an Office of Security Cooperation that, like similar ones in countries like Egypt, would be staffed by civilians and military personnel overseeing the training and equipping of Iraq's security forces. Privately, officials say the Iraqis needed such an office if they hope to continue purchasing and learning how to use M1A1 tanks, F-16 fighter jets and other equipment necessary to rebuild the country's shattered armed forces.
The officials said that a small office would not require a new security agreement with the Iraqi government to replace the existing one, but the size of the office now under active consideration -- with as many as 1,000 personnel -- certainly would, even without a larger contingent of American troops in bases around Iraq after 2011.
While officials said there was still time in the coming months to negotiate with the Iraqis, if they want to, the deadline was rapidly approaching.
''I think everybody understands we can't wait until the end of the year, and also that whatever agreement we are going to reach, we need to start working on that as soon as possible,'' Admiral Mullen said in an interview after meeting with Mr. Maliki in Baghdad. ''There's a finite amount of time. There is a physics problem with this, a mechanical problem, to physically move people and equipment out.''
At the same time, American commanders have also begun to acknowledge that the United States might in fact be able to leave Iraq to handle its own security, something almost unthinkable only a few years ago. Even shortcomings like control of its airspace and electronic surveillance could, in theory, be covered using American aircraft based elsewhere in the Persian Gulf, they say.
''There's no doubt you can get to zero,'' General Wolff said, noting that critics questioned the consequences of reducing the number of troops to 50,000 from more than 140,000 when Mr. Obama took office.
''The president's given us direction, and the answer is zero,'' he said. ''So that's where we're going.''
Others are skeptical, saying that the United States should not risk the failure of a struggling democracy by adhering religiously to the withdrawal.
''We don't yet know whether Iraq's new government will be friendly enough to want a strategic partnership, or stable and effective enough to make one work,'' Anthony Cordesman, a security analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, wrote in a recent report. ''What we do know is that Iraq is far from over its internal problems, and we have not yet won anything in grand strategic terms.
''If we don't maintain strong presence,'' he continued, ''if the State Department does not have sufficient funding to aid Iraq in improving its economy and governance, if Defense cannot maintain a strong advisory presence and offer aid to Iraq in rebuilding its military forces to the point where it can defend the nation, we throw away any chance at turning what has so far been a tactical victory into one that has any lasting meaning.''

HEADLINE: Judicial Math, Beyond 5-4

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
When it comes to the future of the Obama administration's health care plan, the judicial math can seem simple.
So far in three lawsuits against the plan, two federal judges appointed by Democrats have upheld the law; one Republican-appointed judge has declared an important part of it unconstitutional. Use party as your measure, send the cases up the appeals ladder, and you quickly get to a 5-4 decision at the Supreme Court: the justices appointed by Republican presidents will vote to strike down the law. Game over, thanks for playing.
But the votes of the Supreme Court are not that easy to divine, and while political considerations can creep into any judge's views, deeper factors are at play, said Mark Tushnet, a professor at Harvard Law School. Supreme Court justices, for the most part, ''are attuned to their reputations as individuals in history, and their overall place in the government as a whole,'' he said.
Supreme Court justices work differently from judges at the District Court level, noted Jack Balkin, a constitutional scholar at Yale. ''Federal District Court judges do not have to deliberate with anyone else,'' he said. ''Multimember courts are affected by who sits with them,'' and ''this is especially true of a nine-person Supreme Court.'' 
Predicting how justices will vote, and especially the reasoning they will use to get there, becomes especially dicey when questions concerning the extent of government power come up.
Take this year's decision in United States v. Comstock. A Supreme Court majority supported the power of Congress to order the confinement of ''sexually dangerous'' prisoners -- to many observers, an enormous extension of state power. Justice Stephen Breyer, of the court's liberal wing, was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito, who are among the most conservative of the nine.
In the history of Congressional power and the court, one struggle stands out: the New Deal. President Franklin Roosevelt and Congress took on a Supreme Court that was overturning their reform initiatives.
Eventually, they prevailed and the fight left justices reluctant to overturn Congressional action, especially if the legislators could themselves repeal the measure, said Eric M. Freedman, a Constitutional scholar at Hofstra University Law School.
Randy Barnett, a law professor at Georgetown University who opposes the health care bill, agreed that the fight over the law was best understood in the context of the Roosevelt administration. While the court retreated from its efforts to overturn New Deal legislation, Professor Barnett said, those later opinions should not be interpreted as having fully abdicated power to Congress.
The power of the courts to restrict Congress never ended, he said. ''The New Deal cases have been misread by wishful thinking.''
Professor Barnett acknowledges that his overall view is in the minority of legal scholars. But, he said, ''we're not refighting the New Deal here.''
The Obama administration, he said, is ''trying to go beyond the line drawn by the New Deal.''
Opponents of the law insist that Congress has never ordered people to buy something -- that is, to regulate inactivity as opposed to activity.
But Congress has successfully regulated inactivity, said Professor Tushnet of Harvard. In a famous 1942 case, Wickard v. Filburn, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of federal quotas, meant to support wheat prices, that restricted how much farmers could grow. In the case, Roscoe Filburn grew more wheat than permitted; he argued that the wheat was for his own use.
Professor Tushnet noted that Mr. Filburn's actions could be described as a failure to purchase wheat in the general market -- a situation similar to that of people who do not buy health insurance.
''If the constitutional challenge has any legs, it is on the ground that it is unprecedented -- Congress has never done it before,'' he said. ''Well, it turns out that Congress has done it before.''
Michael McConnell, a senior fellow of the Hoover Institution and director of the Constitutional Law Center at Stanford, said the health care bill ''is the first time that regulation of commerce has been taken this far.''
Even so, he said, ''that doesn't make it automatically unconstitutional.'' Professor McConnell said the New Deal had been misunderstood -- but not necessarily in the ways that Professor Barnett argues it has.
In his view, Professor McConnell said, the Supreme Court's initial resistance to the New Deal legislation sent Congress back to the drawing board to fashion better legal approaches.
''By the time the Supreme Court started sustaining most of the New Deal legislation, the character of it had changed, and become much more economically defensible,'' he said. ''You can say that the Supreme Court actually helped save the Roosevelt administration from some of its mistakes.''
The chief justice at the height of the court crisis, Charles Evans Hughes, would say that the problem with the early New Deal legislation was not its political slant but its legal quality.
In ''Rethinking the New Deal Court: The Structure of a Constitutional Revolution,'' the legal historian Barry Cushman wrote that Chief Justice Hughes complained to a United States senator, ''The laws have been poorly drafted, the briefs have been badly drawn and the arguments have been poorly presented.''
Professor McConnell, who pronounced himself no fan of the individual mandate, said similar things could happen with the health care law. ''It's not impossible that some kind of interplay between the administration, a more skeptical Congress and a somewhat more skeptical judiciary could lead to improvements in the legislation.''
Professor Freedman of Hofstra noted that even if the justices were reluctant to accept the government's primary argument that inactivity can be controlled under the Commerce Clause, there are other grounds for finding the health care law constitutional. The most attractive to the court, he suggested, might be categorizing the fine for not buying health care as a tax. He noted that a while only a handful of cases had restricted the power of Congress, under the Commerce Clause, the power to tax has almost always been upheld. The Obama administration has made the tax argument in court, despite having argued during Congressional debate that the financial penalties under the individual mandate were not a new tax.
That seemingly uncomfortable conflict for the administration might suggest a path to upholding the law. A finding that the mandate is in fact a tax -- and thus constitutional -- could mean ''the Obama administration might gain a long-term legal victory at the cost of a short-term political loss,'' Professor Freedman said.
In the world of sports, that's called winning ugly. But the Obama team would probably be happy to win any way it can.

HEADLINE: A Lesson For Wall St. About Failure

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR. 
E-mail: carr@nytimes.com; twitter.com/carr2n

 BODY:
It's awards season again, and critics and the academy members are deciding on their top film picks of the year. But in many corners of the business community, the issue is already settled: ''Waiting for 'Superman' '' is the year's must-see film.
On Wall Street and on Silicon Valley office campuses, in hedge fund boardrooms and at year-end Christmas parties, it seems you can't have a conversation without someone talking about the movie that finally lays bare America's public education crisis. 
''Waiting for 'Superman' '' is one thing that Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg agree on, Rupert Murdoch talks about to anyone who will listen, David Koch of Koch Industries promotes, and Paul Tudor Jones and many of his hedge fund brethren work to support.
''Waiting for 'Superman' '' follows five children and their parents as they run a gantlet to gain access to high-performing charter schools because the alternative -- the public system -- is a complete disaster. The film has caught the imagination of the business community because it represents a reckoning for public education and its chronic failures, making the very businesslike case that large school systems and the unions that go with them must be replaced by a customized, semi-privatized education in the form of charter schools.
Which is odd when you think about it. If you are looking for an American institution that failed the public, made resources disappear without returning value and lacked accountability for its manifest sins, the Education Department would be in line well behind Wall Street.
By now, the notion that business is a place built on accountability and performance should be as outdated as the one-room schoolhouse. Ask yourself, what would happen if American public schools were offered hundreds of billions in bailout money? One outcome is not in the cards: its leaders would not end up back at the trough so quickly, sucking up tens of millions in bonuses as Wall Street has.
If the captains of American business are looking for a holiday movie, I have another suggestion for them. I'm not talking about ''Inside Job,'' which is a scabrous take on the well-documented story of how the American economy was nearly tipped over by business greed and incompetence. Nah, I'd buy them a bucket of popcorn and sit them in front of ''The Company Men,'' a moody and elegiac feature film starring Ben Affleck, Tommy Lee Jones and Chris Cooper as businessmen who have a moment of clarity about how American business lost its soul.
As executives at GTX, a fictitious multinational corporation involved in the transportation business, among other endeavors, they watch as many of their colleagues are laid off to meet inflated earnings targets and as numbers get ginned up to keep the stock price growing and potential acquirers at bay. And then their turn comes.
At that point, ''The Company Men'' becomes a film about the loss of privilege: Porsches are sold and driven away, access to the private golf club is denied and suburban mansions go on the market. But the movie delivers, over and over, a message that far from being a center of American know-how and ingenuity, much of modern business is now preoccupied with goosing the share price and tricking up the year-end bonus -- about getting over by getting by.
The film manages to use the tableau of a bunch of rich guys losing their jobs to reach a fundamental question of this economic age. How can it be that both corporate profits and unemployment are simultaneously high?
''When I made the film, I had hoped it would be a historical document, a portrait of a very bad moment in American economic history,'' said John Wells, an executive producer of the television series ''ER'' and the director of ''The Company Men,'' who began working on the film in 2007. ''Unfortunately, it didn't turn out that way.''
''The Company Men'' reflects that America is no longer in the business of building and making actual physical objects. Instead, all the energy and resources go into the kind of financial engineering that creates quarterly numbers that Wall Street buys into. Mr. Wells said that he spent a great deal of time talking with chief executives who run large concerns like his movie's fictional GTX and said only so much of the blame can be laid at the corner office.
''They are responding to the needs of the market, to the institutional investors -- the large mutual funds, the money market funds,'' he said. ''And when you think about it, that implicates all of us because we are all investing in the market one way or another.''
The movie resonates in the current moment because each day it becomes more clear that the guy at the bar who mutters into his whisky glass about the game being rigged is probably right.
On Dec. 12, my colleague Louise Story chronicled how nine men from various banks meet in secret every month to oversee, and in some aspects control, trading in derivatives, the arcane and often lucrative financial instruments that are used to hedge risk. As her article makes clear, the opacity and secrecy of the systems give banks the upper hand and leaves at their whim the market's less pedigreed players.
It is a small slice of a large problem of self-dealing and self-enrichment on Wall Street, often at the expense of the rest of us. Decisions made there land hard in the middle places where most of America lives and works.
''You know that show 'Undercover Boss?' '' Mr. Wells asked, referring to the hit television show on CBS. ''I'd like to see a show called 'Undercover Investor' where investors go undercover and get a good look at the companies that are being decimated by restructuring plays and roll-ups.''
He added: ''I think so many people are seeing business and how it is conducted in the abstract that they have no idea about how these decisions play out.''

HEADLINE: WEIGHING COSTS, COMPANIES FAVOR TEMPORARY HELP

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
Temporary workers are starting to look, well, not so temporary.
Despite a surge this year in short-term hiring, many American businesses are still skittish about making those jobs permanent, raising concerns among workers and some labor experts that temporary employees will become a larger, more entrenched part of the work force.
This is bad news for the nation's workers, who are already facing one of the bleakest labor markets in recent history. Temporary employees generally receive fewer benefits or none at all, and have virtually no job security. It is harder for them to save. And it is much more difficult for them to develop a career arc while hopping from boss to boss.
''We're in a period where uncertainty seems to be going on forever,'' said David Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''So this period of temporary employment seems to be going on forever.'' 
This year, companies have hired temporary workers in significant numbers. In November, they accounted for 80 percent of the 50,000 jobs added by private sector employers, according to the Labor Department. Since the beginning of the year, employers have added a net 307,000 temporary workers, more than a quarter of the 1.17 million private sector jobs added in total.
One worker who has been forced to accept temporary jobs is Jeffrey Rodeo, 43, who was laid off 14 months ago from his job as an accounting manager at a produce company in Sacramento. He has applied for nearly 700 full-time positions since then, but has yet to receive an offer. Meanwhile, to stay afloat and keep his skills fresh, he has worked on short-term stints at four different employers.
Mr. Rodeo figures his peripatetic work life will last at least another year. ''Companies are being more careful,'' he said. ''It just may take longer to secure a permanent position.''
To the more than 15 million people who are still out of work, those with temporary jobs are lucky. With concerns mounting that the long-term unemployed are becoming increasingly unemployable, those in temporary jobs are at least maintaining ties to the working world.
The competition for them can often be as fierce as for permanent openings, and there are still far too few of them to go around. Indeed, the relative strength in temporary hiring has done little to dent the stubbornly high unemployment rate, which rose to 9.8 percent in November.
''With business confidence, particularly in the small business sector, extremely low,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at the High Frequency Economics research firm, ''it's not surprising that permanent hiring is lagging behind.''
The landscape two or three years from now might look quite different, of course. Many economists and executives at temporary agencies say there are signs that more robust permanent hiring is coming in the new year. Business confidence is up, and temporary agencies report that the percentage of interim workers who have been offered full-time jobs is also up from last year.
Nevertheless, there are signs that this time around, the economy could be moving toward a higher reliance on temporary workers over the long term.
This year, 26.2 percent of all jobs added by private sector employers were temporary positions. In the comparable period after the recession of the early 1990s, only 10.9 percent of the private sector jobs added were temporary, and after the downturn earlier this decade, just 7.1 percent were temporary.
Temporary employees still make up a small fraction of total employees, but that segment has been rising steeply over the past year. ''It hints at a structural change,'' said Allen L. Sinai, chief global economist at the consulting firm Decision Economics. Temp workers ''are becoming an ever more important part of what is going on,'' he said.
Several factors could be contributing to the trend. Many businesses now tend to organize around short- to medium-term projects that can be doled out to temporary or contract workers.
Donald Lane, chief executive of Makino, a manufacturer of machine tools near Cincinnati, said his company would increasingly outsource projects to contract firms that pull together temporary teams. When installing a large machine, for example, Mr. Lane said the company could appoint one full-time supervisor to oversee a number of less skilled short-term workers.
Mr. Lane said he hoped to raise Makino's share of temporary employees from 10 to 15 percent now to about 25 percent in the future.
Flexibility is another factor. Corporate executives, stung by the depth of the recent downturn, are looking to make it easier to hire and fire workers. And with the cost of health and retirement benefits running high, many companies are looking to reduce that burden. In some cases, companies wrongly classify regular employees as temporary or contract workers in order to save on benefit costs and taxes.
Certainly, Americans who have never held anything but a full-time job have sought out temporary posts because they were the only jobs available. And even before the recession, workers were learning that lifelong employment was disappearing along with phone booths and Filofax organizers.
But people still tend to prefer jobs with some sense of permanence, and with full health benefits and some form of retirement contribution.
According to a survey by Staffing Industry Analysts, a Mountain View, Calif., research firm, 68 percent of all temporary workers are seeking permanent employment.
But the whole notion of what constitutes a permanent job may simply be changing. Workers ''need to expect that their lives and jobs will change much more often than they have in the past,'' said Jonas Prising, president of the Americas at Manpower.
Some people have discovered they prefer the freelance life. Antonia Musto lost her job as a staff accountant for a newspaper in Wilkes Barre, Pa., more than two years ago. She signed on with oDesk, a company that matches contract workers with employers online.
She has since worked for several different businesses and even turned down a full-time offer last November. ''I just think I've gotten very accustomed to working very fast and working with many different people,'' Ms. Musto, 38, said. She said she had fully replaced the income she was making at the newspaper and buys private health insurance.
Of course, businesses that can now hire talented workers for temporary jobs may find that when demand picks up, they will need to offer full-time positions with perks and benefits. But it could take a long time to reach that point.
That indefinite stretch worries workers who fear that future employers will look askance at a resume filled with short-term engagements. Others worry that they will lose valuable years of saving for the future.
Mr. Rodeo, the Sacramento accounting manager, said he made anywhere from 10 to 50 percent less while working in temporary jobs than he did at the produce company. He has also been without health insurance all year. None of the interim employers or temporary agencies have contributed to a 401(k) plan, nor has he been able to save much on his own.
''That's the scariest part,'' said Mr. Rodeo.
He is confident he will eventually land a permanent post, but until then, he knows he is losing ground in planning for retirement. ''Of course, for my generation, you can't plan on Social Security,'' he said. ''Most likely, I will have to work longer.''
Others are starting to face the prospect that they could move among temporary assignments for the rest of their careers.
Jose Marin, 50, known as J. D., lost his technology job in Miami in February and moved to North Carolina to live with his sister. After months of looking for a permanent job, he signed on with Modis, a unit of Adecco, and in August began a temporary assignment for a financial services company in Cary, a town west of Raleigh.
While grateful for the job, he longs for a permanent position. ''I'm still old-fashioned and I still want to work for a company where I make a difference and I'm going to be there to retire,'' said Mr. Marin. ''I know that's wishful thinking.''

HEADLINE: Afghan War Just a Slice Of Coverage

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
As the Obama administration conducted an Afghanistan-Pakistan strategy review this month, the news media did too, and the coverage came peppered with question marks.
The same week that ABC News scheduled a series of segments titled ''Afghanistan: Can We Win?,'' Katie Couric of the ''CBS Evening News'' devoted six minutes to a special report, ''Can This War Be Won?''
A recent headline atop New York magazine repeated a question asked by dozens of opinion writers this year -- and last year, and the year before -- ''Why Are We in Afghanistan?''
The questions reflect the complex nature of the Afghan war, and of the news coverage. 
The grueling war there, where a day rarely goes by without an allied casualty, is like a faint heartbeat, accounting for just 4 percent of the nation's news coverage in major outlets through early December, according to a study by the Project for Excellence in Journalism, an arm of the Pew Research Center.
That is down slightly from last year, when the war accounted for 5 percent.
''It's never passed the threshold to be a big story week in, week out for Americans,'' said Mark Jurkowitz, the associate director of the project.
One senior foreign correspondent for television, when told of the 4 percent coverage figure, said he was impressed -- given the relatively small contingent of foreign journalists in Afghanistan.
''There are like seven of us there,'' remarked the correspondent, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to call into question his network's commitment to the war. Those who are there have done courageous work, exposing corruption and documenting military progress in rooting out insurgents.
The low levels of coverage reflect the limitations on news-gathering budgets and, some say, low levels of interest in the war among the public. About a quarter of Americans follow news about Afghanistan closely, according to recent surveys by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press.
''Inside the United States, you've got audiences that are beginning to suffer from war fatigue,'' said Tony Maddox, who oversees international coverage for CNN.
Mr. Maddox said CNN had ''worked very hard'' to make the war resonate with viewers, sometimes through human interest stories. ''It's always the eternal challenge in terms of international coverage: making the important interesting,'' he said.
As President Obama signaled last year that he would wind down the war in Iraq and refocus attention on Afghanistan, television networks largely withdrew from Baghdad, and moved staff to the Afghan capital, Kabul, though not on an equivalent basis. Newspapers and wire services also bulked up in Kabul.
American networks each generally have one correspondent in Kabul at all times, sometimes working on a freelance basis. The office space in Kabul is a home base for occasional visits by anchors, like Lester Holt of NBC, who spent Thanksgiving there, and George Stephanopoulos of ABC, who interviewed Gen. David H. Petraeus there two weeks ago.
Of the cable news networks, Greta Van Susteren of Fox News and Rachel Maddow of MSNBC also spent time in the country this year.
But there is no doubt that cutbacks by media companies have affected the way that the war is transmitted to American living rooms. ABC News cut roughly 25 percent of its work force last spring, and last summer, CBS News laid off most of its camera crews based in London, the jumping-off point for international coverage.
''There's a general drive to do everything with less,'' said another television correspondent, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity because he did not have permission to comment publicly.
At the same time, there are pockets of noteworthy coverage, including by national newspapers, the CBS newsmagazine ''60 Minutes'' and the AfPak Channel, a Web site from Foreign Policy magazine and the New America Foundation. In July, The New York Times and several other news organizations published portions of the military and intelligence reports about the war made public by WikiLeaks, garnering widespread attention.
On the ground, the war remains a dangerous assignment for journalists. In January, Rupert Hamer of the British newspaper The Sunday Mirror was killed while traveling with the military near Nawa. In June, James P. Hunter, a staff sergeant and a writer, was killed in Kandahar. The Committee to Protect Journalists said he was the first Army journalist killed in action in Afghanistan since the war started nine years ago. And Joao Silva, a photographer for The Times, sustained critical injuries in a late October bomb blast in southern Afghanistan.
This year, American economic concerns, the midterm elections and the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico each earned more than twice as much news media attention as the war, according to the Pew assessment, which comes from a weekly study of the nation's major newspapers, radio and television newscasts, and major news Web sites.
The study started in 2007. In that year, Afghanistan -- which was a relatively low-grade conflict at the time, with many fewer allied causalities -- accounted for only 1 percent of the nation's news coverage. The same held true in 2008. The coverage picked up markedly at the end of 2009, when Mr. Obama conducted a lengthy review of Afghanistan strategy, but still added up to only 5 percent for the year.
Four or 5 percent ''may be the baseline, at least for now, no matter what the strategic stakes are, or even as U.S. involvement ratchets up,'' Mr. Jurkowitz said.
This year, Mr. Jurkowitz estimated, roughly half of the coverage of Afghanistan actually emanated from the war zone. That suggests that ''without a major Washington policy debate or strategy review ongoing, that Afghanistan remains a story that gets modest coverage,'' he said.
Modest, with question marks. When the CNN host Eliot Spitzer asked on Thursday night, ''Why are we even there,'' his guests had few answers.
The skepticism was noticeable this month when ABC conducted another of its checkups on the war. The Emmy-winning series was titled ''Where Things Stand'' when it was started in 2004 for Iraq, but this month, for Afghanistan, it was renamed ''Can We Win?''
Tom Nagorski, the foreign managing editor for ABC News, said it was not a political statement or change in tone; rather, it reflected the fact that Mr. Obama's strategic review was under way. ''It's a chance to bring some great, old-fashioned, terrific reporting to bear,'' he said.
Privately, some television executives say the Afghanistan coverage is an outgrowth of the self-evaluations made by news organizations in the wake of the Iraq war, when many were faulted for not broadcasting sufficient skepticism.
At the same time, there are antiwar voices who say the news media has been ''compliant'' with regard to Afghanistan -- the word that Joe Scarborough used on Friday on his MSNBC program, ''Morning Joe.''
He asked Richard N. Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, ''For years, we have had journalists wringing their hands and editorialists lashing out at the profession for not asking the tough questions leading up to Iraq. Ten years from now, won't we be saying the same thing about Afghanistan?''
Mr. Haass said he feared that Mr. Scarborough was right. ''I think history's going to be brutal on the questions that haven't been asked.'' Or, alternatively, the answers that haven't been heard.

HEADLINE: When Zombies Win

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
When historians look back at 2008-10, what will puzzle them most, I believe, is the strange triumph of failed ideas. Free-market fundamentalists have been wrong about everything -- yet they now dominate the political scene more thoroughly than ever.
How did that happen? How, after runaway banks brought the economy to its knees, did we end up with Ron Paul, who says ''I don't think we need regulators,'' about to take over a key House panel overseeing the Fed? How, after the experiences of the Clinton and Bush administrations -- the first raised taxes and presided over spectacular job growth; the second cut taxes and presided over anemic growth even before the crisis -- did we end up with bipartisan agreement on even more tax cuts? 
The answer from the right is that the economic failures of the Obama administration show that big-government policies don't work. But the response should be, what big-government policies?
For the fact is that the Obama stimulus -- which itself was almost 40 percent tax cuts -- was far too cautious to turn the economy around. And that's not 20-20 hindsight: many economists, myself included, warned from the beginning that the plan was grossly inadequate. Put it this way: A policy under which government employment actually fell, under which government spending on goods and services grew more slowly than during the Bush years, hardly constitutes a test of Keynesian economics.
Now, maybe it wasn't possible for President Obama to get more in the face of Congressional skepticism about government. But even if that's true, it only demonstrates the continuing hold of a failed doctrine over our politics.
It's also worth pointing out that everything the right said about why Obamanomics would fail was wrong. For two years we've been warned that government borrowing would send interest rates sky-high; in fact, rates have fluctuated with optimism or pessimism about recovery, but stayed consistently low by historical standards. For two years we've been warned that inflation, even hyperinflation, was just around the corner; instead, disinflation has continued, with core inflation -- which excludes volatile food and energy prices -- now at a half-century low.
The free-market fundamentalists have been as wrong about events abroad as they have about events in America -- and suffered equally few consequences. ''Ireland,'' declared George Osborne in 2006, ''stands as a shining example of the art of the possible in long-term economic policymaking.'' Whoops. But Mr. Osborne is now Britain's top economic official.
And in his new position, he's setting out to emulate the austerity policies Ireland implemented after its bubble burst. After all, conservatives on both sides of the Atlantic spent much of the past year hailing Irish austerity as a resounding success. ''The Irish approach worked in 1987-89 -- and it's working now,'' declared Alan Reynolds of the Cato Institute last June. Whoops, again.
But such failures don't seem to matter. To borrow the title of a recent book by the Australian economist John Quiggin on doctrines that the crisis should have killed but didn't, we're still -- perhaps more than ever -- ruled by ''zombie economics.'' Why?
Part of the answer, surely, is that people who should have been trying to slay zombie ideas have tried to compromise with them instead. And this is especially, though not only, true of the president.
People tend to forget that Ronald Reagan often gave ground on policy substance -- most notably, he ended up enacting multiple tax increases. But he never wavered on ideas, never backed down from the position that his ideology was right and his opponents were wrong.
President Obama, by contrast, has consistently tried to reach across the aisle by lending cover to right-wing myths. He has praised Reagan for restoring American dynamism (when was the last time you heard a Republican praising F.D.R.?), adopted G.O.P. rhetoric about the need for the government to tighten its belt even in the face of recession, offered symbolic freezes on spending and federal wages.
None of this stopped the right from denouncing him as a socialist. But it helped empower bad ideas, in ways that can do quite immediate harm. Right now Mr. Obama is hailing the tax-cut deal as a boost to the economy -- but Republicans are already talking about spending cuts that would offset any positive effects from the deal. And how effectively can he oppose these demands, when he himself has embraced the rhetoric of belt-tightening?
Yes, politics is the art of the possible. We all understand the need to deal with one's political enemies. But it's one thing to make deals to advance your goals; it's another to open the door to zombie ideas. When you do that, the zombies end up eating your brain -- and quite possibly your economy too.

HEADLINE: Rethinking Disability Insurance

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Making Disability Work'' (column, Dec. 10):
Peter Orszag rightly expresses concern about people on disability separating themselves from the workplace for longer than they might if they had other options. It is so difficult to get Social Security disability; the process of appeals and hearings often takes more than a year, during which applicants often have no income and no health care. The difficulty of this process provides a disincentive to give up disability benefits and try to resume work.
However, Mr. Orszag's suggested solution -- employer-sponsored disability insurance -- is never going to happen. Many employers can't afford to provide health insurance; it is unrealistic to think that they could be persuaded to assume additional burdens. 
There are solutions, though. We should have short-term Social Security disability -- a year or two during which a person could recover from surgery, stabilize a chronic condition or ride out an episodic flare. If accompanied by a streamlined application process, this would be favored by many applicants over permanent disability.
Not only would it provide an incentive to get back to work as soon as one is able, but it also would save money by shifting people from permanent benefits to temporary, short-term payouts. This type of system works well in New York and California, which have state-sponsored temporary disability. It should be tried on a national level.
Jennifer C. Jaff Executive Director, Advocacy for Patients With Chronic Illness Farmington, Conn., Dec. 10, 2010
To the Editor:
Peter Orszag is wise to worry that the current system for awarding federal disability benefits will help to make unemployment perpetual for millions of Americans. But I disagree that an additional layer of private disability insurance will solve the problem.
A foretaste of how employer-mandated disability insurance might play out is offered in The Times's account of the scandal that is workers' compensation in New York (''Exams of Injured Workers Fuel Mutual Mistrust,'' front page, April 1, 2009).
The law mandates independent medical exams to verify such claims, which are paid for by employers' private insurance companies. The insurance companies hire the examiners, and those who provide honest assessments -- finding injuries that justify the claims -- are not likely to be hired again.
Judges who handle challenges in this corrupt system are well aware that the reports from certain notorious examiners have no credibility. But cases drag on endlessly, and injured workers often give up in frustration.
Why would anyone assume that a longer-term insurance liability forced on employers would result in more equitable outcomes?
William G. Passannante New York, Dec. 10, 2010
The writer is an insurance recovery lawyer.
To the Editor:
Peter Orszag makes an excellent point about how people on disability insurance typically stay on it permanently, even when they're capable of returning to work. In a recent survey of people with psychiatric disabilities, we found that many of them were reluctant to try returning to work because they feared losing their disability benefits.
The nation's disability insurance system does not allow people to enter or leave easily. If beneficiaries could reclaim benefits should temporary setbacks arise, they would have a stronger incentive to rejoin the work force.
Increasing the number of people with disabilities who can be employed, even if part time, not only adds to the country's tax base, but also helps these individuals on their path to recovery.
Trish Marsik New York, Dec. 10, 2010
The writer is the assistant commissioner of the Bureau of Mental Health at the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.

PERSON: Rene Le Berre 

HEADLINE: Rene Le Berre, Entomologist, Dies at 78; Directed Fight Against River Blindness

BYLINE: By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN

 BODY:
Rene Le Berre, a French entomologist who helped inspire an international campaign that saved millions of West Africans from the parasitic disease river blindness, died Dec. 6 in L'Aiguillon-sur-Mer on France's western coast. He was 78.
The cause was cardiovascular disease complicated by diabetes, said a former colleague, Dr. Joel G. Breman of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. 
Onchocerciasis, the formal name for river blindness, had once been a scourge in the fertile river basins of tropical Africa.
Transmitted when black flies living in rapidly running rivers bite a victim repeatedly, releasing parasitic worms into the body, the disease brings excruciating itching, creates nodules under the skin and often results in blindness. Victims can remain infected for 15 years.
The path toward conquering river blindness in Africa began in 1972 at a small medical clinic in Upper Volta, now Burkina Faso.
Dr. Le Berre (pronounced le-BEAR), who had long been working in West Africa on insecticide programs to kill black flies, met for three hours at that clinic with Robert S. McNamara, former secretary of defense in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, who was visiting Africa as president of the World Bank.
Dr. Le Berre, who had contracted a mild form of river blindness in Africa, spoke halting English, but the photographs he showed to Mr. McNamara told a gruesome tale. They depicted African youngsters guiding lines of men who had been blinded, and portrayed river-blindness sufferers with disfiguring nodules.
In September 1973, the World Bank announced plans for a 20-year, $120 million program to fight river blindness in Africa. It joined with the World Health Organization and other international agencies to form the Onchocerciasis Control Program.
''To convince someone like Mr. McNamara wasn't easy when you're a Frenchman in the middle of nowhere,'' Dr. Le Berre once recalled in a publication of the River Blindness Foundation, whose operations were assumed by the Carter Center in 1996. ''But it was a golden opportunity.''
Dr. Le Berre, who had mapped thousands of breeding sites for black flies during the 1960s, directed aerial attacks on them for the international control program, deploying small planes and helicopters to spray insecticides.
''It is not a war where you say you will win, it is a kind of guerrilla war,'' he told The Associated Press in 1977, reflecting on the long road to controlling river blindness.
The focus on combating the disease changed in the 1980s when Merck & Company in the United States began donating millions of doses of the drug ivermectin to Africans in river blindness regions. Ivermectin weakens the parasitic worms released by the black flies, enabling the body's natural defenses to destroy them.
According to the World Health Organization, the control program, which ended in 2002, protected millions of people in 11 African countries from the effects of river blindness and enabled cultivation and resettlement in river basins after villagers terrified of river blindness had fled to less productive uplands.
Rene Le Berre was born in Quimper, France, on March 3, 1932. He graduated from the University of Rennes, was trained in medical entomology at the Institut Pasteur in Paris and received a science doctorate from the University of Orsay. After working in Africa, he continued his disease eradication efforts for the World Health Organization at its Geneva headquarters.
Dr. Le Berre had been living in retirement at L'Aiguillon-sur-Mer. He is survived by his wife, Eliane, and a son, Francois, of Bangkok.

HEADLINE: THE CAUCUS; With Major Bills Passed and a Fifth Term Ahead, Reid Takes a Victory Lap

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
In manner and rhetoric, Mr. Reid, the flinty Democrat of Nevada, draws unflattering comparisons with his august predecessors. His colorless visage rated only the B-list of Democratic villainy in the 2010 Republican campaign, behind the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California. Fellow Democrats were so convinced that he would lose his seat that they began an intense sotto voce fight to succeed him.
''You couldn't find six or seven people who really thought I could win,'' Mr. Reid said with a smile. 
He ultimately won a fifth term - and a raft of legislative victories in a chamber best known recently for gridlock. Repeal over the weekend of the ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy barring gay, lesbian and bisexual members from serving openly in the military joined the economic stimulus package, the national health care legislation, new financial regulations and a huge tax-cut bill on a list of accomplishments that even Republicans can't help admiring.
''He has, in fact, achieved a great deal,'' said Sheila Burke, who was the chief of staff to Bob Dole, the former Republican senator, when he served as majority leader. ''I don't think anyone can credibly suggest otherwise.''
Still fighting to add to those accomplishments by winning Senate ratification of a nuclear arms control treaty with Russia this week, Mr. Reid goes so far as to claim a central role in ''the most productive Congress in the history of the country.''
Ending a brutal year, with the prospect of renewed combat just ahead, he paused in an interview to savor a victory lap. ''I don't have people saying 'he's the greatest speaker,' 'he's handsome,' 'he's a man about town,' '' Mr. Reid said before a fire in his office off the Senate floor. ''But I don't really care. I feel very comfortable with my place in history.''
Battling the Criticism
Nevadans have never let Mr. Reid get too comfortable in his home state. With Democrats reeling everywhere and Nevada suffering the nation's highest unemployment rate, Mr. Reid's pattern of narrow election victories appeared destined to end this year. But he got lucky when Republicans nominated a mistake-prone Tea Party favorite, Sharron Angle, and his aides built a potent turnout operation that delivered 50.2 percent of the vote.
In the capital, Mr. Reid has battled criticism that he lacks the stature of earlier leaders in both parties, from Mike Mansfield to Mr. Dole. David S. Broder, The Washington Post's venerable columnist, has derided him as ''amateurish,'' ''partisan,'' ''parochial'' and ''incapable of summoning his colleagues to statesmanship.''
But such criticism reflects ''an idealized 1965 view of the Senate,'' countered Burdett Loomis, a Congressional scholar at the University of Kansas. In the present-day reality of intense partisan polarization, he added, Mr. Reid's grit and stamina helped produce a legislative output ''in Great Society territory'' for its reach and importance.
Momentum from Mr. Obama's victory gave Mr. Reid advantages from the start. So did the largest Senate majority in a generation; for a significant stretch, it included 60 members, the number needed to overcome minority filibusters. Indeed, liberals insist that he could have achieved more, like a health bill containing a so-called public option for insurance.
Still, Mr. Loomis concluded: ''For all his mumbling and stumbling, you have to say, in the traditions of the Senate, this guy really did his job.''A Self-Assessment
On health care, Mr. Reid faults himself for not having been partisan enough. He shared responsibility with Mr. Obama for a costly delay in floor action to allow for extended, fruitless negotiations between Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, and Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa.
''We spent far too much time piddling around in the Finance Committee,'' Mr. Reid said. ''That was handled very poorly.''
Mr. Reid boasted that this month's tax-cut compromise brought ''some of my greatest work'' - because of what he didn't do. By resisting White House entreaties to join the negotiations, he preserved his credibility among Democratic colleagues unhappy with the outcome; all but 14 of them eventually joined him in backing it.
Still unclear is whether that bipartisan victory becomes a template for cooperation among Mr. Obama, a House controlled by Republicans and a Senate with diminished Democratic strength. When the 112th Congress convenes in January, Republican memories of hardball tactics by Mr. Reid and others in the 111th won't help.
''They've broken a lot of china'' in amassing legislative victories, said Ms. Burke, the former aide to Mr. Dole. ''It's going to be a very difficult next two years.''
For his part, Mr. Reid predicted, ''We'll get some things done,'' naming comprehensive immigration legislation as one possibility.
If Republicans' vulnerability among Hispanic voters does not persuade them to compromise, he noted, ''they have real problems with their mental capacity.''
His interpretation of the midterm election message: voters want both parties to cooperate on reducing the deficit. But, he said, no one should expect a new Harry Reid.
''No,'' the Senate leader said quietly. ''Same old guy.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Mr. Keshin had worked for McCann Erickson and the McCann Worldgroup since 1980.
Joel Ewanick, vice president for United States marketing at General Motors, Detroit, will add duties for worldwide marketing operations and take the new title of global chief marketing officer.
Edward J.

Miscellany
Pizza Hut, Dallas, part of Yum Brands, said it would, for the first time, buy a commercial during the Super Bowl. The spot will appear in Super Bowl XLV on Fox Broadcasting on Feb. 6. For decades, Pizza Hut has advertised in the pregame and postgame shows but has not bought commercial time during the game itself. The many media outlets that review, analyze and report on commercials shown on Super Bowl Sunday typically cover only those spots that are shown during the game. Also, Web outlets like AOL, usatoday.com and YouTube, which give advertisers free exposure by running video clips of Super Bowl commercials after the game, almost never include spots that do not appear during the game.
ESPN, Bristol, Conn., part of the Walt Disney Company, acquired most of the intellectual property of PVI Virtual Media Services, Lawrenceville, N.J. Financial terms were not disclosed. PVI, originally called Princeton Video Image, was a pioneer in the digital placement of ''virtual'' products and other images in television shows and movies.

HEADLINE: Trying to Overcome the Stubborn Blight of Vacancies

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio -- In its heyday in the 1930s, this Rust Belt town called itself the City of Homes, a place where a working-class man could be master of his own castle.
But when it fell upon hard times, thousands of homes fell into foreclosure in one of the first modern mortgage crises. Thirty years later, many of those houses still sit, their boarded-up windows staring like dead eyes into Youngstown's streets.
As cities around the country try to pick apart the snarl left by the foreclosure crisis, Youngstown stands out as a troubling specter of how hard it is to have success. Its vacant-building rate is still 20 times the national average, according to figures provided by John D. Bralich, a researcher at the Center for Urban and Regional Studies at Youngstown State University. 
But despite the city's best efforts to deal with the vacant structures -- including, most recently, a handful of legal remedies meant to increase municipal control -- they remain a maddeningly intractable problem.
''This is Hurricane Katrina over 30 years,'' said Phil Kidd, a community organizer.
Youngstown's troubles all started with a sharp economic decline after the closing of steel mills in the 1970s, which has reduced the city's population by 60 percent, to 72,000, over several decades. Vacant buildings brought blight, and depressed property values, but for years, officials hoped the problem would just go away.
They sought saviors in the form of a blimp plant and an Avanti sports car factory, among others. None materialized, repelled, in part, by feudal-style corruption.
In those years, people dealt with the vacant houses by burning them down, a practice that became so routine in the 1980s that the mob made a business of it, stripping glass doorknobs and mahogany mantelpieces before setting the blaze in a process known as ''scarfing,'' said Sherry Linkon, a co-director of the Center for Working-Class Studies at Youngstown State.
A fresh chance came in 2000, when an energetic former banker for the Federal Reserve in Cleveland, Jay Williams, became the city's community development director, and five years later, its mayor. He soon unveiled Youngstown 2010, a blueprint that called for shrinking the city, something no one had dared speak about in the past.
The vacant properties were the ''800-pound gorilla in the room,'' in Mr. Williams's words, but somehow a solution remained elusive.
Ordinances were passed, but they fell victim to political infighting and legal action. Code enforcement was difficult because the city's planning department, which employed 28 people in the 1970s, had dwindled to 3, including the secretary.
So demolitions became the main policy, more expensive (and legal) than arson, and still a blunt tool. During Mr. Williams's tenure, more than 2,000 vacant houses have been knocked down, but thousands more remain.
According to the Mahoning Valley Organizing Collaborative, a nonprofit organization that encourages public participation in housing issues, there are 5,249 vacant structures in the city. Together with the approximately 20,000 vacant lots, that makes about 40 percent of the city vacant in some form, according to the group.
As a result, houses have been cheap, and when the frenzy of buying began in the recent housing bubble, that was blood in the water. The average price of a house for the city, based on the past year of sales, is about $17,000, and on the poorer east side, under $10,000.
''People would call and ask, 'Should there be another zero on this?''' said Maureen O'Neil, a real estate agent who also works for the city.
Real estate agents got calls from buyers steeped in late-night infomercials, who had bought a Youngstown house on eBay. Sherry A. DeMar, an agent in a suburb of Youngstown, said she went to look at a house for a buyer in California who had made the purchase based on a photograph he saw on the Internet.
''I told him, 'Do you realize the roof has caved in?''' she recalled. ''He didn't believe me. He said, 'It looked great in the photograph.' ''
New foreclosures began to infect areas that had long been immune, compounding misery for residents and headaches for city planners. Now, about a fifth of vacant structures in Youngstown are owned by out-of-state residents, Mr. Bralich said. Thirty-six percent of the new owners are from California.
Recent years have produced more progress, in part because federal stimulus money arrived. A rental-registration program, initially proposed in the 1990s, is finally up and running, led by Ms. O'Neil and carried out by two inspectors.
An organization was set up to repair blighted houses, and its focus, the Idora neighborhood, is now stable enough that a grocery store plans to open in it, the first in decades. A new land bank program is putting vacant properties back into use, and some to seed. One now is home to a winery.
They are small steps, and may seem insignificant when compared with Youngstown's population decline, which has continued in 2010, according to new estimates from the Census Bureau. Even more vexing, despite the city's efforts to entice residents in far-flung areas of the city to move closer to the center, no one has agreed, and the city's footprint remains unmanageably large.
But residents and officials argue that the principal success has been a change in thinking, one of the biggest obstacles, and with it an infusion of civic energy on the part of residents. Efforts by the group of young activists that form the Mahoning Valley Organizing Collaborative has produced 53 resident-run community groups, up from 19 several years ago.
''There is a shift in mind-set away from silver bullets,'' said Hunter Morrison, director of campus planning at Youngstown State. ''It's a much more grown-up approach.''

SUBSIDIES CUT IN IRAN
And Fuel Prices Soar
Gasoline prices in Iran spiked after government subsidies were reduced, jumping to about $1.44 a gallon from about 38 cents. Riot police guarded filling stations around the capital, though no violence was reported, anticipating riots similar to those in 2007 when gasoline rationing was introduced. Page A5
SOMALI MILITIA RETREATS 
An Islamist militia abandoned several key positions in and outside Mogadishu, Somalia, the latest indication that it has proved the weaker in its rivalry with the Shabab, the radical militant group that now controls much of the country. Page A6
A PROMISE FROM SUDAN
President Omar al-Bashir promised to turn Sudan into an Islamic state governed by Islamic law if the south chooses to secede in a referendum next month. Page A6
A CHANGING VIEW OF TERROR
In the view of American spy agencies, Osama bin Laden and a dwindling cadre of Al Qaeda operatives hiding in Pakistan no longer ''have the capacity'' to carry out a terror plot similar to the Sept. 11 attacks, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said. Page A6
CHINA'S PLEDGE TO PAKISTAN
Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China praised Pakistan's efforts to combat terrorism and promised to further advance the two countries' strategic partnership and economic cooperation in a speech to Parliament. The pledges for greater cooperation came a day after China and Pakistan signed $15 billion worth of trade deals. Page A8
PALESTINIAN HOLDS MEETING
The Palestinian president held a meeting with about 60 Israeli politicians, public figures and activists in an effort to reach out to the Israeli public at a time when the official peace process is at a standstill. Page A10

HEADING TO FIFTH TERM,
Reid Looks to His Legacy
To say the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, gets underestimated is itself an understatement. Fellow Democrats, convinced he would lose his own seat, began an intense sotto voce fight to succeed him. But he won a fifth term and a raft of legislative victories, ending a brutal year with the prospect of renewed combat just ahead. John Harwood, The Caucus. Page A14
A GUIDE FOR A NEW MILITARY
Possible scenarios and their solutions following the repeal of the ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy are outlined in a detailed and at times explicit 87-page Defense Department plan for commanding officers. Page A15

IN HIGH LINE'S NEXT PHASE,
Quirks and Rare Vistas
The designers of the second phase of the High Line in Manhattan have worked in a section of the park that was once a sort of fertile urban valley above the street, where wild trees and plants thrived. They have created a ''woodland flyover'' in which a steel walkway eight feet above the park's surface allows for expansive planting beds. Page A18
A PUZZLING SUICIDE
At a fairly young age, Jessica Fashano had dedicated much of her life to helping others, heightening her commitment to charitable work as she rose in the banking world. On Saturday, she took her own life, entering an apartment house that she did not live in and jumping from the roof to her death. Page A19

GOOGLE DELAYS SOFTWARE
For Web and Television
The Consumer Electronics Show was meant to be the great coming-out party for Google's new software for televisions, which adds Web video and other computer smarts to TV sets. But Google has asked TV makers, who were eager to flaunt their versions of the system, to delay their introductions, according to people familiar with the company's plans. Google wants to refine the software, which has received a lukewarm reception. Page B1
EASING ONLINE CHARITY
Over the last year or so, there has been an explosion of online intermediaries promising to help nonprofit groups raise money and awareness. While donors may find that these online intermediaries smooth the process of donating, for many in the nonprofit world, the value of the sites remains to be seen. Page B2
THE DAILY FLOOD OF DATA
I.B.M. researchers in a laboratory nestled next to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have been working to create programs that find patterns in the ''fire hose'' of information people come into contact with daily. Once patterns are revealed, it becomes easier to decide who or what is worth our undivided attention. Page B3

WEEZER TREATS ITS FANS
To Alt-Rock Time Machine
Weezer couldn't just play its best album, ''Pinkerton'' from 1996, all the way through at Roseland and fill out the concert with other songs, writes Jon Parales. The material ran in reverse chronological order, 2010 to 1994. Weezer charged through brash, tuneful, half-jokey songs about success, self-sabotage and longing. Page C1
GRIT, YES. FAME, NO THANKS
The arrival of the Coen brothers' movie ''True Grit'' is likely to bring Charles Portis a new surge of attention he has no use for. Mr. Portis, the author of the 1968 novel on which the new film is based is allergic to fame. He doesn't use e-mail, has an unlisted phone number, declines interview requests and shuns photographs with the ardor of a fugitive in the witness protection program. Page C1

Meadowlands Miracle
For the Philadelphia Eagles, the Meadowlands has become the birthplace of a share of the franchise's indelible moments. They had their Miracle in the Meadowlands II, with a dizzying win over the Giants, giving them the inside track in the push toward the playoffs and their sixth straight win over their rivals. How it happened may end up being recalled for years by fans of both franchises. Page D4

HEADLINE: CITY ROOM; In High Line's Next Section, Rare Vistas and Wild Quirks

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
Thirty feet above street level and just west of 10th Avenue near 25th Street, the view westward between a pair of old buildings reveals tall smokestacks and a sliver of the Hudson River in the distance.
''This is a piece of lost New York that still exists,'' said Peter Mullan, a planning official for the next phase of the High Line, set to open sometime next spring.
Mr. Mullan, a vice president of Friends of the High Line, was standing on the elevated line near a section of the park that was once a sort of fertile urban valley above the street, where wild trees and plants thrived in the trapped moisture and heat in a canyonlike stretch of track between two buildings. 
Designers of the second phase of the High Line worked this quirk into the park design, creating a ''Woodland Flyover'' section in which a steel walkway eight feet above the park's surface allows for expansive planting beds and dense vegetation.
Rare vistas and creative uses of the ever-changing urban context: this is what visitors can expect from the next section of the High Line, the 1.45-mile linear park built on an elevated train track that snakes through the West Side of Manhattan.
The first section, which runs along and near 10th Avenue from Gansevoort Street in the Meatpacking District up to 20th Street, opened last year.
But that was only the lower third of the old train line. This next phase -- no opening date has been set -- from 20th Street through West Chelsea north to 30th Street, doubles the accessible length of the park.
The final piece will shoot west on 30th before curving around the West Side Railyards and ending at 34th Street near the Javits Center.
In the biting cold last week, Mr. Mullan and several other officials offered a preview of the new section, which is still very much a construction zone. Hard hats were passed out -- don't these things have earmuffs? -- and the group unlocked the gate at 20th Street that currently marks the north end of the park. Walking north, the group stepped carefully to avoid power tools, dodged busy workers and balanced on plywood planks bridging gaps in the walkways still being completed.
The design of Section 2 is of a piece with the existing park including the snazzy pathways of smooth concrete planks and the funky ''peel-up'' benches. The train tracks continue, knifing through the pathways and the planting beds. As in the lower portion of the park, there is street access every few blocks.
But the second section is a whole other park, simply because it explores a different section of the city and because the rail line has its own changing shape and character. The new section feeds off both factors in its design, with new features at every block.
There is an elevated stretch of grass -- the High Line's first lawn! -- between 22nd and 23rd Streets, the fertile valley near 26th Street, and an elegant sweep of curved benches at 29th Street where the tracks turn westward. There are plans for a grating over 30th Street to allow users to peer directly down to ground level.
Section 2, like the north end of Section 1, runs between blocks, about 100 feet west of 10th Avenue. The walkway continues the lofty feel of the existing park, lifting the user above the maddening street chaos. But while the existing section rubs up against the trendy Meatpacking District, the new section feels more like a walk on the wild side. There are some sleek new buildings -- and many more proposed or in construction -- but many of the buildings abutting this stretch of park are old, gritty and splotched with graffiti.
At various points, the city sprawl seems to rush up and then dive away, leaving wide vistas of Midtown and the Hudson River.
The lawn at 22nd Street, 4,900 square feet of newly laid sod, was placed along a wide section of the line that once accommodated an extra track. Stadium seating made from reclaimed teak is being built near it.
As the park heads up through West Chelsea, recession-slowed development can be seen creaking back to life. The High Line ''has been a huge magnet for development,'' said Adrian Benepe, the city's parks commissioner. ''It has turned into one of the great both local and international tourist destinations, beyond anyone's expectations.''
Mr. Benepe said the second phase ''has a much more intimate feel'' than the first: it sidles, he noted, up to windows of residential buildings.
''It feels like a Venetian canal, compared to the southern part,'' he said. ''Like you're walking through the set of 'Rear Window.' ''
Total cost for the second phase is $67 million, compared to $86 million for the first phase, said Len Greco, an official with the city Economic Development Corporation, which is managing the construction along with the Parks Department and Friends of the High Line. The money comes from city, state, federal and private sources.
At 28th Street, the path passes a large scrap metal yard on the west side, and on the east side further along, an exhaust duct from an auto garage below that paints taxicabs.
The north end of Phase 2 suggests the next and final phase. Near 29th Street, long curving benches lining the walkway offer views of Midtown sprawl, the river and a large parking lot.
Back at 20th Street, the group stopped at a viewing station that will allow users to sit on benches and look westward through a big rectangular frame that recalls the billboards that once hung on the train line structure.
It overlooks 10th Avenue, an auto repair shop and a public housing complex. To the west is a block with art galleries. An access stairway was put here partly to welcome park users from a wide demographic, Mr. Mullan said.
''The High Line is the thread between all that,'' he said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Study Shows Rise In Internet Use

BYLINE: By JOSHUA BRUSTEIN

 BODY:
Dec. 16, 5:12 p.m. Updated Adding explanation of Forrester's methodology.
Americans are now spending as much time using the Internet as they are watching television, and the amount of time people spend on the Internet has increased 121 percent over the last five years, according to a survey published Monday by Forrester Research.
While people younger than 30 years old have spent more time with the Internet than television for several years, Forrester's survey shows that this is the first year that people in older age groups are also doing so. The amount of time spent on the Internet for personal uses tails off among older groups, ranging from about 12 hours a week for adults under 30 to about eight hours for people over 66 years old. 
(Several readers have pointed out that these numbers are far below Nielsen's numbers on television use. Because Forrester's data are self-reported, they are not comparable to the widely cited usage numbers from Nielsen; people tend to say they watch less television and use the Internet less than they actually do. But because Forrester has been collecting data using its own methods consistently for years, it can compare its own usage data from this year to corresponding data from previous years.)
At first glance, this seems like further evidence of the much ballyhooed, if statistically suspect, trend of cord-cutting, whereby people transition from watching television to streaming online video. Pay TV subscriptions in the United States are down this year. In addition, wireless carriers like Verizon and Sprint have been encouraging the idea that faster new wireless networks could serve as a substitute for landline broadband services. So cable companies that bundle broadband access with cable television service are seeing threats on multiple fronts.
Forrester's survey does show a significant increase in the number of people using the Internet to watch streaming video; 33 percent of adults surveyed this year said they use the Internet to watch video, up from 18 percent in 2007.
Yet the amount of time people spend with their televisions remains relatively stable. (By contrast, the survey found that people were spending significantly less time listening to the offline versions of radio and reading printed newspapers and magazines.)
The rise of the Internet is not necessarily leading to a drop in television consumption because the Internet, and particularly the mobile Internet, simply creates more opportunities for people to consume media, said Jacqueline Anderson, an analyst at Forrester who wrote the report. Until recently the supermarket checkout aisle was not seen as a prime opportunity for media consumption.
But the survey did not address directly a vital question: whether people who are watching streaming video on their televisions consider themselves to be watching TV or using the Internet. So some television replacement could be hidden behind this ambiguity, if people who are watching Internet content through set-top boxes or Internet-connected televisions see that as television use. It is this activity, of course, that poses the real threat to the existing business model of cable and satellite television providers.
And it is clear that younger viewers are increasingly comfortable with the Internet as the place to watch their television.
''For the younger population, the TV is still important, but where they're getting that content from is changing,'' said Ms. Anderson. ''For the generations that are coming up, that's where we're going to see the cut.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Lawmaker's Trip Involved Private Business and the Nation's

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON; Ron Nixon and Barclay Walsh contributed research.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When Representative Dana Rohrabacher, Republican of California, visited Honduras early this year to congratulate the newly elected president, the congressman showed up with an unusual delegation.
There at his side was not just the typical collection of Washington foreign policy aides, but also a group of California real estate investors and businessmen, including a dealer in rare coins, and top executives from a fledgling San Diego biofuels company run by a friend of the congressman's wife.
Using his status as a senior Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Rohrabacher cheered his hosts in Honduras by openly challenging the Obama administration's foreign policy agenda there, then arranged a series of meetings with top Honduran officials, including the president, during which the congressman ''enthusiastically promoted'' the biofuel company's plans to perhaps set up operations in Honduras, says a State Department summary of the meetings included in the files obtained by WikiLeaks.
The country was eager to accommodate the congressman -- who said in an interview that his actions were entirely appropriate and reflected his activist approach to foreign policy -- given that the previous Honduran president had been forced out of office and into exile, and the new government was angling for United States support. 
Mr. Rohrabacher's three-day trip to Tegucigalpa and his advocacy for SG Biofuels, a small company run by a family friend, stood out from the dozens of written reports detailing summaries of official visits by members of Congress to foreign nations that were included in the vast trove of State Department documents obtained by the WikiLeaks group and reviewed by The New York Times.
These memos -- written by State Department officials who often sit in on lawmakers' meetings with foreign leaders -- show that Congressional trips are often much more than simply fact-finding missions. Members of Congress at times push their own foreign policy agendas, even if they conflict with those of the administration in office.
Lawmakers also use their access to top foreign leaders to advocate for homegrown economic interests.
Senator Russ Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, used his 2008 trip to India as an opportunity to repeatedly push top officials there to cut import taxes imposed on Harley-Davidson motorcycles -- whose maker is based in his home state -- as well as discuss more traditional foreign policy matters like border disputes with Pakistan and combating terrorism, a State Department memo on the visit said.
Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, pressed top government officials in China last year to allow SSA Marine -- a Seattle-based maritime company -- to open a port terminal in China, a State Department cable shows.
Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana and one of the Senate's most influential voices on foreign affairs, has repeatedly pushed leaders in Central Asia to consider working with international oil companies, like Chevron, to expand production capacity. He and his staff have also intervened with nations including Turkey and Norway to defend Eli Lilly & Company, an Indiana-based pharmaceutical company whose employees are major contributors to Mr. Lugar's own political campaigns, against plans to introduce generic versions of some of its most profitable drugs, the documents show.
But Mr. Rohrabacher's trip last February was different because he pushed for small, specific companies with which he had personal and political ties. The coin dealer, John R. Saunders, is a big contributor to Mr. Rohrabacher's campaigns, dating back at least a decade. The president of SG Biofuels, Kirk Haney, is a friend of Mr. Rohrabacher's wife and a former intern in the congressman's office, Mr. Rohrabacher said, as well as a contributor.
Honduras had grabbed international headlines starting in June 2009, when its president at the time, Manuel Zelaya, was detained and then sent into exile, based on a fear by other elected officials there that he was scheming to remain in office despite a one-term limit in Honduras's Constitution.
Mr. Rohrabacher, challenging the stand taken by some Obama administration officials, ridiculed suggestions that Mr. Zelaya's removal was a coup d'etat, and used his visit to Honduras to praise government leaders there who played roles in removing Mr. Zelaya, including members of the Supreme Court and the president of the Honduran Congress, Juan Orlando Hernandez.
Mr. Rohrabacher, who was a speechwriter for President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s as the United States financed ''freedom fighters'' in Central America to challenge a perceived communist threat, has long cast himself as a defender of democratic causes in the region. The turn of events in Honduras offered him a chance to return to that role.
''He warned at the danger of allowing 'caudillos' or strongmen, like Cuban President Fidel Castro and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, to assume control,'' the State Department summary of his visit said, recalling his remarks to the new leaders in Honduras.
Just days before Mr. Rohrabacher's arrival, the Obama administration had pressed Honduras's new president, Porfirio Lobo, to name a ''truth commission'' to investigate Mr. Zelaya's removal, and implied that United States financial assistance to the poor Central American nation might hinge on such a move.
By tradition, members of Congress are not supposed to freelance foreign policy that goes against the sitting administration. But Mr. Rohrabacher, in meetings with members of the Honduran Supreme Court, told them that a truth commission was unnecessary and a waste of time.
Mr. Rohrabacher, in an interview, said that he had long taken an activist approach to foreign policy, and that he was never shy, when he met with foreign leaders, about advocating ''things I think are the direction to go,'' even if they are sometimes not entirely consistent with the views of the sitting administration.
According to the State Department cable, he said in Honduras that his views carried weight. He told the country's top elected officials that ''he was an emissary of Honduras' friends in Congress, in particular member of Congress Ileana Ros-Lehtinen,'' referring to a congresswoman from Florida who is the ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and is now set to become its chairwoman.
But the visit soon shifted to a pitch by Mr. Rohrabacher's companions for possible business deals.
Mr. Saunders, a California real estate executive, antique coin dealer and frequent campaign contributor to Mr. Rohrabacher, said he used the access he had to top Honduras officials, including the head of the country's central bank, to discuss the possibility of buying or at least helping arrange the sale of rare antique American coins from Honduras's gold reserves -- a deal he said, at least so far, had not worked out.
Separately, Mr. Rohrabacher, in a meeting with the top science adviser to President Lobo, introduced two executives from SG Biofuels, who then described their plan to set up contracts with farmers in Central America to grow a flowering plant known as jatropha, whose seeds contain oil that can be harvested as diesel fuel.
Mr. Haney, the president of the company, with Mr. Rohrabacher present, also made a presentation to the United States ambassador, who then referred them to other embassy staff members to discuss possible United States foreign aid funds available for the project, the State Department memo says.
Mr. Rohrabacher, in an interview, said he had known Mr. Haney for more than a decade and he invited Mr. Haney -- who paid his own costs -- not so much to help out his company as to encourage a possible economic opportunity for Honduras.
''I don't do any special favors,'' Mr. Rohrabacher said. ''But if some company is doing something and produces a great new technology that is going to help people, I will help them out.''
The senior Honduran official told Mr. Rohrabacher and Mr. Haney that he was reasonably impressed, and that ''the jatropha project was an excellent opportunity,'' the State Department memo says. He assured them that President Lobo wanted to put a priority on building a biofuel industry in Honduras.
SG Biofuels' vice president for marketing, Brian Brokowski, said that while the meetings arranged by Mr. Rohrabacher with the officials in Honduras were helpful, the company was still not committed to setting up a farming operation there like the one it had in neighboring Guatemala.
''We are exploring the potential,'' he said. ''But for now, it is very preliminary.''

HEADLINE: Debit-Card Fees

 BODY:
To the Editor:
To turn the economy around, the federal government needs to get more cash into the hands of consumers and small-business owners. Ironically, the Federal Reserve Board's proposed price control on debit-card interchange would have the opposite effect (''Fed Proposes Rules to Cut Debit-Card Fees,'' Business Day, Dec. 16). 
The Fed wants to slash the fees that merchants pay banks and credit unions when a customer makes a purchase with a debit card. This will boost profits by billions of dollars for high-volume merchants like Wal-Mart and McDonald's. But as you reported, card issuers will respond by raising fees on debit cards and checking accounts, taking money out of the pockets of consumers and many small-business owners at the worst possible time for the economy.
Congress ordered the Fed to impose these price controls without a single hearing to examine the unintended consequences. That was a mistake. It's not too late for Congress to reconsider.

HEADLINE: Cleric's Anti-U.S. Forces Poised for Gains in Iraq

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY; Khalid D. Ali contributed reporting from Amara, and Duraid Adnan and Yasir Ghazi from Baghdad.

 BODY:
AMARA, Iraq -- The Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, who in the past decade has been both an anti-American insurgency leader and a behind-the-scenes power broker, is not expected to be personally in attendance when Iraq's leaders sketch out a new government on Monday.
But with his followers standing to gain control of powerful government posts, his influence is likely to become apparent in many facets of Iraqi public life, from the halls of Parliament to the tomato farms and marshlands here in southeastern Iraq.
Maysan Province was a stronghold for Mr. Sadr until sweeps by the Iraqi Army in 2008 helped break the grip of his militia forces, and political change ousted his ally from the governorship here last year. 
Now, the winds are shifting again, and the area has become a stage for Mr. Sadr's remarkable political resurgence in Iraq after years of schism, military defeats and Mr. Sadr's own flight to Iran.
Mr. Sadr's followers are pushing for control of the governor's seat here in Maysan Province again, one of several positions they hope to gain as rewards for joining the political coalition that will keep their onetime enemy, Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, in office after the months of wrangling that followed March's inconclusive elections.
That the party, still Iraq's most fiercely populist and anti-American bloc, has come this far is a reflection of the Sadrists' efforts in recent years to recast themselves as maturing politicians who can actually govern and deliver badly needed services.
''We want to show the world we are a modern people, an intellectual people,'' said Fathal Namaa, the group's political director in Maysan. ''We don't want to be radical Islamists. I tell my supporters, don't dress all in black or carry weapons.''
They are tracing a path mapped out by militant groups like Hezbollah or Hamas, which built popular support by augmenting their armed wings with social and political groups that ran schools and hospitals and handed out jobs.
''If we're able to succeed this time and erase some of the mistakes of the past, we think we can win the most seats,'' said Hakim Zamili, who was re-elected easily after beating charges of murder, kidnapping and corruption stemming from his time as an official in the Ministry of Health. ''And maybe the prime minister's position.''
Those outsized ambitions may exceed the movement's grasp at the moment. But its growing political power has stoked new worries about how the Sadrists will play a stronger hand.
''We do not see compelling evidence they have renounced, in practice or in theory, the idea that they can use force against their opponents,'' James F. Jeffrey, the United States ambassador to Iraq, told reporters.
In Iraq's last government, Mr. Sadr's followers were accused of using their offices to spread corruption and sectarian enmity, with officials lining their pockets and death squads roaming public hospitals.
There are also remaining fears, among Americans and Iraqis, that the militia that helped bring Mr. Sadr to power initially -- and was responsible for much of the sectarian violence that threatened to tear the country apart -- could again be mobilized against his enemies, particularly after the American military finishes its withdrawal.
The growing strength of the movement could significantly complicate the United States' relationship with Iraq. Mr. Sadr, who waged bloody street battles against American forces and Sunni Muslims, and his rank-and-file members insist that no American troops should remain on Iraqi soil, and they do not speak with American officials.
''We know there are going to be Sadrist ministries,'' said an American diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under normal diplomatic ground rules. ''We want to make it work. But we will also be true to our own principles, and they may not want to work with us.''
In addition to the governor's seat in Maysan, they are seeking control of service ministries and a slot as one of Mr. Maliki's deputies.
''We're going to get everything,'' said Nasser al-Rubaie, a leading Sadrist politician, as he emerged from Parliament one afternoon.
The posture and power of the Sadrists have forced a shift in tone from American officials and erstwhile Iraqi rivals, who now find themselves thrown together an awkward partnership government.
After fully embracing the political process, Mr. Sadr's candidates pulled off surprising victories to win 40 seats in last March's elections. Female members of the Sadrist slate, who campaigned in black, head-to-toe abayas, fared particularly well compared with their secular counterparts.
The Sadrists are now embracing -- at least in public -- the sunny tones of national unity and partnership, referring to Sunni and Kurdish lawmakers as brothers, not foes. After dozens of Christians were massacred at a Baghdad church on Oct. 31, members of Mr. Sadr's group visited the priests to show the party's solidarity.
They send out daily news releases to announce street-cleaning projects, new orphanages and community centers. And at Mr. Sadr's behest, party leaders said that some newly elected lawmakers had been sent to Lebanon and Turkey to attend classes in public speaking and political etiquette.
The party's newest lawmakers include appellate lawyers, engineers and accountants, as well as candidates with less technocratic backgrounds. Among them is Mohammed al-Khafaji, a former bodyguard to Mr. Sadr whose biography on a Sadrist Web site says he ''participated'' in the fight against the occupation.
''What the Sadrists want is what Iraqis want,'' Mr. Khafaji said, sipping a glass of peach nectar. ''We have to lead the political process.''
In Amara, the resurgence of the Sadr movement has stirred mixed emotions, as well as resistance from the current governor, Mohammed al-Soudani, who has a good working relationship with the Americans.
This is a city where black, red and green banners of Shiite devotion flutter from the rooftops of homes, and photographs of clerics adorn the awnings of fast-food restaurants. But it is one still unsettled by the Sadrists' time in power, when militias dominated local security and bombings and attacks against American forces were common.
Some residents said they welcomed the Sadrists' return.
They blamed the Maliki-supported governor, Mr. Soudani, for persistently high unemployment and creaky services, and said they were ready to allow the Sadrists another chance at power. Some spoke of a deeper fealty to the Sadr family, some of whom were towering Shiite patriarchs killed for resisting Saddam Hussein's rule.
''The Sadrists are very good people, and qualified,'' said Abdul Wahid Bedai, 78, whose living room was decorated with a photograph of Mr. Sadr's slain father. ''We respect them. We respect the movement.''
But Abdul Qarim Muhamadawi, a local leader and former guerrilla fighter during the Hussein era, spoke to the fears of those who worry about the consequences of handing power back to the Sadrists.
Mr. Muhamadawi, known here as the ''Prince of the Marshes,'' said he had already seen once-imprisoned members of Shiite militias back on the streets of Amara, among those said to be released under part of a deal with Mr. Maliki. And he feared the relative stability of the last two years could unwind.
''We are upset about this deal,'' he said. ''This is the moment before the storm.''

PERSON: R. Richard Rubottom 

HEADLINE: R. Richard Rubottom, 98, a U.S. Diplomat When Cuba Was on the Cusp of Revolution

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
R. Richard Rubottom, a diplomat who influenced and helped hone United States policy toward Latin America in the late 1950s, a time of economic and political tumult that culminated in Fidel Castro's takeover in Cuba, died Dec. 6 in Austin, Tex. He was 98.
His family announced the death. 
Mr. Rubottom rose from modest roots -- his parents ran a boardinghouse in central Texas -- to become the ''official most responsible for defining United States Cuban policy'' in the years immediately surrounding the 1959 Cuban revolution, the historian Thomas G. Paterson wrote in ''Contesting Castro: The United States and the Triumph of the Cuban Revolution'' (1994).
Mr. Rubottom began grappling with foreign policy issues in Latin America as assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs from 1956 to 1960. In 1958 he accompanied Vice President Richard M. Nixon on a widely publicized tour of Latin America that was marred by violent demonstrations against the United States. After protesters in Caracas, Venezuela, shattered windows in the vice president's car, news reports suggested that Mr. Nixon partly blamed Mr. Rubottom for allowing his motorcade to be put in harm's way.
As a high-level strategist on American policy toward Cuba in the late 1950s, Mr. Rubottom was portrayed in books and news reports as a strong early supporter of the country's repressive leader, Fulgencio Batista as he battled the rebellion led by Fidel Castro.
But Mr. Rubottom later worried that Mr. Batista's ''brutal retaliatory tactics'' were eroding his support and questioned whether the United States should continue to sell tanks to Cuba after it became known that Mr. Batista was using them against his domestic opponents, a violation of American law. Mr. Batista ultimately canceled the tank order.
With the rise of Mr. Castro, Mr. Rubottom represented the State Department in meetings with military and intelligence officials on whether, how and when to try to eliminate him both before and after he seized power in January 1959.
Yet when Mr. Castro visited the United States in April 1959 as Cuba's new leader, Mr. Rubottom was on hand to greet him, and he was deputized to ask Mr. Castro what American aid he would like. Mr. Castro said none.
Some politicians and historians have criticized Mr. Rubottom for not identifying Mr. Castro as a Communist before he took control. But Adolf A. Berle, a former assistant secretary of state, wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 1962 that he knew for certain Mr. Rubottom had not known.
However, he and his deputy, William Wieland, were convinced that Mr. Castro was ''a hopeless megalomaniac,'' Mr. Berle wrote, and that the ''optimistic image created by the uninformed American press'' was wrong.
In 1960, Mr. Rubottom created a controversy by telegraphing Gov. Edmund G. Brown of California with an appeal by the Uruguayan government to halt the planned execution of Caryl Chessman, a convicted robber and rapist who had become a global cause celebre for opponents of capital punishment. Governor Brown granted Mr. Chessman a 60-day reprieve, although he was ultimately executed.
Mr. Rubottom said he had merely been passing on information that related to American foreign policy -- Uruguay opposed the death penalty -- but his action ignited a debate over federal intervention in state matters and prompted President Dwight D. Eisenhower to issue a statement saying the execution was entirely a California matter.
Roy Richard Rubottom Jr. was born on Feb. 13, 1912, in Brownwood, Tex. He won a scholarship to Southern Methodist University, where he was president of his class and editor of the college newspaper. After graduating in 1932 with a journalism degree, he stayed on at S.M.U. to earn a master's in international relations in 1935.
Afterward he traveled the country as national secretary for his college fraternity, Lambda Chi Alpha; sold kitchen appliances and oil field equipment; and served as an assistant dean at the University of Texas. During World War II he served in the Navy in Mexico and Paraguay.
After his discharge as a commander in 1946, he became vice president of a bank in Corsicana, Tex. But his interest in foreign affairs led him to join the Foreign Service after taking a special exam for war veterans. His postings included Colombia and Spain.
Years later he was removed from his post as assistant secretary and appointed ambassador to Argentina in July 1960 after ''persistent reports of dissatisfaction by Vice President Nixon,'' according to The Times.
After leaving the State Department, Mr. Rubottom had a second career in higher education, serving as a vice president of Southern Methodist University; president of the University of the Americas in Puebla, Mexico; and as a professor of political science at S.M.U.
Mr. Rubottom's wife of 69 years, the former Billy Ruth Young, died in 2008. He is survived by his daughter, Eleanor Odden; his sons, Frank and John; four grandchildren; and one great-grandson.
When it came to improving inter-American relations, Mr. Rubottom was not above counting beans -- literally. In 1958 he said in a speech that if each American used 12 more coffee beans in each cup of coffee, coffee consumption would rise by 600 million pounds, enhancing stability and prosperity in coffee-growing nations.

HEADLINE: South Korea Conducts Drills Amid Rising Tensions on Peninsula

BYLINE: By SHARON LAFRANIERE and MARTIN FACKLER; Sharon LaFraniere reported from Pyongyang, and Martin Fackler from Seoul, South Korea. Neil MacFarquhar contributed reporting from the United Nations, Mark McDonald from Seoul, and David E. Sanger from Boston.

 BODY:
PYONGYANG, North Korea -- South Korea began live-fire artillery exercises on Monday, escalating a confrontation with North Korea even as an American official reported ''important progress'' in breaking through the North's isolation in talks here in the North Korean capital.
The South has insisted on its right to go through with the drills in disputed waters around the Yeonpyeong Island, despite threats from the North for massive military retaliation. 
But a few hours earlier, Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, a former United States ambassador to the United Nations, said the North had agreed to concessions related to its nuclear program, a main source of tension on the peninsula. Mr. Richardson was on an unofficial trip approved by the State Department, meeting here with high ranking military officials, the North Korean vice president and members of the Foreign Ministry over five days.
Mr. Richardson said the North had made two significant concessions toward reopening six-party talks on the country's nuclear program. He said it had agreed to allow United Nations nuclear inspectors back into the Yongbyon nuclear complex to insure that it is not producing enriched uranium for a nuclear bomb. The North recently showed a Western nuclear expert a new and stunningly sophisticated facility there; it had expelled inspectors last year.
The other concession was a willingness to sell 12,000 plutonium fuel rods to South Korea, removing bomb-making material from the North.
''I would describe this as important progress,'' Mr. Richardson said.
However a spokesman for the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said the concessions had no bearing on the South's drills.
Last month's hourlong bombardment was the first military attack against a civilian community since the 1950-53 Korean War, a fact that spurred a rare surge of popular demands for revenge in the South.
This has put the South's president, Lee Myung-bak, in a political bind, between public pressure to respond and the risk of escalation. A conservative who took office with pledges to be tougher on the North, Mr. Lee has been criticized for not responding militarily to the sinking of one of the South's warships in the spring, and for the South's relatively mild military response to the shelling.
For its part, the North denies responsibility for the sinking, and maintains that the shelling of Yeonpyeong was in self-defense. It has promised to respond fiercely if the South fires into waters it claims, including those around Yeonpyeong, eight miles off its coast.
Political analysts believe it has two objectives in pressing its territorial claims: to pressure the South to resume food aid and other assistance to the North's collapsed economy, and to burnish the military credentials of Kim Jong-un, the youngest son and now heir-apparent of the dictator Kim Jung-il.
North Korea often issues bellicose warnings. But Tony Namkung, a senior adviser to Mr. Richardson, said he did not think the North was posturing.
''In 20 years of following the North, I've never seen such unequivocal statements,'' Mr. Namkung said Monday. ''There is no doubt in my mind that there will be a response. The only issue is whether they will once again target civilians, or deliberately try to avoid hitting civilian targets.''
On Sunday, the United Nations Security Council ended an all-day emergency session with no statement on the situation, unable to call on the South to halt its exercises because the members could not agree on how to refer to the North's shelling the South Korean island. China opposed the majority of the other Security Council members over whether there would be a specific condemnation of the North.
During more than six hours of talks behind closed doors, Sin Son-ho, the North Korean ambassador, warned that if war broke out it would not be limited to the peninsula and could easily spread worldwide, diplomats said. He stressed that live fire exercises near the disputed North-South maritime border were a violation of North Korean territory and called it ''gangsterlike'' behavior, according to diplomats in the meeting.
Park In-kook, the South Korean ambassador, noted that the line had been established in 1953 and that North Korea had accepted it under a 1992 agreement, diplomats said.
Russia, which called the special session, released a text noting ''dangerous aggravation'' on the Korean Peninsula. China endorsed that position, diplomats said, but South Korea 's allies, including the United States and Japan, considered it a veiled criticism of Seoul 's continued military maneuvers.
''They are implying the South Koreans are doing something which they should not, while we view the drills as perfectly within their rights and something they have done countless times,'' said one Western diplomat, speaking on ground rules of anonymity.
The officials who met Mr. Richardson over the weekend included Maj. Gen. Pak Rim-su. He is a member of North Korea's powerful National Defense Commission and oversees the demilitarized zone and the armistice between the two Koreas that ended the Korean War in 1953.
Mr. Richardson made two proposals: a military-to-military hot line and a military commission that would include the United States, South Korea and North Korea, to monitor crises in the Yellow Sea.

HEADLINE: REUTERS BREAKINGVIEWS; M.&A. Ready To Soar in 2011

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GOLDFARB and ROB COX

 BODY:
Investment bankers should prepare for a surge in mergers and acquisitions. If deal activity follows a pattern similar to previous cycles, 2011 ought to be a considerably better year.
The climb out of the doldrums has been slow. It took nearly 11 months for the 2010 deal tally to surpass the $2 trillion mark reached in 2009. Economic uncertainty left companies only tentatively deploying their cash stockpiles. Private equity firms were similarly cautious, or deterred by demanding valuations, despite having $500 billion of dry powder. Blackstone's attempt at the industry's first postcrisis $10 billion buyout, of Fidelity National Information Services, unwound quickly in the spring.
The big deals that did get announced looked painstaking to complete. Cross-border takeovers are limping along, including the buyout of the American biotech firm Genzyme by the French pharmaceuticals giant Sanofi-Aventis and of the British broadcaster BSkyB by the News Corporation. They could yet go the way of BHP Billiton's blocked offer for the Canadian fertilizer giant Potash Corporation and Prudential's failed attempt to build an Asian insurance powerhouse with a tilt at the American International Group's AIA subsidiary. 
There have been some juicy transactions, like PepsiCo's bid for the Russian group Wimm-Bill-Dann, which valued the company at $5.4 billion. But these are notable for being the exception.
Still, the omens are favorable. In previous periods of depressed merger activity, there has been a clear bounce back by the end of the second year after the trough.
For example, deal volume in 1991 was down 41 percent from its peak in 1989, according to Thomson Reuters data. By 1993, it was up by a third.
After two awful years in 2001 and 2002, when global merger deals plummeted from $3.4 trillion to $1.2 trillion, there was a 56 percent surge from trough levels in 2004.
In the current downturn, the 2009 nadir was a 52 percent decline from the peak in 2007. If there is a rebound, and the pace of recovery relative to the pace of decline is roughly the same as in previous cycles, then there should be about $2.7 trillion worth of acquisitions in 2011.
That may feel like a bonanza given the current climate. But in reality, it would only take deal activity back to the 2005 level.
Expensive Taste
Wow, that hurts. Such was the understandable sentiment of shareholders of the BMO Financial Group to its $4.1 billion purchase of Marshall & Ilsley on Friday. Absorbing M.& I., which is based in Milwaukee, into its own Midwestern franchise makes good geographic and strategic sense, but the price it's paying is painfully high.
So it's hard to blame owners of BMO, parent of the Bank of Montreal, for slicing some $2.5 billion from the company's market capitalization. Crunching M.& I. into BMO's Harris Bank subsidiary will bring $250 million of annual cost savings. Taxed, discounted and adjusted for one-time costs, that creates value just about equal to the $1 billion premium it's paying.
The trouble is, paying out all the value of future synergies to M.& I. shareholders means BMO is directly liable for any write-downs to M.& I.'s loan book. And these are sizable. BMO estimates future marks of around 12 percent of the institution's $38.8 billion, some $4.7 billion.
Of course, these may not all be permanent losses. BMO takes an accounting hit on these assets, but over time the losses may be written back through earnings -- one of the positive phenomena lifting the bottom lines of many American banks.
But the high-priced purchase is a striking contrast to some deals struck by healthy acquirers, including Canadian financial institutions, picking up limping American banks. Take M&T's acquisition of Wilmington Trust. In that deal, the seller's shareholders bore the cost of writing down its book value by half -- with the result that they succumbed to a ''take-under'' at a 45 percent discount to the market price of their stock.
Meantime BMO's competitor in Toronto, TD Bank Financial, has added to its United States business by acquiring banks from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. It also tried to buy BankUnited in 2009. At the time, TD looked to have paid full prices. With the BMO purchase as the new benchmark, TD and others can now claim to have snagged some relative bargains.

HEADLINE: Antitrust Suit in Michigan Tests Health Law

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON

 BODY:
DETROIT -- When the Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit against Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan in October, the unusual action was widely seen as a warning shot to dominant health insurance carriers in many other states.
The case is viewed as a test for the Obama administration's introduction of the federal health care law, which is aimed at spurring competition and driving down costs.
About half the states in the country, including Alabama, Rhode Island and Iowa, share circumstances similar to Michigan's, in their relationships with a big single insurance carrier. Proponents of the new legislation have long argued that these dominant companies could subvert the competitive goals of the exchanges planned for 2014, which are intended to foster new business and cheaper coverage.
Officials ''have been struggling for a while with the fact that in health insurance markets, small players are not able to enter and expand in a way to make them significant competitors,'' said Jonathan M. Grossman, an antitrust lawyer at Cozen O'Connor. ''Nobody can look at the suit against Michigan and say they didn't put everybody on notice.'' 
Regulators worry that this prevailing dominance in markets across the country is a formidable obstacle. ''Once you have a health plan that is that large, it's really hard to change the dynamics of the market,'' said Robert W. McCann, a health care lawyer in Washington at Drinker Biddle & Reath.
Blue Cross and others paint a far more complex picture, involving intertwined economic and demographic layers. Michigan might also become a proving ground for whether a federal overhaul of the markets would attract any new insurer, especially in tough economic times and with unabated health care costs. It may become increasingly apparent, some argue, that the battle to change the health care system will play out state by state, especially with the separate constitutional challenges mounted by nearly a dozen states against the law itself.
In Michigan, economic conditions alone pose steep challenges for Blue Cross, which still employs 7,100 people in the state. The recession further crippled an already deteriorating manufacturing base. Unemployment is well above the nation's average, at 12.4 percent to the country's 9.8 percent. Its population is declining, growing older and getting sicker.
While it remained profitable through investment and other income last year, with $22 billion in revenue, Blue Cross lost money from operations, including nearly a hundred million dollars because of its status in the state as the insurer of last resort.
Federal prosecutors contend that Blue Cross in Michigan thwarts competitors by pressuring hospitals to charge rival insurers more to provide care, a practice prosecutors say has made health care extremely expensive in a state that can't afford it.
''It is deeply disturbing that Blue Cross, a nonprofit created to help Michigan citizens, would strong-arm hospitals at the expense of hard-working families,'' said Mike Cox, the state's attorney general.
This past Friday in its court response, Blue Cross fired back at the antitrust charges, relying mainly on states' rights arguments to contend that the federal government was usurping the state's ability to provide affordable health care coverage to its residents. The Justice Department says it continues to believe the insurer is stifling competition.
In a recent interview, Daniel J. Loepp, the insurer's chief executive, said Blue Cross, which provides coverage for 4.3 million people, had done nothing wrong. ''Our size is a benefit to the hospitals, and it is a benefit to our customers,'' he said.
Many Blue Cross plans, which are frequently run as not-for-profits and operate in highly regulated states like New York and Michigan, argue that they are exactly the kind of insurer envisioned under the new law. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan says it is required to offer a policy for the same price to anyone who asks, regardless of whether that person has an expensive pre-existing condition. ''It's as close as you can come to a privately run public plan,'' said Mr. Loepp.
The federal lawsuit is not the first attempt to curtail Blue Cross's position in Michigan. Last year, state regulators blocked the insurer's request for a 56 percent increase on some individual policies, and the Justice Department recently prevented Blue Cross from swallowing one of its rivals. Its main competitors are large hospital systems like Henry Ford and Spectrum Health, which largely offer H.M.O. plans. A few national carriers like Aetna and Humana also offer coverage.
Some state officials argue that the market is healthy enough. ''Consumers have a variety of choices,'' said Ken Ross, the state insurance commissioner. ''They can buy high-quality affordable products other than Blue Cross.''
And some competitors even contend that their smaller size gives them an advantage. The plans ''survive based on service, based on value and based on agility,'' Nancy M. Schlichting, the chief executive of Henry Ford, a strong competitor in southeast Michigan, where it is based.
Blue Cross drew the attention of federal prosecutors because of its use of what are known as most-favored-nation clauses in the contracts it signed with dozens of hospitals. Prosecutors charged that Blue Cross squashed competition by demanding that hospitals charge as much as 40 percent more to rivals, and it was even willing to pay hospitals more to sign these contracts.
That practice seems to have stymied competition. Priority Health, the insurer owned by Spectrum Health, says it has not been able to negotiate reasonable contracts with hospitals in places like Lansing. Blue Cross says it is a business decision being made by Priority Health to stay out of any market.
Other insurers also use these contracts, and regulators in Georgia, for example, have questioned their use. WellPoint, which owns the Blue Cross plan in Georgia, declined to comment.
Blue Cross of Michigan defends its use of these provisions. The Blue Cross contracts with hospitals simply reflect the company's insistence on getting the best prices available, amounting to $13 billion in savings through discounts, according to its general counsel, Jeffrey P. Rumley. ''It's part of what our customers expect from bringing significant volume to the table,'' he said.
Blue Cross lost $94 million covering individuals last year. It lost an additional $186 million selling Medicare supplemental policies under state rules. Because of ample investment income and profits from its workers' compensation business, the insurer reported net income of $233 million.
Blue Cross also says it has effectively controlled costs. While the cost of employer-sponsored family coverage more than doubled in the majority of other states from 1999 to 2009, according to a recent government report, Michigan's premiums increased by 88 percent. ''We seem to be managing this pretty well,'' Mr. Loepp said.
He also pointed to various initiatives to improve the quality of care, like working closely with the state's hospitals to reduce infections and with hundreds of doctors' practices to coordinate patient care. ''I'm trying to figure out what is wrong with what we're doing,'' said Mr. Loepp.
But the picture is more complicated. The state attorney general and others have frequently argued that the insurer is raising rates too sharply, even on the supplemental Medicare policies it offers. Even if the government prevails in preventing the use of these contracts, Blue Cross plans like the one in Michigan may still deter competition by being so big. ''It doesn't fundamentally alter the power dynamic and the fact the Blues are dominant players,'' said Axel Bernabe, an antitrust lawyer at Constantine Cannon in New York.
And some insurers may choose not to compete in Michigan because of its dwindling prospects. ''I can't see why it would be a very attractive market,'' said Thomas Buchmueller, a professor at the University of Michigan who focuses on health insurance.

HEADLINE: The Relationship Between College and Jobs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''College, Jobs and Inequality'' (editorial, Dec. 14):
As a community college president, I can plainly see the benefits that accrue when more citizens attend college. However, it is not merely ''more college'' that is the answer, but rather what actually happens there that is important. 
If it is true that the ''jobs of the future'' will be different from those of the present and that we need the ''best and the brightest minds'' to confront future challenges, then what could we better offer our young people than to train their minds through the liberal arts?
To confront problems that have not been encountered before requires both a grounding in the past and the skills and understanding to make sense of today's world.
As for the question of jobs, we hear much about the need for entrepreneurs in business and technology, but what we also need for future prosperity will be an entrepreneurship of the imagination, encouraged by a rigorous immersion in the liberal arts, which might lead to currently unthought-of solutions to currently unimagined problems.

To the Editor:
Your editorial hints at the real elephant in the room for today's college-educated young people: it's not being unemployed, but being locked into working at low-wage jobs.
As a college professor, I vividly see this jobs/education mismatch when I run into former students still waiting tables at local restaurants years after getting their B.A. or master's degrees.
How can we tell young people that getting more education is the key to financial success amid rapidly shrinking chances of actually finding a middle-class job?
Do we really have a ''new knowledge economy'' when three of the fastest growing United States occupations -- home health aide, warehouse clerk and medical assistant -- pay on average less than $14 an hour?

HEADLINE: The Myth of Fast-Forwarding Past the Ads

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
ZOMBIES attacked during a commercial break on the AMC zombie drama ''The Walking Dead'' last month. The flesh eaters were just about to feast on a man and woman when rescue came in the form of the Toyota Corolla, the subject of the 30-second spot.
The scene stopped some people from fast-forwarding through the commercial break -- and perhaps that was the point. 
DVRs are in nearly 40 percent of homes in the United States now, making contextual ads like the one by Corolla increasingly important. (Similar contextual ads by Unilever and other advertisers have run during AMC's signature series, ''Mad Men.'')
DVRs have ''quickly progressed from a novelty to an increasingly mainstream technology,'' the Nielsen Company concluded in a report released on Monday that assesses the powerful effects that the devices have had on the television industry.
The report, intended for Nielsen's advertiser and network clients, is by turns reassuring (people actually do watch some of the commercials when they are in DVR playback mode) and alarming (playback mode is most common at 8 and 9 p.m., when people could be watching shows in real time instead).
From the report, Nielsen's clients can consider making changes to adapt to the on-demand behavior of viewers. Patricia McDonough, the senior vice president for planning, policy and analysis at Nielsen, said one change might involve the teases for local 10 and 11 p.m. newscasts. Since many DVR owners are in playback mode at the 8 and 9 p.m. hours, ''you need to promote differently,'' she said. ''You may need to promote earlier.''
She added, ''We're definitely seeing people promoting things earlier than they did before.''
The Nielsen report seems aimed, in part, at refuting the notion that DVRs have no value for networks and advertisers. ''Some people still say, 'Nobody watches commercials.' That's not true,'' Ms. McDonough said.
In homes that have DVRs and among 18- to 49-year-olds, ratings for the commercials for prime-time shows rise by 44 percent when playback within three days is counted, Nielsen says, noting, ''this degree of lift to the viewing of commercials has remained steady for several years.''
Nielsen suggests that DVR owners are watching more TV and commercials over all than they otherwise would. It is true that among homes with DVRs, the ratings of commercials for some shows, particularly younger-skewing shows on Fox and the CW, soar by more than 50 percent when played back within three days, according to Don Seaman, a vice president and the director of communications analysis for the media agency MPG.
''However, they're also the ones most likely to be media multitasking -- texting, Facebooking, etc., during the commercials, using that as 'down time' to do other things until the commercial is over,'' Mr. Seaman wrote in an e-mail. ''Are we saying that they're too lazy to pick up the remote to fast-forward? Far from it. They're probably likely using commercials as a timing device to know when to pay attention to the TV again.''
Mr. Seaman noted that agencies most likely would not buy ad time in DVR homes only, so a look at all households was more representative.
Nielsen says that among all households, playback occurring within three days adds 16 percent to the ratings of commercials for 18- to 49-year-olds.
Speaking of the 18- to 49-year-old demographic, Ms. McDonough said, ''One thing that continues to strike us is the dramatically different profiles when you look at the live audience versus the playback audience.'' The playback audience, she said, ''is so much younger and so much more upscale. Even though they are skipping commercials, they are the consumers that most advertisers are very eager to get.''
The number of homes with DVRs has risen for the last five years, according to Nielsen, to 38.1 percent in September of this year. If the economy were more robust, DVRs would be even more prevalent, Ms. McDonough predicted. DVRs, which can come with an extra monthly fee from distributors, are more common in higher-income households.
There are indications that the growth in DVR ownership is beginning to slow, although that, too, may be related to the shaky economy. Seven in 10 households that have DVRs have only one, a figure that has been unchanged for the last year. A quarter of households have two DVRs, and 5 percent have three or more.
Households with viewers who have owned a DVR for more than a year tended to spend more time playing back TV shows. This could be because earlier adopters of the DVR are bigger TV consumers, or because they have grown comfortable using the device, the Nielsen report said.
The number of playbacks in a household may grow as more cable and satellite providers introduce multiroom DVRs, which allow viewers to record in one room and play it back in another.
Of the programs that are played back within seven days -- the length of time that Nielsen tracks -- 49 percent are played the same day, and 88 percent are played within three days, it said.
Maybe the networks should be encouraging that same-day playback, which Ms. McDonough calls ''near live.''
''If you're that close to live,'' she said, ''you almost forget that you're in DVR mode, and in that case we see that many more of the commercials are viewed.''

HEADLINE: Shale Gas Success Drives Down Prices

BYLINE: By ROB COX

 BODY:
North America's shale revolution has run out of control, with leases forcing companies to step up drilling even as gas prices slump. The riot should last through 2011, even though many wells are money losers. All this should lead to a wave of consolidation and joint ventures -- like the one Talisman Energy signed with Sasol on Monday -- in the gas patch.
Over the last few years new drilling techniques promised to redraw the energy picture in the United States. Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has opened access to vast quantities of gas trapped in rock. Even cautious estimates put this new treasure trove at 616 trillion cubic feet -- equivalent in energy terms to 106 billion barrels of oil, roughly Kuwait's proven reserves. 
These resources are a potential win for America's politicians too -- allowing them to reduce dependence on foreign oil-producing countries while cutting carbon emissions from dirty coal.
But the shale pioneers have become victims of their own success. The magnitude of the reserves unearthed by the likes of Chesapeake Energy and XTO, now a division of Exxon Mobil, has sent prices plunging -- even as an economic revival has perked up demand. Gas now trades at little more than a third the level of June 2008.
Yet instead of cutting back, the energy industry has intensified its drilling. The number of rigs drilling shale has doubled since 2007 to more than 500, according to Tudor, Pickering, Holt, the Houston merchant bank.
Part of the explanation for this perverse behavior is the structure of leases for the land. These drill-it-or-lose-it leases often compel companies to pump gas or say goodbye to their claims -- which can cost as much as $30,000 an acre in prime parts of Louisiana or Texas. Involuntary drilling of this kind will only start to die down toward the end of 2011.
Any natural brake on self-destructive activity has also been weakened by a spree of joint ventures. Eager to get a taste of North America's new energy bonanza, foreign energy companies are bankrolling the cost of drilling in exchange for a share of the spoils.
In Monday's deal, for instance, South Africa-based Sasol agreed to pay 75 percent of Talisman's drilling costs in exchange for a 50 percent interest in some of its Canadian shale assets. It's easier to keep drilling when spending somebody else's money -- even though as many as half of all new wells are uneconomical at current gas prices, according to Tudor, Pickering.
So far much of the pain of collapsing prices has been cushioned by hedging. But the prolonged decline in gas prices means this protection will start to slip away in early 2011. Even so, natural gas supply is expected to climb another 5 percent. And if the gas price moves higher, there are an estimated 1,000 wells waiting to be completed.
Depressed prices would typically draw out more demand as gas displaces coal in electricity generation and, in time, motorists opt for natural gas vehicles. This should happen eventually. After all, while the price of a barrel of oil is hovering around $91, natural gas is offering the same amount of energy for the bargain price of $27. Even traditionally cheap coal is under threat from gas at current prices.
But that demand will take years to emerge. Shifting parts of America's transport sector to natural gas -- as countries like Argentina have done -- takes time and investment in infrastructure like filling stations. Meanwhile in the absence of a carbon tax, natural gas is only gradually gaining ground in electricity generation as geriatric coal plants are retired.
With supply shooting higher and demand creeping gently, natural gas prices should remain below $5 per million B.T.U. units through 2011. For those energy producers locked into gas drilling, that makes more joint ventures or asset sales likely. And others will look to beef up on oil-producing shale assets, particularly in the Bakken region of North Dakota and the Eagle Ford shale in Texas. EOG Resources has already blazed a trail, increasing liquid output by about 43 percent against 2009. Chesapeake also has been shifting toward oil, and Sasol may be able to help Talisman do the same.
This may sound like bad news for energy companies awash in cheap gas. But it's good news for Houston's sought-after cadre of energy bankers. They will be called upon to broker more deals, joint ventures and capital raisings than ever before.

HEADLINE: Computers And Cabbage At a Food Bank That Works

BYLINE: By SUSAN DOMINUS. 
E-mail: susan.dominus @nytimes.com

 BODY:
Not much has been easy for Madelyn Ruiz, a Florida native, since she arrived in New York in October after a job overseas fell through. For the first time in her 33 years, she has been living in shelters, most recently in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn.
She would be looking for another accounting job, but her daughter, who is 15 months old, has been in and out of the hospital with asthma. Last week, Ms. Ruiz was directed to a food pantry, where she fully expected that she would be handed a shopping bag full of groceries someone else had chosen, items her daughter might or might not eat. 
Instead, when she arrived at St. John's Bread and Life on Lexington Avenue, Ms. Ruiz was given a swipe card. She sat at a computer and used a touch screen to select her own menu: dried cranberries, canned spaghetti and meatballs, vegetable soup. As Ms. Ruiz made her choices, the system subtracted points from an allotment of 200 for the month (healthy items count for fewer points). A volunteer explained that she could pick everything up within a few minutes.
Going home with groceries she wanted: this, at last, was easy. ''Some places you go and they give you stuff you're not eating, so it's not really helping,'' she said. ''Here, if you don't eat it, at least you're not wasting it.''
That is precisely what Anthony Butler, the executive director of the St. John's Bread and Life pantry, was thinking when he put the system into effect in 2008. Since the economy soured, the number of families using the food bank has shot up, rising 85 percent in the first year since the system was put in place.
For Mr. Butler, customer service is not about making poverty pleasant; it is about building trust. ''If you make it too onerous, they won't trust you enough to engage in the other services,'' he said. His staff members try to guide people, as often as possible, from the pantry to the food-stamp program.
It sometimes seems that the approach to hunger is as antiquated as the problem is old. Last December, I wrote about New Yorkers' attachment to canned-food drives, a loyalty that frustrates some pantry organizers, who prefer cash donations so that they can feed more people by taking advantage of bulk discounts. And pantries that give out one-size-fits-all bags of food might not meet the needs of a fussy toddler or a man with hypertension.
Mr. Butler's food bank not only gives clients more choice -- something they lack in most aspects of their lives -- but can also track their needs. The City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, has said she is committed to trying to introduce the digitized system to as many food pantries as possible.
In bringing his food bank into the future, Mr. Butler may also end up changing the way it interacts with the neighborhood, including residents who do not need its charitable services. Impressed by Mr. Butler's digital expertise, Local Orbit, a business that connects local farmers with markets, has established a hub at St. John's Bread and Life, an experiment that injects locavore culture directly into the world of free food.
Something of a cross between FreshDirect and a community-supported agriculture cooperative, the program allows consumers to shop online for locally grown groceries -- foodie options last month included kohlrabi cabbage and shallots -- and pick up their orders at the pantry on Thursdays.
Residents in need with Bedford-Stuyvesant ZIP codes can use the same site to select fresh staples, like onions and potatoes, at no cost.
People in need of free food may not always have the resources to order groceries online in advance, and so far takers have been few. But the service, if it takes off, could provide more fresh produce in a neighborhood famously devoid of it, and a new model for what, exactly, a food bank is to a community: in this case, another place where people of various incomes would overlap over the same basic desire for sustenance.
''You don't create community around problems,'' said Mr. Butler, who hopes that clients on food stamps will eventually be able to shop from Local Orbit farmers at St. John's. ''You create community around shared projects.''
As pleasant as the experience of the pantry is right now, research has shown that there is little danger that it will lull its users into a sense of complacency: the greatest number of users are one-timers, people truly in crisis. For Ms. Ruiz, the system was painless, fast and efficient. She hopes to never come back.

HEADLINE: Iran Lets Gas Prices Soar, But Drivers Seem Unfazed

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YONG

 BODY:
TEHRAN --Seemingly unaffected by a sharp increase in gasoline prices that went into effect at midnight on Sunday, drivers jammed the streets here on Monday after the government lifted traffic restrictions aimed at reducing severe air pollution.
Government subsidies, which had kept the basic price of gas at about 38 cents a gallon, were drastically cut, quadrupling the rationed fuel price overnight and pushing the ''free'' price, at which motorists can purchase an unlimited amount, to $2.55 a gallon -- a staggering price for Iranians, who on average make little more than one-fifth of what Americans earn. But Iranians took to the streets as if nothing had changed.
Iran's subsidies, introduced to ensure the fair distribution of goods during the Iran-Iraq war, have placed enormous strains on the country's finances, with energy subsidies alone costing $114 billion a year. That, coupled with gas shortages stemming from international sanctions, prompted the government of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to take a step that his predecessors had avoided for fear of the potentially high political costs. 
To help soften the blow, the government is offering a one-time cash payment of around $77 per person.
''They give you rials and they expect you to pay for gasoline in dollars,'' said an older man, one of thousands of unlicensed taxi drivers here who pick up four passengers at a time, providing a makeshift transit system in a city with limited subway service and buses that arrive infrequently and invariably packed.
Before the price rise, he said, he spent about $1.50 a day for fuel and made about $28 for an eight-hour day. That was enough for a $4 or $5 kebab and rice, he said. But with fuel costing around $10, ''I guess I'll have to give that up and eat yogurt and cucumber.''
Amin, 24, who is studying computer programming, works another taxi route on his way to university. ''What's the effect? You're looking at it now,'' Amin said. ''I wasn't picking up taxi fares yesterday, but look at me today. Now, I'm a taxi driver between classes.''
Though he had heard the president's announcement, made in a televised speech on Saturday night, Amin was still shocked when he paid nearly $7 for two and a half gallons of fuel that morning while he would have paid about a dollar before.
''I don't care what happens to the economy, but what happens to the money that they save?'' he asked, expressing a common sentiment here. ''Are they going to put it in their pockets? Are they going to give $25 million to Lebanon every month?''
At the government-owned Shahrvand Supermarket in central Tehran, Mohammad-Sadegh Ruzbahani, 50, a retired police officer, was filling the trunk of his car with the fruits and nuts that Persians traditionally eat, along with watermelon and pomegranates -- the color red symbolizing the glow of life -- to celebrate Yalda, the feast of the winter solstice, which falls this year on Tuesday.
''It's too early to say what the result will be,'' Mr. Ruzbahani said. ''We should wait one or two months for the effects to be seen. In my opinion this will benefit the lower classes because of the money that the government is giving them. I have two cars, so of course I will have to pay more than those who have no car.''
Not everyone is so complacent about the benefits of a plan that many fear could lead to price increases in a wide range of household items, adding to an inflationary trend that has increased the cost of meat, fruit and bread significantly in recent months.
Zhila Shakiba, 55, a housewife and mother of four children, two of whom still live at home, called the $77 payment woefully inadequate. ''Whatever the president says about there being no poor people in this country, that kind of money is no money at all,'' she said. ''When you go out to buy just a few essential things, the prices blow your mind.''
''That money is meant to be for electricity, water and gas -- even if it covers that -- but as far as I can tell, we are going to have to add money to that amount to meet the costs,'' Ms. Shakiba said, adding that the higher prices would encourage Iranians to curb their often extravagant consumption of energy and water resources.

HEADLINE: S.&P. 500 Reaches 2-Year High as Shares Post Modest Gains

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Share prices were mostly higher on Monday, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rising to a two-year high.
Trading volume was light and was expected to remain that way through the rest of 2010. Investors stayed with sectors that have led a sharp December rally, including financials, energy and materials stocks. The S.& P. 500 is up 5.7 percent for the month and 11.8 percent for the year. 
''We have seen this year-end rally refuse to give up any ground,'' said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Ala.
The combination of improving economic data, additional stimulus from the Federal Reserve and the extension of tax cuts was keeping equities in demand, Mr. Hellwig said.
The financial sector, which has lagged the broader market, was up 0.4 percent as some investors bet the sector could be among the leaders next year after a strong December.
However, American Express tumbled 3.4 percent, to $42.50 after Stifel Nicolaus downgraded the stock to hold from buy.
Boeing also kept gains in check. The stock was down 2.7 percent, to $63.27 after The Seattle Times said a delivery delay could be announced for the plane maker's 787 Dreamliner aircraft.
The Dow Jones industrial average dipped 13.78 points, or 0.12 percent, to 11,478.13. The S.& P. 500 added 3.17 points, or 0.25 percent, to 1,247.08. The Nasdaq composite index rose 6.59 points, or 0.25 percent, to 2,649.56.
Markets in the United States will be closed on Friday in observance of the Christmas Day holiday.
Energy shares led the way up as the price of oil rose nearly 1 percent in choppy trading. Chevron added 0.4 percent, to $88.88.
Amazon.com helped lift the Nasdaq on optimism the company would benefit from improved holiday spending. According to the research firm comScore, online sales in the United States are up 12 percent, to $27.5 billion so far this season compared with a year ago.
Shares of Amazon gained 3.2 percent, to $183.29, while the S.& P. consumer discretionary sector was up 0.6 percent.
American Express shares have fallen 7.8 percent since last Thursday when the Federal Reserve proposed limiting debit interchange fees at 12 cents a transaction.
Stifel said the company was increasingly exposed, as a cut in fees ''will significantly increase pressure on higher-cost payments alternatives like Amex.''
Nick Kalivas, senior equity index analyst at MF Global in Chicago, said some of the optimism in the financial sector was sapped by the Fed proposal.
''There was the feeling there could be some opportunities in the banks and I think the interchange cooled that,'' said Mr. Kalivas.
Interest rates were steady. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 2/32, to 94 1/32, and the yield rose to 3.34 percent from 3.33 percent late Friday.

HEADLINE: What's On Today

BYLINE: By KATHRYN SHATTUCK

 BODY:
8 P.M. (Bio) JIMI HENDRIX VOODOO CHILD With a soundtrack rich in hits like ''Purple Haze,'' ''Hey Joe,'' ''Fire'' and ''Voodoo Child,'' this two-hour documentary chronicles the life of Jimi Hendrix, above, who revolutionized the vocabulary of the electric guitar, including heavy use of the wah-wah pedal and amplifier feedback. The focus is especially on the period from 1967, when he shot to fame after his performance at the Monterey Pop Festival, to his death at 27 on Sept. 18, 1970. Among the highlights: his headline performances at the Woodstock Festival in 1969 and the Isle of Wight Festival three weeks before his death. The film also features rare photographs and footage from family archives, as well as interviews with Hendrix.
9 A.M. (ABC) LIVE! WITH REGIS AND KELLY In ''Live's Holiday Skating Party,'' the studio is transformed into a winter wonderland rink, with performances by Bette Midler, Katharine McPhee and cast members of ''Disney on Ice: Toy Story 3,'' as well as an appearance by Santa Claus. 
8 P.M. (National Geographic) LIVING IN THE TIME OF JESUS The historian Arne Kislenko tries his hand at some common occupations found in the Bible during the time of Jesus: farmer, shepherd, fisherman and camel-riding merchant. At 9 he looks at biblical methods of healing the sick, like applying leeches and covering a patient with mud. And at 10 he explores the differences between law and order in the Roman Empire and in the Holy Land.
9 P.M. (CNBC) PRICE OF ADMISSION: AMERICA'S COLLEGE DEBT CRISIS If a key to success is a college education, what are families to do in the face of increasing tuition and staggering student loans, most of which cannot be refinanced or eliminated through bankruptcy? Some loans can even outlive the student, leaving relatives with the responsibility for paying them off. Scott Cohn reports on this latest debt crisis, which is nearing $1 trillion, with Americans now owing more on their student loans than on their credit cards. He also investigates a system that encourages widespread borrowing, often with little regard for a student's ability to repay the loans. Critics say universities, both nonprofit and for-profit, and lenders are hiding default rates to keep government money flowing. Mr. Cohn speaks with the education secretary, Arne Duncan, about whether he is concerned that the student loan system is creating a class of borrowers and debtors.
9 P.M. (NBC) SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE PRESENTS: A VERY GILLY CHRISTMAS Kristen Wiig unleashes her violent troublemaker, Gilly, in this two-hour holiday special, which featured new material when it was first broadcast in 2009, as well as a few skits whose titles are too impolite to mention. But you know those. Alec Baldwin, Steve Martin, Justin Timberlake and Andy Samberg make appearances.
9 P.M. (13); 10 P.M. (49) THE CALLING In the conclusion of this ''Independent Lens'' documentary, Christians, Muslims and Jews studying to become members of the clergy receive their first real jobs.

HEADLINE: Toyota to Pay $32.4 Million In Fines Related to Two Recalls

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Toyota on Monday agreed to pay two more fines, totaling $32.4 million, for failing to swiftly recall millions of defective vehicles, the Transportation Department said.
The fines are the maximum allowed by law and are in addition to the $16.4 million Toyota paid earlier this year in a related matter. The sum of the fines, $48.8 million, amounts to about $30 for each vehicle Toyota has sold this year in the United States. 
The new fines are the result of two separate investigations: one into the recall of nearly five million vehicles with accelerator pedals that could become trapped under the floor mat and a second involving a 2005 recall to fix steering relay rods that could crack or break in some models. Toyota waited a year after initiating a recall on the relay rods in Japan before conceding that models in the United States also were affected.
''I am pleased that Toyota agreed to pay the maximum possible penalty and I expect Toyota to work cooperatively in the future to ensure consumers' safety,'' the transportation secretary, Ray LaHood, said in a statement.
While agreeing to pay the fines, Toyota did not admit committing any violations, but they are another blow to a company that has faltered this year after appearing invincible for decades. The payments could pale in comparison to the billions of dollars in liabilities it could face if lawsuits related to the recalls succeed.
Since November 2009, Toyota has recalled more than 11 million vehicles worldwide, including popular models like the Prius hybrid and the Camry and Corolla sedans. The recalls have prompted some shoppers to shy away from Toyota, causing its sales in the United States to be flat on the year, while the rest of the industry is up 13 percent.
Steve St. Angelo, Toyota's chief quality officer for North America, said in a statement that the company had ''worked very hard over the past year to put these issues behind us and set a new standard of responsiveness to our customers.'' He said resolving the investigations would allow Toyota to forge a better relationship with regulators and ''focus even more on listening to our customers and meeting their high expectations for safe and reliable vehicles.''
In May, Toyota paid what was a record fine in connection with the government's investigation of a January recall for so-called sticking accelerator pedals. Automakers are required to notify the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration within five days of discovering a defect.
The fines levied Monday are $16.375 million for the floor-mat recall in late 2009, and $16.05 million for the steering relay rod recall. Both amounts are the maximum allowed but differ because of adjustments for inflation.
The problems in each of the three recalls for which Toyota has been fined were connected to numerous reports of crashes that resulted in injuries and deaths.

HEADLINE: After Fall of 'Don't Ask,' Pushing for 'I Do'

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Republican senator from North Carolina was blunt. ''Because she's a damn lesbian,'' Jesse Helms snapped, explaining to The Washington Times why he would vote against Roberta Achtenberg, President Bill Clinton's nominee for assistant housing secretary. Later, he clarified, calling her ''a militant, activist, mean lesbian.''
That was in 1993. On Saturday, another North Carolina Republican, Richard M. Burr, stood on the Senate floor and surprised gay rights advocates by voting to repeal the military's ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy. Mr. Burr said repeal was ''generationally right'' given that most Americans have grown up in a time where ''they don't think exclusion is the right thing for the United States to do.''
The two votes, 17 years apart, would suggest a kind of ''We've come a long way baby'' moment. But while public opinion has changed in favor of gay rights over the past two decades, those attitudes are often not reflected in public policy, because the views of lawmakers, polls suggest, lag behind the public, and not just among social conservatives who have long opposed elements of the gay rights agenda on moral grounds. 
Polls show the public is broadly supportive of equal rights for gay men and lesbians on several issues -- with the exception of the right to marry. The vast majority of Americans, nearly 90 percent, favor equality of opportunity in the workplace. More than 60 percent favored overturning ''don't ask, don't tell'' -- a figure that has stood steady at least since 2005, according to the Gallup Organization, which tracks public sentiment on gay rights.
Yet the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, first proposed in the Clinton years, remains stuck on Capitol Hill, in part because lawmakers are squeamish about language in it that would protect transgender employees. The ''don't ask, don't tell'' repeal bill nearly died the week before it was passed.
Same-sex marriage is even trickier for politicians. Fewer than half of all Americans support it, which puts even supporters of gay rights, like President Obama, in a political bind. Mr. Obama supports civil unions but has opposed same-sex marriage, although he recently said that ''attitudes evolve, including mine'' -- a hint that he might change his position.
''There have been enormous and important shifts in public attitudes, and those are a hopeful sign,'' said Tobias B. Wolff, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania who advises the Obama White House on gay rights issues. But Mr. Wolff speaks of a ''political gay panic,'' saying, ''Even when the public is so strongly behind equality, so strongly behind the right thing, politicians are hyper-cautious.''
Ms. Achtenberg, who was ultimately confirmed as Mr. Clinton's assistant secretary for housing -- after a protracted debate -- agrees. She became the first openly gay appointee to win Senate confirmation at just about the same time as Mr. Clinton put forth the ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy. She said she watched the Senate vote on Saturday at home in San Francisco and cried.
''It feels like 17 years of unfinished business,'' she said.
Now that Republicans have won control of the House and increased their numbers in the Senate, many in Washington expect the political climate for gay causes to worsen. Some advocates of gay rights say their efforts will shift to the states; Maryland, New York and Rhode Island, for instance, are all contemplating legislation to legalize same-sex marriage.
Activists are also looking to the courts. In California, a federal appeals court will soon hear a challenge to that state's same-sex marriage ban. In one big sign that attitudes have changed, a lead lawyer trying to overturn the ban is Theodore B. Olson, the conservative lawyer who was solicitor general to President George W. Bush.
In a 2009 interview with The New York Times, Mr. Olson said he regarded the case as one that could ''involve the rights and happiness and equal treatment of millions of people.''
Popular culture has been a driving force behind attitudinal shifts around gay men and lesbians and gay rights, and the pace of change has been faster than during the civil rights or women's rights movements, said Anna Greenberg, a pollster who tracks gay rights issues for the Human Rights Campaign, an advocacy group.
When Ellen DeGeneres brought her character on the ABC sitcom ''Ellen'' out of the closet in 1997, she shocked the nation, and her show suffered. In 2008, her wedding to Portia de Rossi was covered by People magazine, ''which to me defines the mainstream,'' Ms. Greenberg said.
By 2009, Dick Cheney, the Republican former vice president, was publicly supporting same-sex marriage; his daughter, Mary, is a lesbian.
Conservatives are dismayed.
''The other side is winning the war on words and the rhetoric,'' said Tom McClusky, senior vice president of Family Research Council Action, the legislative arm of the conservative advocacy group. ''Generationally, this is an uphill battle for us, and we realize that.''
Yet while the country may have embraced gay men and lesbians in popular culture -- witness the success of movies like ''Milk,'' based on the life of the slain gay rights activist Harvey Milk -- its political leaders are careful about that embrace. Former President Jimmy Carter recently created a stir when he said the nation was ready for a gay president. On Monday, the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, brushed aside a question about whether Mr. Obama shares that view.''I haven't asked him,'' Mr. Gibbs said.
Mr. Clinton, for one, learned firsthand the dangers of getting ahead of public opinion on gay rights. In 1992, he ran for president as the first major party candidate to openly court the gay vote. But when he took on the issue of gays in the military just days after his inauguration, he opened a hornet's nest. The public was split on whether gay men and lesbians should serve openly.
''Don't ask, don't tell'' was devised as a compromise from Mr. Clinton's initial position, which was that the ban on service by gay men and lesbians should be lifted entirely. After Saturday's vote, Mr. Clinton's onetime adviser on gay rights, Richard Socarides, sent the former president an e-mail message, via an aide.
''92 campaign promise fulfilled!'' Mr. Socarides wrote.
The aide, Mr. Socarides said, wrote back with a message from the former president: ''Hooray! A long time coming.''

HEADLINE: Iraqi Premier Proposes Cabinet Ministers to Parliament

BYLINE: By JOHN LELAND; Duraid Adnan and Zaid Thaker contributed reporting.

 BODY:
BAGHDAD -- Iraq's prime minister set forward the skeleton of his new government on Monday night, proposing ministers to fill a majority of cabinet seats and bringing a bitter nine-month impasse one faltering step closer to resolution.
For the first time in Iraq's recent history, the proposed government represents all main ethnic and sectarian factions, with participation from parties supported by Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds, whose haggling over how to share power has threatened at many points to derail the agonizing and often rancorous process. 
Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki proposed 25 cabinet ministers in a meeting with the speaker of Parliament after the lawmakers' regular session had ended for the day, said Hassan al-Seneid, a lawmaker from Mr. Maliki's alliance.
Mr. Maliki stopped short of proposing heads for some of the more hotly contested and powerful ministries, including health, labor, defense, security and interior. In all, he did not name heads for 17 ministries.
Parliament is scheduled to meet Tuesday and must approve the cabinet choices before the new government can be officially formed. Six ministries will continue as caretaker agencies until Mr. Maliki can select ministers acceptable to the body at large, Mr. Seneid said.
The names give focus to an electoral process in which Mr. Maliki's alliance won fewer than one third of the 325 seats in Parliament, and in which a rival alliance, Iraqiya, finished first, barely. During the protracted negotiating after the March elections, Mr. Maliki was able to form alliances with, or neutralize, long-time antagonists, eventually gaining concessions from Iraqiya's leader, Ayad Allawi, who until last weekend had maintained that he had the right to form the government.
Throughout the process, Iran and the United States found themselves in the position of unlikely allies, both pressuring Iraqi leaders to resolve differences and get on with the business of governing.
''We won't know what this all means until we know who got what and what all the deals were,'' said Ryan C. Crocker, former United States ambassador to Iraq and now dean of the George Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University.
''The prolonged bitterness doesn't tell me much. It may have produced a government that can actually govern,'' Mr. Crocker said. ''Maliki knows he's got enough of a base that he's not subject to any single party.''
The government, once it is formed, faces an array of challenges, including rebuilding an economy, resolving territory disputes between Arabs and Kurds, passing an energy policy, fixing the electrical grid and providing security to a country weary from seven years of war and conflict.
Mr. Maliki brought the partial list of ministers to the speaker of Parliament, Osama al-Nujaifi, after a confusing day. At first his office said he would present the new government to the Parliament on Monday, then the move was delayed. As of Monday night the names were still not public, though Mr. Seneid provided them to The New York Times.
If Mr. Maliki does not present a cabinet to Parliament by Dec. 25, the Constitution calls for the president, Jalal Talabani, to appoint another member of Parliament to form the government.
No progress was made on Monday toward defining the role of a still vague National Council for Higher Policies, whose status has been at the heart of much of the fractiousness since the election. On Sunday, Mr. Allawi announced that he was relinquishing his claim to lead the next government and accepting the role of head of the council, which he has insisted holds executive powers. The Obama administration has supported forming the council as a check on the prime minister's authority. But its authority remains unspecified.
''I'm worried that checks won't happen,'' said Joost R. Hiltermann, the deputy Middle East program director at the International Crisis Group, a research organization.

HEADLINE: Clinton Budget Chief Returns to Job, Prepared Anew for Battles Ahead

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Jacob J. Lew already had bruises after a month as President Obama's budget director when, on Thursday, his former boss, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, belatedly hosted a farewell party for him. Amid the holiday splendor of a State Department reception room, colleagues sent him off with a memento: a helmet like those of diplomats in war zones.
''No doubt I will need this helmet,'' Mr. Lew said, mindful of the budget battles ahead.
''When we go to Afghanistan or in Iraq,'' he added, ''at least you put on body armor, you get into the armored vehicle, there are people who are protecting you. I'm now out there on my own.'' 
Even as he spoke, the House was finishing debate on the first major compromise between Mr. Obama and Congressional Republicans empowered by their midterm election gains: a package of tax cuts and unemployment aid that Mr. Lew helped negotiate. While the deal drew fire from both parties, liberal Democrats were especially enraged by a two-year extension of Bush-era tax cuts for high incomes and wealthy estates and a reduction in payroll taxes for Social Security. In private caucuses, some turned their anger at the White House on Mr. Lew.
''This is not a package we could have supported if it didn't take care of the workers who are most vulnerable,'' Mr. Lew said in an interview, echoing the pitch he made to Democrats in private.
But this episode was just a warm-up for what are likely to be bigger confrontations and arduous budget parleys in the next two years. With both Mr. Obama and Republicans vowing to bring down annual deficits swelling the nation's debt -- in very different ways -- Mr. Lew becomes an even more crucial figure in the cabinet than budget directors typically are.
And if Mr. Obama were to take steps to reduce the long-term growth of popular domestic programs and military spending and to increase tax revenues -- as his own bipartisan fiscal commission recommended -- that will force Mr. Lew, renowned as one of the most unassuming officials in Washington, into more clashes with Democrats as well as Republicans.
Like his boss, Mr. Lew is part of an emerging strain of pragmatic liberals who believe Democrats must compromise with Republicans to reduce long-term deficits, or ultimately the mounting debt could force far more severe cuts in Medicare, Social Security and other programs benefiting low- and middle-income Americans.
Budgets are ''a self-portrait of what we are as a country,'' Mr. Lew said a decade ago as President Bill Clinton's last budget director. And for three decades. Mr. Lew has been at the center of power as the nation has lurched from deficits to surpluses and back again.
Now a boyish 55 years old, half a lifetime ago Mr. Lew was a remarkably young lieutenant to Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., the proud Irish-Catholic New Deal Democrat, as Mr. O'Neill repeatedly battled and compromised with President Ronald Reagan and a Republican-led Senate in the 1980s. Among their deals was the 1983 law preserving Social Security by reducing benefits and increasing payroll taxes, and the 1986 tax code overhaul.
''Even to this day, when I talk with Jack, he's one of the few people who understand the personality of the Congress,'' said Leon E. Panetta, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, who was a Democratic congressman in the 1980s and, in the 1990s, Mr. Clinton's first budget director and later his chief of staff.
Yet through all the years and back-room politicking, Mr. Lew has maintained a bipartisan reputation as a straight-shooter.
He ''knows how to deal, and his word is good as gold,'' said Billy Pitts, the top House Republican leadership aide in the 1980s.
Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, long the Senate Republican leader on budget issues, said he rejected Mr. Lew's request for the traditional courtesy call before Mr. Lew's Senate confirmation vote because ''I didn't need to have him waste his time.''
''I'm a fan,'' Mr. Gregg said. ''Obviously we don't have the same philosophy but that doesn't matter. He is a pragmatist.''
At the farewell party at the State Department, where Mr. Lew was a deputy, Mrs. Clinton read ''the top 10 things Jack will miss about working at State.'' No. 8 was ''riding shotgun with Roddy''; assigned a driver, Roderick Martin, Mr. Lew insisted on sitting up front with him. Mr. Lew would call to reassure a colleague ''after a rough meeting,'' Mrs. Clinton said, and he e-mailed the daughter of another ''just to let her know that her mother's doing fine in Iraq.''
Once confirmed as budget director, Mr. Lew had to hit the ground running, simultaneously negotiating with agencies over budget cuts and lawmakers over the tax deal.
''I'm not sure how I would have done this if I hadn't done it six times before,'' he said.
Mr. Lew said the common thread in all the budget and tax deals back to the Reagan era was his and his Democratic mentors' insistence that the compromises fairly apportion benefits and pain. He considers his legacy to be his role, as Mr. O'Neill's aide, in helping to develop so-called distributional analysis, which measures a bill's impact among income groups.
For antipoverty programs in recent decades, ''a lot of the expansions came while there was deficit reduction,'' Mr. Lew said. ''So you don't have to say that you leave your progressive values. And this last deal actually bears that imprint.''
Wendell Primus, who as a House committee aide in the 1980s worked with Mr. Lew on the distribution studies, said they also helped to devise a strategy to get around Republicans' opposition to spending for lower-income people: Join in the tax-cutting.
''We made the political calculus that it was easier to reduce taxes on those families than to increase food stamps or welfare benefits,'' Mr. Primus said.
So it was that decades later Mr. Obama, in return for temporarily extending the Bush-era tax rates, got expanded tax credits for the working poor and for middle-income families with children and college costs.
After Mr. Obama's election, Mr. Lew was in line to be director of the National Economic Council. But that job went to Lawrence H. Summers after Mr. Obama named Timothy F. Geithner to be Treasury secretary instead of Mr. Summers. Mrs. Clinton snatched Mr. Lew to be one of her two deputies at the State Department.
As first lady, she had worked with him on the development of the AmeriCorps national-service program and on the doomed health insurance legislation. After the Clinton administration, both moved to New York -- Mrs. Clinton as senator and Mr. Lew as executive vice president of New York University and then as an executive at Citigroup. (He still splits his time between Washington and New York, where his wife, Ruth Schwartz, works on education technology; a son lives in New York and a daughter in Washington.)
At the State Department, he managed its budget and oversaw the department's ''civilian surge'' in Afghanistan and Iraq of aid workers and advisers for local governance, farming, education and health. Then last summer, when Peter R. Orszag decided to leave as budget director, Mr. Obama asked Mr. Lew to take the job again.
Mrs. Clinton, in an interview, said that when Mr. Lew told her about Mr. Obama's job offer, ''after I picked myself off the floor, I said, 'I really can't stand in your way or the president's way, but I hope there's some way that you can say no.' ''
She spoke privately with Mr. Obama. Asked whether he had persuaded her that Mr. Lew should move, Mrs. Clinton replied, ''Apparently not,'' then acknowledged that Mr. Lew was perfect for the budget job.
Mr. Lew said Mr. Obama had argued that ''the times really required someone with experience,'' and ''he needed me to do it.''
''When the president of the United States makes that case to you,'' Mr. Lew said, ''unless you think it would ruin your life, the right thing to do is say, 'Yes, sir.' ''

 BODY:
PLAN OF ATTACK That the New York attorney general's office may file civil charges against Ernst & Young, Lehman Brothers' outside auditor, is a bit unusual. White Collar Watch asks, is this the beginning of a wave of cases against former Lehman executives and advisers for their role in the firm's collapse? Or could it signal a split between the New York attorney general's office and the Securities and Exchange Commission as they follow their own paths in pursuing cases? PETER J. HENNING 
NEW FIGHT Seneca Capital, the hedge fund that led the fight to scuttle Dynegy's plan to sell itself to the Blackstone Group, came out against the company's new effort to sell itself to the billionaire Carl C. Icahn for $665 million.
In a news release, Seneca, which owns 12 percent of Dynegy shares, argued that the new bid, worth $5.50 a share, remained too low and that shareholders should refuse to tender their holdings. MICHAEL J. de la MERCED BULLISH ON BANKING Investment banking is the business that Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive of Goldman Sachs, sees as having the most potential next year, according to a new Wall Street analyst report.
Glenn Schorr, an analyst with Nomura, says he met with Mr. Blankfein and the firm's chief financial officer, David Viniar, above, and found that management was feeling good about how 2011 was shaping up, given robust M.&A. and equity underwriting pipelines. ANITA RAGHAVAN
RETURN TO LAW John C. Dugan, who left the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in August, is rejoining his former law firm, Covington & Burling.
He will be chairman of the firm's financial institutions group, the position he held before he was appointed comptroller by President Bush in 2005. Mr. Dugan, 55, will be advising clients on ''a range of legal matters affected by significantly increased regulatory requirements resulting from the financial crisis,'' the firm said. nytimes.com/dealbook

HEADLINE: Ernst & Young Suit Said to Be Imminent

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN and SUSANNE CRAIG

 BODY:
More than two years after Lehman Brothers imploded, nearly bringing the global economy to its knees, regulators are preparing to file the first major legal action stemming from the collapse of the investment bank.
The charges, however, are not expected to be leveled against senior executives at Lehman, but rather against the accounting firm that audited the firm's financial statements.
A civil fraud lawsuit could be brought by the New York attorney general against Ernst & Young by Tuesday, accusing the accounting firm of helping Lehman mislead investors, according to a person briefed on the matter. Ernst & Young certified the financial statements of Lehman from 2001 until the firm's bankruptcy filing in September 2008.
The two sides have had discussions on a settlement, this person said. The possibility of a lawsuit was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal. 
The move by Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo -- coming just days before he is sworn in as New York's governor -- could spur other regulators to act. Both the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission have been investigating the demise of Lehman.
The government investigations of Lehman, which began not long after its collapse, have resulted in no charges against any of the firm's executives, including Richard S. Fuld Jr., its longtime chief executive.
''The New York attorney general, whether it's Cuomo or his predecessor Eliot Spitzer, has always been aggressive when it comes to civil litigation matters,'' said Michael J. Missal, a government-enforcement lawyer at K&L Gates. ''This appears to be another instance where the office is moving ahead of the S.E.C. and any other federal regulator.''
Ernst & Young's role as Lehman's outside auditor has been under intense scrutiny since the release in March of a 2,200-page report into the investment bank's collapse. The attorney general's investigation of Ernst & Young began after the release of the report, said the person familiar with the inquiry.
The stinging report, written by a bankruptcy court-appointed examiner, accused Lehman's top executives -- particularly its chief financial officers -- of manipulating the firm's balance sheet and inflating the value of its souring real-estate holdings, among other alleged misdeeds.
But the report reserved some of its harshest criticism for Ernst & Young, effectively laying out a road map for a potential legal action against the accounting firm.
The examiner, Anton R. Valukas, a lawyer at Jenner & Block, said there was enough evidence to support at least three claims against Ernst & Young over its poor supervision of Lehman's accounting practices.
Specifically, the report focused on an accounting maneuver -- known inside Lehman as Repo 105 -- that it denounced as ''materially misleading.'' The tactic temporarily removed as much as $50 billion of assets from its balance sheet to give the appearance that the firm had reduced its debt levels. It often did this just before the end of a financial quarter, the report said.
The report said that Ernst & Young knew about this practice since 2001 and criticized the accounting firm for not exploring the possibility ''that Repo 105 transactions were accounting-motivated transactions that lacked a business purpose.''
Mr. Valukas's report also said that the auditors ignored warnings by a Lehman executive about potential accounting improprieties at the firm just months before its bankruptcy filing. While Ernst & Young spoke to Lehman's board about the executive's claims, it did not disclose allegations about Repo 105, the report said.
''Ernst & Young took no steps to question or challenge the nondisclosure by Lehman of its use of $50 billion of temporary, off-balance sheet transactions,'' the report said.
Legal and accounting experts have previously said that the report could expose Ernst & Young to civil malpractice claims and even criminal charges.
An Ernst & Young spokesman declined to comment on any potential case brought by Mr. Cuomo's office.
At the time of the examiner's report release, the Ernst & Young spokesman said that the firm stood by its work and complied with generally accepted accounting principles. He also said that Lehman's collapse was the result of ''a series of unprecedented adverse events in the financial markets.''
Britain's independent accounting regulator, the Financial Reporting Council, is also investigating Ernst & Young in connection with the accounting firm's role in preparing reports to British regulators related to Lehman's European operations.
To date, United States regulators have brought few cases connected to the companies at the center of the financial crisis. While shareholders have filed civil lawsuits, no senior executives at Lehman, the American International Group or Bear Stearns have been charged by government regulators.
In November 2009, in the first major criminal case connected to the financial crisis, a federal jury in Brooklyn acquitted two Bear Stearns hedge fund managers on charges that they had misled investors as their portfolio of mortgage-backed securities crumbled.
Lehman has been in regulators' cross hairs since its collapse. In 2008, federal prosecutors subpoenaed several Wall Street firms seeking information about whether their analysts had been misled by Lehman about its financial health, according to people familiar with the matter.
Specifically, prosecutors have asked questions about certain statements Lehman executives made in June 2008, when it sought to raise capital to bolster its balance sheet, and its final days, when it assured analysts that it did not need new capital.
Former Lehman employees say officials from the S.E.C. have been asking how Lehman valued an investment in a power plant in India. The asset's lofty valuation may have bolstered the firm's finances in 2008 before its collapse, these people say. An S.E.C. spokesman declined to comment.
Mr. Fuld has kept a low profile since the collapse of Lehman Brothers. He started a firm called Matrix Advisors, offering advice to former Lehman clients and others on various transactions. Ian Lowitt, the firm's last chief financial officer, is the chief operating officer of the United States wealth-management business at Barclays of Britain, which bought Lehman's operations in the United States.
Erin Callan, his predecessor, left Lehman in June 2008. She accepted a job at Credit Suisse, but left not long after. She is currently not employed in the securities industry.
If the New York attorney general's office takes a different tack on Lehman, that would not be unusual. Mr. Cuomo, like his predecessor, Mr. Spitzer, has used the attorney general's office to take aggressive aim at Wall Street. For instance, Mr. Cuomo sued Bank of America and Kenneth D. Lewis, its former chief executive, accusing them of hiding billions of dollars in losses at Merrill Lynch from shareholders even after the S.E.C. reached a settlement with the bank.
With the big accounting firms and other companies, federal prosecutors have been mindful of the experience of Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm that went out of business after its conviction on obstruction of justice charges in 2002. (The Supreme Court later threw out the conviction.) In many cases, the government has struck so-called deferred prosecution agreements with companies instead of filing charges.
If a lawsuit were filed against Ernst & Young this week without a settlement, it would be handed off to Mr. Cuomo's successor, Eric T. Schneiderman.

HEADLINE: Housing for Hurricane Victims

 BODY:
The recession has made it impossible for Louisiana and other gulf states to replace thousands of affordable housing units swept away five years ago by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Congress tried to fix this problem last week with a one-year extension of a tax-credit program that encourages companies to invest in affordable housing as a way of offsetting tax liabilities. 
But one year does not allow enough time for weather and construction delays; investors have already made it abundantly clear that they will avoid the program unless Congress gives them at least 18 months to get the deals signed, the buildings erected and tenants installed. This should be an urgent priority for the next Congress.
Nearly all the affordable rental housing in this country is built through the low-income tax-credit program. After the two storms, Congress allotted Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama more than $300 million in credits under a program requiring that projects be ready for occupancy by the end of this year.
The credits sold briskly while the economy was booming. But demand dropped off steeply during the recession when businesses had progressively smaller tax liabilities. The market picked up again with the recovery, except in the Gulf of Mexico region, where investors worried they could lose money by buying into projects that would miss the ready-for occupancy deadline.
Last spring, Senator Mary Landrieu, a Democrat of Louisiana, introduced an amendment extending the occupancy date by two years. Congress dragged its feet up until last week when lawmakers demanded that the extension be cut back to one year.
This will help a handful of projects that are already in progress. But it will do nothing for the 70 or so projects scattered around the gulf states that are still searching for investors. The next Congress will need to quickly extend the tax credits by another year.

HEADLINE: Hiring Suit Takes On Bias Based On Credit

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Sending a sharp warning to employers nationwide, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commissionsued the Kaplan Higher Education Corporation on Tuesday, accusing it of discriminating against black job applicants through the way it uses credit histories in its hiring process.
The lawsuit, an unusual intervention by the federal government on the issue, comes amid rising concerns that employers are denying jobs to applicants with damaged credit histories, even in cases where creditworthiness does not appear to be directly relevant to the job.
Several states, including Hawaii, Washington, Oregon and Illinois, have banned or severely limited the use of credit reports in hiring, partly out of worry that the practice could prevent unemployed, financially pressed Americans from getting back into the work force. Other states and Congress have considered similar laws. 
Private and government surveys have suggested that about half of all employers use credit histories in at least some hiring decisions.
Justine Lisser, an E.E.O.C. spokeswoman, said that credit histories were often inaccurate and might not be a good indicator of a person's qualifications for a particular job. ''Credit histories were not compiled to show responsibility,'' she said. ''They were compiled to show whether or not someone was paying the bills, which is not always the same thing.''
In the E.E.O.C.'s suit, which was filed in federal district court in Cleveland, the agency said that since at least January 2008, Kaplan had rejected job applicants based on their credit history, with a ''significant disparate impact'' on blacks.
''This practice has an unlawful discriminatory impact because of race and is neither job-related nor justified by business necessity,'' the commission said. The agency did not specify what types of jobs were involved.
Kaplan, which is owned by the Washington Post Company, operates a chain of for-profit colleges and training schools around the country. The parent company's shares fell more than 2 percent in Tuesday trading.
In a statement, Kaplan said, ''We are an equal opportunity employer, and we are proud of the diversity of our work force.''
The company added that it typically conducted background checks on all prospective employees. ''The checks are job-related and a necessity for our organization to ensure that staff handling financial matters, including financial aid, are properly screened,'' Kaplan said. Kaplan and other for-profit education companies have come under intense scrutiny from the federal government because of concerns that the industry leaves too many students unable to repay large federally backed education loans, while providing them with little help in finding jobs. The Department of Education has proposed regulations that would cut off federal financing to for-profit education companies whose graduates have high debt-to-income ratios and low repayment rates.
The federal lawsuit is seeking a permanent injunction to stop Kaplan's use of credit histories in hiring and other employment decisions. The agency is also seeking lost wages and benefits for people who were not hired because of Kaplan's use of credit reports to screen applicants, and it wants Kaplan to make employment offers to those individuals.
Michael J. Zimmer, a professor of employment law at Loyola University in Chicago, said that, under federal law, ''if an employment practice has a disparate impact on a certain race, you have a case.'' He said that the E.E.O.C. would not have brought the case unless it had reviewed statistics about Kaplan's hiring.
''I think the issue is going to boil down to whether it's justified as job-related and necessary for business,'' he said. ''That's the defense's standard in a disparate impact case.''
The E.E.O.C. typically brings discrimination cases only when it is convinced that serious abuse has occurred. Ms. Lisser said that 99,000 charges were filed with the E.E.O.C. in its most recent fiscal year, but the agency filed just 250 lawsuits that year, usually in what it saw as especially strong or significant cases. The agency said the Kaplan case was only the third time it has sued over the misuse of credit reports in employment.
In a recent letter to the agency, the Consumer Data Industry Association strongly defended using credit histories in hiring decisions. It told the agency that employers tried hard to create working environments that were free from fraud and theft.
In that letter, Eric J. Ellman, the association's vice president for public policy and legal affairs, said, ''In a climate of economic uncertainty, where employers are likely choosing from a large employment pool, they need to be critically careful about protecting their businesses and their customers.''
Mr. Ellman noted that the use of credit reports for employment purposes was legally protected and that ''credit reports for employment purposes are reliable predictors of risk.''
''Many safeguards exist for employers to ensure that credit information is used where it is job-related and consistent with business necessity,'' he concluded in his letter to the agency.
But Ms. Lisser, the E.E.O.C. spokeswoman, vigorously disagreed. ''It's not clear that employers who are relying on credit histories know if someone has never paid a bill for 10 years or if someone was a very responsible bill payer for years until they lost a job or someone in their family had a medical emergency and they suddenly couldn't make a payment. We don't think it's a good marker for responsibility in employment,'' she said.
