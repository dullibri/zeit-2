HEADLINE: Democrats' Odds of Retaining Senate Improve

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Republican fortunes have diminished because of retirements and questions about the quality of candidates. 

 BODY:
When we last took an overview of Senate races in December, Republicans appeared to be slight favorites to take control from Democrats, with a net gain of four to five seats representing the most likely outcome.
Since then, however, Republican fortunes have diminished somewhat because of problems with the quality of some candidates and key retirements. Although Republicans are most likely to gain seats on balance because Democrats have considerably more incumbents up for re-election, the question of whether the Republicans will win enough to gain control now appears to be closer to a tossup. In fact, the outcome may depend on who wins the presidential election, as well as whether an independent Senate candidate who is favored in Maine will caucus with the Democrats.
The table below contains the FiveThirtyEight estimates of the probability of victory for each party in the 33 Senate seats to be contested this November. These forecasts, although they are informed by polling and other objective measures, are ultimately reflections of my best judgments and also account for "intangible" factors like candidate quality and the partisan orientation of the state. (We traditionally switch over to purely tangible factors in the summer, once polling becomes more robust and we post the official forecast model for the Senate.)
Although these estimates run on a scale from 0 percent to 100 percent, we also classify the races into different categories like "Lean Democrat" and "Likely Republican" for ease of interpretation. Nine races have switched categories since our previous update: six in favor of Democrats, two in favor of Republicans, and one in favor of an independent candidate. These changes do not reflect shifts in the overall political environment, which remains fairly evenhanded, but rather circumstances particular to each race.
Shifts in Favor of Democrats
We had previously categorized the Senate race in California as Likely Democrat. The Democratic incumbent up for re-election there, Dianne Feinstein, has only average approval ratings and at age 78 was a plausible risk for retirement. However, Mrs. Feinstein is running in the state's June 5 primary and, between California's Democratic politics and its expensive airwaves, it would take a strong and well-financed Republican challenger to defeat her. Instead, the Republican field in the state has been disorganized, with few candidates capable of running a full-fledged campaign. We now classify the state as Safe Democrat.
In Indiana, Democrats have a pickup opportunity because of the defeat of the longtime Republican incumbent, Richard G. Lugar, in the primary last week. Although the candidate who defeated him, State Treasurer Richard Mourdock, should be capable of running a competent race, Democrats have a strong candidate in Representative Joe Donnelly, who survived the Republicans' electoral onslaught in 2010. The only poll of the race so far showed a tie between Mr. Mourdock and Mr. Donnelly. We give Mr. Mourdock a slight edge because of Indiana's overall partisan orientation and classify the race as Lean Republican. But the race is much more competitive than it would have been if Mr. Lugar had survived the primary.
In Michigan, the Democratic incumbent Debbie Stabenow gained considerable ground in the polls after a questionable advertisement by one of her potential Republican opponents, Peter Hoekstra. Mrs. Stabenow may also be helped by the state's improved economy, as Michigan's unemployment rate has dropped substantially,to 8.5 percent from a peak of 14.1 percent. We now classify the race as Likely Democrat rather than Lean Democrat. Republican chances to win it may depend in part on how much time and money Mitt Romney invests there in the fall.
Republicans are still favored to pick up a seat in Nebraska, where Ben Nelson, an unpopular Democrat, is retiring. However, Democrats have the better-credentialed candidate in Bob Kerrey, the former senator and governor, whereas Republican primary voters on Tuesday elected an inexperienced candidate, State Senator Deb Fisher, in an upset. Mrs. Fisher should still be the favorite because of Nebraska's strong Republican orientation, and she led Mr. Kerrey in polls in March. Still, the candidate-quality gap is substantial and could translate into her running an inferior campaign, and candidate quality is a variable that we have found to have predictive power in the past. We now classify the race as Lean Republican rather than Likely Republican.
The hardest Senate race to call may be in North Dakota, where Democrats have another tough defensive assignment after the retirement of Kent Conrad. Like in Nebraska, the partisan climate in the state leans toward Republicans. However, Democrats are somewhat more unified behind their candidate, Heidi Heitkamp, the former state attorney general. The only recent poll of the race showed Mrs. Heitkamp slightly ahead, but it was commissioned by the North Dakota Democratic Party and such partisan polls often exaggerate their candidate's standing. For now, we classify the race as Lean Republican, rather than Likely Republican as before, but the race could revert to Likely Republican or move into the tossup category pending the release of nonpartisan polling. One measurable factor working in Republicans' favor is that their candidates have combined to raise more money than Mrs. Heitkamp has.
Finally, in Pennsylvania, Republicans were in need of a strong candidate to seriously challenge the Democratic incumbent, Bob Casey, who is fairly popular. Instead, their field failed to coalesce and they picked an inexperienced nominee, the businessman Tom Smith, in their primary in April. We classify the race as Safe Democrat, rather than Likely Democrat as before.
Shifts in Favor of Republicans
Two races have shifted in favor of Republicans. In New Jersey, Robert Menendez, a Democrat, has middling approval ratings and is below 50 percent in the polls against the most likely Republican nominee, State Senator Joseph Kyrillos. Mr. Kyrillos would need to catch some breaks to win the race - his fund-raising has lagged Mr. Menendez's so far, and he might need Mr. Romney to be more competitive in New Jersey than Republican presidential candidates have been in recent years. Still, there is a plausible path to an upset, and so we now classify the race as Likely Democrat rather than Safe Democrat.
We had classified Texas, where Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican, is retiring, as Likely Republican, hedging our bets somewhat as open-seat races are inherently somewhat competitive by default. But Democrats have failed to recruit a good candidate, while Republicans have several well-qualified choices. A significant candidate-quality advantage, and Texas' substantially Republican partisan orientation, is enough for us to classify the race as Safe Republican.
Shift in Favor of an Independent Candidate
The Senate race in Maine has already been upended twice: first, when Olympia Snowe, a Republican, announced her retirement, and when former Gov. Angus King, an independent, announced that he would run. Mr. King was popular as governor and now has a large lead in the polls. He is formidable enough, in fact, to have deterred several major-party candidates from running, particularly Democrats. Although independent candidates inherently face some difficulties in winning elections - they cannot receive money from party committees, for instance - Maine has a history of treating independents favorably, as Mr. King's two terms as governor demonstrated. Thus, we classify the race as Likely Independent. If there is an upset, it could be by the Republican candidate in the event that votes on the center and the left split between Mr. King and the Democrat - although Democrats could avert that outcome by essentially surrendering the race to Mr. King. 
Instead, the most interesting question in Maine might be which party Mr. King would caucus with if he wins. The Democrats are a much more likely possibility than the Republicans; Mr. King's politics are center-left, and he endorsed Representative Chellie Pingree, a Democrat, in 2010. Still, Mr. King has declined to reveal his intentions if he wins, suggesting at times that he might not caucus with either party or that his decision could depend on the overall partisan environment after the November elections.
Overall Forecast
The ambiguity over Mr. King's status complicates the overall forecast. Currently, we project the most likely outcome to be Republicans winning 50 seats, Democrats 49, and Mr. King the seat in Maine. Under those circumstances, the Democrats would retain control of the Senate if Mr. King caucused with them and President Obama won re-election, making Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. the tiebreaking vote. Otherwise, Republicans would control the chamber.
However, it should be remembered that this is just one potential outcome out of a fairly wide range of possibilities. In 2006 and 2008, Democrats won all or almost all of the races that would have been classified as tossups or as leaning toward one party at this stage. Republicans did the same in 2010.
This year, if Republicans won all the lean and tossup races, they would pick up a net of nine seats from Democrats. That would give them control of 56 seats - a sizable majority whether or not Mr. King aligned with them.
Conversely, if Democrats won all the lean and tossup races, they would actually gain a net of three seats from Republicans, or four if Mr. King caucused with them. That would give them 55 or 56 seats over all.
What would produce such a shift in the overall partisan environment is unclear, but a substantial economic upturn or downturn, a major foreign policy success or failure, a significant gap in turnout among Democratic and Republican voters, a partisan row in Congress like last year's debt ceiling debate or a major scandal involving Mr. Obama or Mr. Romney are all possibilities. Put more simply, the possibility for major news events is a "known unknown," and there is plenty of time between now and November.
Still, if the elections were held today, the Senate races would be more localized than they were in 2006, 2008 or 2010, and Mr. King's decision and the outcome of the presidential race could swing the partisan balance.

HEADLINE: Amateur Hour: Jack Hitt Talks About an American Tradition

BYLINE: JOHN WILLIAMS


HIGHLIGHT: The author of "Bunch of Amateurs" on the rebellious spirit of American innovators. 

 BODY:
In "Bunch of Amateurs: A Search for the American Character," Jack Hitt investigates the tradition of American amateurism in various fields, from politics to astronomy to bird watching. He writes, "American professionals have had to grow up right alongside their striving, awkward, amateur cousins in the same way that the first attempts at gentry in the Old South had to contend with their toothless cousins named Fishbait or Elrod, sleeping in the bushes outside the mansion." In a recent interview via e-mail, Mr. Hitt discussed the reputation of the Tyrannosaurus rex, Benjamin Franklin's role in the mythology of amateurism, the relationship between pros and amateurs, and more. Below are excerpts from the conversation.
Q.
Did any particular experience with amateurs lead you to write an entire book about them?
A.
Definitely - the time I spent with the Kansas City Space Pirates. They are a group of amateurs centered around a guy named Brian Turner, a computer consultant who spends his weekends fiddling with power beaming. (Imagine a fuel-less airplane powered by a ground-based laser juicing on-board solar cells.) Hanging out with Turner and his team made me realize that this legendary American character, the garage tinkerer - whose time is always said to have dimmed a generation or two ago - is actually a kind of cyclical figure, typically showing up right around the time we've convinced ourselves that our moment in history has grown too sophisticated and complex for anything of importance to get invented in a garage or a dorm room. Hello, Mark Zuckerberg.
Q.
Was Benjamin Franklin America's founding amateur? 
A.
In almost any way that you can imagine, yes. We all grow up learning of the practical backyard inventor - the guy who fiddled his way into creating the energy-efficient Franklin stove, the lightning rod or even the earliest odometer so he could measure his carriage rides. But there are many other ways.
Q.
You write that "there's just something fundamentally American about heading off to one's garage to reinvent the world." Why? And is it really uniquely American?
A.
Back to Franklin: On a more Freudian level, he bolted his Boston apprenticeship in 1723 (the equivalent then of dropping out of college). He ran away, eventually, to Philadelphia to create a new version of himself. Some historians argue that the immigrant story retraces this plot line and that, ultimately, all Americans struggle in some way to recapitulate this essential Franklin narrative.
Q.
Why might we look back at this time in history as one of the golden ages of amateurism?
A.
My argument about the cycle of amateurism is that it often cranks back up when the economy goes sour and people drift off to that backyard temple of ingenuity. Hewlett-Packard was formed in David Packard's garage in 1938 at the height of the Depression. Is it a coincidence that Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak hid out in a Cupertino, Calif., garage during the dog days of Gerald Ford's "whip inflation now" economy in 1976 and improvised the first desktop computer? The April jobs report for 2012 saw an increase of 119,000 new employees. Only 4,000 of those derived from large firms. Small businesses and startups were responsible for 58,000 of those jobs. 
Q.
One theory of amateur success says that outsiders are not burdened with the "curse of knowledge." When is knowledge a curse?
A.
Expertise can elevate you to see new things or it can bury you beneath a mountain of conventional wisdom. Here's an example. When the modern Tyrannosaurus rex first stood up in 1910 at the American Museum of Natural History, the curators had to chisel the tail bones to bend them into the tail-dragging Godzilla-esque posture that every expert simply knew to be true. Several generations later, along came a self-taught paleontologist, Jack Horner. He looked at the fossil evidence and noticed that the ocular cavity in the brain suggested the Tyrannosaurus rex had poor eyesight, while the olfactory area revealed one of the most sensitive schnozes in evolutionary history. Its legs were built for walking, not running, and he probably moved like a bird - tail and head parallel to the ground. Various mass kills of singular species showed that the only bits of evidence of any other species present were the teeth of the Tyrannosaurus rex, suggesting he was there to scavenge on dead flesh. Almost overnight, the iconic predator of all paleontology and the Cretaceous Period's menacing beast of prey became a waddling buzzard. 
Q.
In astronomy, you note that NASA and other major organizations and universities are "the primary leaders" in exploration. So what do amateurs really offer in an established, well-financed field like that one? Are they just having fun or can they make substantial contributions?
A.
A few years ago a data download of a million Hubble images of new galaxies needed sorting - a decade-long project for an average astronomy department. But the Web site GalaxyZoo attracted some 150,000 amateurs who provided the necessary sifting - at one point categorizing some 70,000 images per hour - making multiple confirmations totaling some 50 million in the first year. In other cases, amateurs find and confirm supernovas and exoplanets. A great deal of astronomy is time-consuming scut work - almost impossible to do on the much sought-after massive telescopes on Chilean mountaintops; so armies of amateurs get to it.

HEADLINE: When a Spending Cut Can Be Like a Tax Increase

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: Spending cuts in programs that are means-tested can have a very similar effect to raising taxes, an economist writes, using Medicare proposals as an example. 

 BODY:
 
Sometimes Republicans and Democrats are like Coke and Pepsi: a lot more different in marketing than they are in substance.
Aging, changes in the health sector and the recession all serve to increase what the government spends on social welfare programs. Republicans and Democrats both acknowledge that some kind of adjustment is needed to bring the amount the government spends in line with the amount that it taxes.
Republicans are more apt to say that spending needs to be cut in order to match government revenues that are currently less than spending. Indeed, many of them have taken a "no new taxes" pledge. Democrats are more apt to consider raising revenue to help pay for the cost of social spending.
To the degree that Republicans propose to cut spending by means-testing programs that were formerly provided to all income groups, there may be little or no economic difference between Democratic and Republican proposals.

Take, as an example, Medicare, the health-insurance program administered by the federal government primarily for people 65 and older. It is a universal program, rather than an antipoverty program: all citizens can receive benefits from the program when they become old, regardless of how rich or poor they are.
To simplify the arithmetic, suppose the medical goods and services provided cost an average of $11,000 a year per beneficiary. The government could provide Medicare free of charge, in which case each beneficiary effectively receives $11,000 in premium assistance from the public treasury in order to pay for the cost of the program.
The premium assistance by itself tends to increase the government deficit in proportion to the size of the older population, because the government has to pay for the medical goods and services. One idea, close to some Republican thinking, is to reduce the deficit by cutting government spending by "means-testing": limiting the assistance to people who cannot afford to pay the premium themselves. 
For example, the premium assistance might be reduced 10 cents for every dollar of a beneficiary's income. (Medicare Part A is currently is a universal program. Medicare Parts B and D currently subsidize premiums for all beneficiaries, but to a greater degree for those with low incomes; in this regard Medicare is a means-tested premium assistance program.)
The universal and means-tested approaches are shown in blue and red, respectively. The horizontal axis shows annual income ranging from zero to $120,000 a year. The universal premium assistance approach is shown as a horizontal line, because all beneficiaries receive the same assistance regardless of income. The green means-tested schedule slopes down, because high income people receive less assistance than low-income people.
An alternative approach would be to keep the universal assistance but help pay for it with an additional 10 percent income tax on people 65 and older. A 10 percent income tax on incomes below $110,000 a year is shown in red in the chart. Democrats have proposed raising taxes on wealthier Americans to avoid deeper spending cuts, though none have called for a tax on the elderly, as in this hypothetical example. 
Under the income tax version, the net benefit to beneficiaries is the difference between the blue and the red lines in the chart, which coincides with the green means-tested proposal. 
Although the new tax and cut-by-means-test proposals sound different - the former proposal raises revenue without cutting spending while the latter proposal cuts spending without raising taxes - they are economically equivalent in these examples.
Both proposals cut net benefits (or raise net taxes) more for higher-income beneficiaries than for low-income beneficiaries. Putting more of the burden on higher-income beneficiaries is sometimes described as fair or equitable, but it also adds to the penalty for having a high income and, equivalently, subtracts from the burden of having a low income. That results in more people with low incomes, because incomes are determined in part by effort, which is affected by costs and benefits.
My point here is to advocate equity rather than incentives and to point out that both proposals -- tax increase and spending cut -- can increase equity and reduce incentives, in much the same ways.
Despite the economic similarities between the two approaches, I expect Republicans and Democrats to continue to differentiate their policies excessively, with Republicans arousing taxpayers over Democratic plans to raise taxes and Democrats alarming beneficiaries about imminent cuts in important social programs.

HEADLINE: Study Says Sundance Is a Publicity Machine, to the Tune of $69 Million

BYLINE: BROOKS BARNES


HIGHLIGHT: The festival drew 46,000 people to the mountains outside Salt Lake City, among them many members of the news media, who produced 35,224 print and online articles and 2,400 television reports. 

 BODY:
The Sundance Film Festival attracted 46,000 people to the mountains outside Salt Lake City this January, a 2 percent increase over the prior year, according to an economic impact report released Wednesday. 
The festival generated an overall economic impact of about $80 million for Utah, up from $70.8 million last year, and $62.7 million the year before, according to an annual Sundance study conducted by the Bureau of Economic and Business Research at the University of Utah. A slightly greater portion of attendees came from out of state or abroad, according to the study. 
Among the reasons that independent filmmakers covet a Sundance festival slot is the publicity the event generates, some of which invariably splashes onto the films that are shown there. 
This year, an increase in the number of TV outlets covering the festival sent worldwide media exposure soaring. According to the study, this year's festival generated $69 million in free media exposure (from 35,224 print and online articles and 2,400 television reports), up from $27 million the year before.

HEADLINE: Bosnia's 'Genocide Deniers' Challenged

BYLINE: HARVEY MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: A war crimes trial in The Hague will finally seek to assign responsibility for the bloody events of the Bosnian war. But will the case against Ratko Mladic end a polemic over the conflict and the intervention that helped to end it? 

 BODY:
LONDON - Whatever truth is revealed at the war crimes trial of General Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb military commander who went before an international court on Wednesday, it is unlikely to sway hard-core nationalists who still regard him as a hero.
They rioted when he was arrested a year ago and, even now, some inhabitants of the Serbian village where he was seized are said to want to rename it Mladicevo in his honor.
But will the evidence that comes out of the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal in The Hague at least put an end to a long-running polemic about the nature of the Bosnian war and the Western intervention that helped to end it?
Gen. Mladic is accused of being responsible for the worst atrocities in Europe since the end of World War II, including the massacre in 1995 of 7,000 Muslim men and boys in the town of Srebrenica.
"Srebrenica is one of the best-documented atrocities in modern history," the late Christopher Hitchens wrote at the time of Gen. Mladic's arrest a year ago. "The production of this material in court will, one hopes, wipe any potential grin from his face and destroy the propaganda image of the simple patriotic man at arms."
A debate still rages over whether all communities were equally guilty of fostering the Bosnian war or whether the Serbian nationalists, guided by Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president at the time, were uniquely culpable. 
Oliver Kamm, a British journalist, has written in The Jewish Chronicle that it was a "fatal misreading" to view the Balkan conflict as a "resurgence of ancient ethnic hatreds among Serbs, Croats and Muslims."
"Responsibility lay overwhelmingly with the Bosnian Serbs," he wrote. "Their leaders, Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, sought to carve out an ethnically pure territory in a deranged, racist scheme for a 'Greater Serbia.'"
Mladic trial begins. BBC rightly terms Milosevic the architect of Balkan wars of 1990s:bbc.co.uk/news/world-eur
- Oliver Kamm (@OliverKamm) May 16, 2012
The targets of Mr. Kamm's article were historical revisionists who had sought to play down the Serbs' crimes. "The facts of the genocidal assault on Bosnia's Muslims are so horrific that a cottage industry of denial has since grown up," he wrote.
He has not been alone in denouncing what he calls "genocide deniers." The late Mr. Hitchins sparred with Noam Chomsky over his claims that the radical American academic had ignored Muslim sufferings in Bosnia in his enthusiasm to support the Serbs.
Mr. Chomsky has argued that the West used human rights violations as a pretext for its interventions in the Balkans. He has also denied he is a Milosevic sympathizer. "He did all sorts of terrible things, but it wasn't a totalitarian state. I mean, there were elections, there was the opposition " he once told Serbian television.
Others have more directly challenged the extent of the events at Srebrenica. They include Edward S. Herman, an American economist who follows the Chomsky line on intervention.
"There has been a steady stream of inflated, sometimes ludicrously inflated, claims of target-inflicted deaths in the Yugoslav wars," said Mr. Herman, who edited the book "The Srebrenica Massacre.''
The debate has led to charge and counter-charge, and even a court case, about the accuracy of reports that emerged from the Bosnian war. 
So, will the outcome of the trial in The Hague put the polemic to rest? Or will ideological divisions over the legitimacy of military intervention trump the facts?

But as television begins to resemble the mobile business, Microsoft is in the lead with the Xbox, according to a new report out Wednesday from Forrester Research. The report, by the Forrester analyst James McQuivey, argues that there is a battle of technology platforms about to commence in the television market every bit as intense as the one in mobile, featuring Microsoft, Apple, Google and a small handful of other companies, possibly including Facebook and Amazon.
With the Xbox, Mr. McQuivey believes Microsoft is the farthest along in creating a meaningful audience of people watching online video through their television sets and holding that audience's attention for the longest amount of time. "Using those metrics, Microsoft is in the lead, offering everything that matters: a growing content library, a convenient engagement path for millions of existing Xbox 360 owners, and a growing ecosystem of partners and developers eager to exploit the platform for their own purposes," Mr. McQuivey wrote in the report.
"Platform" is one of the tech industry's favorite pieces of jargon, referring to technologies like Apple's iPhone and iPad, Microsoft's Windows and Google's Android that have created foundations for independent companies to build products -- everything from apps to carrying cases to personal computers. Microsoft has been adding more and more apps lately to the Xbox that allow people to watch streaming video from providers like Comcast Xfinity, Verizon FiOS and HBO. And of course, there are loads of games on disc and in downloadable form that run on the Xbox. too.
Forrester estimates that half of Xbox users in the United States have connected their devices to the Internet. Microsoft has shipped more than 66 million Xboxes worldwide.
Microsoft has not yet gone as far as Apple and Google have with their mobile platforms by creating an app store that is open to almost any developer with the right technical skills. In an interview, Mr. McQuivey said Microsoft should do exactly that if the company wants to stay ahead of more serious moves in the television market by Apple and Google. "If Microsoft understands what they're sitting on, they will open that platform," he said.

HEADLINE: Republican Lawmaker Questions Uproar Over JPMorgan Loss

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Representative Spencer Bachus of Alabama played down the event's significance for Wall Street and the broader economy, arguing that the loss will barely dent JPMorgan's bottom line. 

 BODY:
The $2 billion trading loss at JPMorgan Chase has led to worries about the bank's risk management, the danger of high-stakes trading by Wall Street and the shape of future financial regulation. 
But one prominent Republican lawmaker has posed a drastically different question: Why all the fuss?
On Wednesday, Representative Spencer Bachus of Alabama played down the event's significance for Wall Street and the broader economy. Mr. Bachus, speaking at a House Financial Services Committee hearing, argued that for now the loss will barely dent JPMorgan's bottom line. While the loss is expected to grow, he noted that the bank made $23 billion before taxes last year. 
"Even with this loss, I believe they're one of the most profitable financial institutions in the country," said Mr. Bachus, chairman of the committee. Mr. Bachus has said that the committee will hold a "serious" hearing on JPMorgan once lawmakers "do our homework" on what went wrong. 
The hearing on Wednesday was focused on new oversight of nonbank firms that pose a systemic risk to the economy. But with JPMorgan being the talk of Wall Street and Washington, the subject was unavoidable. 
Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican from West Virginia who led the hearing, raised a series of questions about what went wrong at JPMorgan, while other lawmakers largely steered clear of the topic du jour. 
Mr. Bachus, however, focused much of his remarks on the fallout from the JPMorgan debacle, questioning the wisdom of adopting new regulation in response the problem. Some lawmakers and reformers have championed tougher legislation in recent days, including the proposed Volcker Rule, an effort to ban banks from trading with their own money. 
"Because of the JPMorgan Chase situation, we are again hearing from some of our colleagues," he said, adding that they are pushing to "essentially prevent a business from losing money" or taking risks.
"No law can do that," he said. "It's an impossibility."
He further highlighted that, unlike the 2008 financial crisis, the trading loss was contained to JPMorgan and did not put taxpayer money at risk. 
"Unless the facts are diametrically different, there is no risk from this loss to depositors or to taxpayers," he said.

HEADLINE: In Michigan, Aiming to Set the Fuel-Economy Bar at 3,300 M.P.G.

BYLINE: RONALD AHRENS


HIGHLIGHT: A team from the University of Michigan will try to set a new record in the SAE International Supermileage Challenge next month. 

 BODY:
ANN ARBOR, Mich. - When a few engineering students here at the University of Michigan noticed that the 2012 SAE International Supermileage Challenge, scheduled for June 7 and 8, would be held an hour away from campus, they asked the obvious question: "Why aren't we involved?"
Led by Brett Merkel, who graduated from the university on April 28, a core group of 10 team members started work on a car and all aspects of a competitive program while trying to complete courses and degrees. Mr. Merkel was out of the country when Wheels visited the team's workshop on the university's north campus. Laura Pillari, the project manager, who also is a new graduate in mechanical engineering, explained that aside from the time constraints, they worked within a budget of "about 14 grand."
At last year's challenge, 27 teams from American and Canadian universities competed on the proving grounds (PDF) of the Eaton Corporation, fielding single-seat cars of superlightweight construction. Each entry in the challenge, which was founded in 1980, was powered by a single-cylinder engine donated by Briggs & Stratton. The team from the University of Sherbrooke, in Sherbrooke, Quebec, won in 2011, with an entry averaging 2,158 miles per gallon. Laval University, of Quebec City, set the record of 3,169 m.p.g. in 2008.
"The goal was to make it an educational, social and just kind of fun experience for engineers," Ms. Pillari, of Naperville, Ill., said in an interview at the team's shop. She and Mr. Merkel managed to channel their efforts on the Supermileage team into their senior projects. 
Parts for their unnamed competition entry - which features a carbon-fiber and acrylic body and is expected to weigh around 100 pounds, including the engine and running gear - are fashioned by hand or extensively revised from existing components. 
The effort to ready the car has been all-consuming. "Ever since class ended, it's just been nonstop," Ms. Pillari said. 
Vincent Glud of Livonia, Mich., a senior majoring in physics and the team's engine project leader, said he recently spent 12 hours at a milling machine and missed the last bus between the university's north and central campuses. He walked home in the dark. Aside from having metal splinters in the palms of his hands, Mr. Glud said he smelled "like cutting oil all the time" as a result of the project. 
To compete with the top programs, the team planned to modify its engine, which is permitted under the competition's rules. Ultimately the team opted not to use the fuel-injection system developed by Lihang Nong, a graduate student who founded the Supermileage team at the University of Ottawa as an undergraduate. With two patents pending, Mr. Nong's PicoSpray injection system appears to be a breakthrough. It incorporates a high-pressure fuel pump, pressure regulator and injector into a single unit, which he said was ideal for small engines. Eyeing production of the system, he sees numerous potential applications. 
"We believe that if we can achieve our target cost, nearly every small engine produced a few years from now will be fuel-injected - especially with new emissions standards coming into effect globally," he wrote in an e-mail. 
But instead of PicoSpray, a conventional carburetor will deliver the air-fuel mixture for combustion in the car's debut. "There's not a lot of precedent," Ms. Pillari said. "Every component is unusual. Even the experts, there's only so much they can tell us." 
The team intends to stringently limit the amount of iso-octane fuel in relation to air in the fuel mixture, a strategy not without repercussions. "It's going to run really, really lean and really hot," Mr. Glud said. But with only six laps around the 1.6-mile test course, engine life was not expected to be an issue, he said. 
Free to modify the cylinder head, the team purchased an aftermarket GY6 overhead-camshaft unit with four valves for improved airflow. The engine will run at about 2,000 r.p.m. with throttle inputs controlled exclusively by the engine-control computer, producing a road speed of 15 to 20 m.p.h. Ms. Pillari, who will drive, will concentrate on steering and braking. Using hypermiling techniques to maximize forward momentum, she will determine when to shut off the engine on downhill segments and restart it for uphill and level stretches. 
If the team meets its stated target of using just 11 milliliters from the standard-issue 250-milliliter fuel tank, it will achieve the hoped-for 3,300 m.p.g. and set a record. 
For all the team's calculations and innovations, the ultimate advantage could be Ms. Pillari. Rules call for a minimum driver weight of 130 pounds, but Ms. Pillari said she weighed 100 pounds "when I eat my vegetables." The team is consequently required to add 30 pounds of ballast. But if that weight is strategically positioned for a low center of gravity, cornering might be improved, which could save that last bit of precious momentum, giving Michigan the edge it seeks.

HEADLINE: Believing in Obama

BYLINE: CHARLES M. BLOW


HIGHLIGHT: The president's supporters have more confidence in their candidate's chances than Mitt Romney's have in him, but how much does this matter? 

 BODY:
You gotta have faith.
Democrats have it. Republicans don't. That is the finding of a USA Today/Gallup poll that was released on Tuesday.
The poll found that:
Fifty-six percent of Americans think Barack Obama will win the 2012 presidential election, compared with 36 percent who think Mitt Romney will win. Democrats are more likely to believe that Obama will win than Republicans are to believe Romney will. Independents are nearly twice as likely to think that Obama, rather than Romney, will prevail.
This comes at a time when voter preference between the two candidates is roughly even. It highlights the ever-present Republican anxiety and unease with the candidate they have. How skewed is this difference in confidence? The poll found that Republicans are twice as likely to believe that Obama will win than Democrats are likely to believe that Romney will win.
This no doubt has something to do with the power of the incumbency and Obama's still rather high likability numbers. But it's probably also because Republicans still don't love Romney. A different USA Today/Gallup poll, released on Monday, found that more than a third of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents still say that they are not satisfied with Romney as the nominee and would have preferred another candidate.
By contrast, 80 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said that they were happy with Obama.
This is utterly unsurprising. Romney is the most awkward, clumsy Republican nominee since Bob Dole in 1996. For the record, Gallup points out that "in an August 1996 poll, Americans overwhelmingly believed incumbent Bill Clinton (69 percent) would defeat Bob Dole (24 percent)." What's past is prologue.
Furthermore, a Washington Times/JZ Analytics poll released Sunday found a sizeable enthusiasm gap favoring the president. As the Washington Times reported:
Of those backing Mr. Obama, 64 percent said it is because they feel he deserves to be re-elected, while only 11 percent said they are trying to deny Mr. Romney the spot, another 11 percent said they are supporting the nominated Democrat, and 9 percent said the president is the "lesser of two evils."
For Romney, the news was not so good: 
Less than half of his backers said they are supporting him because they think he is the best candidate. Nearly 20 percent said they are voting to deny Mr. Obama another term, and an additional 19 percent said Mr. Romney is the "lesser of two evils." A final 10 percent said they are backing whomever the G.O.P. offered up.
Why does all this matter? Because, as Gallup points out, "Americans' predictions of the four prior presidential elections were also generally accurate." Rather surprisingly, "Americans are a bit more likely now to say Obama has a better chance of winning than they were at a similar point in 2008."
Now this certainly does not guarantee an Obama victory. Polls check present sentiments. They can't predict the future. The farther you are away from Election Day, the more time voters have to change their minds.
Also, believing that your candidate has the race in the bag can have a dulling effect on the importance of showing up to vote.
But these numbers do point to a real problem for Romney. Many of Obama's supporters are devout believers. Romney can't claim the same. And that imbalance tends to have a real effect on Election Day.

HEADLINE: How I Answered Michele Bachmann's Questionnaire

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: Q: Will President Obama's lack of leadership on foreign policy be a deciding factor in your vote this November? A: Just take out "lack of" and the answer is yes. 

 BODY:
The leader of the Tea Party caucus, Rep. Michele Bachmann, sent out an email blast to her "fellow conservatives" this morning urgently seeking their donations to her re-election campaign I mean soliciting their opinions on matters of great importance to the country in this election season.
I'm not part of the target demographic for her survey, but I decided to fill it out, anyway.
How would you describe your ideological views? If this were the 1980s and the Republican Party were still somewhere in sight of the American political mainstream, I'd say moderate. But the Tea Party folks think I'm a terrorist-coddling Marxist lunatic.Are you more in favor of the limited government message of the TEA Party or the continued influence of corrupt labor union bosses in government? No judgment implied here! I guess I'd rather have a corrupt labor boss helping working people, than a Tea Party member (corrupt or otherwise) hurting working people.President Obama has raised the federal debt limit SIX times in three years. It now sits at $15.4 Trillion. Do you believe this is responsible leadership? I need to rephrase the question. Congress passed a law that compels the President to ask for increases in the debt ceiling, usually twice a year, to pay interest on existing debts. Last summer, Congress used this law to hold budget negotiations hostage, and nearly drove the nation into default. Do you believe this is responsible leadership? Answer: No.It's been just over two years since the Democrats forced through Obamacare. Do you believe the government takeover has helped or harmed the American economy? Most of "Obamacare" has yet to take effect, and I'm not sure what you mean by government takeover. But yeah, I think it has helped.Is the repeal of Obamacare important to you? Repealing "Obamacare" would be a tragic abdication of Congressional responsibility.Next year the Bush-era tax cuts will come up for another vote. Do you support making these important middle class tax cuts permanent? I'm in favor of keeping tax rates low for the middle class. But you left out the tax cuts for really rich people, who don't need them. Let those expire.Should the next President and Congress reverse President Obama's decision to reject the Keystone XL Pipeline, which would increase America's energy resources? If the Keystone project actually increased America's energy resources, maybe it would be a good idea. But most of the oil will end up in China.Do you support tapping into America's emergency oil reserve as a means of lowering gas prices? I support not pretending that the president is responsible for oil prices.Do you support Cap-and-Trade legislation, which necessarily drives energy costs to the benefit of alternative energy companies like Solyndra? Not any law that specifically mentions Solyndra, but the actual cap-and-trade legislation? Yes.Should Iran be permitted to acquire a nuclear weapon? Of course not, but what exactly do you plan to do about it? Invade Iran?Do you support the nation of Israel as one of America's strongest allies in the War on Terror? I don't support the war on terror, but I do support Israel, and so does pretty much everyone in the United States government, including President Obama.Will President Obama's lack of leadership on foreign policy be a deciding factor in your vote this November? Just take out "lack of" and the answer is yes.Do you agree that defunding Planned Parenthood should be a focal point of the GOP's campaign strategy this November? Yes, please. Attack women's health care as often as you like. Invite Rush Limbaugh to speak at the convention and call people sluts.The Obama Justice Department recently said they would no longer defend the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in court. Do you support their decision? I think the government should waste tons of money and squander important legal resources to defend an unconstitutional and punitive law. There's nothing more important to do. Not even cracking down on drug trafficking, terrorism, sex trafficking, Internet piracy, civil rights violations or organized crime. Those are so minor compared to DOMA.

This blog post has been revised to reflect the following correction:
Correction: May 16, 2012
This post originally stated that most of oil from the Keystone project would end up in China. After passing through refineries on the Gulf Coast, most of it would end up overseas, but not necessarily in China.

HEADLINE: Worries Over Greece Trump Encouraging Signs

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks closed lower in a choppy session on Wednesday, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index posting its fourth straight decline as investors worried about Greece's future as a member of the euro zone.
Early gains on Wall Street were erased after the European Central Bank said it had stopped providing liquidity to some Greek banks that had not been recapitalized. The central bank's move caused some market confusion, adding to volatility, because traders quickly react when it comes to news about Greece. 
Investors were not enticed by the minutes from the Federal Reserve's most recent meeting, at which policy makers kept alive the possibility of a fresh round of monetary stimulus for the moderately expanding economy.
''All eyes continue to be trained on Europe -- what is going to happen in Greece, what the potential fallout from that is going to be -- so there wasn't much from the Fed data to impact things,'' said Stephen Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Morgan in San Francisco.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 33.45 points, or 0.26 percent, to 12,598.55. The S.& P. 500 dropped 5.86 points, or 0.44 percent, to 1,324.80. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 19.72 points, or 0.68 percent, to 2,874.04.
Worries about Greece's political and financial future, with political upheaval in the broader euro zone, have driven equity losses in recent weeks, sending the S.& P. 500 down 5.9 percent since the end of March.
Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany tried to assuage investors' fears by saying Greece would stay in the euro zone. Ms. Merkel's comments helped stem selling before the market's opening.
Opinion polls in Greece showed leftists who are opposed to the terms of the international bailout for the country would most likely win an election, set for June 17.
On Wednesday, a day after J. C. Penney scrapped its dividend, its shares plunged 19.7 percent, to $26.75, the company's biggest one-day percentage drop since at least 1973.
Penney's financial results showed the effort to remake itself as an affordable, fashion-oriented retail chain took a much bigger than expected toll on sales in the first quarter.
The government reported Wednesday that industrial production rose in April at its fastest pace in more than a year. A separate report showed a rebound in groundbreaking for United States homes in April, suggesting the housing market recovery was gaining.
Domestic data continues to show a modest expansion, leading some analysts to believe the market could be primed for a strong rally if a solution in Greece is reached.
''We have some basic good news here in the U.S., but we have a cloud over the land, and that is the Greek cloud, and until that situation is finalized, I don't think it is going to be possible for the rally to lift,'' said Carol Pepper, chief executive of Pepper International in New York.
''But when it is finalized, then you are going to see an explosion on the upside because one way or the other this Greek situation is going to be concluded,'' Ms. Pepper said.
Shares of General Electric gained 3.3 percent, to $19, on news that its finance arm, GE Capital, won regulatory approval to resume returning some of its profit to the parent company.
Such a move could clear the way for General Electric to accelerate stock buybacks and raise its shareholder dividend. GE Capital plans to pay a special $4.5 billion dividend to General Electric later this year.
Shares of Target edged up 0.4 percent, to $55.32, after the retailer raised its full-year profit outlook.
In the bond market, the price of the 10-year Treasury note rose 4/32, to 99 30/32, while its yield fell to 1.76 percent, from 1.77 percent.

HEADLINE: A Co-Founder's Reflections

BYLINE: By QUENTIN HARDY; David Kocieniewski contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Eduardo Saverin can escape the United States, but he cannot slip Facebook.
''Everything I do in my personal life, in my professional life, it's completely there,'' said Mr. Saverin, a Facebook co-founder, in his first major interview. ''A lot of what I do, what everyone does, is influenced by it.''
Alone among Facebook's 900 million users, Mr. Saverin is special: a billionaire with only the vaguest of causes. 
He co-founded Facebook at age 21, then left two years later with a legal settlement that cut him off from Facebook but left him phenomenally wealthy. His stake will most likely be worth more than $3 billion when Facebook goes public Friday.
Reports last week that Mr. Saverin, 30 and born in Brazil, had renounced the American citizenship he gained as a teenager led to considerable criticism that he was skipping out to avoid taxes. He has become a permanent resident of Singapore, which levies no capital gains taxes. Mr. Saverin said he was misunderstood. He first filed to give up American citizenship in January 2011. It became official last September, and the government published the news at the end of April as part of a routine filing.
Coming on the eve of the Facebook I.P.O., the news brought into sharp focus Mr. Saverin's tax savings, which could easily exceed $100 million.
''I'm not a tax expert,'' he said. ''We complied with all the known laws. There was an exit tax.'' That tax is based on the assets held by a citizen leaving America. The exit tax was intended to make sure the departing wealthy paid something before they decamped.
He professes ignorance about his taxes and refuses to discuss his finances. ''This had nothing to do with taxes,'' he insisted. ''I was born in Brazil, I was an American citizen for about 10 years. I thought of myself as a global citizen.''
American tax lawyers say they think Mr. Saverin's exit had more to do with estate and gift taxes than income tax. If he remained an American citizen, he would not have had to pay the United States capital gains tax on his income until he sold his shares. Wealthy American shareholders often borrow against their shares and live tax-free off the unrealized appreciation for years.
When American citizens pass on their holdings to their heirs, however, those assets are subject to estate taxes, which are difficult to escape (as are gift taxes on assets given to relatives and heirs before death). So Mr. Saverin's decision to leave could have been a wager that the cost of an exit tax now -- 15 percent of whatever valuation he could get the Internal Revenue Service to agree to -- would be far less than the 35 percent or more in estate tax his heirs would face on his holdings when he died.
Two of Mr. Saverin's Facebook co-founders, Mark Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz, dropped out of Harvard to work on Facebook. A third, Chris Hughes, graduated from Harvard in 2006, and then worked at Facebook before leaving in 2007 to run social media for Barack Obama's presidential campaign. Mr. Saverin received a degree in economics from Harvard in 2006, and in 2009 settled in Singapore while on a world tour with his freshman-year Harvard roommate, Andrew Solimine.
Today Mr. Zuckerberg runs Facebook. Mr. Moskovitz, who left Facebook in 2008, has a start-up called Asana, which makes corporate management software, based on software he designed at Facebook. Mr. Hughes has purchased and runs The New Republic magazine. Of all the founders, Mr. Saverin has had perhaps the greatest difficulty figuring out how to build on what is likely a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Mr. Saverin said that becoming a Singapore resident enabled him to engage in more sophisticated financial activities within that country. He said it also placed him squarely at the nexus of China, Indonesia and India, three of the world's largest populations, where the effects of social networking are just being felt.
What has gotten attention, though, is his billionaire playboy lifestyle in glittering Singapore. Thanks to the interconnected world Mr. Saverin helped to create, the Internet is full of people sharing photos and stories of him embraced by statuesque women and drinking expensive Champagne. ''It's a misperception, especially the playboy,'' he said. ''I do have a Bentley. I do go out. I'd rather not go into personal details.''
''I'm clearly very busy,'' he said, with ''friends, family, existing investments.'' To date, his major investments have been in American companies that he thinks will have a global impact in a Facebook-connected world. One, Jumio, makes products for merchants to accept payments over a mobile phone. Another, ShopSavvy, offers discounted deals in brick-and-mortar stores via smartphones. He has helped finance a few other American and Singaporean companies, but his investments in start-ups amount to less than 1 percent of what he will soon be worth.
He also said the depiction of him in the movie ''The Social Network'' was distorted. ''It was more art than documentary,'' he said. As to his purported betrayal by Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook, the dramatic core of the movie, Mr. Saverin said: ''There was no burning there. Mark is a phenomenal guy.''
More than anything, he said, he would like to get his head around his wealth. (He planned to quietly watch Facebook go public Friday -- which will be the middle of the night in Singapore -- with just a few friends around, he said).
And, he said, he would like to inspire young entrepreneurs to embrace the Facebook world, ''where people are at the center of everything.''
''People look at my profile and say, 'You can have all the options,' '' he said. ''But really, everyone does.''
As for himself, good advice for the single young billionaire is harder to find. He said he had spoken with a number of people with tremendous wealth, ''but every experience is unique. Certainly there has been no one who was a college kid, and got it this fast.''
''What does this enable me to do? What am I provided with to help?'' he asked. ''Right now, I don't know how to deploy the capital and the blessings.''

HEADLINE: Minneapolis Tussles Over a Faded Plaza

BYLINE: By KATHRYN SHATTUCK

 BODY:
In 1975 a two-acre outdoor public space called Peavey Plaza opened in downtown Minneapolis, offering city dwellers an ''urban oasis'' at a time when many Americans were re-embracing city life, its designer, M. Paul Friedberg, said in a recent interview. Using a 10-foot depression created during construction of the adjacent Orchestra Hall, Mr. Friedberg, a Modernist landscape architect based in New York, built a terraced amphitheaterlike space and a drainable reflecting pool that could be used as a stage in summer and a skating rink in winter. Waterfalls absorbed noise; garden rooms offered intimacy and softened concrete edges. In 1999 the American Society of Landscape Architects recognized the plaza as one of the nation's most significant examples of landscape architecture, along with Central Park in Manhattan and the Biltmore estate in North Carolina. 
But things have changed. These days two of the plaza's three fountains no longer work, their pumps and lines not easily replaceable. Concrete is stained and crumbling, exposing rebar. The reflecting pool is dry more often than not. And those intimate spaces are occasionally put to unsavory uses. Peavey Plaza's time may be up. Even as preservationists argue for rehabilitation of what they consider the finest surviving example of Mr. Friedberg's work, the City of Minneapolis, which owns 75 percent of it, has commissioned a significant redesign of the space. The plaza has become another battleground in the wars being fought around the country between preservationists determined to save what they see as underappreciated Modernist designs and cities and developers pushing to move on.
On Thursday the city's public works department will appeal the Minneapolis Heritage Preservation Commission's recent denial of a demolition permit, and if the permit is approved, the issue will be voted on by the City Council on May 25. Fund-raising has begun for a new design by Tom Oslund of Oslund and Associates, a Minneapolis firm, which is expected to cost between $8 million and $10 million, with $2 million provided by state bond funds.
''Even though Peavey Plaza is not a city landmark, the commission is considering it to be an historic resource worthy of further study and possible designation,'' said Chad M. Larsen, chairman of the preservation commission.
Whatever it may once have been, the plaza ''is not a beautiful space now,'' said Gwen Pappas, the director of public relations for the Minnesota Orchestra, which owns 25 percent of it and has used the planned $50 million remodeling of its 1974 building to generate momentum for remaking the plaza. ''The concern was if the hall was to get a shiny, new refurbishment and Peavey was left in its current state of disrepair, the discrepancy between the two would be even greater,'' she said.
In addition, the city points out that Peavey Plaza meets neither Americans With Disabilities Act accessibility requirements nor sustainable water-use standards, and that it lacks the electrical supplies necessary for outdoor events. Mr. Oslund's design addresses those issues and also creates a more open space, sunken less deeply below street level.
Supporters of rehabilitating Mr. Friedberg's design say the city has not met its legal obligation to prove ''that there are no reasonable alternatives to the demolition'' as required by the code of ordinances on historic resources.
In June a group of people recruited to give feedback on proposed changes to the plaza was shown four concepts with preliminary budgets, said Erin Hanafin Berg, a member of the group and a field representative for the Preservation Alliance of Minnesota, which supports saving Mr. Friedberg's design. In July the group was told that the city would move forward with developing two of those concepts, both by Mr. Oslund: a new scheme and one that adapted the original design.
But at an October meeting, ''it was a rude shock when only the new, reconfigured scheme was on the table, and we were told that the restorative scheme was unfundable,'' Ms. Berg wrote in an e-mail. In its demolition application, the city maintained that no feasible alternative was available because of the scope of construction and because funders would not contribute millions of dollars to restore the original design.
''There have been some conversations'' with potential funders, said Charles T. Lutz, deputy director of the city's Community Planning and Economic Development Department. They believe Mr. Oslund's design ''better reflects what is needed on the plaza today,'' he added.
Mr. Friedberg had originally been on Mr. Oslund's team; in an e-mail, Mr. Oslund said he removed Mr. Friedberg after he made it clear that he thought the plaza should not change.
Mr. Friedberg, who has recently come up with a set of design additions to Peavey Plaza that he believes would bring the space ''into the 21st century,'' said he would be open to more extreme change ''if I thought what was being created advanced the idea of landscape architecture and urban culture.'' Mr. Oslund's design, in his opinion, ''is not a significant view in that direction.''

HEADLINE: Whites Account For Under Half Of Births In U.S.

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- After years of speculation, estimates and projections, the Census Bureau has made it official: White births are no longer a majority in the United States.
Non-Hispanic whites accounted for 49.6 percent of all births in the 12-month period that ended last July, according to Census Bureau data made public on Thursday, while minorities -- including Hispanics, blacks, Asians and those of mixed race -- reached 50.4 percent, representing a majority for the first time in the country's history.
Such a turn has been long expected, but no one was certain when the moment would arrive -- signaling a milestone for a nation whose government was founded by white Europeans and has wrestled mightily with issues of race, from the days of slavery, through a civil war, bitter civil rights battles and, most recently, highly charged debates over efforts to restrict immigration. 
While over all, whites will remain a majority for some time, the fact that a younger generation is being born in which minorities are the majority has broad implications for the country's economy, its political life and its identity. ''This is an important tipping point,'' said William H. Frey, the senior demographer at the Brookings Institution, describing the shift as a ''transformation from a mostly white baby boomer culture to the more globalized multiethnic country that we are becoming.''
Signs that the country is evolving this way start with the Oval Office, and have swept hundreds of counties in recent years, with 348 in which whites are no longer in the majority. That number doubles when it comes to the toddler population, Mr. Frey said. Whites are no longer the majority in four states and the District of Colum-bia, and have slipped below half in many major metro areas, including New York, Las Vegas and Memphis.
A more diverse young population forms the basis of a generational divide with the country's elderly, a group that is largely white and grew up in a world that was too.
The contrast raises important policy questions. The United States has a spotty record educating minority youth; will older Americans balk at paying to educate a younger generation that looks less like themselves? And while the increasingly diverse young population is a potential engine of growth, will it become a burden if it is not properly educated?
''The question is, how do we reimagine the social contract when the generations don't look like one another?'' said Marcelo Suarez-Orozco, co-director of Immigration studies at New York University.
The trend toward greater minority births has been building for years, the result of the large wave of immigration here over the past three decades. Hispanics make up the majority of immigrants, and they tend to be younger -- and to have more children -- than non-Hispanic whites. (Of the total births in the year that ended last July, about 26 percent were Hispanic, about 15 percent black, and about 4 percent Asian.)
Whites still represent the single largest share of all births, at 49.6 percent, and are an overwhelming majority in the population as a whole, at 63.4 percent. But they are aging, causing a tectonic shift in American demographics. The median age for non-Hispanic whites is 42 -- meaning the bulk of women are moving out of their prime childbearing years.
Latinos, on the other hand, are squarely within their peak fertility, with a median age of 27, said Jeffrey Passel, senior demographer at the Pew Hispanic Center. Between 2000 and 2010, there were more Hispanic births in the United States than there were arriving Hispanic immigrants, he said.
The result is striking: Minorities accounted for 92 percent of the nation's population growth in the decade that ended in 2010, Mr. Frey calculated, a surge that has created a very different looking America from the one of the 1950s, when the TV characters Ozzie and Harriet were a national archetype.
The change is playing out across states with large differences in ethnic and racial makeup between the elderly and the young. Some of the largest gaps are in Arizona, Nevada, Texas and California, states that have had flare-ups over immigration, school textbooks and priorities in spending. The nonrural county with the largest gap is Yuma County, Ariz., where just 18 percent of people under 20 are white, compared with 73 percent of people over 65, Mr. Frey said.
Perhaps the most urgent aspect of the change is education. A college degree has become the most important building block of success in today's economy, but blacks and Latinos lag far behind whites in getting one. According to Mr. Frey, just 13 percent of Hispanics and 18 percent of blacks have a college degree, compared with 31 percent of whites.
Those stark statistics are made more troubling by the fact that young Americans will soon be faced with caring for the bulging population of baby boomers as they age into retirement, said William O'Hare, a senior consultant to the Annie E. Casey Foundation in Baltimore, on top of inheriting trillions of dollars of government debt.
''The forces coming together here are very clear, but I don't see our political leaders putting them together in any coherent way,'' he said, adding that educating young minorities was of critical importance to the future of the country and the economy.
Immigrants took several generations to assimilate through education in the last large wave of immigration at the turn of the 20th century, Mr. Suarez-Orozco said, but mobility was less dependent on education then, and Americans today cannot afford to wait, as they struggle to compete with countries like China.
''This is a polite knock on the door to tell us to get ready,'' said Ruy Teixeira, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. ''We do a pretty lousy job of educating the younger generation of minorities. Basically, we are not ready for this.''
But there are bright spots. Arturo Vargas, executive director of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, said the immigration debate of recent years has raised the political consciousness of young Latinos and he is hopeful that more will become politically active as a result. Only half of eligible Latino voters cast ballots in 2008, he said, compared with 65 percent of eligible non-Hispanic voters. ''We have an opportunity here with this current generation,'' Mr. Vargas said. About 50,000 Latinos turn 18 every month, he said.
And the fact that the country is getting a burst of births from nonwhites is a huge advantage, argues Dowell Myers, professor of policy, planning and demography at the University of Southern California. European societies with low levels of immigration now have young populations that are too small to support larger aging ones, exacerbating problems with the economy.
''If the U.S. depended on white births alone, we'd be dead,'' Mr. Myers said. ''Without the contributions from all these other groups, we would become too top-heavy with old people.''

HEADLINE: Access to Dignified Work

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''The Human Disaster of Unemployment,'' by Dean Baker and Kevin Hassett (Sunday Review, May 13): 
The human costs of unemployment are dramatic, exacting a heavy toll from people and communities. The call for shared sacrifice, reflected in the German example, underscores a point that is often left out of the unemployment debate, but implied in this article: Ensuring that all who want and need to work have access to dignified employment is a community responsibility.
While job sharing represents a good start, this crisis calls for a more concerted investment in people. There is more than enough work to be done in our communities. What is needed now is a transformative commitment to creating work through expanded training and education for growing fields, public works projects, incentives for companies that hire and train the unemployed, and extensive and accessible support for the unemployed.
It is time to put aside partisan politics and come together as a community to create a society in which dignified work is a human birthright.

HEADLINE: Spending Spurs Economy Beyond Expectations in Japan

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Japan's economy grew a robust 1 percent in the first three months of 2012 from the previous quarter, helped by heavy government spending after last year's devastating tsunami and an uptick in consumer spending. 
Numbers released by the Cabinet Office on Thursday showed that the world's third-largest economy expanded at an annualized rate of 4.1 percent from January to March, a faster clip than economists had forecast. Growth for the previous quarter was revised up to 0.1 percent.
The strong showing was the third consecutive quarter of growth for Japan and eclipsed the annualized 2.2 percent growth posted by the United States for the first quarter.
Growth was largely driven by the public sector. Government spending rose 5.4 percent as Tokyo continued to channel funds into reconstruction projects. Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda has pledged to spend more than 20 trillion yen to help rebuild areas devastated by Japan's earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis last year.
Consumer spending, which makes up more than half of Japan's gross domestic product, gained 1.1 percent, buoyed by government subsidies for fuel-efficient cars.
A weaker yen and recovering overseas demand also pushed exports higher, though corporate capital spending fell 3.9 percent.
Economists said growth would likely slow as post-tsunami reconstruction winds down. And subsidies on green cars could expire later this year.
Possible energy shortages caused by Japan's temporary nuclear shutdown could also crimp growth this summer.
And Japan will remain at the mercy of the global economy, said Ryutaro Kono, chief economist for Japan at BNP Paribas.
''Our baseline scenario for the economy has a modest cyclical recovery continuing,'' Mr. Kono wrote in a note to clients. ''But the pace of the global economy has been feeble of late.''
He added: ''There is also a risk that turmoil in Europe could be reignited by the outcome of parliamentary elections in Greece. If that were to happen, there is a chance that the global economy could be pulled down into recession in the latter half of 2012.''

HEADLINE: Relax, It Could Be Worse

BYLINE: By KJ DELL'ANTONIA

 BODY:
The academics Chris Herbst and John Ifcher are challenging collective wisdom: parents, they say, really are happier than their non-parent counterparts.
Mr. Herbst and Mr. Ifcher set out to assess the body of research that led to the generally accepted ''parental happiness gap,'' that is, the repeated findings showing that parents experience more depression and anxiety and are less happy in general (and in their marriages) than non-parents are. What they found suggests that the balance of happiness is shifting. Parents' happiness has held steady, while the absolute happiness of non-parents dropped from 1972 to 2008. 
Why? Other research suggests that a decline in community and political involvement, a sense of disconnect from family and friends and a feeling of economic insecurity reduce people's reported sense of well-being. But as Mr. Herbst and Mr. Ifcher write, parents ''have been relatively immune to those changes.'' Instead, parents ''have become relatively more likely to visit friends, to get the news every day and to remain engaged in politics,'' and even to ''agree that 'family income is high enough to satisfy nearly all important desires.' ''
''Happy'' is the ultimate in subjective standards: you're only as happy as you say you are. Do children (as Mr. Herbst suggested in an e-mail) ''inoculate parents from many social, cultural, and economic changes that have conspired to reduce most Americans' happiness''? Economists and social scientists will surely continue to work on that one. But at least those of us with children can be happy with this round. The parents are all right. KJ DELL'ANTONIA

HEADLINE: A New Game Delights In Difficulty

BYLINE: By CHRIS SUELLENTROP

 BODY:
Video games weren't always so easy. Players who know only the current generation of consoles must think of their favorite games as gentle, kindhearted, almost mothering in their ministrations -- adapting themselves to the needs of the gamer, serving up big shiny arrows or straightforward explanatory text when things get confusing, and just generally showering kisses and encouragement every time someone skins a knee.
Not all that long ago games were exacting, punishing, cruel. For more than a decade the economics of the arcade age -- kill a player, get a quarter -- influenced the spirit of the first games that were designed to be played at home, on televisions, even though they were sold for one fixed, all-you-can-play price. Three lives and you're out. Quickly.
In a creative version of Stockholm syndrome, now that the generation that grew up playing these games is making games of its own, difficulty is seeing a resurgence, especially among indie games: those built by small teams, or even individuals, at independent developers that work outside of the industry's studio system and its multimillion-dollar budgets. Many of these games make a fetish of how impossible they are. And Fez, a brilliant, intricate new game created by a two-person team in Montreal, might be the most impenetrable of them all. 
In ''Indie Game: The Movie,'' a documentary that opens on Friday in New York, Phil Fish, the game's designer (he worked with Renaud Bedard, the game's sole programmer), says his first video-game memories are of playing Super Mario Bros., the Legend of Zelda and Tetris. Fez, his tribute to 1980s gaming, is lovingly, almost excessively, devoted to the golden age of Nintendo, from its chunky, lo-fi art style to its numerous homages to those three titans of Mr. Fish's youth.
Fez took Mr. Fish and Mr. Bedard five years to build. A prototype won an award for visual excellence from the Independent Games Festival -- in 2008. Finally -- news that broke too late for the documentarians who chronicled Mr. Fish's failure to meet numerous development milestones -- Fez became available on the Xbox downloadable games marketplace, for about $10, last month.
Mr. Fish is a Quentin Tarantino of 8-bit gaming, prodigiously quoting from the pop culture of his childhood (in this case, the Nintendo Entertainment System, rather than blaxploitation films). The oddly shaped blocks from Tetris can be seen everywhere in Fez: on the walls, on the ground, on signposts, scrawled on chalkboards, even in the constellations in the sky. Gomez, Fez's protagonist, beams with joy, adorably, when he finds an important item in a treasure chest, much like Link, the hero of Zelda. But it is to Super Mario Bros. that Fez owes its greatest debts. For starters, there are mushroom levels, moving platforms on rails and an underground world that Gomez reaches by descending through a well that looks very much like a pipe.
Somehow all of this feels inventive rather than derivative. Initially, Fez appears to be about Gomez's discovery that his two-dimensional universe is actually three-dimensional, as he uses his fez -- thus the title -- to reveal that squares are in fact cubes. The gameplay is always side-scrolling in two dimensions, but Gomez can rotate his cube-universe so that he traverses different planes -- the flat surfaces of the same cube -- to make his leaping less difficult. This Escher-like manipulation of the universe is not all that confusing on the screen, nor is it typically challenging. When Gomez falls to his death, the game generously places him on the most recent platform he stood on, rather than returning him to the start of a level or a checkpoint.
Fez's difficulty -- its status as a ''Finnegans Wake'' of video games -- does not come from Gomez's ostensible quest, which is to collect 32 golden cubes for some blah-blah-save-the-universe reason. Finding the cubes is sort of a ruse on Mr. Fish's behalf to get you to check out every corner of his densely constructed universe so you will begin to want to unspool the complex game that is layered atop Gomez's childlike adventure.
There are owls that utter cryptic messages and artifacts that help unlock codes for counting and lettering. Another code in the game uses symbols to convey commands that a player is supposed to enter on the game pad. Sometimes QR codes (those images read by a smartphone) appear, and when scanned they provide instructions. One set of puzzles can be cracked by sensing the vibrations the game sends to the controller, and others involve knowing -- largely on the basis of a single image in a single room out of score upon scores of such places -- that a certain code must be rotated 90 degrees before it is translated. A quick brown fox literally jumps over a lazy dog. There is, of course, a monolith.
This aspect of the game can't begin to be deciphered without taking handwritten notes to interpret the ''patterns everywhere'' that are promised, and quickly Fez makes the player feel like John Nash as portrayed by Russell Crowe in ''A Beautiful Mind,'' pasting scraps of text on a wall in a fruitless effort at unlocking a deeper mystery. (There is a ''Fez notes'' Tumblr, where players upload their scribbles for posterity.)
Yet every time diminishing returns to this cryptography began to set in, Fez would offer a new carrot pellet, revealing a fresh, alluring discovery. This sort of thing never ends well. At some point, as is always the case with such fiction -- remember ''Lost''? -- it ends, and you ask yourself: Really, is that all that was?
The most retro thing about Fez -- and one of Mr. Fish's ambitions for the game, he suggests in ''Indie Game: The Movie'' -- is how it has convened a community of players on sites like GameFAQs who share insights and crowdsource the particularly nettlesome puzzles. I could never have completed 212.5 percent of Fez -- not 100, it's that kind of impishly infuriating and entrancing game -- without some help from the online resources put together by these people, the 21st-century version of the classmate at recess who told you how to beat King Hippo in Mike Tyson's Punch-Out, or theorized that you should finish Metroid three times to confirm that Samus Aran is a woman. The best of these digital assistants won't tell you exactly what to do, but will point you in the right direction.
Just don't read too much. For the mystery is the pleasure of Fez's hidden codes and ciphers that promise a deeper revelation. The game cannot hope to deliver a meaning-of-life stunner that would be required for all those puzzling hours to be rewarding, except as time spent on an enjoyable task for its own sake. The question really is the answer.
One mystery lingers. Even the Internet and its collective wisdom has not been able to explain the meaning of Fez's monolith. And it's probably not worth spending any more time on it. While wandering through the game, I stopped to transliterate some markings on a signpost. What was I about to learn? What piece of this captivating jigsaw would be revealed? ''Be sure to drink your Ovaltine''?
No, worse: ''Trapped in a Fez factory,'' read the laborious fruits of my labor. ''Please send help.''

HEADLINE: Target Shines, but Forecasts Are Dim for 2 Other Retailers

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Several major retailers posted quarterly results that met or beat analysts' forecasts on Wednesday, but their share prices posted mixed results on uncertain outlooks for the rest of the year. 
Target and Limited Brands topped forecasts while Staples matched forecasts.
Target raised its annual earnings forecast after posting a larger-than-expected rise in quarterly profit, even as it spends more on plans to open stores in Canada and has concerns about consumer spending in the United States.
The discount chain expects economic uncertainty to continue for the rest of 2012, the chief executive, Gregg W. Steinhafel, said on Wednesday.
''Consumers are not buying more at Target. What's driving their sales is maybe people are shopping a bit more often,'' said Brian Sozzi, chief equities analyst at NBG Productions. ''It's not like people are going in and loading up their baskets as much as they were a couple of years ago.''
Some of the first-quarter strength came from an early Easter and warmer weather, which spurred sales of clothing and other items. Apparel had its best quarterly performance since 2006.
Target said it earned $697 million, or $1.04 a share, up from $689 million, or 99 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding the Canada costs, the company earned $1.03 a share, topping analysts' average forecast of $1.01, according to Thomson Reuters.
Sales in the period, which ended April 28, rose 6.1 percent, to $16.54 billion. Total revenue, including credit card revenue, rose 5.9 percent, to $16.87 billion.
Stock in Target, which is based in Minneapolis, rose 24 cents, to $55.32 a share.
Limited Brands, parent of the Victoria's Secret lingerie stores, posted a quarterly profit that topped Wall Street's estimate but its shares fell more than 3.5 percent in after-hours trading after its forecast for the current quarter fell short of analysts' expectations.
The company, based in Columbus, Ohio, forecast second-quarter earnings of 40 cents to 45 cents a share, below analysts' average forecast for earnings of 50 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters.
The company, which also operates the Bath & Body Works and La Senza chains as well as the luxury retailer Henri Bendel, reported a first-quarter net profit of $124.6 million, or 41 cents a share. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected the company, on average, to earn 40 cents a share in latest quarter.
Net sales slipped to $2.15 billion from $2.22 billion in the first quarter a year ago, which included $214 million in sales from the company's third-party apparel sourcing business, a unit that was sold in November.
Same-store sales increased 7 percent in the first quarter, which ended April 28.
Shares of Limited Brands fell to $47.96, down 0.18 percent.
Staples, the office supply chain, said first-quarter net income fell to $187.1 million, or 27 cents a share, from $198.2 million, or 28 cents a share, a year earlier.
Excluding one-time items, the company earned 30 cents a share, meeting analysts' expectations, according to Thomson Reuters.
Sales fell to $6.10 billion from $6.17 billion, and missed analysts' expectations of $6.18 billion. Stock in Staples, which is based in Framingham, Mass., fell 84 cents, or 6 percent, to $13.91 a share.

HEADLINE: As Plavix Patent Dies, So Does Promotion

BYLINE: By KATIE THOMAS

 BODY:
For more than a decade, cardiologists treating patients who have had a heart attack have routinely scribbled one drug onto their prescription pads: clopidogrel bisulfate, better known as Plavix.
''It's a mainstay,'' said Dr. Steven Nissen, chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic. Before Plavix arrived in 1997, aspirin was the standard treatment for preventing blood clots that led to heart attacks and stroke. Combining aspirin with Plavix, though, ''tremendously improved'' the results, Dr. Nissen said.
But now, in a farewell that has been years in the making, the story of Plavix is coming to an end. The drug is set to lose its patent protection on Thursday. Faced with an expected influx of cheaper generic alternatives, Bristol-Myers Squibb, which sells Plavix in the United States under a partnership with Sanofi-Aventis, has said it no longer plans to actively promote the drug. 
''This is one of the behemoth drugs that really defined the drug industry in the '90s,'' said Catherine J. Arnold, an analyst for Credit Suisse.
Bristol-Myers is hardly the only company to face the loss of a best-selling drug: at least 19 are set to lose patent protection this year, which is expected to cost the pharmaceutical industry about $38.5 billion in lost sales, according to an analysis by Barclay's. About 80 percent of the prescriptions written in the United States are now filled with generic drugs.
The loss of the company's top product is sure to sting. Plavix brought in $7.1 billion in net sales in 2011, accounting for a third of revenue for the year, according to Bristol-Myers filings. In the 15 years since it entered the market, Plavix generated $42.8 billion in sales for Bristol-Myers, according to IMS Health, a health care services company. It is the biggest name-brand drug to lose patent protection since Lipitor, made by Pfizer, encountered generic competition late last year.
With the loss of patent protection for Plavix and Lipitor coming in such quick succession, ''this year is a year that pharmaceutical insiders refer to as 'pharmageddon,' '' Dr. Nissen said.
But while Pfizer moved to retain its market share of Lipitor for as long as possible -- by selling its own authorized generic version and negotiating aggressive deals with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers to match or beat the price of generic alternatives -- Bristol-Myers has said it has no plans to hold onto Plavix, other than to offer a limited-time discount plan for patients who wish to continue with the brand-name drug. The company stopped running television advertisements in June.
''We expect a rapid, precipitous and material decline in Plavix net sales,'' company officials wrote in the 2011 annual report. Analysts expect the price of generic alternatives to be substantially lower than brand-name Plavix.
Usually, drug prices take several months to drop because one generic company -- the first to file an application with the drug agency -- is granted the exclusive right to market the drug for the first six months. But Plavix is different because the company that won that right, the Canadian drug maker Apotex, forfeited its exclusive period after it flooded the market in 2006 with unauthorized generic versions of the drug.
In what amounted to a dress rehearsal for this year, Plavix lost an estimated $1 billion in sales when Apotex, which had challenged the drug's patent, managed to distribute a six-month supply before a judge ordered the company to stop.
Negotiations with Apotex over the patent also landed Bristol-Myers in trouble with federal authorities. Bristol-Myers ultimately paid more than $3 million in civil and criminal fines after the Justice Department claimed it had entered into a secret deal with Apotex to delay offering its own generic version of the drug during Apotex's exclusivity period. A former Bristol-Myers senior vice president pleaded guilty to making a false statement to the government in the case.
Because Apotex lost its exclusivity, seven companies have received tentative approval to market the generic drug. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories received approval in 2008 to market a 75-milligram dose, but it has been prevented under a court order from selling the drug. The agency often, but not always, gives final approval to generic drug companies on the day the brand-name drug loses patent protection.
Uday Baldota, a spokesman for Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, an Indian drug maker that has received tentative approval to sell generic Plavix, said his company often planned for the introduction of a new drug seven to eight years ahead of time, with the goal of shipping the new drug ''as soon as the patent expires,'' he said in an e-mail. Once the company receives final approval, the plan unfolds with extreme precision, he said. ''I would not be surprised if there was a stopwatch involved!''
A spokeswoman for the large drug distributor Cardinal Health said the company planned to begin shipping generic Plavix on Friday.
Analysts have largely credited Bristol-Myers with successfully planning for its future after Plavix. In recent years, it has moved away from its primary care business and into specialty pharmaceuticals, using cash from the sales of smaller business units to finance the purchase of several small biotechnology firms.
Last year, the company won approval of a drug to treat melanoma, Yervoy. In June, the Federal Drug Administration is expected to decide on approval of a blood-thinning drug, Eliquis, that Bristol-Myers is developing in partnership with Pfizer. Eliquis belongs to a new class of drugs intended to help prevent strokes in people with the heart arrhythmia known as atrial fibrillation. If approved, analysts expect it to bring in billions of dollars in revenue.
''It really turned out to not just be rhetoric,'' Ms. Arnold of Credit Suisse said. ''They really have created a confidence in investors that there is life beyond Plavix.''

HEADLINE: Popular Antibiotic May Raise Risk of Sudden Death

BYLINE: By DENISE GRADY

 BODY:
A new study finds that a widely used antibiotic, azithromycin, may increase the likelihood of sudden death in adults, especially those who have heart disease or are at high risk for it.
The increased odds of death are small, but significant enough that the authors of the study say doctors should consider prescribing a different drug, like amoxicillin, for high-risk patients who need antibiotics. People at high risk include those with heart failure, diabetes or a previous heart attack, and those who have undergone bypass surgery or have had stents implanted. In such patients, the drug may cause abnormal heart rhythms that can be fatal. Just how the drug might disrupt heart rhythm is not known, the researchers said.
The concerns do not apply to children, because most have very little risk of heart disease, according to the lead author of the study, Wayne A. Ray, a professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University. The study is being published on Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine. 
Azithromycin is used to treat bacterial infections, including bronchitis, pneumonia, sore throats and earaches. It is familiar to many people as the ''Z-Pak,'' to be taken for five days, and part of its appeal is its convenience; many other antibiotics must be taken for 10 days or longer. Last year, doctors wrote 55. 3 million prescriptions for azithromycin in the United States, and sales were $464.6 million, according to IMS Health, a health care information and services company. Global sales were $1.8 billion.
Two related antibiotics, erythromycin and clarithromycin, were already known to raise the risk of sudden death. But azithromycin was thought to be safer.
Experts outside the study gave it differing reviews.
Dr. John G. Bartlett, a professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and a former president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said, ''I'm inclined to agree with Dr. Ray.''
He said he was convinced by the study because it included data on a huge number of patients and because the findings were biologically plausible, given that related drugs had also been found capable of disrupting heart rhythm. For patients at high risk, he would prescribe a different drug, he said, adding that there are plenty of alternatives.
Dr. Bartlett also said that the study provided another reason to curb overuse of antibiotics, which are too often prescribed for colds and other viral infections that they cannot treat. The overuse has contributed to the emergence of dangerous, drug-resistant strains of bacteria.
''We use azithromycin for an awful lot of things, and we abuse it terribly,'' Dr. Bartlett said. ''It's very convenient. Patients love it. 'Give me the Z-Pak.' For most of where we use it, probably the best option is not to give an antibiotic, quite frankly.''
Dr. Lori Mosca, director of preventive cardiology at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center, advised caution in interpreting the study, because of its methodology and because azithromycin's benefits may outweigh the small risks suggested by the study.
Dr. Mosca noted that the study was observational, meaning that the researchers looked back at medical records, rather than setting up an experiment in which patients were assigned at random to one treatment or another and then monitored. Even the most careful observational study can be misleading, she said: results that appear related to treatment may really be due to basic, undetected differences between groups of patients. She said a more rigorous study should be done to verify these new findings.
In the meantime, she said: ''It would be crazy to think we can't use azithromycin. It's bad to undertreat infections.''
Dr. Roy M. Gulick, the chief of infectious diseases at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell, also said that more research was needed. But, he said, ''in someone with significant cardiovascular risks or documented disease, the results of this study would be one factor that would help you choose among the antibiotics.''
Dr. Ray and his team analyzed the medical records of about 540,000 Medicaid patients ages 30 to 74 in Tennessee from 1992 to 2006. The researchers looked at cardiovascular deaths while people were taking various antibiotics and during comparable periods in which they were taking none: about 350,000 prescriptions for azithromycin, 1.4 million matched periods with no treatment, 1.4 million prescriptions for amoxicillin, 265,000 for ciprofloxacin and 194,000 for levofloxacin. By comparing people taking other antibiotics, the researchers hoped to control for the possibility that the infections they were being treated for were the cause of sudden death.
Over all, there were few sudden deaths during these specified periods, fewer than 100 combined among those taking azithromycin, amoxicillin or no antibiotic. But when the researchers calculated the rates of sudden death per million courses of treatment (or untreated control periods), azithromycin stood out, with 64.6 deaths per million courses, as opposed to 21.8 for amoxicillin and 24 when there was no treatment. The death rates with azithromycin and levofloxacin were about the same (earlier studies have linked levofloxacin to abnormal heart rhythms), and were higher than the rate with ciprofloxacin.
The people who had the greatest baseline risk for heart disease had the highest risk from taking azithromycin.
''Any antibiotic is going to have risks and benefits,'' Dr. Ray said. ''We think this is an important piece of information about risks.''

HEADLINE: Ignore That Panorama

BYLINE: By GUY TREBAY

 BODY:
WEARING snug khaki shorts, a white button-down oxford shirt and a pair of Alden desert boots, Todd Alexander Romano paced a West Side penthouse apartment looking stricken.
A compact, energetic Texan, Mr. Romano is -- typically speaking -- the type to take the view not merely that the glass is half-full but that it would look a lot prettier if only you moved it over there to the lacquered table next to the reproduction Louis XV fauteuil from Maison Jansen.
''My first thought was to paint it gray and fill it with corn,'' Mr. Romano said glumly of a dining room whose daunting proportions -- about 13 by 17 by 21 feet high -- were more suggestive of a silo than an elegant multimillion-dollar penthouse with panoramic views of the Hudson and whatever they call that place on the other side.
This was in late April. Roughly 10 days earlier Mr. Romano had been invited to participate in the 40th annual edition of the Kips Bay Decorator Show House, one of 30-odd members of that underrated profession who volunteer each year to work wizardry on rooms in houses donated for the purpose, all to benefit the Kips Bay Boys and Girls Club. 
For most of its history the Kips Bay Decorator Show House has been staged in one or another Manhattan brownstone or town house. But this year there were no town houses to be found. And so the developer of the Aldyn, a 40-story condominium building at the south end of the former Trump development above the old Penn Central rail yards, offered the charity the use of two adjacent unsold duplexes, each more than 6,000 square feet (priced at $15.9 million and $16.9 million) and each equally unpromising in architectural terms. There are the views, of course. But a person cannot live in a view. You need a sofa.
The first time she saw the room allotted her at the show house, she felt like Mary Poppins, the decorator Susan Zises Green said: ''I felt you could fly right through the windows.''
Mr. Romano entertained similar notions, although the flight he contemplated was in the opposite direction, straight out of Dodge.
But, as previously suggested, Mr. Romano is no quitter. And his is not the kind of profession anymore (if ever it was) whose practitioners can afford to turn up their noses at awkward, boxy high-rise developer apartments, places with bump-outs, overhanging soffits and air-conditioning vents located, for no apparent reason, in the middle of dining room walls.
''I almost threw up my hands,'' Mr. Romano said, throwing up his hands. ''I stood in the space and thought, 'I don't get it.' And then it came to me, which 9 times out of 10 is what happens. I walk into a room and the space, the geography or the architecture gives me a path and a story.''
The narrative that suggested itself to Mr. Romano involved a gallery. He would treat the ungainly dining room as a space well suited to die-hard Manhattanites of a type that, as Marlene Dietrich once noted, tend to be hungry for everything except food.
He would alter the proportions and the mood of the too-tall room by painting the walls a nocturnal hue, a color he called aubergine.
Aubergine, of course, is French for eggplant, and one of the enduringly charming traits of those in the decorating trade is that, being in the fancying-up business, they seldom prefer a dull English word when a swanky-sounding foreign one is ready at hand. (Take, for example, that Louis XV armchair -- uh, fauteuil.)
Mr. Romano knew instantly, or semi-instantly, that he would cover the walls with big modern paintings by Rachel Hovnanian and Marc Van Cauwenbergh and hang a faceted poison-green 1960s Italian mirror, and that he would place in the middle of the neutralizing sisal rug an octagonal Alessandro Albrizzi table, with room to seat six to eight people, an ideal number for dinner because, he said, ''Less is boring and with more you get no general conversation.''
He would arrange around the table French Empire chairs because, he said, referring to himself in the third person in a way that somehow seems unstudied, ''there will always be a French chair in a Todd Alexander Romano room.''
He would borrow from Guy Regal at Newel Antiques an immense 42-arm 1940s Venetian chandelier, using it to anchor the space. He would add a pair of ivory ''Bunny'' porcelain lamps from Christopher Spitzmiller atop a white-painted, 19th-century English console table. For an added touch of whimsy, or possibly madness, he would mount a monumental brass giraffe bust by the Mexican sculptor Sergio Bustamante high on one wall.
He would accessorize the space with amethyst geode cathedrals and a bomb-sized hunk of terra cotta in the shape of a pineapple and, when he was finished with all that, the imaginary family Mr. Romano conjured up to inhabit the room might feel when dining as if they were appearing nightly in a remake of ''Boom'' and not merely sitting down to General Tso's chicken eaten straight from the container.
THIS, perhaps, is the place for a reporter to declare himself. I love decorators. I love the idea of their odd, now struggling profession, with its famous lineages (Parish-Hadley, McMillen Inc., Colefax and Fowler) reminiscent of circus dynasties (think Flying Wallendas).
I admire their skills, their professional lore, their gifts as psychologists and mind-readers called on to enter strangers' houses and help those strangers feel somehow more at home. It must take moxie to convince others you have better taste than they do, since taste, after all, is little more than habit and can be acquired.
There is something else. The decorators of this city, people tend to forget, keep thousands of local crafts and tradespeople employed, not the least of these the woman who lives in Far Rockaway and makes by hand the paper lampshades Mr. Romano places in the houses of clients around the world.
Most visitors to the Kips Bay Decorator Show House are likely to come to experience some decorating showbiz, to enjoy the little visual jolts provided by, say, Bryant Keller, who covered a foyer in a red Scalamandre wallpaper designed by Flora Scalamandre in the 1940s and patterned with leaping zebras.
That the wallpaper was a visual trademark of the late lamented restaurant Gino's is itself a knowing wink to the profession, since it was to Gino's or else the Isle of Capri on the Upper East Side that decorators of yesteryear typically repaired after a grueling day gathering samples at the Decoration & Design Building on Third Avenue, slipping off their Belgian loafers under the table and fortifying themselves with strong drink.
I love, too, the element of a decorator's ability that is innate and cannot easily be explained.
''The regular Joe or Carol doesn't have the magic,'' said Mario Buatta, an industry stalwart who for years was a Kips Bay Decorator Show House regular. ''It's great that everybody can go to Restoration Hardware or Pottery Barn and buy the furniture, but how to make the proportions right and put it together is what most people just don't get.''
Years ago, Mr. Buatta said, the decorator Albert Hadley -- a beloved industry eminence who recently died, at 91, and to whom this year's show house is, loosely speaking, an homage -- visited the apartment where Mr. Buatta then lived, above Swifty's.
''There was a tub chair in the room,'' he said. ''And after we were there for a while, Albert said, 'Do you mind if I do something?' And he got up and moved the chair two inches and it completely changed the feeling of that room.''
Before going out on her own years ago, Bunny Williams, the chairwoman of this year's show house, spent more than a decade learning the trade as an associate at Parish-Hadley, the decorating firm of Mr. Hadley and Mrs. Henry Parish II, universally known as Sister.
''When I first started, all of us worked for firms,'' Ms. Williams said. ''We trained. We were assistants. It never occurred to us to just begin decorating.''
Now, in this age of self-promotion and dubious stylists and the dreary reality of D.I.Y., ''everyone wants to be a famous decorator by the time they're 30,'' Ms. Williams added. ''That has diminished our profession tremendously.''
The gluttony and greed of a bygone boomtown era also took a heavy toll on the profession. ''Nothing was harder hit than the interior design industry,'' she said, by both the recession and by widespread suspicion of business practices throughout the industry. ''And now we're in a more realistic time.''
Reality, however, as Ms. Williams conceded, is hardly what visitors pay admission to see in a decorator show house. They come for the ''fantasy, the playfulness, the flair of artistry.''
They come to project themselves, in an altogether pleasurable and voyeuristic manner, into Mr. Romano's aubergine dining room.
The Kips Bay Decorator Show House will be open through June 14 at the Aldyn Residences, 60 Riverside Boulevard, between 62nd and 63rd Streets; 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays, until 8 on Tuesdays and Thursdays; noon to 5 p.m. Sundays; (212) 755-5733, kipsbay.org. Tickets are $30.

HEADLINE: Home Construction Rose in April, Nearly Matching a 3-Year High

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Home construction rose to nearly a three-year high in April, the government reported Wednesday. And factory output rose in three of this year's first four months. 
The two reports suggest growth in the April-to-June quarter is off to a good start, helped by falling gasoline prices and solid hiring gains. Fears of a spring slump are easing.
''It's all very encouraging,'' said Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics. ''Things look good at the moment.''
Builders broke ground in April at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 717,000 homes, an increase of 2.6 percent, the Commerce Department said. That pace nearly matches that of January, the best since October 2008. Construction rose for single-family homes and apartments.
A separate report from the Federal Reserve showed that industrial production rose 1.1 percent in April after a lull in March.
Some economists have noted that a warm winter led companies to move up some hiring and accelerate other activity -- including home building -- that normally would not occur until spring. That gave the appearance that the economy had strengthened in January and February and weakened in March.
But Mr. Ashworth noted that the overall trend in housing starts had been running at approximately the same annual pace -- about 700,000 -- over the last six months. That is 100,000 more on average than the pace for the previous six months.
Mr. Ashworth said the higher level suggested demand was increasing and the mild winter had less effect than some economists had thought.
''We expect starts to strengthen further this year,'' Mr. Ashworth wrote in a note to clients.
Even with the gains, the rate of construction for all homes is only about half the 1.5 million annual pace that most economists consider healthy. But the increase, along with rising builder confidence and stronger job growth, is a sign that the home market may finally be starting to recover nearly five years after the housing bubble burst.
Manufacturing has become one of the strongest areas of the American economy since the recession ended nearly three years ago. Factory output is now 18.3 percent higher than its low hit in June 2009, the month the recession ended. It is only 6.1 percent below its prerecession peak.
Factories are busier in part because automakers are selling more cars and trucks. Half of April's increase in factory output reflected a 3.9 percent increase in the production of motor vehicles and parts. That was the fifth consecutive gain at auto plants.
Production also rose at several types of businesses in April, like makers of computers, aerospace companies and furniture factories.

HEADLINE: Obama and House Republicans Offer Taste of Renewed Fight Over the Debt Ceiling

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER; Jonathan Weisman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama and Congressional Republicans staged a preview of a looming end-of-year battle on Wednesday, as the president warned Republicans that he would not allow Congress to hold the economy ''hostage'' to another fight over whether to raise the country's debt ceiling without accompanying cuts in spending.
During a lunch of hoagie sandwiches at the White House that was supposed to be about urging Congress to act on proposals to spur the economy, Mr. Obama and the House speaker, John A. Boehner, clashed again over the debt ceiling. Mr. Boehner initiated the hostilities on Tuesday, when he appeared to signal that he wanted to start scrapping over the debt ceiling this summer, in the middle of the election campaign, instead of at year's end, when the country will again need to raise the borrowing limit. 
Mr. Boehner stood by his position at the White House, an aide said, telling the president that ''as long as I'm around here, I'm not going to allow a debt ceiling increase without doing something serious about the debt.''
The president and his Democratic allies on Capitol Hill were talking tough, too. ''The president made clear that we're not going to recreate the debt ceiling debacle of last August,'' said Jay Carney, the White House press secretary. He added, ''It is simply not acceptable to hold the American and global economy hostage to one party's political ideology.''
Last summer, House Republicans balked at raising the debt ceiling without deep spending cuts, an impasse that led to the lowering of the country's debt rating from Standard & Poor's. After weeks of drama, the White House and Congress reached an agreement that raised the debt ceiling until, most likely, the end of this year, after the November elections.
But some people seem ready to start fighting now. Mitt Romney, the likely Republican presidential nominee, joined the fray on Wednesday, accusing Mr. Obama of not doing enough to rein in the country's $1 trillion budget deficit, even after Mr. Obama criticized President George W. Bush as having run up the deficit. Mr. Romney told the audience at a campaign event in St. Petersburg, Fla., ''I find it incomprehensible that a president could come to office and call his predecessor's record irresponsible and unpatriotic, and then do almost nothing to fix it and instead every year to add more and more and more spending.''
While the tough talk may help shore up support for Mr. Romney among Tea Party conservatives, it could also alienate independent and moderate voters unhappy with Congress's handling of the debt ceiling fight last year. A New York Times/CBS News poll last August found that 47 percent laid the blame for the debt ceiling fight on Congressional Republicans, while only 29 percent blamed Mr. Obama or the Democrats.
On Wednesday, Congressional Democrats were not running from the fight either. An aide to Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, said that Mr. Reid reminded Mr. Boehner and Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, that ''absent a balanced agreement that pairs smart spending cuts with revenue measures asking millionaires to pay their fair share, the debt will be dealt with through the sequester.'' That is a reference to a previous agreement that would automatically cut $1.2 trillion in spending, with half taken out of military spending and half from domestic spending.
Senate Republicans, meanwhile, engineered a daylong debate on Wednesday intended to highlight the Democratic majority's failure for the third straight year to produce a budget blueprint -- and to embarrass Mr. Obama by bringing his budget to a vote. A procedural motion to proceed to the Obama budget failed, 99 to 0.
The lunch meeting on Wednesday was intended to be a chance for Mr. Obama to take advantage of presidential prerogative to invite lawmakers to the White House, and to hawk his ''to-do list'' of proposals he would like to see Congress enact this year.
The president wants Congress to approve a proposal to help small businesses that hire additional workers, and to look for ways to hire more veterans. ''Too many folks are still out of work,'' he said in an appearance with small-business owners at a deli in Washington before the lunch. ''We've got some headwinds, the situation in Europe, and still a difficult housing market.''
''So my message to Congress, and I'm going to have a chance to see the Congressional leadership when I get back to the White House -- I'm going to offer them some hoagies while they're there -- is let's go ahead and act to help build and sustain momentum for our economy,'' the president said.

HEADLINE: Minutes Suggest the Fed Will Stay the Course on Policy

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve is solidly entrenched in its current policies and there is little sign that a change is in the offing, according to an account the Fed published Wednesday of the most recent meeting of its policy-making committee.
The Fed released a statement after its Federal Open Market Committee met in late April affirming that it would continue its efforts to reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, and the account released Wednesday does not significantly alter that basic message. 
Fed officials saw little reason to retreat, according to the account, which was published after the standard three-week delay. They expressed skepticism about signs that the economy was expanding more rapidly, and they remained sanguine about inflation. At the same time, the account includes only a brief mention of the possibility that the Fed might expand its efforts.
The Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and his lieutenants have indicated that the threshold is unusually high for any change in Fed policy. Any further effort to stimulate growth must be substantial to be meaningful, and any reduction in the Fed's existing efforts would represent a significant shift in policy.
Still, the account suggests the committee was closer to slackening -- specifically, by reeling in its prediction that interest rates will remain near zero until late 2014. Only four of the 17 Fed officials on the committee said that they expected the Fed to hold rates at the current level through 2014, down from six in January, when the Fed last published their projections. But the committee decided not to shift its official projection because members ''preferred adjusting the forward guidance only once they were more confident that the medium-term economic outlook or risks to the outlook had changed significantly.''
The account cited several reasons for hesitation, including the possibility that an unusually mild winter had buoyed economic activity. Officials also remain concerned that the economy could be slowed by financial disruptions emanating from Europe, or by events closer to home, if a divided Congress did not negotiate an alternative to the significant tax increases and spending cuts scheduled to take effect at the end of the year.
''The possibilities that U.S. fiscal policy would be more contractionary than anticipated and that uncertainty about fiscal policy could lead to a deferral of hiring and investment were other downside risks,'' according to the account, which the Fed describes as the ''minutes of the meeting'' although it is not a transcript or complete record.
According to the account, several committee members also emphasized that they would support an expansion of the Fed's efforts to stimulate growth ''if the economic recovery lost momentum or the downside risks to the forecast became great enough.'' But it contained no indication that Fed officials had considered extending an effort that ends in June to reduce interest rates by shifting the composition of its investments toward Treasury securities with longer terms. James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, said in public remarks Wednesday that the Fed was ''on pause'' because its existing measures were working and there was no need for additional aid at this time.
''The ultra-easy monetary policy -- much of which is still impacting the U.S. economy -- along with better-than-expected data over the last nine months combined to put the F.O.M.C. on hold, or pause, in its aggressive easing campaign,'' Mr. Bullard said.
Mr. Bullard, who does not hold one of the rotating votes on the policy-making committee this year, is among the more conservative members of the committee. But while he cautioned that the Fed ''may be trying to do too much,'' he did not call for a reduction in efforts, a reflection of the stability of the Fed's current position.
The Fed also said Wednesday that its policy-making committee would expand its scheduled meetings so that each of the eight annual sessions included a second day. Until now, half of those meetings have lasted only a single day. The change reflects Mr. Bernanke's emphasis on fostering discussion and debate among committee members. His immediate predecessor, Alan Greenspan, had treated the meetings as formalities.
The Fed also adjusted the schedule for Mr. Bernanke's news conferences. He will still answer questions in public four times each year, but the sessions will now be spaced at regular intervals of three months, falling in the final month of each quarter.
The committee is scheduled to hold its next meeting on June 19 and 20, followed by a news conference with Mr. Bernanke.

HEADLINE: Blitz of Campaign Ads Is Early and Aggressive

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
The presidential campaign is erupting into a full-scale advertising war, with both candidates and their allies pouring huge sums into early and aggressive efforts to define the fight on their terms.
At least $50 million worth of ads will appear in swing states in the next several weeks as President Obama and Mitt Romney move swiftly to win over voters now, casting aside concerns that their money will be wasted on people who are not paying much attention five and a half months before Election Day.
The latest volley came on Wednesday, when Crossroads GPS, a political group formed by Karl Rove and other top Republican strategists, unveiled a $25 million advertising campaign. The group opened with a hard-hitting commercial that casts Mr. Obama as a failed leader, unable to deliver on his pledges to fix the country's problems. 
''President Obama's agenda promised so much,'' it says over the sound of breaking glass. ''He hasn't even come close. We need solutions, not just promises.''
The Crossroads campaign matches the $25 million advertising offensive that the Obama campaign began last week. Other outside political groups and ''super PACs'' have committed at least an additional $15 million in recent weeks, mostly to Mr. Romney's benefit, according to Kantar Media.
There is almost certainly more to come before the highly viewed spring television schedule winds down for the summer. Many central players, including the Democratic and Republican Party committees and Mr. Romney's campaign, have been largely absent from TV in recent weeks and are sitting on large piles of cash. Mr. Romney, who had more than $10 million in the bank at the end of March and has been busily raising money in the last few weeks, has not advertised since Rick Santorum dropped his bid for the Republican nomination a month ago.
Such a high volume of ads coming before the summer -- many of them negative and concentrated in a handful of battleground states -- further reinforces the belief among political strategists that this election will see an unusually heavy and vicious air war as outside political groups assume a larger role than ever.
In dueling sets of ads, each side offers its perspective on the improvement, or lack thereof, that the country has made under Mr. Obama. The new Crossroads ad pushes the narrative that despite his lofty vision for a better America, Mr. Obama -- and indeed the nation -- has made little progress in three and a half years.
In its ads, the Obama campaign tries to remind voters of the deep economic crisis the president inherited and argues that he has set the country on the right path.
''It's still too hard for too many,'' the opening ad of his $25 million campaign says. ''We're not there yet. It's still too hard for too many. But we're coming back.''
In previous years, ad spending has been heavy but not as narrowly focused on such a small number of states. In 2004, for example, George W. Bush's campaign was spending $5 million every week on television ads after Senator John Kerry emerged as the Democratic nominee. But the campaign initially spread its advertising over 17 states.
''I think the key word is concentrated,'' said Kenneth M. Goldstein, president of Kantar Media's Campaign Media Analysis Group. ''This tells us that it's not 13 or 14 states that matter. It's seven or eight.''
With the Crossroads ads, set to start running on Thursday, the president and his opponents will be on television head to head in nine states: Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
The rush to advertise now reflects a belief among political strategists on both sides that they have a small window of time to frame the election. Only a few weeks remain before the busy television-watching season slows down and summer reruns begin. The Olympics start at the end of July, a time when most Americans will hardly be thinking about politics. Many strategists believe they will not have an opportunity to connect with voters again until the political conventions begin in late August.
''The first ads that are run are in many ways the most important because the mind is the most open and uncluttered at that point,'' said Carter Eskew, a veteran Democratic strategist. By late summer and early fall, he said, political advertising has reached the saturation point.
''Most people are sick of it because you have ads for president, then Senate, then dog catcher and assistant dog catcher,'' he said. ''It's back to back to back.''
The new Crossroads campaign fills a void in those crucial states. Mr. Romney's super PAC has been running ads sporadically, including a sarcasm-laden Mother's Day spot that took two notable Democrats to task for their dismissive comments about Ann Romney, a stay-at-home mother. ''Happy Mother's Day from Barack Obama's team,'' said the narrator, a soft-spoken woman.
Mr. Romney, however, has been quiet. Stuart Stevens, a senior Romney strategist, would not elaborate on Wednesday about the campaign's plans. But Romney videographers have been interviewing people across the country about their economic woes.
The role of super PACs in providing that auxiliary support has been essential, experts said.
''It's to your advantage to offload your work to the super PACs,'' said Erika Franklin Fowler, director of the Wesleyan Media Project, which tracks political ads. ''In a world in which campaigns can't technically coordinate with super PACs, one way of doing things is waiting to see what the other is doing and then filling in the gaps.''

HEADLINE: Merkel Says She Is Open to Stimulus for Greece

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH and MELISSA EDDY

 BODY:
BERLIN -- Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said Wednesday that she was ready to discuss stimulus programs to get the Greek economy growing again and that she was committed to keeping Greece in the euro zone, signaling a softer approach toward the struggling country.
The fierce rhetorical salvos out of Germany in the past week gave way to conciliatory gestures by Ms. Merkel, who throughout the crisis has shown a propensity for managing through brinkmanship. ''I have the will, the determination to keep Greece in the euro zone,'' she said in an interview on CNBC on Wednesday, in what appeared to be an attempt to relax an increasingly tense situation.
If Greek officials are looking for ''stimulus to be pursued for growth in the euro zone, which we could pursue in the interest of Greece, we're open for this,'' Ms. Merkel said. ''Germany is open for this.''
Europe was shaken anew this week by the chaos in Greece, where a bank run threatened to hasten the country's exit from the euro and jeopardize the Continent's financial stability. While the impact of a country's leaving the euro is hard to predict, economists fear the crisis could spread to much larger countries like Spain and Italy if financial markets bid up borrowing rates to unsustainable levels. 
Ms. Merkel is preparing to head to Camp David in Maryland for the Group of 8 meeting beginning on Friday, and she is likely to be pressed there by the leaders of other industrial nations, in particular by President Obama, to find a way to quell the turmoil. On Tuesday night she met for the first time with France's newly inaugurated president, Francois Hollande, who campaigned on the need for more growth-promoting policies.
In recent days Ms. Merkel has signaled a growing openness to additional growth measures as long as they do not interfere with the fiscal compact to cut deficits in the euro zone in the long run. ''On the one hand we have the pillar of sound fiscal policy, and the second pillar will then be the growth component,'' Ms. Merkel said in the CNBC interview.
That support could come in the form of money from existing European Union funds that would be redirected for use by crisis countries, said Fabian Zuleeg, the chief economist with the European Policy Center. That approach had been championed by Mr. Hollande.
But it will take more than technical adjustments to calm the growing political opposition to austerity in Greece, Spain and other hard-hit countries in the euro zone's periphery, Mr. Zuleeg added. ''We need to put together a package that looks convincing. It can't just be rhetoric; it has to have some real elements to it,'' he said. ''The real element that certainly has to be in there is money.''
Ms. Merkel's comments punctuated a day in which all sides -- from European policy makers in Brussels to political operatives in Athens, where a caretaker government was named on Wednesday -- began gearing up for a second Greek election, scheduled for June 17. The political establishment in Greece and elsewhere is seeking to describe the vote as a referendum on membership in the euro, which a large majority of Greeks say they support, even as they also demand a renegotiation of the terms of their bailout agreement.
Speaking at an event in Frankfurt on Wednesday, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, made a plea for having Greece remain in the euro zone. ''I want to state that our strong preference is that Greece will continue to stay in the euro area,'' Mr. Draghi said.
German officials have been boasting recently about the ability of the euro zone to handle a Greek exit. Though aimed at reining in Greece's left-wing parties and their goal of renegotiating the bailout deal, the talk also unsettled markets and had the potential of turning into a self-fulfilling prophecy. The perils of brinkmanship in an unstable environment were on full display on Wednesday as the news emerged that Greeks had pulled nearly $900 million in savings from banks in the days after the May 6 elections, prompting fears of an uncontrollable bank run.
The tough talk about Greece's departure from the euro has resulted in growing qualms among the Greek public that their money could be converted to a new, significantly weaker currency -- such as a reintroduced drachma -- shrinking the value of hard-earned nest eggs. The more likely this possibility appears, the more Greeks have an incentive to put their money in bank accounts abroad.
With the continuing instability, the rest of Europe would remain ''in limbo'' waiting for Greek elections, said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank in London, ''which for financial markets means one thing: volatility.''
He added, ''We are exactly in the situation where the rumors or the expectations could trigger a downward spiral.''
Mr. Schmieding said that Ms. Merkel and Mr. Hollande were prepared to make concessions, but had to focus the rest of their energy on preparing to control contagion and cushion the brunt of the impact in the event of a Greek departure.
The high stakes of the second trip to the polls for Greek voters were apparent on Wednesday. ''The Greek people should know what they are voting about,'' said Guido Westerwelle, Germany's foreign minister, in a statement on Wednesday. ''It is not about party politics, but about Greece's future in Europe and the euro. We hope and at the same time also expect that everyone in a decision-making role in Greece is aware of their responsibilities.''
Ms. Merkel has proved time and again how adept she is at shifting with changing circumstances. ''There is a realignment under way, and one thing we know about Ms. Merkel is she is able to manage this sort of transition with very high tactical skills,'' said Nicolas Veron, a visiting fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.
Voters in Germany's most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, dealt Ms. Merkel's party a devastating electoral loss on Sunday, which was viewed in part as a repudiation of her emphasis on austerity to the detriment of growth.
But Ms. Merkel's ultimate goal, Mr. Veron said, is to maintain European unity. ''Her primary objective is avoiding a situation where there would be a divide between France and Germany that would be impossible to manage for both nations and would make the whole euro crisis even less manageable than it was before,'' he said.
Jorg Kramer, the chief economist at Commerzbank, said he believed that the European Union was actually more flexible than German politicians had claimed, and could give Greece more time to meet the promised goals to reduce its budget deficits.
''The political class in Europe still has solidarity with Greek politicians, with the exception of the radical left,'' Mr. Kramer said.
Europe needs to show its support for Greece, Ms. Merkel said in a second televised interview, on CNN, ''as regards growth, as regards employment, as regards development, because what the people in Greece are experiencing now is a very, very tough period.''

HEADLINE: G.O.P. 'Super PAC' Weighing A Hard-Line Attack on Obama

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A group of high-profile Republican strategists is working with a conservative billionaire on a proposal to mount one of the most provocative campaigns of the ''super PAC'' era and attack President Obama in ways that Republicans have so far shied away from.
Timed to upend the Democratic National Convention in September, the plan would ''do exactly what John McCain would not let us do,'' the strategists wrote.
The plan, which is awaiting approval, calls for running commercials linking Mr. Obama to incendiary comments by his former spiritual adviser, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., whose race-related sermons made him a highly charged figure in the 2008 campaign. 
''The world is about to see Jeremiah Wright and understand his influence on Barack Obama for the first time in a big, attention-arresting way,'' says the proposal, which was overseen by Fred Davis and commissioned by Joe Ricketts, the founder of the brokerage firm TD Ameritrade. Mr. Ricketts is increasingly putting his fortune to work in conservative politics.
The $10 million plan, one of several being studied by Mr. Ricketts, includes preparations for how to respond to the charges of race-baiting it envisions if it highlights Mr. Obama's former ties to Mr. Wright, who espouses what is known as ''black liberation theology.''
The group suggested hiring as a spokesman an ''extremely literate conservative African-American'' who can argue that Mr. Obama misled the nation by presenting himself as what the proposal calls a ''metrosexual, black Abe Lincoln.''
A copy of a detailed advertising plan was obtained by The New York Times through a person not connected to the proposal who was alarmed by its tone. It is titled ''The Defeat of Barack Hussein Obama: The Ricketts Plan to End His Spending for Good.''
The proposal was presented last week in Chicago to associates and family members of Mr. Ricketts, who is also the patriarch of the family that owns the Chicago Cubs.
Brian Baker, president and general counsel of a super PAC called the Ending Spending Action Fund, said Mr. Ricketts had studied several advertising proposals in recent months and had not signed off on a specific approach to taking on Mr. Obama.
''Joe Ricketts is prepared to spend significant resources in the 2012 election in both the presidential race and Congressional races,'' Mr. Baker said in an interview Wednesday. ''He is very concerned about the future direction of the country and plans to take a stand.''
The document makes clear that the effort is only in the planning stages and awaiting full approval from Mr. Ricketts. People involved in the planning said the publicity now certain to surround it could send the strategists back to the drawing board.
But it serves as a rare, detailed look at the birth of the sort of political sneak attack that has traditionally been hatched in the shadows and has become a staple of presidential politics.
It also shows how a single individual can create his own movement and spend unlimited sums to have major influence on a presidential election in a campaign finance environment in which groups operating independently of candidates are flourishing.
Should the plan proceed, it would run counter to the strategy being employed by Mitt Romney's team, which has so far avoided such attacks. The Romney campaign has sought to focus attention on the economy, and has concluded that personal attacks on Mr. Obama, who is still well liked personally by most independent voters surveyed for polls, could backfire.
Mr. Ricketts has become an increasingly active player in Republican politics through several political action committees, including Ending Spending. He has a son, Pete, who is a member of the Republican National Committee from Nebraska and a daughter, Laura, who is a top contributor to Mr. Obama's re-election campaign. She has not been involved in her father's political efforts.
The 54-page proposal was professionally bound and illustrated with color photographs, indicating that it is far beyond a mere discussion. The strategists have already contacted Larry Elder, a black conservative radio host in Los Angeles, about serving as a spokesman, and the plan calls for a group of black business leaders to endorse the effort. The strategists have also registered a domain name, Character Matters.
The proposal suggests that Mr. Ricketts believes the 2008 campaign of Senator John McCain erred in not using images of Mr. Wright against Mr. Obama, who has said that the pastor helped him find Jesus but that he was never present for Mr. Wright's politically charged sermons. Mr. Obama left the church during the campaign.
Apparently referring to a Wright ad that was produced for the McCain campaign by Mr. Davis's firm but never used, the proposal opens with a quote from Mr. Ricketts: ''If the nation had seen that ad, they'd never have elected Barack Obama.''
The planning document is emblazoned with the logo of Strategic Perception, the political advertising firm of Mr. Davis, the colorful Republican operative who last worked on the Republican presidential campaign of former Gov. Jon M. Huntsman of Utah. Included on his ''Recommended Team of Pirates'' are the former Huntsman pollster Whit Ayres and the McCain campaign Internet strategist Becki Donatelli.
The document, which was written by former advisers to Mr. McCain, is critical of his decision in 2008 not to aggressively pursue Mr. Obama's relationship with Mr. Wright. In the opening paragraphs of the proposal, the Republican strategists refer to Mr. McCain as ''a crusty old politician who often seemed confused, burdened with a campaign just as confused.''
''Our plan is to do exactly what John McCain would not let us do: Show the world how Barack Obama's opinions of America and the world were formed,'' the proposal says. ''And why the influence of that misguided mentor and our president's formative years among left-wing intellectuals has brought our country to its knees.''
The plan is designed for maximum impact, far beyond a typical $10 million television advertising campaign. It calls for full-page newspaper advertisements featuring a comment Mr. Wright made the Sunday after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. ''America's chickens are coming home to roost,'' he said.
The plan is for the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., to be ''jolted.'' The advertising campaign would include television ads, outdoor advertisements and huge aerial banners flying over the convention site for four hours one afternoon.
The strategists grappled with the quandary of running against Mr. Obama that other Republicans have cited this year: ''How to inflame their questions on his character and competency, while allowing themselves to still somewhat 'like' the man becomes the challenge.''
Lamenting that voters ''still aren't ready to hate this president,'' the document concludes that the campaign should ''explain how forces out of Obama's control, that shaped the man, have made him completely the wrong choice as president in these days and times.''

HEADLINE: Another Showdown on the Debt Ceiling?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''G.O.P. Pledges New Standoff on Debt Limit'' (front page, May 16) and ''Mr. Boehner and the Debt'' (editorial, May 16): 
Speaker John A. Boehner and the Republican Party continue to attempt to solve federal budgetary problems through more spending cuts with no tax increases under consideration. We cannot forget that the majority of the deficit has been caused by the Republican zeal for tax cutting.
We should not be fooled, as this is yet another effort to enrich the wealthy and hurt the most needy. Mr. Boehner and his ilk should be reminded that even Ronald Reagan raised taxes 11 times during his presidency. The 112th Congress should be just as open-minded and needs to stop the magical thinking that somehow cutting spending alone will balance our budget.
EDWIN ANDREWS Malden, Mass., May 16, 2012
To the Editor:
Every Republican member of Congress who supports the party's budget proposal should face town hall meetings this summer at which the real consequences are discussed. Citizens should be well aware of what's at stake before voting this November.
If there is a debt-ceiling crisis -- and that's debatable -- the smart way to deal with it is to increase revenue by taxing those who are reaping the greater rewards from the economy.
Fairness is what we ask, not another Congressional stalemate.
SUELLEN HOY WALTER NUGENT Highland Park, Ill., May 16, 2012
To the Editor:
As has been evident since President Obama was elected, the Republican Party believes that his defeat in November justifies all means. Economic turmoil resulting from a refusal to raise the debt ceiling is the desired outcome, ideally ''catastrophic'' and ''calamitous'' (as the Federal Reserve warned).
It is no coincidence that Speaker John A. Boehner's posturing came on the same day that Mitt Romney spoke of a ''prairie fire of debt'' raging across the country. This carefully coordinated process of destabilizing the economy, thwarting growth and recovery, blaming Mr. Obama for Congress's inaction and laying the legacy of Bush-era policies at his feet is at the heart of the Republican strategy.
The Republicans' worst nightmare? Declining gas prices, improving consumer sentiment, falling unemployment and a rising stock market.
Their greatest hope? An economy in tatters.
This is not conservatism; it is a cynical bet against the country's best interests: the worse, the better.
JOHANNA SCHULMAN Cambridge, Mass., May 16, 2012
To the Editor:
Speaker John A. Boehner's grandstanding on raising the debt ceiling is ironic given the fact that President Ronald Reagan had the debt ceiling raised 18 times and George W. Bush seven times, compared with four times for Bill Clinton, who, incidentally, balanced the budget three of his last four years in office. Neither Mr. Reagan nor Mr. Bush ever had a balanced budget, which, of course, contributed immensely to our national debt.

HEADLINE: Big Gathering For NATO Puts Chicago On High Alert

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY and STEVEN YACCINO

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- Foreign delegations are to arrive in this city over the weekend for a NATO summit meeting, the first such gathering to be held in the United States outside of Washington, and Chicago is bracing for all that will bring: thousands of international dignitaries, reporters and others; protesters from around the country; road closings and possible train delays -- and what amounts to a significant trial for Mayor Rahm Emanuel, one year into his leadership of the nation's third-largest city.
Mr. Emanuel, who months ago urged President Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to bring the gathering to Chicago, the president's hometown, says he believes it will draw international recognition to the city, not to mention an immediate economic benefit, estimated by one accounting firm at $128 million from hotel rooms, meals and the like. 
''I expect that what will come from this is part of the public exposure that will drive economic opportunity,'' Mr. Emanuel said in an interview. ''I wouldn't ask for it otherwise,'' he said, adding that cities like New York, Paris and London all take part in similar international events. The costs to this city, Mr. Emanuel has said, again and again, will not be covered by Chicago taxpayers, but by private corporate donations (about $36.5 million) and federal reimbursements ($19.1 million).
''We can do this,'' Mr. Emanuel said. ''Our city's fully capable of this.''
A year after his inauguration, a poll by The Chicago Tribune/WGN-TV shows Mr. Emanuel receiving generally positive marks. But he may have less say over how Chicago receives the NATO meeting than he does over things like his efforts to press for major investment in the city's roads and bridges, install cameras to catch speeders, and make cuts in city employment.
For the moment, Chicagoans seem divided. Some people said they intended to steer clear of downtown entirely -- to stay home from work on Monday, the second day of the two-day meeting, or even close their businesses to avoid tangled streets, police searches of their briefcases on trains, or crowds of demonstrators.
''My mom begged me to take the day off,'' said Joe Szulkowski, a salesman for a shipping company, who said he would, nonetheless, work as usual. ''She's scared.''
At least a few downtown offices were urging workers to wear casual clothes instead of business attire (to avoid possibly becoming the targets of protesters) and have strengthened the security of their computer networks in recent days.
But others scoffed at all the fuss, comparing the meeting to any of the scores of successful conventions the city has hosted over many years, and suggesting that those who worried were just stuck in stale memories of the Democratic Convention of 1968, when the police here clashed with demonstrators.
''I think everybody is preparing for a lot of things that aren't going to happen,'' said Casey Freund, who works at a law firm in the Loop.
The formal meeting of NATO is to start on Sunday, but by Wednesday evening, buses carrying demonstrators from Occupy movements in eight cities around the nation were expected to begin converging on Chicago. The concerns of demonstrators vary widely: among them are those who say they oppose war, and those who say foreign military spending -- and the work of NATO -- has taken away from efforts for health care, education, immigration and other pressing matters.
''Why are we spending this much money on war when we can be spending that money at home on social programs?'' said David Goodner, 31, a member of Occupy Des Moines, who took part in a protest here on Wednesday aimed at stopping evictions of homeowners facing foreclosure.
Estimates of how many protesters may ultimately appear ranged widely. On Sunday, in what is expected to be the largest in a series of demonstrations, a group plans to march to McCormick Place, the site of the meeting, led by uniformed Iraq war veterans who intend to give back their medals as a gesture against the war.
Local organizers said they plan displays of civil disobedience before the meeting ends -- including an attempt to shut down the Boeing headquarters on Monday -- but say the city's preparation for security has been an overreaction, and that they have no intention of marring their broad antiwar message with a violent outbreak. Still, they acknowledged that with protesters coming here, many with their own plans and causes, the possibility of escalating confrontations between police and protesters cannot be dismissed.
For nearly a year, the Chicago police have prepared for the event, and officers from departments as far away as Milwaukee and Philadelphia were expected to help with some duties here. But, Garry McCarthy, the police superintendent, said he was optimistic about the days ahead. By Wednesday, at least a dozen people had been arrested here in connection to early demonstrations, mostly on trespassing charges.
''There's a lot of people that have been predicting that the sky is falling,'' Mr. McCarthy said. ''But I'm looking forward to a good event. It's actually a little bit exciting, rather than doom and gloom.''

HEADLINE: Asking a Skeptical Europe to Open Its Wallet for Afghanistan

BYLINE: By ALISSA J. RUBIN; Graham Bowley contributed reporting.

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan -- There are few certainties for Afghanistan as the NATO troop withdrawal moves into high gear, but one of them is this: the Continental Europeans have a grimmer prognosis for what can be accomplished than do their American and British counterparts.
As they assess Afghanistan, the Europeans see an economic depression looming as Western aid and military spending evaporate; corruption, already endemic, is escalating dangerously as Afghan power brokers milk the war economy for every last penny before it dries up; security remains elusive -- not only because of the Taliban, but also because ethnically based militias are reactivating across large parts of the country.
The American and British, however, emphasize potential: the Afghan security forces are improving; President Hamid Karzai has pledged not to run again, making it possible that there will be a credible election; and the Taliban appear open to peace talks, just not right now.
These disparate outlooks, laid out in interviews with foreign officials here over the past week, are more than a matter of semantics. They are fundamental differences in the allies' conclusions about how much has been achieved and how much more should be spent on Afghanistan. 
That question will be front and center at the NATO summit meeting in Chicago that starts this weekend and is focused on getting commitments from NATO member countries and others to finance the Afghan security forces for 10 years after the NATO mission ends in 2014.
''We have a lot of European countries that are in economic crisis, that are facing elections and whose citizens are fatigued with the war after 11 years. So for us coming up with substantial money for the Afghan National Security Forces, it is not so clear a priority for us,'' said one European diplomat here. Like others interviewed for this article, the diplomat spoke about the aid discussions on the condition of anonymity.
Everyone believes that at the end of the day -- in fact by the end of the conference -- the aid pledges will be there to fill out a goal of $4.1 billion a year, over the next 10 years, to help Afghanistan maintain its security forces. The Americans plan to provide roughly two-thirds of that.
Still, for many European countries, the money is being given reluctantly, most of all because they would prefer to spend on health clinics and schools rather than armies. And even as they are agreeing to commit the money for security help at the Chicago conference, they worry that doing so will make their parliaments reluctant to give more at a Tokyo conference in July that will focus on future Afghanistan reconstruction projects. And in more candid moments, some wish aloud that the money could stay available for countries with more chance for success than Afghanistan.
''What dominates the agenda of Karzai and the United States is security -- the military strategy, the night raids, detention and the rest,'' another European diplomat said. ''So no matter how much we are going to push the Afghans to address issues of governance and corruption, it's not going to happen. But these are things we care about and the capitals care about.''
Though the Americans and British insist that they do not want to end up slighting development spending, their clear priority in Chicago is to ensure there is enough money for the security forces to avoid a repeat of what happened in 1991 when the Soviet Union withdrew financial support for the military under Najibullah, the Communist ruler they had left in Kabul after they withdrew in 1989. When the money stopped, his government collapsed in a matter of months.
''Everybody has economic problems but this is serious business,'' said a senior American official. ''Security forces cannot be under-resourced without grave danger to the state.''
Yet for all that the Americans wanted a broad Western coalition, they did themselves no favors in the prelude to Chicago by sending around a list in January with the amount they expected every country to give. Canada was assessed for $125 million; Finland for $20 million; France, $200 million; Sweden, $40 million -- among others. Only Greece, whose government is in default, was given an exemption.
The list made other countries feel they were trapped in a carpet bazaar in which the store owner sets the price above what he knows he will get. (The list was even called ''Target Asks.'')
''It was a bit blunt as an approach, and we thought, 'Right, why weren't we involved in the exercise to come up with the numbers?' '' one European diplomat said.
Another country's diplomat looked at the list and wondered why his country was asked to pay more than another country of similar size. ''We were told, 'You punch above your weight,' and we said, 'Yes, but we don't want to pay more than our share.' ''
So far the result is that countries are offering about 60 percent of the amount the Americans asked them for. Britain has already announced it will spend $110 million -- barely more than half the $200 million it was asked for. France was asked for $200 million, but with the election last week of a staunchly antiwar Socialist president, Francois Hollande, no one is expecting they will give that much. Several diplomats said they doubted that Mr. Hollande would come to the Chicago meeting empty-handed.
A senior United States official said that the Americans recognized the European reluctance, but that as a practical matter what was most important was that the United States remain out front in helping Afghanistan -- in part because of a sense of responsibility that the past 11 years of war cannot be allowed to come to nothing, but also because it encourages other countries to contribute.
''What it really takes is us,'' said the official, referring to the United States.
The strategic partnership agreement signed on May 1 by President Obama and Mr. Karzai in Kabul committed the United States to support Afghanistan for the next 10 years in economic development, rule of law and security, among other things.
The European reluctance to spend on security is not born of a lack of interest in Afghanistan. Many European countries have had development and humanitarian efforts here going back more than 25 years. But after years of development programs that have fallen far short of the West's hopes, they are wary of the prospect of pumping more money into defending an Afghan state that many Europeans have dwindling faith in.
They are put off by a troubling record of corruption and human rights abuses, and daunted by the prospect of a collapse into civil war after NATO pulls out. They say the Americans base their projections on best-case plans.
''The major goal now is to avoid a cross-country conflict that moves into a regional conflict,'' a European diplomat said. He added, ''We have low expectations for 2014.''
Another European diplomat, who has spent years in the country, described how Afghanistan has fallen out of his country's consciousness.
''Our media is not even mentioning Afghanistan now,'' the diplomat said. ''We are Europeans at the end of the day; we have to care about North Africa -- it is closer; we can explain why it matters. We have to care about Belarus, it is nearly a neighbor. But Afghanistan is very far away.''

CORRECTION-DATE: May 18, 2012

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about Europeans' gloomy view of Afghanistan's future misstated the financial condition of Greece, the only country exempted from a list of NATO partners the United States expects to contribute aid for Afghan security forces. Greece's government has rescheduled much of its debt; it has not defaulted.

HEADLINE: James Abdnor, Ex-South Dakota Senator, Dies at 89

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
James Abdnor, a South Dakota Republican farmer who liked to say that he got off his tractor and went to Washington, where he served four terms in Congress and one in the Senate after defeating the Democratic incumbent, George S. McGovern, in 1980, died on Wednesday in Sioux Falls, S.D. He was 89.
His death was announced by his family. 
It was not quite true that Mr. Abdnor got off his tractor and went to Washington. He went first to South Dakota's capital, Pierre, in the 1950s and was a state senator for 12 years and lieutenant governor for two more before winning a seat in the House and being re-elected three times in the 1970s.
But his campaign line, evoking Jimmy Stewart's aw-shucks Senate appointee in Frank Capra's 1939 film classic ''Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' played well with conservative voters when he challenged Mr. McGovern, a three-term incumbent. Mr. McGovern had opposed American involvement in the war in Vietnam and, as the 1972 Democratic presidential nominee, had lost in a landslide to Richard M. Nixon.
The 1980 South Dakota Senate race offered stark contrasts: Mr. McGovern had national stature, a liberal voting record, many legislative achievements and eloquence as a campaigner. Mr. Abdnor was all but unknown outside his state, had a conservative voting record but few legislative accomplishments, and was as plain-spoken as politicians come, with the added distraction of a word-slurring speech impediment. He said Mr. McGovern was out of touch with the state, but Mr. Abdnor refused to debate.
The two agreed almost word for word on state farming issues. But on national issues, they disagreed on almost everything. Mr. McGovern favored the Equal Rights Amendment, abortion rights, even federal loan guarantees for New York City, while Mr. Abdnor opposed them all. Mr. Abdnor supported the B-1 bomber, the MX missile system and deregulation of oil prices, all of which Mr. McGovern opposed.
In addition, Mr. McGovern had been married for 37 years and had five children. Mr. Abdnor was a lifelong bachelor. His survivors include four nieces and two nephews.
Mr. Abdnor won easily, 58 percent to 39 percent. Analysts said the outcome had less to do with issues than with a negative campaign by the National Conservative Political Action Committee, which portrayed Mr. McGovern as a friend of Fidel Castro because he had visited Cuba, and as ''antifamily'' or a ''baby killer'' because he opposed a constitutional ban on abortion.
But Mr. Abdnor had another advantage. He was widely seen as a nice guy, a rare quality in politics that found expression that year in Ronald Reagan's presidential victory. It carried many Republicans, including Mr. Abdnor, on its coattails in a sweep that moved America to the right politically.
In the Senate, Mr. Abdnor supported rural electrification, water development, agriculture and the Reagan agenda of tax cuts and strong national defense. Mr. Reagan, in turn, campaigned for Mr. Abdnor in 1986 when he ran for re-election against a Democratic representative, Thomas A. Daschle. Mr. Abdnor tried to link his opponent to Jane Fonda and other ''Hollywood liberals'' who had contributed to his campaign.
Mr. Abdnor, a stocky, rough-hewed man who looked uncomfortable and sometimes unprepared before crowds, also tried to turn his speaking difficulties and dirt-farmer manner into assets. In one television commercial produced by a New York media consultant, he wore jeans, sat on the steps of a farmhouse and portrayed himself as an earnest farmer toiling for his state in Washington.
''God didn't make me a flashy speaker, that's for sure,'' he said. ''But we got a lot of flashy speakers in Congress. And if speeches solved problems, we wouldn't have any problems.''
But it was the Reagan administration's failure to improve the troubled farm economies of the Dakotas that weighed heavily with voters, and Mr. Abdnor narrowly lost to Mr. Daschle. Mr. Reagan named him to head the Small Business Administration, and he remained in Washington for two more years.
Ellis James Abdnor, who almost never used his first name, was born on Feb. 13, 1923, in Kennebec, S.D., to Samuel J. and Mary Wehby Abdnor. His father, a Lebanese immigrant, was an itinerant peddler and later a merchant in Kennebec. James attended local schools and enrolled at the University of Nebraska. His studies were interrupted by World War II Army service, but he graduated with a business administration degree in 1945.
He became, and always considered himself, a wheat farmer and cattle rancher. Aside from his years in Pierre and Washington, and some retirement years in Sioux Falls and Rapid City, S.D., he lived all his life in the home where he was raised in Kennebec (population 280), in south-central South Dakota. He died in hospice care in Sioux Falls.
Mr. Abdnor was a teacher and coach in nearby Presho from 1946 to 1948, chief clerk of the State Legislature in the early 1950s and chairman of the state's Young Republicans from 1953 to 1955.
Mr. Abdnor served in the State Senate from 1957 to 1968, and was lieutenant governor under Gov. Frank L. Farrar from 1969 to 1971. He ran unsuccessfully for a seat in Congress in 1970, but two years later went to Washington as a freshman representative. In 1995, he was inducted into the South Dakota Hall of Fame.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, a picture caption on Thursday with the obituary about James Abdnor, a former United States senator from South Dakota, misstated the cabinet post held by James A. Baker III, with whom Mr. Abnor is shown in 1986 when he lost a re-election bid. Mr. Baker was then Treasury secretary, not secretary of state. (He was secretary of state from 1989 to 1992.)

HEADLINE: City's Jobless Rate Dips After Steady Rise

BYLINE: PATRICK MCGEEHAN


HIGHLIGHT: New hiring helped reduce the unemployment rate, with improvements in the construction and tourism fields. 

 BODY:
 New York City continued to add jobs in April, and this time the gain was big enough to lower the city's stubbornly high unemployment rate, the state's Labor Department reported on Thursday.
 The hiring, which was strong in construction- and tourism-related businesses, helped to reverse a nearly yearlong climb in the city's unemployment rate. It now stands at 9.5 percent, down from 9.7 percent in March, but still well above the national rate of 8.1 percent.
 About half of the city's drop in the unemployment rate was caused by a decrease in the number of unemployed residents, while the rest is attributable to a decline in the number of people looking for work, said James P. Brown, principal economist for the Labor Department. People have to be trying to find jobs to count as unemployed. But when the prospects for finding work are poor, some people give up searching.
 The tally of jobs in the city, which is derived from a separate survey of employers, has been rising this year, even as the unemployment rate, until last month, climbed. Since April 2011, the number of private-sector jobs in the city has increased by 66,100, or 2 percent. That is faster than the national job growth rate of 1.8 percent in the past year, the Labor Department said. 
 But, in an apparent contradiction, the city's unemployment rate remains much higher than the 8.8 percent recorded in April 2011.
 "You'd expect it to be trending down more," Mr. Brown said. "It's still noticeably above its year-earlier levels. That's not great news."
 On the other hand, Mr. Brown said, the employment gains were encouraging, especially in construction, an industry that had been stalled for many months. The city added about 4,700 construction jobs in April as developers "seem to be restarting some of those abandoned co-op and condo projects outside of Manhattan," he said.
 The leisure and hospitality industries added about 7,800 jobs, which Mr. Brown said was in line with the usual April pattern. "This is a month when the tourism industry starts to hit its stride," he said.
 On Wall Street, employers were not so bullish, though. They cut about 1,000 jobs last month and more layoffs appear to be on the way, Mr. Brown said.
 Outside New York City, the state did not appear to be in the same hiring mode. Even with the city's gains, the increase in private-sector jobs for the entire state was just 100, the Labor Department said. The state's unemployment rate held steady at 8.5 percent in April.

HEADLINE: Having Children Makes You (Relatively) Happier

BYLINE: KJ DELL'ANTONIA


HIGHLIGHT: New research shows that having children inoculates parents against the things that conspire to cause unhappiness. So there. 

 BODY:
Two college professors, Chris M. Herbst and John Ifcher, are challenging the collective, if counterintuitive, wisdom. Being a parent, they say, really does make people happier than the alternative - in part because over the past few decades, those who aren't parents have been becoming gradually less happy.
Dr. Herbst, an assistant professor of public affairs and social work at Arizona State University, and Dr. Ifcher, an assistant professor of economics at Santa Clara University, set out to critically assess the body of research that led to the generally accepted "parental happiness gap" -- repeated findings showing that parents are less happy, experience more depression and anxiety, and are more likely to be unhappy in their marriages than those who are not parents.
In 2010, Jennifer Senior wrote a cover story for New York magazine, "Why Parents Hate Parenting." which provoked a collective howl of outrage - a data rebellion. How had we been conned into participating in this betrayal of our children? We are, too, declared parents, happier with our children than without.
What the two researchers found, in a paper titled "A Bundle of Joy: Does Parenting Really Make You Miserable?" (presented at the annual Population Conference of America), suggests that the balance of happiness is shifting, and that ultimately, we who protest as parents may be proved right. But it's not necessarily because we're getting happier. Rather, parents' happiness has held steady over time, while the absolute happiness of those who aren't parents responding to questions like "Taken all together, how would you say things are these days - are you very happy, pretty happy, or not too happy?" decreased from 1972 to 2008.
Why? We believe, Dr. Herbst wrote in an e-mail, "that children may inoculate parents from many social, cultural, and economic changes that have conspired to reduce most Americans' happiness." Other research suggests that a decline in community and political involvement, a sense of disconnect from family and friends, and a feeling of economic insecurity reduces people's reported sense of well-being, but parents "have been relatively immune to those changes." Instead, parents, according to their presented findings, "have become relatively more likely to visit friends, to get the news every day, and to remain engaged in politics," and even to "agree that 'family income is high enough to satisfy nearly all important desires.'"
"Happy" is a complex construct, an ever-changing barometer, and the ultimate in subjective standards: you're only as happy as you say you are. Do parents have an advantage in having effectively created an excuse to do the things that seem to promote feelings of happiness, like personal interactions and a space in even a small community? Economists and social scientists will surely continue to try to work that one out. But at least those of us with children can be happy with this round of research findings -- though they make provoke protest in others corners. The parents are all right.

HEADLINE: Theater Talkback: Against Ovation Inflation

BYLINE: BEN BRANTLEY


HIGHLIGHT: I would like to make the case, officially and urgently, for the return of the sitting ovation. Because we really have reached the point where a standing ovation doesn't mean a thing. 

 BODY:
Something rare and wonderful happened at the opening night of the Encores! concert production of "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" at City Center last week. At the end of the show, when the performers took their bows, the audience remained seated.
Let me hasten to add there was no doubt that this audience had mightily enjoyed what it had just seen. We had all beat our hands raw with clapping through a succession of showstoppers, including a tap sequence that would have made you swear the ghosts of the Nicholas Brothers had possessed its performers; an athletic series of variations on the Charleston; and a knockout rendition of "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend," that immortal anthem to non-liquid assets.
That number was performed by Megan Hilty, who as the gold-digging Lorelei Lee gave an original, audacious comic performance that, for the moment, wiped out memories of Carol Channing and Marilyn Monroe, her indelible predecessors in the role. It felt like one of those fabled performances (much cherished by theatergoers) that in a single, golden night thrust its leading lady into the firmament of musical stage stardom.
And at the final curtain, we stayed in our seats.
We whooped, we roared, we wolf-whistled. Our applause might well have sent tremors all the way to Battery Park. But no one, as far as I could tell, was standing up. "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" had been accorded the five-star tribute of a sitting ovation. 
I would like to make the case, officially and urgently, for the return of the sitting ovation. Because we really have reached the point where a standing ovation doesn't mean a thing. Pretty much every show you attend on Broadway these days ends with people jumping to their feet and beating their flippers together like captive sea lions whose zookeeper has arrived with a bucket of fish. This is true even for doomed stinkers that find the casts taking their curtain calls with the pale, hopeless mien of patients who have just received a terminal diagnosis.
The s.o. (if I may so refer to a phenomenon that no longer warrants the respect of its full name) has become a reflexive social gesture, like shaking hands with the host at the end of a party.
Or, to put in cruder and more extreme terms, it's like having sex with someone on the first date, whether you like the person or not, because you think it's expected of you.
The reasons for the ubiquity of the promiscuous s.o. have been widely pondered by cultural pundits. One theory has it that it's because habitual theatergoers have become a relative rarity. Many of the people who attend big Broadway shows are tourists whose itinerary includes, along with visits to the Statue of Liberty and the Hard Rock Caf, a performance of "Wicked" or "Jersey Boys."
For such audience members, standing up to applaud at the end has become of the Official Broadway Experience. And of course, if you've spent several hundred dollars for that pair of orchestra seats, an s.o. seems to help confirm that the money wasn't wasted.
I also have a suspicion that for some people, standing up immediately at the end of the show is simply a physical relief after an hour or more of immobility. Besides, the sooner you're on your feet, the greater your odds are for beating the crowd to the exits. And, oh yes, let's not discount the domino effect of an s.o.: Once the person in front of you is standing, you too must stand if you want to see what's on stage.
In London, where theater remains a larger and more natural part of the general cultural conversation, the s.o. is less epidemic. True, I have felt its sweaty presence at some of the bigger West End musicals (often imported from Broadway, so perhaps they arrived carrying the virus). But I can't remember the last time I witnessed an s.o. at the National Theater, where the level of professional quality is consistently and rewardingly high.
Admittedly, there are some shows that deserve an s.o., which I don't necessarily mean as a compliment. "Newsies the Musical," in which the characters keep dancing and cartwheeling and jumping all over the place, seems so pathetically eager for an s.o. that to deny it one would be like forbidding an adorable puppy its chew toy. Similarly, Liza Minnelli - whenever and wherever she appears - must receive an s.o. It's part of the unwritten but unbreakable contract between her and her audience (as it was with her mother, Judy Garland).
And then there are - or once were, the old ones tell us -- the meaningful s.o.'s. These were not instantaneous or knee-jerk. Legend has it that on the opening night of Arthur Miller's "Death of a Salesman," the audience was so moved by what it had witnessed that it sat in in shocked silence, collecting itself and drying its tears, before the applause broke out.
I think that people seeing Mike Nichols's current revival of that play may well be similarly moved by the tragedy of Willy Loman, its title character. But at the performance I attended, they were on their feet in a millisecond, as if electrodes had been applied to their legs.
So I can't tell you how heartened I was, at the end of a packed spring theater season, to be part of that seated ovation at "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes." I should point out that among audiences for musicals, those who attend the Encores! productions are probably the most sophisticated and discriminating in town. Many of them know the history, in detail, of the show they're seeing and the resumes of those appearing in it.
But can't we all, please, strive to be a little more like them? I'm not asking for the wholesale abolition of the s.o. That would be a sadly quixotic demand. I'm just asking you, my comrades in urban theatergoing, to think before you stand, if you must stand at all. And to remember, in an age in which the s.o. is as common in a Broadway theater as an endless line for the ladies room at intermission, that staying seated has become the exceptional tribute.
What's your diagnosis for s.o. fever? Do you have any prescriptions for curtailing it? Or do you feel it even needs to be addressed?
A critic's notebook article on Monday about the prevalence of standing ovations at Broadway shows described incorrectly the quickness with which audience members appeared to be on their feet at a performance of the current revival of "Death of a Salesman." Their ovation seemed to occur within a millisecond - one-thousandth of a second - not a megasecond, which is one million seconds.

HEADLINE: HSBC Targets Extra Revenue from Business Units

BYLINE: JULIA WERDIGIER


HIGHLIGHT: The bank has doubled its target to $2 billion for additional revenue HSBC plans to achieve by referring more clients between its investment banking and commercial banking units. 

 BODY:
HSBC doubled its target on Thursday for additional revenue that the bank plans to achieve by referring more clients between its investment banking and commercial banking units.
HSBC said it would generate an additional $1 billion in revenue through efforts like selling more products across the different units and also bringing its commercial banking and private banking operations closer together, especially in emerging markets.
Updating investors on its progress after the first year of a three-year reorganization that includes job cuts and asset sales to increase profitability, HSBC said it was content with what it had achieved so far.
"We made encouraging progress," Stuart T. Gulliver, the chief executive, said on a conference call with journalists. "I think we surprised in how fast we can execute."
HSBC said it had sold or exited businesses through a total of 28 transactions since the beginning of last year and would continue to do so at a similar pace over the next two years. Mr. Gulliver said the bank was watching some products at its global banking unit, which might become unprofitable because of stricter regulation or changing consumer demands.
HSBC has sold about $6 billion worth of assets since the beginning of last year, including the sale of its credit card unit in the United States to Capital One Financial and its upstate New York branch network to the First Niagara Financial Group. It also agreed to sell its general insurance businesses in Asia and Latin America in March and its businesses in Costa Rica, El Salvador and Honduras in January.
"We have to keep the intensity of the program up," said Mr. Gulliver, who described the effort as the bank's "biggest reshaping in at least 32 years."
HSBC, which is based in London but generates most of its earnings from Asia, said it expected to have $3.5 billion in savings by the end of 2013, the top end of the range it gave last year.
Mr. Gulliver said the biggest threats to HSBC's strategy were the situation in the euro zone and questions about "whether Greece stays in and whether firewalls are large enough to protect Spain."
HSBC confirmed its target for return on equity, a measure of profitability, of 12 to 15 percent; it had an 11 percent rate last year.

HEADLINE: Investigating JPMorgan Chase

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: Since the company operates with implicit government backing, its recent trading losses demand an independent inquiry on five specific questions, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
JPMorgan Chase is too big to fail. As the largest bank holding company in the United States, with assets approaching $2.5 trillion as reported under standard American accounting principles, it is inconceivable that JPMorgan Chase would be allowed to collapse now or in the near future. The damage to the American economy and to the world would be too great.
The company's recent trading losses therefore call for greater public scrutiny than would be the case for most private enterprise - and demand an independent investigation into exactly what happened. (Dennis Kelleher of Better Markets has already called for exactly this.)
The investigation begun by the F.B.I. is unlikely to be sufficiently public. Given the strong political connections between JPMorgan Chase and the Obama administration, it would also be better to have an investigation led by a completely independent counsel.
Hopefully, too-big-to-fail is not forever. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is working on a mechanism that could conceivably allow that agency to handle the "failure" of a bank holding company while protecting the creditors of operating subsidiaries - limiting the potential contagion effect.
But this mechanism is not yet in place. It does not now apply to cross-border banking (remember that JPMorgan Chase's losses are in London), and even the F.D.I.C.'s acting chairman, Martin J. Gruenberg, was careful in describing its likely efficacy in a speech last week.
(Disclosure: I'm on the F.D.I.C.'s Systemic Resolution Advisory Committee, and I've worked with the F.D.I.C. with some outreach activities intended to help the agency receive constructive feedback on resolution. I am not paid by the F.D.I.C.)
In effect, JPMorgan Chase operates with the implicit backing of the United States government - primarily in the form of actual and potential access to borrowing from the Federal Reserve, with the implication that the Treasury could also provide support.

Being effectively backed by the full faith and credit of the government is a great help; it lowers a bank's financing costs because it reduces the risk to creditors. JPMorgan Chase and the other big banks in the American economy are effectively government-sponsored (and subsidized) enterprises.
There is no kind of market involved in determining the franchise value of mega-banks; this is a government subsidy scheme, pure and simple. People on the right of the political spectrum understand this, as do people on the left; see my blog post last week on the extent of cross-partisan agreement on this issue.
I would add to that list former Gov. Mike Huckabee, the Arkansas Republican. When I appeared on his radio show on Monday afternoon, we were in complete agreement on the need to break up or otherwise constrain the size of big banks.
There are many unanswered questions about the JPMorgan Chase losses and a great deal of informed guesswork about exactly what went wrong. By his own account, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive, was unaware of what was happening on the relevant trading desk until Bloomberg News reporters brought it to his attention.
At that time, he dismissed any concerns as a "tempest in a teapot." In the weeks after, this supposed "hedge" - or risk-reduction strategy - blew up badly.
The question is not why a trader made a mistake; this can happen anywhere. The issue is how this was handled and reported by JPMorgan Chase's risk-management professionals and their systems - believed by many insiders to be the best in the business.
Here are five questions that an independent investigation should consider:
1. What exactly was the trade? Who approved and reviewed the trade?
2. To what extent were the mistakes encouraged or condoned by particular quantitative models -- for example, those popularly known as value-at-risk? (For a critique, see Pablo Triana's book, "The Number That Killed Us.")
3. What did Mr. Dimon know and when did he know it? Was there disclosure to the board and to shareholders with appropriate timing? This is among the specific concerns raised by Mr. Kelleher.
4. Does the board have adequate depth of experience along the relevant dimensions of risk management?
5. What interactions did Mr. Dimon or any of his colleagues have with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York before and while these losses were incurred? Mr. Dimon is on the board of that institution, where his role is described as advisory. But on what exactly did he advise them in recent months and years, particularly with regard to risk management and capital levels in systemically important banks?
On the one hand, we hear from bankers that supervisors are watching them closely - and even undermining their business. On the other hand, clearly someone was not paying attention. Why not?
This is not about conducting a witch hunt. It is about establishing the facts and understanding if anything about standard operating procedures and emergency protocols should be examined.
The right analogy is National Transportation Safety Board investigations - a suggestion that has been made by Andrew Lo, my colleague at M.I.T., and his co-authors. We learn a great deal when companies actually go bankrupt; e.g., about Enron (see the excellent book "The Smartest Guys in the Room," by Bethany McLean and Peter Elkind) and about Lehman (see the bankruptcy examiner's report).
But we need to investigate near-misses as well.
This is awkward for the White House - look at any of Ben White's recent articles on the links between Wall Street and the Obama administration. But the power of big banks on Wall Street makes this kind of investigation even more necessary - see the reporting of Matt Taibbi for some graphic details.
Congress may also want to get involved, at least to understand if Dodd-Frank has been at all helpful. The Volcker Rule is not yet in effect but, if it were, would this have made a difference?
Mr. Dimon contends not, and he has been a consistent and vociferous opponent of the rule from the very beginning. It would seem foolhardy to accept Mr. Dimon's view on this matter at face value. I testified in favor of the Volcker Rule before the Senate Banking Committee in early 2010; Barry Zubrow, then chief risk officer of JPMorgan Chase, testified and strongly opposed it.
Some people in the private sector and within the banking community will push back, asserting that this would further expand the scope of government vis--vis legitimate private business. This misses the point -- that it is the people who run our largest banks who have undermined the viability of the private sector and who threaten its future.
Cam Fine, president of the Independent Community Bankers of America, has shown strong leadership on this point over the last week (you can follow him at @Cam_Fine on Twitter).
In the end, we may well come to the same conclusion as Elizabeth Warren - who has brilliantly seized the political moment and put her opponent for the Senate seat from Massachusetts, the Republican incumbent Scott Brown, on the defensive.
Ms. Warren is calling for the re-imposition of Glass-Steagall - separating commercial from investment banking. Mr. Fine is already pushing in the same direction. This position should be appealing across the political spectrum.

HEADLINE: Fitch Warns Banks Must Raise $566 Billion in New Capital

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The world's largest banks must raise a combined $566 billion to satisfy new capital requirements, Fitch Ratings says, as the authorities press firms to hold more cash in reserve to protect against future financial shocks. 

 BODY:
9:38 a.m. | Updated 
The world's largest banks must raise a combined $566 billion to satisfy new capital requirements, Fitch Ratings said on Thursday, as the authorities demand that banks hold more cash in reserve to protect against future financial shocks.
The figure represents a 23 percent increase on what the banks currently hold in reserve and will most likely reduce return on equity, a critical figure used to gauge a firm's profitability, Fitch said.
The banks affected are the 29 "systemically important financial institutions" as designated by the global Financial Stability Board. They include the likes of Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, HSBC of Britain and the Mizuho Financial Group of Japan. In total, the firms hold roughly $47 trillion in combined assets.
Under new regulatory rules, known as Basel III, the firms must have a Tier 1 common equity ratio, a measure of a bank's ability to weather financial shocks, of roughly 9.5 percent by 2019, though officials are eager for banks to meet the targets as soon as possible.
To meet the deadline, Fitch says the 29 banks will probably hold onto future earnings and cut shareholder dividends, wind down exposure to risky investments like underperforming real estate portfolios, and tap investors for new cash.
As firms pull back from riskier sectors, the new regulatory regime may lead to increased borrowing costs, a tightening in the availability of credit and a shift of capital markets funding to less-regulated areas of the financial system, like from hedge funds and private equity firms, the ratings agency's report said.
Banks in the United States and Europe are already working to meet the new capital requirements, and have been selling noncore assets, paring back lending to the wider economy and reworking their balance sheets to find new sources of cash.
There is still a lot to get through. European banks, for example, still hold more than 2.5 trillion euros ($3.2 trillion) of noncore loans on their balance sheets, according to the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers.
The push for banks to hold more money in reserve, instead of lending out the cash for a profit, will also affect profitability, according to the Fitch report. Once the Basel III rules are in place, the stricter capital requirements could reduce the median return on equity to 9 percent from current returns of approximately 11 percent. That represents a potential 20 percent reduction in profitability within the next decade.
"Single digit return on equity reasonably could be the rule of the day," said Martin Hansen, senior director in Fitch's macro credit research team. "The recent high historical returns may be difficult to achieve."

HEADLINE: The Early Word: Gloves Off

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
In Today's Times:
A group of high-profile Republican strategists is working with a conservative billionaire on a proposal to mount one of the most aggressive and provocative campaigns of the "super PAC" era and attack President Obama in ways that Republicans have so far shied away from. Jeff Zeleny reports on the detailed advertising strategy, commissioned by Joe Ricketts, the founder of TD Ameritrade, that is laid out in a proposal titled "The Defeat of Barack Hussein Obama: The Ricketts Plan to End his Spending for Good." 
The 2012 presidential campaign is already quickly becoming more expensive than 2008, as President Obama, his Republican rival, Mitt Romney, and their respective allies spend millions of dollars on advertisements to lure voters in states that will be pivotal in the elections in November, Jeremy W. Peters writes. 
President Obama's meeting with Congressional leaders offered a preview of what is expected to be another protracted showdown over the debt ceiling, Helene Cooper writes. Republicans including Mr. Romney, the presumptive nominee, seem eager to heat up the debate by summer, instead of after the November elections, when the federal government's borrowing limit will need to be increased to prevent the United States from defaulting on its obligations.
The reverberations of State Senator Deb Fischer's upset win in Nebraska's Republican Senate primary on Tuesday carried all the way to South Carolina, the home of Representative Jim DeMint, who saw his pick to win the race land in a distant third place. Jonathan Weisman explains that Mr. DeMint's efforts to be a kingmaker for Republican candidates outside of the establishment have irked the party's leaders and have had only mixed success.
House Republicans approved a somewhat scaled-back version of the Violence Against Women Act on Wednesday, despite calls from Democrats to approve a more expansive version that passed the Senate with bipartisan support, Robert Pear reports. The debate over the bill is the latest front in the battle for female voters, with Republicans saying their version protects women and taxpayers, and Democrats arguing that protections in the Senate bill for lesbians, American Indians and immigrants are necessary to better address loopholes in current domestic violence law.
Georgetown University's invitation to Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, to speak at the commencement ceremony at the Jesuit college on Friday has outraged some Roman Catholics who have accused her of being a traitor to the faith for her support of abortion rights and defense of President Obama's health care overhaul law. Laurie Goodstein reports on the controversy.
Happening in Washington:
Economic reports expected Thursday include weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m., followed at 10 by leading indicators for April and weekly mortgage rates.
The House is expected to continue debating the National Defense Authorization Act, legislation to authorize and finance military programs for 2013, with votes possible on amendments.
Michael J. Astrue, commissioner of the Social Security Administration, will testify before the Senate Finance Committee at a 10 a.m. hearing examining the health of the program. In April, the Obama administration said the program was running out of money faster than previously anticipated.
Also at 10, the House Financial Services Committee will look at federal regulators' settlement practices. The witness list includes officials from the Federal Reserve Bank and the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as a few academics.

HEADLINE: Agilent to Buy Dako for $2.2 Billion

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: Agilent Technologies, a maker of scientific instruments, has agreed to buy Dako, a Danish cancer diagnostics company, for $2.2 billion. 

 BODY:
Agilent Technologies, a maker of scientific instruments, agreed on Thursday to buy Dako, a Danish cancer diagnostics company, for $2.2 billion.
The acquisition is the largest ever by Agilent, which was spun out of Hewlett-Packard more than a decade ago and posted revenue of $6.6 billion last year.
Under the terms of the deal, Agilent, based in Santa Clara, Calif., will pay cash for Dako, currently owned by the Swedish private equity firm EQT.
The transaction is the latest in a flurry of deals in the health care sector, which continues to show signs off growth despite concerns about the broader economy. Last month, Nestl agreed to buy Pfizer's infant nutrition business for $11.9 billion, while the drug maker AstraZeneca also announced a $1.26 billion takeover of Ardea Biosciences.
Agilent said it was buying Dako to expand its presence in the life sciences industry.
"In the rapidly growing diagnostics market, Dako's products and capabilities are a strategic complement to Agilent's existing offerings," Agilent's chief executive, William P. Sullivan, said in a statement. "Agilent's strategy in acquiring Dako is about strengthening the company's presence in life science and about revenue growth."
Dako, which was bought by EQT in 2007, provides antibodies, scientific instruments and software pathology laboratories as part of the diagnosis of cancer. It has annual revenue of more than $300 million and employs about 1,000 people, primarily in Denmark and California.
The acquisition is expected to close by the end of July.
Credit Suisse and the law firm Cleary Gottlieb advised Agilent on the deal, while Goldman Sachs and the law firm Davis Polk advised EQT.

HEADLINE: Romney Rejects Using the Rev. Jeremiah Wright Against Obama

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: "I repudiate the effort by that PAC to promote an ad strategy of the nature they've described," said Mitt Romney 

 BODY:
12:48 p.m. | Updated Mitt Romney condemned efforts to use President Obama's former pastor, the Reverend Jeremiah Wright, in ads attacking the president, as reportedly planned by a "super PAC" working toward electing Mr. Romney in November.
"I repudiate the effort by that PAC to promote an ad strategy of the nature they've described," Mr. Romney said during an interview with the conservative Townhall Web site. "I would like to see this campaign focus on the economy, on getting people back to work, on seeing rising incomes and growing prosperity -- particularly for those in the middle class of America."
Mr. Romney used the opportunity to accuse Mr. Obama of running a "campaign is a campaign of character assassination" but said of the PAC that "I repudiate what they're thinking about."
Earlier, Mr. Romney's campaign manager, Matt Rhoades, said that "Gov. Romney is running a campaign based on jobs and the economy, and we encourage everyone else to do the same."
The Times's Jeff Zeleny and Jim Rutenberg Thursday morning on a plan by a group of Republican strategists to run ads linking Mr. Obama to his former pastor. A copy of the group's detailed advertising plan, obtained by The Times, suggests using Mr. Wright's "black liberation" rhetoric against the president, who attended Mr. Wright's church for years.
In a statement issued Thursday afternoon, a spokesman for Joe Ricketts, the billionaire to whom the super PAC proposal was made, said Mr. Ricketts had no interest in financing the plan.
"Joe Ricketts is a registered independent, a fiscal conservative, and an outspoken critic of the Obama Administration, but he is neither the author nor the funder of the so-called "Ricketts Plan" to defeat Mr. Obama that The New York Times wrote about this morning," said Brian Baker, the president of the Ending Spending Action Fund.
"It reflects an approach to politics that Mr. Ricketts rejects and it was never a plan to be accepted but only a suggestion for a direction to take," Mr. Baker said.
As Mr. Romney's campaign confronts the story about the super PAC's plans, its response may be constrained by the forceful denunciation of that very tactic by the Republican Party's former presidential nominee.
In 2008, Senator John McCain forbade his advisers from using Mr. Obama's association with Mr. Wright in campaign commercials. But his direction was not only made in private. Mr. McCain spoke forcefully - and publicly - in defense of his Democratic rival.
Speaking on Fox News four years ago, Mr. McCain said that he did not believe Mr. Obama should be held accountable for the things that Mr. Wright said from the pulpit, despite Mr. Obama's attendance at the church for years.
"When people support you, it doesn't mean that you support everything they say," Mr. McCain said in the interview. Noting the incendiary language that Mr. Wright used, Mr. McCain said: "Obviously, those words and those statements are statements that none of us would associate ourselves with. I don't believe that Senator Obama would support any of those as well."
Given repeated opportunities by Sean Hannity, the Fox host, to link Mr. Obama to Mr. Wright, Mr. McCain steadfastly defended his rival, saying "I do know Senator Obama. He does not share those views."
Later in the campaign, Mr. McCain again said he did not believe that Mr. Obama shared Mr. Wright's views about America, though he said Mr. Obama had acknowledged the issue was a legitimate one for people to consider.
"I don't believe that Senator Obama shares his views in any way," Mr. McCain said. "But he has said it's a legitimate topic of discussion. If that's what the American people want to discuss, that's fine."
Statements like that from Mr. McCain may be part of the reason Mr. Romney's campaign quickly rejected the idea of using Mr. Wright as a way of attacking the president. Already, advisers to Mr. Obama have raised the question of whether Mr. Romney will speak out like Mr. McCain did.
"Stunning! Will Mitt stand up, as John McCaln did? Or allow the purveyors of slime to operate on his behalf?" David Axelrod, a senior campaign adviser to Mr. Obama, wrote on Twitter early Thursday morning.
Mr. Romney's campaign may also fear shifting the conversation of the campaign away from the economy, where advisers believe the president has a weak and indefensible record. Mr. Romney has, for example, shied away from discussing the same-sex marriage issue, preferring to keep his attention focused on the economy.
Mr. Romney declined to answer a question about the report when asked about it, saying he had not read the story.
In a statement Mr. Obama's campaign manager, Jim Messina, slammed the super PAC's plans and criticized Mr. Romney for not publicly condemning the effort in person. 
"This morning's story revealed the appalling lengths to which Republican operatives and SuperPacs apparently are willing to go to tear down the President and elect Mitt Romney," Mr. Messina wrote.
He added: "It also reflects how far the party has drifted in four short years since John McCain rejected these very tactics. Once again, Governor Romney has fallen short of the standard that John McCain set, reacting tepidly in a moment that required moral leadership in standing up to the very extreme wing of his own party."
Mr. McCain, in a statement provided to The Times by his spokesman, said he stands by his opposition to using Mr. Wright against the president.
"Senator McCain is very proud of the campaign he ran in 2008," said Brian Rogers, the spokesman. "He stands by the decisions he made during that race and would make them again today."

HEADLINE: A Modestly Strong Batch of New Data

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: The Times's weekly tracker suggests that job growth this month may be slightly stronger than forecast a week ago. 

 BODY:
The latest batch of economic data has been slightly better than expected, causing Moody's Analytics to raise its forecast for May job growth to 170,000, up from 165,000 last week. 
"The best evidence comes from surveys of builders and manufacturers," Moody's economists write. The surveys suggest that "April's slowdown in factory hiring was a temporary phenomenon."
One sign of the likely strengthening of the job market since April, when the economy added only 115,000 jobs, came in this morning's report on new claims for unemployment benefits. Last week, 370,000 people applied for initial benefits, compared with 389,000 a month earlier. Because last week included the 12th day of the month, it is the week on which the May monthly jobs report will be based.

The latest data do not change the larger picture, though. Moody's forecasts average monthly job growth of 183,000 in the six months between now and election day (virtually unchanged from 182,000 a week ago). As I noted last week in the debut of The Times's new Jobs Tracker:
History suggests that this year's election will probably be very close if the economy adds 100,000 to 175,000 jobs a month in the six months before Election Day. (These benchmarks come from work by Nate Silver, of The Times's FiveThirtyEight blog.) Job growth above 175,000 would tend to make President Obama a favorite. Growth below 100,000 would make Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, the favorite .
Historically, nothing - not social issues, campaign advertisements or gaffes - has influenced voters more heavily than the direction of the economy in an election year. In only three races since World War II has the outcome been different from what the economy's direction would have suggested: 1952 (when the popular Dwight D. Eisenhower was running), 1968 (when the Vietnam War hobbled the Democrats) and 1976 (when Watergate hobbled the Republicans).
For now, the forecast suggests that the pace of job growth will be a modest help to Mr. Obama in November. Although the direction of the economy, rather than overall condition, has traditionally been the best predictor of elections, the fact that the last few years have been so rough could obviously complicate the situation this year.

HEADLINE: Billionaire Rejects Proposal to Revive Jeremiah Wright Controversy

BYLINE: JIM RUTENBERG and JEFF ZELENY


HIGHLIGHT: Joe Ricketts, the billionaire behind the proposal to run ads highlighting President Obama's relationship with the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright, has released a statement disavowing the politics it represents. 

 BODY:
5:19 p.m. | Updated Joe Ricketts, the billionaire behind the proposal to run ads highlighting President Obama's relationship with the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright, has released a statement disavowing the politics it represents. The statement, released through Brian Baker, president of his "Super PAC," the Ending Spending Action Fund, asserts that the proposal was merely that.
Joe Ricketts is a registered independent, a fiscal conservative and an outspoken critic of the Obama administration, but he is neither the author nor the funder of the so-called Ricketts Plan to defeat Mr. Obama that The New York Times wrote about this morning. Not only was this plan merely a proposal - one of several submitted to the Ending Spending Action Fund by third-party vendors - but it reflects an approach to politics that Mr. Ricketts rejects and it was never a plan to be accepted but only a suggestion for a direction to take. Mr. Ricketts intends to work hard to help elect a president this fall who shares his commitment to economic responsibility, but his efforts are and will continue to be focused entirely on questions of fiscal policy, not attacks that seek to divide us socially or culturally. 
But in an interview on Wednesday evening, Mr. Baker did not reject the contents of the advertising proposal. The statement from Mr. Baker was released on Thursday as the Ricketts family sought to respond to the fallout from the story.
The proposal, however, indicates that Mr. Ricketts was more than a passing participant.
It opens with a quote from Mr. Ricketts saying if an advertisement about Rev. Wright that Mr. McCain's team had produced four years ago - which Mr. McCain rejected - had aired, "They'd never have elected Barack Obama."
And, a note about staffing for the effort reads, "With your preliminary approval at the New York meeting, we have discussed this plan in highly confidential terms with the following proposed team members. All are ready to jump into action upon plan approval."
Two members of the Ricketts family on Thursday distanced themselves from the political discussion, but not the family.
A furor erupted in Chicago - Mr. Obama's hometown - over the disclosure of the advertising plan. The Ricketts family, which owns the Chicago Cubs, suddenly became entangled in city politics because the Cubs are pursuing city and state assistance for a $300 million renovation of Wrigley Field. 
Tom Ricketts, the chairman of the Chicago Cubs, issued a statement, saying: "I repudiate any return to racially divisive issues in this year's presidential campaign or in any setting-like my father has.
"My focus is on one of the great American pastimes, baseball. And our team and every other Major League Baseball team are great examples of people of diverse backgrounds working together towards a common goal. I shall have no further comment on this or any other election year political issue. My full-time focus is on making the Chicago Cubs a World Series champion preserving Wrigley Field and making the Chicago Cubs a great corporate citizen."
Laura Ricketts, a Chicago lawyer who is a member of the National Finance Committee for the President Obama's re-election campaign, did not distance herself from her family in a statement.
 "All of my family members and I love this country and are passionate about doing what is right for the country. That love of country was instilled in us by my father. We have different political views on how to achieve what is best for the future of America, but we agree that each of us is entitled to our own views and our right to voice those views.
 "Though we may have diverse political views, above all we love and respect each other.
 "My own personal view is that President Obama has been a great leader in very difficult times. He has been leading us to an economic recovery; served with great honor as commander-in-chief during a time of war; been a strong proponent on issues important to women and just last week he exhibited great courage in endorsing the freedom to marry for Gay and Lesbian Americans.
"I am doing all that I can to help President Obama get re-elected because it is what I believe is best for America."

HEADLINE: How to Energize the Liberal Base

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: Attacking the president by dredging up the Jeremiah Wright controversy is bad political strategy. 

 BODY:
Fred Davis is a lousy political strategist.
That's my takeaway from today's Times story on how Mr. Davis, a high-profile Republican consultant, is working with Joe Ricketts, the founder of TD Ameritrade, "on a proposal to mount one of the most provocative campaigns of the 'super PAC' era"-namely commercials "linking Mr. Obama to incendiary comments by his former spiritual adviser, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. "
There is no doubt that the proposal, titled " The Defeat of Barack Hussein Obama: The Ricketts Plan to End His Spending for Good," is "provocative," as the Times story put it. (Note the use of the president's middle name. Nudge, nudge. Think of Saddam Hussein. Nudge, nudge. He must be a Muslim.)

But after reading the "storyboard" for the ad, I'm amazed that anyone would actually think it could hurt the president's re-election chances.
The proposed ad spins off Mr. Wright's comments from many years ago, including his infamous "God Damn America" remark. "Week after week, year after year, he heard the hatred," the script reads. "He was taught for years that America WAS the problem, so how could he ever believe it could be the solution?" 
The week after week bit is not true. It's not even clear that Mr. Obama heard the "God damn" remark. But, regardless, the Wright connection was barely relevant four years ago. It's completely irrelevant now.
The middle of the attack ad is a diatribe against Mr. Obama's economic policies - the stimulus was a failure, along with the health reform law; he added more to the national debt than any previous president; and he's done nothing to boost job growth. Sound familiar? It should, because these distortions feature in pretty much every other anti-Obama ad that's already run or is in the works.
The only thing the Davis spot adds to previous attacks is the race angle. And lest readers think I'm crazy to see a racist aspect to the proposal-his team was well aware that they'd be charged with race-baiting. According to the Times story, the group even "suggested hiring as a spokesman an 'extremely literate African-American' who can argue that Mr. Obama misled the nation by presenting himself as a 'metrosexual, black Abe Lincoln.'" I know I'm not the only one who thinks a metrosexual, black Abe Lincoln sounds awesome.
John McCain rejected this tactic in 2008: He refused to run an ad tarring Mr. Obama by association. Perhaps because he knew it would backfire. But the Davis team thinks that's why he lost. "Our plan is to do exactly what John McCain would not let us do: Show the world how Barack Obama's opinions of America and the world were formed," the proposal says.
I guess there were people in 2008 who thought Mr. Obama's membership in Mr. Wright's congregation meant he was some kind of sleeper agent bent on destroying America. But the only voters who could possibly believe that now are fringe right-wingers who would never support Mr. Obama, anyway. If Mr. Obama wanted to destroy America, wouldn't he have done that already?
The proposed ad plays right into the liberal conviction that racial paranoia motivates much of the aggressive opposition to Mr. Obama. It might even be just the thing to fire up a liberal base that has been a bit slow in rallying around the president.
While I was writing this post, Mitt Romney condemned the proposal.
"I repudiate the effort by that PAC to promote an ad strategy of the nature they've described," Mr. Romney said during an interview with the conservative Townhall Web site.
But let's not forget that, in February, he told Sean Hannity "I'm not sure which is worse, him listening to Reverend Wright or him saying that we must be a less than Christian nation."
Mr. Ricketts also distanced himself from the proposal.
The president of his super PAC, Brian Baker, said in a statement: "Not only was this plan merely a proposal - one of several submitted to the Ending Spending Action fund by third party vendors, but it reflects an approach to politics that Mr. Ricketts rejects."
I have to wonder why Mr. Baker didn't explain that to the reporters who interviewed him Wednesday evening, before the PAC got a half-day's free publicity for the sort of "approach to politics that Mr. Ricketts rejects."

HEADLINE: Behind a Band's Stunt, an Entrenched World of Ticket Fees

BYLINE: BEN SISARIO


HIGHLIGHT: String Cheese Incident, a jam band from Colorado, recently made a symbolic protest against Ticketmaster, but the surcharges that Ticketmaster collects feed many mouths in the music industry. 

 BODY:
In an age when almost all concert tickets are bought online and come with a heavy surcharge, what can a lowly band do for its fans? Perhaps the only way left for an act to assert control is simply to walk up to a box office and hand over cash.
That seems an almost quaintly old-fashioned solution, but it was central to one band's recent scheme to circumvent Ticketmaster's surcharges.
As I wrote in Wednesday's paper, String Cheese Incident, a jam band from Colorado with a long history of conflict with Ticketmaster, recently had some friends and fans buy $20,000 in tickets from the Greek Theater in Los Angeles and then resold them more cheaply through its own Web site.
Since the article ran, a number of readers have asked for more information about how ticketing works, and why the surcharges exist in the first place. It's a complicated story, but one that any music fan should probably know about.
There are two basic reasons for the surcharges. One is convenience (yours). The other is profit (for several parties).
It can be easy to forget, but vendors like Ticketmaster save you time and effort. They act as intermediaries with theater box offices, selling tickets via a phone call or mouse click so you can avoid spending a rainy Saturday morning waiting in line at a theater 15 miles from home. That's a service for your convenience, and you pay for it.
But why so much? For String Cheese Incident's show at the Greek, the face value for two tickets is $99.90, but by the end of the order Ticketmaster charges $130.25 - a markup of 30 percent, typical for Ticketmaster as well as any number of other companies.
One of the semi-dirty secrets of the concert industry is that when it comes to ticket surcharges, Ticketmaster - by design - tends to suffer the most curses and shaken fists, but there are several other hands in the pot. Ticketmaster takes its cut for handling the order; so do credit card companies. But the theater hosting the event also gets a fee in exchange for giving Ticketmaster the right - usually exclusive - to sell its tickets. The promoter of the concert, which books the acts and takes the greatest financial risk, also takes a cut. Depending on the show, there may be other interested parties as well.
Performers, however, are generally excluded from these fees. That's because they get most of the face value of the ticket - in this case the $99.90, before the 30 percent in charges are added on. Decades ago bands and promoters used to split this money more evenly, but as the economics of the industry have changed - largely through national consolidation and more competitive bidding - the balance has shifted to the benefit of the bands, with major acts routinely getting 90 percent, or even more.
Because of this, every other party involved in a show must find other ways to make money, and the easiest way to do that is through surcharges. That's why Ticketmaster and many promoters oppose String Cheese Incident's requests to sell up to 50 percent of their tickets themselves, without service fees. If they do, then a show's promoter, theater and ticketer would lose half the income they would normally make on such sales. In the thin margins of concert promotion, that can mean the difference between profit and loss.
To get its tickets for the Greek, String Cheese Incident exploited a loophole in the system: many box offices waive or greatly reduce surcharges for walk-up sales. But in this case, even that loophole had a loophole. The Greek's box office normally charges $3 per ticket on walk-ups. But Mike Luba, one of the managers of String Cheese Incident, said the band was able to get that fee waived for its shows. The Greek did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday's article.
As pointed out in the article, the tickets String Cheese Incident resells on its site are not totally without extra charges. Although there are no service fees, the band charges $12 shipping per order.

HEADLINE: Rival Views of the Fight for the House

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: The party chairmen of the Congressional campaign committees offer their views of the 2012 race for the House. 

 BODY:
In one view of the political universe, voters in November will continue to dismantle the Democratic Party's presence in the House by sending more conservative Republicans to wage an ideological war against spending, taxes, big government and social engineering.
In another view, the voters this fall will rebel against a do-nothing Republican leadership in the House, tossing out Speaker John A. Boehner and the Tea Party-backed lawmakers whose refusal to compromise has led to stalemate in the Capitol.
Both can't be right, of course. 
The first is the view of Representative Pete Sessions of Texas, the man charged with helping to elect Republicans in the House and ensuring that Mr. Boehner retains the speaker's gavel.
The second is how Representative Steve Israel of New York sees things. He's the Democratic counterpart to Mr. Sessions, with the responsibility of adding 25 or more Democrats to his party's ranks in the House and restoring Nancy Pelosi to the speaker's office.
Reality is likely to be somewhere in the middle. But with six months to go before Election Day, Mr. Sessions and Mr. Israel are, for now, unwilling to move off their optimistic talking points.
In separate interviews with The Caucus at the Capitol on Wednesday, Mr. Sessions and Mr. Israel both made clear they intended to wage a fierce - and well-funded - effort to win the 50 to 75 most hotly contested races that will determine who controls the House.
Mr. Sessions insists that the Republicans will actually add to their ranks after historic gains two years ago. Even his boss, Mr. Boehner, isn't prepared to make that prediction, saying recently that he thinks the Democrats have a 30 percent chance of retaking the House in the fall.
"I'm the only person in Washington that believes we are going to pick up seats," Mr. Sessions said.
Mr. Israel offers what he says is a more pragmatic assessment, admitting that he can't guarantee that the Democrats will seize control of the chamber again. But he predicts that his party will have a good night nonetheless, winning back plenty of seats it lost two years ago.
"I will sign an affadavit that it will be razor close," he said.
Here's an edited transcript of the conversations with the two committee chairmen:
Q: Who will control the House after November's elections? 
SESSIONS: I've looked at this. I have analyzed it. I have been all across the country. I'm in Congressional seats every week and talking to people. I believe we have the will to win, and I believe we will.
ISRAEL: The House is in range, the House is in play. We've taken it from our 20-yard line to their 20-yard line, and the goal is in view. Unlike the chest-thumping bravado of my counterparts in the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee, I prefer to be realistic. If Pete Sessions, my counterpart, is including the redistricting on the planet Pluto, then maybe he's accurate. I don't think that's right.
Q: What are a few bellwether districts that we should watch to see how things are going?
SESSIONS: Utah's 2nd District (Jim Matheson, Democratic incumbent, versus Mia Love, Republican challenger) and Illinois's 12th District (Jerry Plummer, the Republican, versus Brad Harriman, the Democrat). Those two seats will tell us whether we are going to win big across the country and hold what we have got.
ISRAEL: California's 10th District (Jeff Denham, the Republican, versus Jose Hernandez, the Democrat); Illinois's 8th District (Joe Walsh, the Republican, versus Tammy Duckworth, the Democrat); and New York's 25th District (Daniel Maffei, the Democrat, versus Ann Marie Buerkle, the Republican). Those are three districts - California, Illinois, New York - that are bellwether and should tell us the story of whether we are going to get the 25.
Q: What's the defining issue in all of these races?
SESSIONS: I think the choice really will be down to the direction we are headed and the results that we've achieved. If we're going to have a better shot at a brighter future, we have to employ 2.5 million more people. And that's where, then, the policies like the Keystone pipeline come into play. I would be for their agenda too if it worked. But it doesn't work.
ISRAEL: Every election is about who you are for. The Tea Party Republicans have shown us they are for millionaires versus Medicare. That they are for millionaires versus the middle class. That they are more interested in protecting their own perks and privilege than protecting the people that they represent. That they are about partisan obstruction to the point where they announced yesterday that they are willing to once again downgrade the credit rating of the United States of America and hurt the economy in order to help themselves and their party.
Q: Will your standard-bearer (Mitt Romney or President Obama) be welcomed to campaign with all of your candidates?
SESSIONS: I will give a message right now to Mitt Romney. I hope you come to every single Congressional district in this country where a Republican is running. We want to be seen with Mitt Romney. I wonder how many Democrats will be busy when the president of the United States visits their districts? 
ISRAEL: The question is whether Mitt Romney wants to campaign with these House Republicans. Look, every member of Congress on both sides of the aisle has to do what's best for their districts and best for themselves, in that order. And so I leave those judgements to the individuals. I think this election is going to be about solutions and not endorsements and not who you are standing next to. 
Q: What keeps you up at night worrying?
SESSIONS: The worry is that our young people, as they did four years ago, would hear a promise that comes from someone who is a pied piper that will talk about the easy things in life. Yes, we can. Yes, we can just let the government take control of our life. Yes, we can just give in and all work together and let that 1 percent carry the 99 percent across the line. And yet, tax them and watch them leave.
ISRAEL: Super PACs. I think "super PACs" will transform the landscape for the worse. We did not lose the House in 2010 to Republicans. We lost the House in 2010 to Karl Rove and the Koch brothers, to undisclosed, tainted, stealth money. Many of our members of Congress had double-digit leads in the polls in the last week and then got swept off their feet by six-figure buys by these secret groups. This does keep me up at night.

HEADLINE: Berkshire Bets Again on Newspapers With Media General Deal

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: Media General said on Thursday that it had sold nearly all of its 63 newspaper properties to Berkshire Hathaway for $142 million in cash. 

 BODY:
Berkshire Hathaway's latest deal may have investors wondering: Does Warren E. Buffett want to be a media mogul?
Media General said on Thursday that it had sold nearly all of its 63 newspaper properties, excluding The Tampa Tribune, to Berkshire for $142 million in cash. 
Berkshire is also providing a $400 million loan and a $45 million line of credit. In exchange, it is getting warrants that are convertible to about 19.9 percent of Media General's outstanding shares. Berkshire is also getting a seat on the media company's board.
 Shares in Media General skyrocketed 48 percent, to $4.50, in early trading on Thursday.
It is the second newspaper deal that Berkshire, based in Omaha, has reached in the last six months. In November, Mr. Buffett struck a deal to buy The Omaha World-Herald Company, the publisher of his hometown paper, for a reported $200 million.
Berkshire will fold its new titles, including daily and weekly publications in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Alabama, into its BH Media Group. The Richmond Times-Dispatch and The Winston-Salem Journal are among the papers being sold.
"In towns and cities where there is a strong sense of community, there is no more important institution than the local paper," Mr. Buffett said in a statement. "The many locales served by the newspapers we are acquiring fall firmly in this mold and we are delighted they have found a permanent home with Berkshire Hathaway."
Mr. Buffett had hinted of future newspaper deals at his company's annual shareholders convention this month, telling investors, "We may buy more." 
The billionaire has often reminisced about being a paperboy in his youth -- a newspaper tossing competition featuring Mr. Buffett and his friend Bill Gates was one of the highlights of the investor meeting -- and waxes nostalgic about the decline of newsprint. 
And among Berkshire's older holdings is The Buffalo News and a stake in The Washington Post Company.
Mr. Buffett said at the annual meeting that one of the biggest challenges facing the industry was how to convince customers to pay for news content online, when companies previously gave away the information.
"I don't know of any business plan that has sustained itself that charges in one version and offers the same version free to people," he said.
But Mr. Buffett also argued that local newspapers could still serve as the hub of their communities. While he won't learn anything new about Afghanistan from The Omaha World-Herald, he can find out what is going on in his own backyard.
At the same time, the new deal will give Mr. Buffett exposure to Media General, which is intent on transforming itself into a broadcast and digital media company. Berkshire's financing -- bearing an expensive 10.5 percent initial interest rate -- will be used to repay some of Media General's existing debt.
"We are extremely pleased to enter into a new financing partnership with the highly respected Berkshire Hathaway organization," Marshall N. Morton, Media General's chief executive, said in a statement. "Our new credit agreement addresses Media General's long-term capital needs and provides the company with significant financial and operating flexibility."
Media General was advised by the Peter J. Solomon Company, while JPMorgan Chase arranged the financing.

HIGHLIGHT: Casey Stoner, the two-time MotoGP champion, abruptly announced he would retire at the end of the 2012 race season. 

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
 Casey Stoner, the winner of the 2007 and 2011 MotoGP championships, abruptly announced his retirement Thursday, effective at the end of the 2012 season. Stoner, 26, the rider for Repsol Honda, said at a news conference at the Le Mans circuit in France that he would "go forward in different things in my life." Stoner, an Australian, did not specifically address his motivations for retiring. He has won two of the three races this season, but has suffered from arm fatigue. (MotoGP)
 Ford dealers opened their order books Thursday for the coming C-Max Hybrid family mover. Priced from $25,995 before an undisclosed delivery charge, the hybrid is positioned to undercut the Prius V wagon by $500 when it arrived in showrooms this fall, Ford said. Pricing for the C-Max Energi, the plug-in variant, is expected to be announced closer to its sale date later in the year. (Ford)
 The Union of Concerned Scientists has taken issue with a recent report from the Congressional Budget Office alleging the proposed Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards for 2017-25 would deprive the Highway Trust Fund of $57 billion in revenue from unrealized gasoline taxes. The U.C.S. asserted the shortfall would be closer to $2.5 billion. (Union of Concerned Scientists)
 Enterprise Holdings, the parent company of the Enterprise, Alamo and National car-rental agencies, announced Thursday its acquisition of Mint Cars On-Demand, a peer-to-peer car-sharing service with fleets in New York and Boston. Though the service will continue to operate under its own name, it, along with two other peer-to-peer networks owned by Enterprise Holdings, will be integrated by the end of 2012 under the umbrella Enterprise Car Share name. Enterprise Holdings said terms of the acquisition would not be disclosed. (Enterprise Holdings)
 The National Highway Traffic Safety Agency issued a recommendation Wednesday that all heavy truck rigs and buses be equipped with electronic stability control to prevent rollovers. The department claimed the systems would reduce rollovers by 56 percent annually. The recommendation, which entered the Federal Register Wednesday, was opened to a 90-day public comment period, after which a public hearing would be held at a time and location to be announced in coming weeks.

HEADLINE: Dimon to Appear Before Senate Committee

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS and NELSON D. SCHWARTZ


HIGHLIGHT: Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, will appear before a Senate Banking Committee hearing that will look at the bank's surprise trading loss. 

 BODY:
6:49 p.m. | Updated 
Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, agreed on Thursday to testify before a Congressional committee examining the bank's surprise trading loss.
The Senate Banking Committee will hold the hearing with Mr. Dimon this summer, once it has had separate sessions with the bank's regulators. 
The committee is expected to focus on the trade gone awry and its implications for the future shape of financial regulation.
Jennifer Zuccarrelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan Chase, confirmed that Mr. Dimon would appear. "As always, we will continue to be open and transparent with our regulators and Congress," she said. 
The announcement last week that the nation's largest bank by assets sustained significant losses on its derivatives trading provided fodder for advocates of increased financial regulation. They have cited the incident to underscore the dangers of Wall Street risk taking. The calls for a crackdown have centered on the so-called Volcker Rule, which would ban banks from trading with their own money. Regulators are putting the finishing touches on the rule, a crucial piece of the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul law.
The Senate Banking Committee will kick off a round of Dodd-Frank hearings on Tuesday, when it convenes a panel with the leaders of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The committee will hold a second hearing on June 6 with some of JPMorgan's main regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. 
The hearing featuring Mr. Dimon will come later in the summer. The chairman of the committee, Senator Tim Johnson, has not yet issued a formal invitation and did not specify what day Mr. Dimon would be asked to attend.
 "Our due diligence has made it clear that the banking committee should hear directly from JPMorgan Chase's C.E.O. Jamie Dimon, and following our two Wall Street reform oversight hearings I plan to invite him to testify," Mr. Johnson said in a statement. 
Another Republican member of the committee, Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, initiated the push for a JPMorgan hearing. He also caused something of a storm in Washington on Monday, when he revealed that a regulator from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency had told him that the Volcker Rule would not have applied to the JPMorgan trade. The head of the agency has since acknowledged that the earlier statements to Mr. Corker were premature.
The two Democratic authors of the Volcker rule - Senator Carl Levin of Michigan and Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon - have used the JPMorgan trading blunder as ammunition for their effort. On a conference call with reporters on Thursday, the lawmakers called for the closing of the "JP Morgan Loophole."
In an initial draft, the Volcker Rule allowed banks to hedge their exposure to various risks, as JPMorgan initially did in its trades. But the lawmakers argued that the only kind of hedging permitted for big banks should be for the purpose of neutralizing a specific risk, rather than broad economic concerns, putting the onus on banks to identify that risk. 
"This dramatized the reason why you need a Volcker Rule and makes it much more difficult for the Wall Street lobbying effort to succeed," said Mr. Levin, who wrote a letter with Mr. Merkley on Thursday to top regulators reiterating the message about tighter regulation in the wake of JPMorgan's trading loss. "This is a situation where the law is clear and the history is clear."

HEADLINE: Facebook Raises $16 Billion in I.P.O.

BYLINE: EVELYN M. RUSLI and PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: The initial public offering, priced at $38 a share, values Facebook at $104 billion, putting the social networking company on par with McDonald's, Citigroup and Amazon.com. 

 BODY:
Facebook pulled it off.
As investors raced to buy shares, the sprawling social network raised $16 billion on Thursday, in an initial public offering that valued Facebook at $104 billion.
While the I.P.O. shares, 421 million of them, are being sold at $38 each, the feverish anticipation of their debut could drive them higher on Friday when the stock starts trading about 11 a.m. Newly public technology stocks - particularly ones that have captured investors' attention like Facebook - often achieve double-digit gains in a one-day pop.
 Investors who buy Facebook shares are taking a stake in a unique and potentially valuable business. But they are also exposing themselves to the risks posed by a relatively young company operating in uncharted territory.
The I.P.O. signals a rapid evolution for the company. In just eight years, Facebook has gone from a scrappy college service founded in a Harvard dormitory to the third-largest public offering in the history of the United States, behind General Motors and Visa.
Investors now consider Facebook more stalwart than start-up. At $104 billion, the social network's market value is higher than those of McDonald's, Citigroup, Amazon and all but a handful of other American companies.
"Facebook is here to stay," said Navin Chaddha, a managing director of the Mayfield Fund, a venture capital firm. "It's a virtual economy where people are spending more time than any other Internet property."
Facebook will be celebrating the occasion in the same style on which it built its reputation.
The social network planned to celebrate its 31st "hackathon" on Thursday night, with engineers coding into the wee hours, employees amped up on Red Bull and workers-turned-D.J.'s playing their tunes, Facebook said. Part work, part fun, the Facebook tradition, which will take place in an area of the company's campus known as Hacker Square, encourages employees to do what they do best: brainstorm, design and create.
On Friday, Mark Zuckerberg, the hoodie-wearing founder whose stake after the I.P.O. is worth $19 billion, is set to ring the opening bell for the Nasdaq from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., surrounded by executives, engineers and other employees. Shares of Facebook, which will trade under the ticker FB, will start trading shortly thereafter.
For now, Facebook seems to be a must-own stock.
As the largest player in the social media arena, Facebook has enjoyed blue-chip status from the start, with investors worried about missing out on what could be the next Google. The social network will also soon join the Nasdaq 100, the technology index, so money managers looking to track the benchmark will join the swell of demand in the coming months.
The frenzy for Facebook was on full display in the weeks leading up to its I.P.O.
On May 4, JPMorgan Chase, one of the I.P.O. bankers, redecorated its Manhattan headquarters with a giant Facebook flag and welcomed the company's management team to discuss the scheduled roadshow. Before an equity sales team of 300, Jamie Dimon, the firm's chief executive, made a rare appearance. Alongside him was the deal maker Jimmy Lee, who affectionately called Facebook "the next great blue-chip."
In the weeks that followed, investors packed hotel ballrooms to hear Facebook executives give their pitch. Bankers drew up waiting lists for the events, which included stops in New York, Boston and Palo Alto, Calif.
The tour yielded an avalanche of orders. With investors lining up for shares, Facebook raised its price range and increased the size of its offering. Even so, demand from investors in the United States alone outstripped the number of shares by 30 times, according to one person with knowledge of the situation, who requested anonymity because the matter was private.
On Thursday, the underwriters met one more time at Facebook's headquarters to settle on a final price. The bankers, along with Facebook's chief financial officer, David Ebersman, discussed a price as high as $40 a share, above the estimated range. While demand was strong even at that level, the largest institutional investors, the pillars of any offering, pushed back a bit on the valuation. By early afternoon, the stock price was set at $38.
Facebook landed its record I.P.O. in the face of doubts about the company's main source of revenue: advertising.
After years of courting Madison Avenue, Facebook is still trying to persuade companies to not only build a presence on its site, but spend real dollars on advertising. Just as important, the company has to find ways to insert advertising into its users' activity without making the site cluttered or irritating.
Inconveniently, General Motors, one of the country's biggest advertisers, said this week that it was discontinuing its advertising on Facebook. That amounted to $10 million, a drop in the ocean for Facebook, but it exposed the social network's Achilles' heel. Investors, experts caution, will have to be patient for Madison Avenue to come around.
"It could take many years to calculate Facebook's impact," said Martin Sorrell, the chief executive of WPP, the large advertising company. "There's a lot of pressure for them to monetize their content and demonstrate productivity, but you can't do it overnight."
In addition, Facebook may struggle to generate advertising revenue from the mobile space. Last month, it paid about $1 billion for Instagram, a mobile photo-sharing application that has plenty of users but not a scratch of revenue. Given the growth of smartphone use and the increasing amount of time those devices command, solving the mobile question is widely seen as a necessity, not an option, for Mr. Zuckerberg.
At the moment, investors are willing to give Facebook the benefit of the doubt.
Facebook is set to trade at more than 100 times its earnings for the last 12 months. At that level, investors assume the company will be far more profitable than the rest of corporate America. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index trades at 14 times earnings.
Facebook's fans think the rich valuation is warranted, given the company's prospects for earnings. The company's net income could be $4.5 billion in 2014, up from $1.2 billion last year, according to Ken Sena, an analyst at Evercore Partners.
But Facebook's results will depend on whether companies are willing to shell out their marketing dollars for a chance to reach the social network's 900 million users - and it's not clear advertisers will be willing to pay.
While Facebook is often compared with Google, the search giant has a relatively straightforward, and proven, method of generating most of its advertising revenue. It matches ads with what people are searching for. By contrast, Facebook has the potentially more demanding task of finding ways to insert ads into users' activity without cluttering their experience.
Bullish investors point to Facebook's profit margins, which are much bigger than Google's. "A lot of people don't understand how profitable Facebook is," said Thomas Vandeventer, manager of the Tocqueville Opportunity Fund, which already owns Facebook shares. In 2005, Google's operating profit amounted to 34 percent of its revenue. Last year, Facebook's were 47 percent.
Facebook's user activity could also provide the company with a richer array of data than Google. The company just needs to work out ways of using this data for advertisers.
Facebook, in many ways, is like a mining company sitting on valuable deposits that are hard to dig up and refine. At a market value of $104 billion, investors think Facebook is sitting on gold. But the share price could tumble at any sign that Facebook's management cannot unearth it.

HEADLINE: The Boldface Names on the Witness List for Gupta's Trial

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Possible witnesses who could be called to testify -- or whose names may come up during the trial -- include Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman's chief executive, and A.G. Lafley, the former chief executive of Procter &#038; Gamble. 

 BODY:
The potential witness list has been released for the insider trading trial of Rajat K. Gupta, the former director for Goldman Sachs and Procter & Gamble, and as expected, it is chock full of boldfaced names. 
Possible witnesses who could be called to testify -- or whose names may come up during the trial -- include Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman; Gary D. Cohn, the bank's president; A.G. Lafley, the former chief executive of Procter & Gamble; and Kenneth I. Chenault, the chief executive of American Express. 
The trial of Mr. Gupta, the former global head of the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, is scheduled to start on Monday. He is charged with leaking boardroom secrets to his friend and business associate Raj Rajaratnam, who was convicted last year and is serving an 11-year prison sentence. 
Goldman is expected to be on center stage during the trial. The government says Mr. Gupta told Mr. Rajaratnam confidential details about Goldman Sachs before announcements were made public, including news of Warren E. Buffett's $5 billion investment in the bank at the depths of the financial crisis. 
Byron Trott, the former Goldman banker who oversaw the Buffett investment, is a possible witness. Other Goldman executives who may be called to testify are David A. Viniar, the chief financial officer, and Stephen R. Pierce, the head of the bank's capital markets business. Even one of Goldman's outside lawyers, Steven Peikin of Sullivan & Cromwell, is on the list. 
The government is likely to ask Mr. Trott about the timing of the Buffett investment and how quickly it came together. He also may be asked about how many people knew about it, including the Goldman board.
Mr. Pierce is expected to discuss a secondary stock offering of Goldman stock that Mr. Gupta is accused of passing along to Mr. Rajaratnam. 
At a pretrial hearing on Wednesday, the government said that its first witness was expected to be Caryn Eisenberg, Mr. Rajaratnam's secretary at his Galleon Group hedge fund. She is likely to testify about how frequently Mr. Gupta and Mr. Rajaratnam spoke to each other, according to people briefed on the case.

HEADLINE: The Romance of Garlic and Knives

BYLINE: By RUTH PENNEBAKER

 BODY:
HER class ''Couples Cook Italian,'' Vicki J. Caparulo said, evolved out of a tradition that she and her husband, Steve, started when their children were young. Every Friday night, they cooked a series of small dishes together, with their three sons and two daughters pitching in.
''It's what we call a grazing menu, with no main course,'' Ms. Caparulo, a chef and longtime cooking teacher, said. 
The meals were so successful and so much fun that she and her husband, who was a food photographer and also a cooking instructor, began teaching couples' classes at the Institute of Culinary Education in the Flatiron district.
''The classes were sold out from the beginning,'' she said. ''Cooking is something couples can do together -- like biking or going to museums. I think food brings out intimacy in people.''
On a rainy spring afternoon, she was teaching a four-hour recreational class for couples who wanted to cook Italian or cook better or spend some time together or just stop embarrassing themselves by knowing nothing about cooking in a world of 21st-century gourmets. Seven couples sat on stools, leaning over a square table to get to know one another. They were gathered in an oversize kitchen at the institute that looked out from the 14th floor onto a mosaic of buildings that were blurred in the mist.
Ms. Caparulo was friendly, but brisk and no-nonsense. She quickly led her students through the 11 dishes they would be making, including shrimp scampi, bruschetta with roasted red peppers and Genoa salami rollatini. She divided the class into three teams responsible for designated dishes.
''You're in this together,'' she said. ''Nobody eats till we're all finished.''
To the two worst cooks in the class (O.K., it was a friend and me), this sounded a bit ominous. But we were there to learn, after all. Our team was assigned the fried calamari with spicy marinara sauce, the shrimp and the bruschetta with mortadella mousse. (Mortadella, it turns out, is a pork sausage.)
Ms. Caparulo moved from table to table, offering instruction on tasks like how to cook garlic (''Start with the garlic in cold oil, not hot. That way, you won't burn it'') and how to hold a cutting knife. (''It's like gripping a tennis racket.'')
The room, originally a bit cold, began to warm as burners and ovens were fired up. My friend Margo, who knew a little more about cooking than I did, suggested that we concentrate on the four pounds of calamari, a k a squid. We placed them on cutting boards, slicing them with knives that we held like tennis rackets.
Around us, our four teammates butterflied shrimp, carved up baguettes for bruschetta and pureed mortadella, Parmesan, ricotta and cream. Kristin Killian, the standout on our team, produced a delicious pink froth of mortadella mousse while Margo and I struggled with the endless supply of calamari.
Kristin's husband, Ross, who had enrolled the two of them in the class as a Christmas present for his wife, helped us coat the sliced calamari with flour and cornstarch. Then he and I fried the calamari and drained it on paper towels while Margo went to look for an antacid.
At the end of the evening, we gathered again at the large square table in the kitchen. Our plates were heaped with small, bright portions of shrimp and calamari, bruschettas with white-bean puree and mortadella mousse, and cylinders of prosciutto wrapped around mozzarella balls. The rain had ended, and we could see a dazzling panorama of brightly lighted buildings through the windows as we ate and drank potent glasses of sgroppino (limoncello, lemon sorbet, prosecco -- delicious and dangerous).
Ms. Caparulo has seen couples meet in her classes, she said later. She's also seen men trying to please their wives by learning to cook. Women consider it romantic, she said.
''Cooking brings out the worst in some couples and the best in others,'' she said. ''You're wielding sharp objects and you're around fire, and you can tell a lot about couples by the way they cook together.''
Once, she had to insist that a couple cook back to back, so the wife wouldn't try to control every move her husband made in the kitchen. ''It was kind of like parallel play for toddlers,'' she said.
During the holidays, couples from out of town crowd the couples classes at the institute, but most students come from the New York area. In recent years, Ms. Caparulo said, cooking and cooking instruction have become more popular with young people trying to economize in a shaky economy.
She said she couldn't imagine not continuing to teach her couples classes after her husband of 32 years died two years ago. ''They're too much fun,'' she said, ''and they're good for me.''
Her five children -- all good cooks, she said -- are grown. Her Friday family dinners are in the past. In spite of the fires and sharp objects and opportunities for conflict, though, she still thinks cooking can make families closer.
Two weeks after the class, Kristin Killian said she had more confidence in her husband in the kitchen. ''Ross is now more involved in cooking,'' she said. ''And you know what? We've started cooking with our kids -- we have two boys and a girl -- once a week at dinner.''
After a four-hour course, even a hopeless cook has picked up a few tricks. But -- cooking can be fun? Cooking can be romantic? She'll take that on faith and another glass of sgroppino.

HEADLINE: Banks Must Add $566 Billion to Meet Reserves, Fitch Says

BYLINE: By MARK SCOTT

 BODY:
9:38 a.m. Updated
The world's largest banks must raise a combined $566 billion to satisfy new capital requirements, Fitch Ratings said on Thursday, as authorities demand that banks hold more cash in reserve to protect against future financial shocks. 
The figure represents a 23 percent increase in what banks hold in reserve and is likely to reduce the banks' return on equity, a critical figure used to gauge a firm's profitability, Fitch said.
The banks affected are the 29 ''systemically important financial institutions'' as designated by the global Financial Stability Board. They include the likes of Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, HSBC of Britain and the Mizuho Financial Group of Japan. In total, the firms hold roughly $47 trillion in combined assets.
Under new regulatory rules, known as Basel III, the firms must have a Tier 1 common equity ratio, a measure of a bank's ability to weather financial shocks, of roughly 9.5 percent by 2019, though officials are eager for banks to meet their targets as soon as possible.
To meet the deadline, Fitch says, the banks are likely to hold onto future earnings, cut shareholder dividends, wind down exposure to risky investments like underperforming real estate portfolios and tap investors for new cash.
As firms pull back from riskier sectors, the new regulatory system may lead to increased borrowing costs, a tightening of available credit and a shift of capital markets financing to less-regulated areas of the financial system, like hedge funds and private equity firms, the ratings agency's report said.
Banks in the United States and Europe are already working to meet the new capital requirements, and have been selling noncore assets, paring back lending and reworking their balance sheets to find new sources of cash.
There is still a lot to get through. European banks, for example, still hold more than 2.5 trillion euros ($3.2 trillion) of noncore loans on their balance sheets, according to the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers.
The push for banks to hold more money in reserve, instead of lending out the cash for a profit, will also affect profitability, according to the Fitch report. Once the Basel III rules are in place, the stricter capital requirements could reduce the median return on equity to 9 percent from current returns of approximately 11 percent. That represents a potential 20 percent reduction in profitability in the next decade.
''Single-digit return on equity reasonably could be the rule of the day,'' said Martin Hansen, senior director in Fitch's macro credit research team. ''The recent high historical returns may be difficult to achieve.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Chinese Solar Panels Face Big Tariffs

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER and DIANE CARDWELL; Keith Bradsher reported from Hong Kong and Diane Cardwell from New York.

 BODY:
The United States on Thursday announced the imposition of antidumping tariffs of more than 31 percent on solar panels from China.
The move by the Commerce Department is certain to infuriate Chinese officials already upset after recent bilateral frictions over China's human rights policies and its increasingly confrontational approach toward American allies like the Philippines and Japan.
The antidumping decision is among the biggest in American history, covering one of the largest and fastest-growing categories of imports from China, the world's largest exporter.
The department said the United States bought $3.1 billion worth of Chinese solar cells last year, giving China more than half the American market for the devices. 
Many solar panel installers in the United States have opposed tariffs on Chinese panels, contending that inexpensive imports have helped spur many homeowners and businesses to put solar panels on their rooftops. The new tariffs are likely to mean a substantial increase in the price of solar panels here.
Chinese officials have been indignant at American criticism of their solar power industry, pointing out that the United States has urged China for years to embrace renewable energy as a way to reduce air pollution, combat climate change and limit the need for oil imports from politically volatile countries in the Mideast.
Government support for solar energy is an important feature of China's current Five-Year Plan, which runs through 2015, although Premier Wen Jiabao publicly cautioned in March that he was becoming concerned about overcapacity in the sector.
Li Junfeng, an energy policy maker and regulator in the Chinese government who is also the president of the government-controlled Chinese Renewable Energy Industries Association, responded angrily to the American decision.
''This is really a surprise,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''It's really dangerous.'' Mr. Li said that Chinese companies would ''certainly'' retaliate by filing a trade case at China's commerce ministry accusing big American chemical companies of dumping polysilicon, the main ingredient in solar panels, on the Chinese market.
The American decision was made by civil servants in a quasi-judicial process that is heavily insulated by law from political interference and does not represent a deliberate attempt by the Obama administration to confront China on trade policy. But that distinction has been largely lost in China, where the solar panel issue has been one of many causes embraced online by the country's vociferous ultranationalists, who put heavy pressure on Chinese officials to respond forcefully to perceived snubs to China.
Further complicating matters is a similar case against China and Vietnam over the manufacture of steel towers for wind turbines, charging that steep government subsidies were giving foreign companies an unfair advantage over American manufacturers. A preliminary ruling is due on May 30 in that case.
The solar tariffs, which are retroactive to 90 days before the decision is officially published in the next several days, are in addition to antisubsidy tariffs of 2.9 to 4.73 percent that the department imposed in March.
SolarWorld Industries America, which led the coalition of manufacturers that filed the solar dumping case, welcomed the department's ruling. The decision ''is a very positive step in the process. It's also in line with what we expected,'' said Ben Santarris, a company spokesman. ''We consider this a bellwether case. It underscores the importance of manufacturing to the U.S. economy.''
Alan Price, a partner who heads the international trade practice at Wiley Rein, the law firm representing the United States companies in both the solar and wind cases, said that China posed a particular threat to America's developing green energy sector.
''China's method is straightforward: it sets forth industry-specific Five-Year Plans and then uses all forms of national and local subsidies and other governmental support to quickly transfer jobs, supply chains, intellectual property and wealth, to the permanent detriment of U.S. and global manufacturers,'' he said. ''China's ability to ramp up and overwhelm an industry is unique and particularly devastating with new and emerging technologies, where global competitors may be less established and can be knocked out more easily and quickly.''
Several large Chinese manufacturers expressed disappointment with the decision and said they would try to convince the Commerce Department that it was unjustified.
''Limiting trade in solar products will cause panel prices to increase, defeating America's goal of driving down costs,'' said Shawn Qu, chief executive of Canadian Solar, which makes panels in several Chinese plants and does brisk business in the United States. ''Our first priority should be to support the health of the industry as a whole through the financing and installation of solar, which is the key driver to expanding jobs in the U.S. solar market.''
According to a report from the Solar Foundation, an advocacy group, the solar industry employed about 100,000 workers last year, up almost 7 percent from the year before. More than half of the jobs were in installation, with about a quarter in manufacturing.
Isabelle Christensen, the marketing director of JinkoSolar, another Chinese manufacturer, said that her company had already established a factory in Canada and could probably shift production there if necessary.
''We can begin ramping up our manufacturing facility in Canada fairly quickly,'' she said, matching what the company produces in China for the American market in a matter of months.
But while Chinese solar panel manufacturers may threaten to set up production elsewhere, they may face another obstacle: their bankers. State-owned banks have already lent heavily to the Chinese manufacturers under pressure from the government, producing a capacity glut in China that has prompted factories to slash prices as they fight to maintain market share.
A senior Chinese banker, who insisted on anonymity to avoid political repercussions, said that Chinese banks were not eager to lend heavily for another round of solar panel factory investments on the large scale needed to supply the American market.
In the United States, solar panel trade cases have divided the industry in much the same way that automotive trade disputes in the 1980s split the American auto industry, when Detroit automakers seeking import restrictions were opposed by American car dealers who were making large profits from selling and servicing cars imported from Japan.
Opponents of the tariffs say that the United States benefits from cheap Chinese production. They point out that Chinese companies often turn to American companies to buy the factory equipment and polysilicon they need to make solar panels, and installers hire local American workers to set up and service rooftop systems.
Like the antisubsidy tariffs, the antidumping decision on Thursday is preliminary. But if solar panel importers win a final review of both tariff decisions by the Commerce Department later this year, the preliminary tariffs could be reduced or even entirely refunded, although they also might be increased.
The Commerce Department calculated the 31 percent tariff by estimating Chinese manufacturers' costs and then determining how far below cost the solar panels were being sold in the United States. But the department's methods for calculating costs are controversial for countries that it designates as nonmarket economies, where the government plays such a large role in allocating land, credit and other resources that the true costs of any given product may not be apparent.
In Thursday's decision, the Commerce Department sided with SolarWorld in using solar manufacturing costs in Thailand as a proxy for costs in China. The Chinese industry had wanted to use India as a proxy instead.

HEADLINE: Visions of Sugarplums As Legislature Regroups

BYLINE: By ROSS RAMSEY. 
rramsey@texastribune.org

 BODY:
Ross Ramsey, the managing editor of The Texas Tribune, writes a regular column for the Tribune.
You might not think of Santa as a powerful figure, but nobody talks smack about him when he is working that list of his.
With the Legislature -- and its leadership -- facing high turnover this year, the power comes with the ability to decide who gets what. 
The House speaker, Joe Straus, has some big prizes in the gift bag this year. At least 9 of the House's 39 top jobs will be empty when the session starts next year, from speaker pro tempore to head of the redistricting committee. More chairs are currently occupied by representatives who are dealing with hard re-election races, so they, too, could well be empty.
When lawmakers meet at the start of a session, the first thing they do is organize. In the House, they elect a speaker, who chooses the people to head various committees and fills out the rest of the assignments, weighing strengths and weaknesses, alliances and rivalries. Mr. Straus overthrew a sitting speaker in 2009 and survived a challenge in 2011. If he is re-elected, as expected, he'll have that goody bag on his back, and with it, the power to reward some of his allies.
The Senate version is a little different, usually. Voters pick a lieutenant governor, then the Senate, by its rules, gives that person the power to name committees, decide what comes up for consideration and when, and so on. But with Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst vying for a United States Senate seat, it could fall to the senators to pick their own presiding officer for the rest of Mr. Dewhurst's term. The winner of that contest would populate the committees next year, deciding who gets to drive and who has to sit in the back seat.
And the goody bag is very interesting. A new lieutenant governor isn't obligated to keep people where they are, which is creating deep anxiety. And even if the new boss leaves the assignments alone, departures have opened the trophy case. The middle chairs are empty on the finance, public education, economic development and jurisprudence committees.
In legislative terms, that's real money.
It's illegal, of course, to trade a thing of value for a vote for speaker or for lieutenant governor. You can't promise this post or that appointment in return for someone's support.
You can tell them how much you like them. How much you need their support. How they're the kind of people you would want by your side if you were fortunate enough to win. How their expertise in this or that would be beneficial and how awed you are at their leadership qualities. You just can't say, ''Hey, Marge. When I win, you'll be the head of the Energy Committee.''
That particular law is sort of useful to a candidate. If there are four open committees and six people who would like to lead them, it prevents the candidate from promising the seats away; it allows the candidate to let all six potential supporters dream of their future stations, even though two of them aren't going anywhere.
It's not hard to work this out.
A challenger, of course, starts with a blank slate. The longer a speaker serves, the greater the danger that too many people feel shut out of the process. If you would like to be the chairman of something and the legislator currently in that job isn't going anywhere -- and hasn't been going anywhere for six or eight years -- you might be more willing to fire the current management and replace them with new people. The assumption being, of course, that you would be one of the new people.
It helps when redistricting or other changes increase the turnover rate. This year, 30 of the 150 Texas House members are leaving voluntarily -- not seeking re-election for one reason or another. Not everyone who wants to come back will win. That new blood comes at the expense of experience, but it also keeps plum assignments in motion. Everybody in a Legislature wants to believe there's a chance of a high position, even if it's not available right this minute.
If senators choose a new lieutenant governor, they will base their pick, in large part, on what they think the new officeholder will do with the committees.
Everybody wants to be Santa. Or Santa's favorite.

HEADLINE: Citizenship to Go

BYLINE: By JACQUELINE STEVENS. 
Jacqueline Stevens, a professor of political science at Northwestern University, is the author of ''States Without Nations: Citizenship for Mortals.''

 BODY:
CITIZENSHIP laws are in the news again. Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota acquired, and then quickly renounced, Swiss citizenship. Eduardo Saverin, a founder of Facebook who was born in Brazil and lives in Singapore, gave up his United States citizenship, perhaps to avoid American taxes. Anti-immigrant activists are claiming that the 14th Amendment does not bestow citizenship on children born in the United States to noncitizen parents -- even though a century of jurisprudence says it does.
The real problem with citizenship laws is not their manipulation by lawmakers or entrepreneurs, much less by mythical ''anchor babies.'' The problem is more fundamental: the age-old, irrational linkage between citizenship and birthplace. 
From ancient Athens to South Sudan, birth to certain parents, or in a certain territory, has been the primary criterion for citizenship. The word ''nationality'' comes from the Latin nasci, or birth. America is no exception, notwithstanding the enlargement of citizenship to encompass non-Europeans and women.
Archaic membership rules have made life miserable not only for Mexican migrants in the United States, but also for people who cannot persuade their governments to accept their claims of citizenship, as a recent conference at Boston College, titled ''Citizenship-in-Question,'' made clear. Scholars discussed cases in England, India, Indonesia, Ivory Coast, Malaysia, South Africa, Thailand, Togo and the United States in which governments rendered their own legal citizens stateless.
Thai highlanders who live in border regions have had to submit DNA samples even though they can trace back their ancestry for centuries. According to a Cornell graduate student, Amanda Flaim, about 100,000 of the highlanders ''have not acquired the Thai citizenship to which they are legally entitled.''
Kamal Sadiq, a political scientist at the University of California, Irvine, showed how bureaucrats in Malaysia, Indonesia and India have improperly denied birth certificates to children because they were born outside of hospitals or because their mothers were unmarried or were immigrants.
Rachel E. Rosenbloom, who teaches law at Northeastern University, discussed a 2008 lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union over the State Department's refusal to process passport applications by Mexican-Americans in certain border regions. (The authorities said they were responding to a scheme involving midwives falsifying papers.)
The problem is not bad science, poorly trained officials or even ethnic hatred. The problem is the dubious reliance on birth for assigning citizenship.
Why does the practice endure? One could point to how birthright ensures loyalty to those born on the same soil and preserves one's ties to one's ancestors. But as Aristotle, explaining how the first families proved themselves to be citizens, said: ''As a mortar is made by a mortar-maker, so a citizen is made by a citizen-maker.'' In other words, citizens are not sprung from the earth or the womb; nationality is not genetic.
Citizens are created by politicians, the citizen-makers. And they are created because the nation, and hence birthright citizenship, exists to alleviate anxieties about death. Belonging to the nation or any other community by birth, including one's family, sustains fantasies of immortality, as these groups persist after one's own life has ended. Birthright citizenship, and indeed, the entire body of laws around families and inheritance, embody societies' collective flight from death.
Libertarians and economists have long questioned the usefulness of national boundaries. In 1984, The Wall Street Journal's editorial page proposed adding a constitutional amendment: ''There shall be open borders.''
For some on the left, the abolition of birthright citizenship evokes the nightmarish prospect of a labor glut in wealthy countries, the global lowering of wages, and capitalism run amok. But greed and corruption have challenged good governance in all ages, not just in the modern capitalist era. Moreover, too many on the left overlook how inheritance laws perpetuate inequality, as well as the disparity in wealth among countries because of restrictions on migration.
Karl Marx predicted that the demise of feudalism would mean that wealth would be created anew in each generation. Instead, intergenerational transmission of money and property remains the main culprit for inequality in wealth. Abolishing inheritance would help end inequality within countries; abolishing birthright citizenship would help end inequality among countries, by letting people move for greater opportunity.
Impossible? Utopian? That was the response to those who proposed the elimination of slavery, a persistent feature for most of the world's history and, like nativism, defended by some because its abolition would benefit Northern capitalists and increase factory exploitation.
Instead of using birth for assigning citizenship, why not keep the boundaries of current countries, open the borders, and use residence to define citizenship, as the 50 states do? Free movement of people in the United States does not diminish the authority of states in our federal system, or the right to participate politically as a citizen of one state and not another. Nor did it lead to the citizens of Georgia moving en masse to Massachusetts.
Consider, too, the experience of the European Union, where the free movement of labor across borders and ease of travel have resulted in greater well-being, and were not the cause of the current monetary and fiscal crisis.
In early modern Europe, vagabonds without passes were hanged, imprisoned, branded and shipped off to the colonies, including America. Requiring a birth certificate to document citizenship is no less irrational. We need governments, but we don't need nations. People should be free to move across borders; they should be citizens of the states where they happen to reside -- period.

HEADLINE: U.S. Redefines Afghan Success Before Conference

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER and THOM SHANKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Leaders of the NATO nations will meet in Chicago on Sunday to set in motion the massive machinery necessary to wind down the war in Afghanistan.
But even as American officials prepare a list of benchmarks they can cite as achieved in the war effort -- expect to hear much about strategic partnership agreements and assurances that the Afghan people have not been abandoned -- they acknowledge privately that the bar has been significantly lowered on how success in Afghanistan is defined after 11 years of combat.
''Look, this is Afghanistan,'' one administration official said in an interview. ''Is it going to be Switzerland? No. But is good enough for Afghanistan? That's where we need to get to.'' 
In fact, the phrase ''Afghan good enough'' has been making the rounds at the White House, State Department, the Pentagon and inside the many research organizations scattered around Washington. Gone is the much greater expectation that NATO will leave behind a cohesive central government with real influence beyond Kabul and a handful of other population centers. Gone is the assumption that Helmand Province, Kandahar and the rest of the heavily contested south -- where the bulk of the 2010 influx of troops was sent -- will remain entirely in the control of the central government once that area is transferred to Afghanistan's fledgling national security forces.
In previewing the meeting for reporters on Thursday, President Obama's national security adviser, Thomas E. Donilon, described a hoped-for outcome in Afghanistan that was far less ambitious than what American officials once envisioned.
''The goal is to have an Afghanistan again that has a degree of stability such that forces like Al Qaeda and associated groups cannot have safe haven unimpeded, which could threaten the region and threaten U.S. and other interests in the world,'' Mr. Donilon said.
With Afghan forces assuming the lead role in 2013 for protecting the country and its government, Mr. Donilon said the NATO allies hoped to leave behind ''a set of security assets that allow it to provide for that modicum of stability'' that will allow Afghanistan to protect itself against Al Qaeda and ensure that the United States' core goal -- making sure that Al Qaeda cannot again use Afghanistan as a base from which to target the West -- is met.
While Kandahar and other population centers in the south have seen a decrease in Taliban attacks since the surge forces arrived, insurgent attacks have increased in less populated southern areas, military officials report. The heads of the Senate and House intelligence committees, appearing on CNN's ''State of the Union'' program two weeks ago, and reporting on a recent trip to Afghanistan, said the Taliban were gaining ground, something that is bound to accelerate once the NATO troops give way to Afghan-led forces.
''I think we'd both say that what we found is that the Taliban is stronger,'' Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said, seated next to Representative Mike Rogers, Republican of Michigan.
Anthony H. Cordesman, a longtime military analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote a paper three weeks ago called ''Time to Focus on 'Afghan Good Enough.' ''
''Is progress sustainable?'' Mr. Cordesman wrote. ''Almost certainly no.
''The real question for everybody now is, can you hold this thing together to the point where, yes, the Pakistanis will have some influence, and Iran will have major influence in the northwest, and we'll lose influence in the south and the east but we might be able to hold onto Kandahar.''
Mr. Cordesman added: ''That would be Afghan good enough.''
Senior NATO military commanders in Afghanistan say they are well aware of the narrowing goals for their effort in Afghanistan. ''We trained for a number of lines of operation in addition to the security line, whether education, civil society, economic development, you know, the whole government-in-a-box thing,'' said one NATO military commander in Afghanistan. ''Now, it's only security. How much security can we bring before we go home? And how quickly we can train up Afghan forces to take over the security mission?''
And, for their part, senior Afghan government officials are aware that the ambitions of the Obama administration -- and, in fact, the agenda for the NATO summit -- are narrowly focused on security.
Eklil Hakimi, Afghanistan's ambassador to the United States, said in an interview that President Hamid Karzai and the presidents and prime ministers of NATO countries will arrive in Chicago not to discuss nation-building in Afghanistan, but only securing the nation of Afghanistan.
''This particular summit, the Chicago summit, within the context of NATO, is focusing on the Afghan security forces and their support for the years to come,'' Mr. Hakimi said.
In his official remarks to the summit leaders, Mr. Karzai will describe the increasing competence of Afghan security forces and the need for the international community to provide long-term support, both with personnel for training and advising, but also with money for equipping and logistical needs, the ambassador said.
There will be little if any discussion in Chicago of governance or financial development, he said. Those themes of development and economic strategy will await an international conference in Tokyo in July.
Pressed to describe the view of Afghan officials of the American phrase ''Afghan good enough,'' Mr. Hakimi cited advances made in women's rights and education in the decade since American forces and Afghan fighters toppled the Taliban government and drove Al Qaeda from the country. Afghan women have leading roles in Parliament, in business and in medicine. Before the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, only 900,000 Afghan boys were in school. Today, the number is eight million, and 40 percent of the students are female.
Asked whether that was sustainable with the lowered expectations of the United States and NATO for Afghanistan, the ambassador spoke forcefully.
''I leave that question to our partners,'' Mr. Hakimi said. ''That much we have achieved up to now -- with you, together.''
''So it's up to you,'' he added. ''Do you want to leave all this behind, or do you want to continue with us the journey that we have started together? With the support of our own people and also with the support of our international partners, we have laid a strong foundation for Afghanistan's future. So, politically, we are moving in the right direction. In order to further strengthen that, we need support from our international partners for years to come.''

HEADLINE: Greek-Americans Struggle With Response to Crisis

BYLINE: By THEO EMERY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As Greece's turmoil deepened, Alex Batistatos fumed. In phone calls from Athens, his 83-year-old grandmother told him how her pension was slashed and neighbors were forced to beg. She gives medicine to a friend, she said. Hungry Athenians pick over street garbage for food.
Frustrated, Mr. Batistatos, a 19-year-old student, returned to his Virginia home from college determined to help. Last weekend, he, along with his brother Chris, his parents and friends, organized a fund-raising walk at the National Mall -- one family's effort to offer help in the face of what many Greeks see as a calamity. 
As the ramifications of Greece's financial problems have spread, Americans of Greek descent have been struggling with how to respond. For many, the crisis represents an emergency as acute as an earthquake or a tsunami, with the same wrenching consequences of hunger, poverty and displacement.
The crisis has spurred clothing drives and church collections, but it has also revealed uncertainty. Many worry that aid will not reach those in need. Others balk because of the Greek government's instability.
''If there was leadership, we would overcome this ambivalence and this hesitation,'' said Lefteris Karmiris, 68, of Bethesda, Md., a retired World Bank employee who joined the march last Saturday. ''We could give a message to say this is what we should do, but there is a leadership problem.''
In general, man-made disasters do not garner as much largess from outside donors as natural disasters, ''because there are humans to blame,'' said Sam Worthington, president of a consortium of aid organizations based in the United States called InterAction. Moreover, Greece is relatively affluent, and its fraying social safety net is a symptom of a broader structural problem.
''People tend to focus on the degree to which they can make a difference in a tangible way, and Greece is a challenging environment to do that,'' Mr. Worthington said, adding that he was not aware of any recent international relief efforts around a financial crisis, although he noted that emergency aid went to Zimbabwe when soaring inflation put food prices out of reach.
Nonetheless, aid groups have watched in alarm as social and health problems mount because of austerity measures in Greece. An article in The Lancet last fall warned of a potential ''Greek tragedy'' as the public health care system is stretched thinner and thinner. Unemployment is soaring and suicides are rising. Doctors Without Borders has reported spikes in H.I.V., AIDS and malaria cases.
Andrew S. Natsios, former administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, said that Greece's safety net is disintegrating along with its health care system, and hunger is forcing families to return to depopulated islands to grow food.
''I don't think people realize how serious this is,'' Mr. Natsios said. ''We know that families are breaking up now over this, people can't support their children. I've never seen anything like this, actually, since World War II.''
For Greek-Americans -- particularly older ones -- that time represents the only comparison to the country's situation today, albeit on a much larger scale then. During the Nazi occupation, hundreds of thousands of Greeks starved to death, and Greeks abroad responded by pouring relief money into the country.
The failure to quickly mobilize in the current crisis led to finger-pointing last winter when Gregory C. Pappas, owner of a Chicago marketing firm and founder of the Greek America Foundation, wrote an online column castigating Greek-Americans for not doing enough to ease the crisis.
''I upset some people, and I know that I upset some people, because they came and told me,'' he said. ''Well, if that's what it takes to feed some people over there, then I'm glad it happened.''
The column appeared to touch a nerve. One organization he singled out, the American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association, published a response defending its record and pointing out that there was no ''silver bullet'' to address the country's growing needs.
Within weeks, however, the organization announced a charitable drive, and reported that it raised $150,000. Basil N. Mossaidis, the association's executive director, said his group had been helping Greece long before Mr. Pappas's column appeared. But he acknowledged that many Greek-Americans are hesitant to lend a hand.
''You have to address that first,'' Mr. Mossaidis said. ''You have to tell them first this is not a game, we're not just going to point fingers at people and say these fat cats stole our money. This is a humanitarian issue.''
The archbishop of the Greek Orthodox Church in the United States, Demetrios Trakatellis, also issued an appeal. Churches responded with extra collections during Masses and assembled emergency kits for children and the sick. International Orthodox Christian Charities, the church's relief arm, shipped medical supplies and equipment in April.
In an interview, the archbishop said Greek-Americans were worried about where their donations would go, a concern he called ''very serious.'' He hand-delivered a $500,000 check to the church in Athens several weeks ago to allay those fears.
''We have full transparency and accountability,'' he said. ''The archbishop of Athens is personally offering a report with details about the last dollar sent from here.''
The chaotic political situation, as well as humanitarian needs, provided lively debate among the two dozen or so people who gathered at the Lincoln Memorial on Saturday for the walk.
They set out, following a bobbing Mylar balloon festooned with blue and white streamers and with ''Stand by Greece'' printed on one side. Steven Martnishn, Alex and Chris Batistatos's father, pointed out Doric columns along the route, and his wife, Ergini, led the way with an unfurled Greek flag.
They raised about $600 for families on the island of Kefalonia, the Batistatoses' ancestral home. Alex Batistatos admitted it was a small gesture, but hoped it would be an example for others to follow.
''Hopefully there are more things like this going on -- I really don't know,'' he said. ''There's a lot of dialogue, but few organized events. Hopefully things will actually happen, instead of just talking about it.''

HEADLINE: Steady, Steady: Niagara Falls Awaits

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y. -- Nik Wallenda climbed up a scaffold, stepped onto the steel cable and slipped the harness of his balancing pole over his head. Then he began to walk -- each step a few inches in front of the last, his leather moccasins kissing the wire that lay before him.
The backdrop: a T.G.I. Friday's restaurant, a Starbucks and a Sheraton hotel to the left, and the Seneca Niagara Casino and Hotel to the right.
The scenery next month will be different: the rapids of Niagara Falls swirling below, a cold mist enveloping Mr. Wallenda, a national television audience watching in prime time. 
Mr. Wallenda, who has marveled at the falls since he first visited at age 6, said he felt compelled to walk on wires, and, on June 15, he plans to walk across Niagara Falls on a two-inch-diameter cable.
''Just like an artist paints art, or a musician plays music, this is my instrument,'' he said.
He explained his attitude by quoting a great-grandfather, Karl Wallenda, who said, ''Life is on the wire, and everything else is just waiting.''
Karl Wallenda died in 1978, after falling from a tightrope in San Juan, P.R. But Nik Wallenda completed that same walk, and now professes confidence in his ability to cross the falls. To demonstrate his sureness, he asked to be interviewed while walking on the 1,200-foot-long high wire on which he has been practicing this week, suspended above a casino parking lot. He answered questions without losing his poise.
''This is about mind games,'' he said. ''Right now, I'm putting myself at the top of the falls.''
A seventh-generation stuntman and scion of the Flying Wallendas family of circus performers, Mr. Wallenda, 33, won permission to walk across the falls after waging a binational lobbying campaign.
Government officials in this economically depressed corner of upstate New York embraced his proposal, hoping it would spur a tourism boom, and Albany lawmakers passed legislation last year that gave Mr. Wallenda legal authority to cross.
But some Canadian officials were less easily persuaded. At first, they rejected his proposal, noting that so-called stunting had long been banned at the falls, and saying that Mr. Wallenda's walk would mar the natural beauty of the waterworks. But in February, they agreed to make an exception.
Now, Mr. Wallenda has turned his attention from politics to practice. Like a one-man football training camp, he emerges twice a day to walk the wire, just a few blocks from the falls and across the street from a minimart that doubles as daredevilry museum. His presence has been documented with daily front-page coverage in the local newspaper, The Niagara Gazette.
He has been joined by his wife, Erendira, a fellow acrobat to whom he proposed on a high wire, and their three children, ages 14, 11 and 9, who act as a cheering squad and support crew. (Their 9-year-old, Evita, unsuccessfully lobbied her father to wear her white Hello Kitty sunglasses as he walked on Thursday. ''I want Hello Kitty to sponsor you,'' she reasoned.)
Several practice sessions this week drew 100 to 200 onlookers, some of whom abandoned their slot machines to sprawl on three sets of aluminum bleachers the casino had set up for observers. Nearby, a concession stand sold hot dogs for $4 and ice cream for $2; glossy photographs of Mr. Wallenda were $10.
One man went to a hardware store to buy a piece of wire for Mr. Wallenda to sign; Jean Geyer, a retired nurse from Niagara Falls, Ontario, asked him to autograph her cane. After watching him practice, she expressed confidence that he could handle crossing the gorge.
''Everybody has skills in life, and that's his -- it's like a surgeon doing brain surgery,'' Ms. Geyer said. ''I don't think he's crazy.''
The wire walking is not Mr. Wallenda's only preparation -- he also works out in a gym -- and his routine varies. On Wednesday afternoon, for instance, he started at one end of the practice wire and walked to the end, and back, and to the end again. Then he descended in a scissor-lift, at which point his 11-year-old son, Amadaos, handed him a pair of black clogs to wear over his moccasins, which his mother makes for him.
A self-described born-again Christian, he says he prays before he gets on the wire, every time.
''Wire-walking, it's about doing it,'' Mr. Wallenda said. ''The more I do this, the more comfortable I get.''
Niagara Falls presents several unique challenges, Mr. Wallenda said. One issue is the mist; Mr. Wallenda wants to get a fire engine to spray him to simulate the wet conditions, though practicing on a rainy morning this week offered some experience. Another is wind; Mr. Wallenda's team is trying to obtain a portable wind machine for practice.
Mr. Wallenda said the crossing over the falls, about 170 feet above the water, should take 30 to 40 minutes. He said he had not decided which direction he would walk in, or what he would wear.
ABC television plans to broadcast the walk in a three-hour special, but also plans a 5- to 10-second delay, just in case. ''We want it to be exciting and thrilling, but we also want every parent in America to hear loud and clear that we're going to make it comfortable for them to watch with their kids,'' said Jeffrey W. Schneider, an ABC spokesman.
Mr. Wallenda had a scare last week, when he slipped while walking on a tightrope over Baltimore's Inner Harbor; he steadied himself, but later called the misstep a ''wake-up call.''
His plan is to cross the falls without any tether or netting; if he slips, he hopes to grab the cable to catch himself before he plunges to the swirling waters, and local emergency personnel have been practicing possible rescue techniques. But Mr. Wallenda said he was being pressured by his sponsors to accept some further safety measure.
''I'll be adamant until the end that I do not want to wear a tether,'' Mr. Wallenda said. But he said ''if it comes down to the point where either you wear a tether or you don't do it,'' he would acquiesce.
Mrs. Wallenda, whose family history of circus performing goes back eight generations, admitted she was nervous about the Niagara Falls walk and said she was preparing for the day with ''a lot of prayer.'' But she said she did not want her husband to wear a tether, either, given his family's long history of performing without any backup safety measures.
''It's like if Madonna would lip-sync,'' she said. ''This is what we were raised doing. This is our life.''
But there are limits. Asked whether he wanted his children to follow him into high-wire walking, Mr. Wallenda said, ''I encourage them to go to school and maybe take on a different occupation.''

HEADLINE: Apocalypse Fairly Soon

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Suddenly, it has become easy to see how the euro -- that grand, flawed experiment in monetary union without political union -- could come apart at the seams. We're not talking about a distant prospect, either. Things could fall apart with stunning speed, in a matter of months, not years. And the costs -- both economic and, arguably even more important, political -- could be huge.
This doesn't have to happen; the euro (or at least most of it) could still be saved. But this will require that European leaders, especially in Germany and at the European Central Bank, start acting very differently from the way they've acted these past few years. They need to stop moralizing and deal with reality; they need to stop temporizing and, for once, get ahead of the curve. 
I wish I could say that I was optimistic.
The story so far: When the euro came into existence, there was a great wave of optimism in Europe -- and that, it turned out, was the worst thing that could have happened. Money poured into Spain and other nations, which were now seen as safe investments; this flood of capital fueled huge housing bubbles and huge trade deficits. Then, with the financial crisis of 2008, the flood dried up, causing severe slumps in the very nations that had boomed before.
At that point, Europe's lack of political union became a severe liability. Florida and Spain both had housing bubbles, but when Florida's bubble burst, retirees could still count on getting their Social Security and Medicare checks from Washington. Spain receives no comparable support. So the burst bubble turned into a fiscal crisis, too.
Europe's answer has been austerity: savage spending cuts in an attempt to reassure bond markets. Yet as any sensible economist could have told you (and we did, we did), these cuts deepened the depression in Europe's troubled economies, which both further undermined investor confidence and led to growing political instability.
And now comes the moment of truth.
Greece is, for the moment, the focal point. Voters who are understandably angry at policies that have produced 22 percent unemployment -- more than 50 percent among the young -- turned on the parties enforcing those policies. And because the entire Greek political establishment was, in effect, bullied into endorsing a doomed economic orthodoxy, the result of voter revulsion has been rising power for extremists. Even if the polls are wrong and the governing coalition somehow ekes out a majority in the next round of voting, this game is basically up: Greece won't, can't pursue the policies that Germany and the European Central Bank are demanding.
So now what? Right now, Greece is experiencing what's being called a ''bank jog'' -- a somewhat slow-motion bank run, as more and more depositors pull out their cash in anticipation of a possible Greek exit from the euro. Europe's central bank is, in effect, financing this bank run by lending Greece the necessary euros; if and (probably) when the central bank decides it can lend no more, Greece will be forced to abandon the euro and issue its own currency again.
This demonstration that the euro is, in fact, reversible would lead, in turn, to runs on Spanish and Italian banks. Once again the European Central Bank would have to choose whether to provide open-ended financing; if it were to say no, the euro as a whole would blow up.
Yet financing isn't enough. Italy and, in particular, Spain must be offered hope -- an economic environment in which they have some reasonable prospect of emerging from austerity and depression. Realistically, the only way to provide such an environment would be for the central bank to drop its obsession with price stability, to accept and indeed encourage several years of 3 percent or 4 percent inflation in Europe (and more than that in Germany).
Both the central bankers and the Germans hate this idea, but it's the only plausible way the euro might be saved. For the past two-and-a-half years, European leaders have responded to crisis with half-measures that buy time, yet they have made no use of that time. Now time has run out.
So will Europe finally rise to the occasion? Let's hope so -- and not just because a euro breakup would have negative ripple effects throughout the world. For the biggest costs of European policy failure would probably be political.
Think of it this way: Failure of the euro would amount to a huge defeat for the broader European project, the attempt to bring peace, prosperity and democracy to a continent with a terrible history. It would also have much the same effect that the failure of austerity is having in Greece, discrediting the political mainstream and empowering extremists.
All of us, then, have a big stake in European success -- yet it's up to the Europeans themselves to deliver that success. The whole world is waiting to see whether they're up to the task.

HEADLINE: Helping Native Americans

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Poverty's Poster Child'' (column, May 10): 
Nicholas D. Kristof is right that Indian country faces disparities with the rest of the nation, especially in health care, law enforcement, education and unemployment -- all areas for which our federal government has not lived up to its promises. The issues facing Native American children should be front-page news.
But that isn't the end of the story. Pine Ridge, like all Indian reservations, is home to a unique culture and tradition. Tribal communities have the most inspirational and resilient young people I've ever met. Indian country has generated innovative economic development, cutting-edge health care programs and, most important, cohesive and powerful Native American pride.
Our approach to addressing disparities in Indian country must come from a deep sense of humility. Our country includes 566 federally recognized tribes with distinct sovereign governments. You can't visit one reservation and know Indian country. A paternalistic, simplistic or negative label neglects to account for the incredible strength and history of tribal governments.
So yes, we should talk about disparities, primarily to compel our government to deliver on its trust obligations. But let's be respectful in how we describe tribal communities. We want Native youth to be hopeful, because there's every reason to be proud to be First Americans.
BYRON DORGAN Washington, May 15, 2012

HEADLINE: Spanish Bank Woes and U.S. Data Hurt Shares

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The stock market hit a four-month low on Thursday as worries about the health of Spanish banks added to investors' anxiety about Europe and as another round of weak data undermined hopes for the American economic recovery.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell to its lowest level since mid-January, wiping out more than half of its gains from the first quarter. 
''There is not a lot of interest in the equity market,'' said Jason Weisberg, managing director at Seaport Securities. ''The overhang with Europe is so heavy, people are tired of playing whack-a-mole, and their portfolios are the mole.''
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 156.06 points, or 1.24 percent, to 12,442.49. The S.& P. 500 fell 19.94 points, or 1.51 percent, to 1,304.86. The Nasdaq Composite Index lost 60.35 points, or 2.1 percent, to 2,813.69. The S.& P. 500 has fallen 6.1 percent in May.
Bond prices rallied, sending the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note to its lowest level in more than seven months. The 10-year yield is within striking distance of 1.67 percent, its lowest point in at least 60 years.
''Treasuries continue to be the haven of choice for a spooked market,'' said Gennadiy Goldberg, fixed-income strategist at 4Cast.
Lackluster economic data weighed on investor sentiment. The Conference Board's gauge of future economic activity fell in April for the first time in seven months, and the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's index of business conditions hit its lowest point since September. In addition, the weekly claims for jobless benefits showed no improvement, holding unchanged at 370,000, a sign that the pace of hiring remains lackluster.
News from Europe provided more reason for concern. The Spanish government denied on Thursday that customers of Bankia were scrambling to withdraw their money after the newspaper El Mundo reported that they had withdrawn more than 1 billion euros over the last week.
Adding to concerns about Spain, its borrowing costs shot up at a bond auction. Bankia shares fell 14 percent in Europe.
Reports that some Greek banks needed more emergency money also hurt sentiment on Wall Street.
With a pattern of brief gains in recent trading sessions fizzling quickly, investors saw little reason to fight the selling pressure. ''Everyone is inclined to sell into rallies rather than buy into dips,'' said Terry Morris, senior equity manager for the National Penn Investors Trust Company.
Caterpillar dropped 4.4 percent to $87.70 as the biggest drag on the Dow after the company's dealers reported slowing sales for April.
The Nasdaq fell on weakness in technology shares. Apple lost 2.9 percent to $530.12 and Qualcomm fell 3.3 percent to $57.16.
Dollar Tree declined 6.1 percent to $95.13. It was one of the biggest percentage decliners on the Nasdaq 100 after it gave a second-quarter profit outlook that was below expectations.
GameStop tumbled 11.1 percent to $18.52, the biggest percentage decliner on the S.& P. 500, after it forecast second-quarter earnings that were below expectations.
In the bond market, the price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose 20/32, to 100 18/32, while its yield fell to 1.69 percent from 1.76 percent late Thursday.
The Treasury also sold $13 billion in 10-year inflation-protection securities, which came with a yield of minus 0.43 percent late Thursday.
''It's not the negative yield that attracted investors,'' said Michael Pond, co-head of interest rates strategy at Barclays Capital. ''It was the pretty cheap inflation protection.''

HEADLINE: A Greek Exit? Europe May Be Ready

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- It is increasingly conceivable that Greece may leave the euro zone, not just because of its own political dysfunction but also because the consequences of such an exit for the rest of the Europe and the global economy no longer seem quite so scary.
The foot-dragging and brinkmanship of the last few years have won the other members of the currency union valuable time to prepare for life without Greece. Banks have recorded losses on Greek investments, companies are making contingency plans and Europe has bolstered rescue funds for other vulnerable nations like Portugal, Ireland and Spain.
Those measures also have reduced the risks for the United States, making it less likely that a ''Lehman moment'' will spread panic through global financial markets. American investment funds and banks have also sharply reduced their investments in Europe.
But some experts say Europe's preparations remain incomplete and the potential costs of a Greek exit are highly uncertain and potentially substantial. That reality helps to explain why Germany continues to profess its determination to keep Greece in the currency union if at all possible. 
Still, European leaders are increasingly willing -- even eager -- to comment publicly on the possibility that Greece will leave, something they long refused to countenance, not just because relations with Greece continue to deteriorate but also as a result of their own preparations.
''We've worked hard to mitigate against such a scenario,'' the Dutch finance minister, Jan Kees de Jager, told reporters after a meeting of European finance ministers early this week. ''That's why the contagion risk would be far, far smaller than one and a half years ago.''
What once seemed unthinkable is being reduced to a budget line. Economists at a German bank recently estimated that a Greek exit would cost the German government about 100 billion euros ($127 billion), or about 3 percent of the nation's annual economic output.
Francois Baroin, the departing French finance minister, said this week that a Greek exit would cost France up to 50 billion euros -- a similar share of its economic output.
''Greece is not a big deal in itself. It's not a major risk and our banks and insurance companies certainly would be able to absorb it,'' Mr. Baroin told Europe 1, a French radio station on Tuesday.
The more pressing question, as Mr. Baroin went on to say, regards the consequences for the other struggling nations at the bottom end of Europe. He warned that the departure of any member could spread ''doubt and distrust'' in the minds of foreign investors over the health of the euro. Stock markets have declined worldwide on fears that Europe will unravel.
The first job of a finance minister is to convince the markets that everything is under control, and in recent days, European officials have lined up to insist that the euro would survive.
''They seem fairly at ease, fairly resigned to the fact that they would be able to deal with it, which I think is a result of the months that they have had to prepare,'' said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics here.
He said the current round of talks was intended primarily to influence the outcome of the Greek elections next month, but he added that he thought Europe was legitimately in a better position to handle a worst case.
But Kenneth S. Rogoff, a professor at Harvard and former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, said Europe had made progress but still was not adequately prepared to control the fallout. He said Europe lacked sufficient mechanisms to ensure that loans remained available to other troubled countries, like Spain and Italy. Furthermore, there is no political consensus about support for borrowing by local governments and private companies. And, he said, there is no credible long-term plan to ensure the viability of the euro.
''These are difficult political decisions that they just aren't ready for,'' he said. ''They should be. They've had two years to think about it. But they're not ready.''
Uri Dadush, director of the international economics program at the Carnegie Endowment for World Peace here, and formerly director of economic policy at the World Bank, said Europe had made significant strides. An agreement this year reduced the value of outstanding Greek government debt by roughly 90 percent, limiting the potential for further losses. A range of corporations have acknowledged that they are preparing for the possible return of a Greek currency. Europe has significantly expanded the scale of its various emergency lending programs.
Still, he said, ''the bottom line is that it remains a risky proposition.''
If a Greek departure is interpreted as a sign that the euro zone is crumbling, depositors in other troubled countries could start to withdraw their money from the local banks, and interest rates could continue to rise. Italian companies are already struggling to compete against rivals in other countries because of the higher interest rates that they are forced to pay.
''How do you prevent the disease from spreading?'' Mr. Dadush asked. ''That's the big question for the Europeans if the Greeks go out.''
The United States mostly is watching from the sidelines.
The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has said repeatedly that problems in Greece would have little direct impact on the American financial system. Domestic banks have eliminated more than two-thirds of their investment in Greece over the last two years, paring their exposure to $5.8 billion at the end of 2011 from $18 billion at the end of 2009, according to the most recent available data from federal financial regulators. The banks have also reduced their exposure to other troubled countries, including Spain (down 21 percent), Ireland (16 percent) and Italy (14 percent).
Money market funds have also backed away from Europe. The funds held $205 billion in debt issued by euro zone banks in April, down 62 percent from the previous April, according to research by JPMorgan Chase. Investment has actually increased during the early months of the year, but most of the new investment is in the banks of France and Germany, which are regarded as relatively safe.
But the domestic economy remains vulnerable to disruptions in Europe. Roughly one-quarter of American exports go to Europe, and Americans held $1.4 trillion in the securities of euro zone companies and countries at the end of 2010, according to the most recent available federal data.
''If there is a major financial problem in Europe,'' Mr. Bernanke told Congress in February, ''there will be so many different channels on which that will affect our financial system that I would not want to take too much comfort from'' the fact that the financial system has little direct exposure to Greece.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A news analysis article on Friday about Europe's preparedness for Greece's possible exit from the euro zone misstated, in some editions, the relative cost of such an exit to Germany's government. The actual cost, about $127 billion, which was noted correctly, is 3 percent of Germany's annual economic output, not less than one-tenth of 1 percent.

HEADLINE: Concern About Stability Gives Chinese Officials Leeway to Crush Dissent

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES; Shi Da contributed research from Dongshigu, China, and Edy Yin from Beijing.

 BODY:
LINYI, China -- The central government says that the activist Chen Guangcheng is a free man, and has promised him an investigation of the harrowing abuses he suffered at the hands of guards here. Mr. Chen's desperate escape last month from persecution to American protection has embarrassed China's leaders and cast new shadows on their commitment to the rule of law.
But a visit to this municipality in eastern China, where Mr. Chen and his family most recently spent 20 months as prisoners in their own home, offers no hint of a change in the way China deals with its dissidents.
Journalists who sought on Sunday to talk to residents a few hundred yards from Dongshigu, the village in Linyi where Mr. Chen was held captive, were quickly escorted out by thugs in four cars, and later were accosted in a burst of arm-wrenching and name-calling. 
Members of the same gang still keep Mr. Chen's mother under siege here. Mr. Chen's nephew faces a charge of attempted murder after he slashed a knife at plainclothes officers who invaded his home and beat him. Lawyers seeking to defend the nephew have been ordered to drop the case or face retribution.
There is no evidence that the government in Beijing ordered this harassment, all of which is illegal under Chinese law. But there is also no any indication that Beijing wants it to stop.
In fact, both rights activists and legal experts say, the system for dealing with dissidents and other troublemakers is geared toward allowing local leaders to ignore the law, with Beijing's sometimes silent assent.
The central government may even reward local leaders for doing so. The reason is that their Communist Party careers depend on meeting a series of performance goals -- from high economic growth to low levels of public unrest -- whose importance far outweigh any gold stars awarded for following the law.
That system gives leaders an incentive to silence troublemakers by any means in order to win high marks for maintaining public stability, one of the most importance performance metrics. It can uncork gushers of money for added security measures to keep control of a high-profile activist like Mr. Chen.
And it can pay off for the local leaders who do the job well. The man Mr. Chen has blamed most for his detention and imprisonment is Li Qun, who was mayor of Linyi from 2003 to 2007. Just a few years before that, Mr. Li was studying public administration at the University of New Haven and an intern to the New Haven mayor, John DeStefano Jr.
Mr. Li has since been promoted to party secretary of Shandong's biggest port, Qingdao, and he sits on the province's Communist Party standing committee, its highest ruling body.
Only when local measures blow up into national or global embarrassments, as they have in Mr. Chen's case, is the central government obliged to step in and order face-saving measures like investigations. In countless other instances, the experts say, Beijing quietly tolerates local officials' lawlessness, and they do so for a simple reason: with rare exceptions, the system is exceedingly efficient at stifling unrest.
Jerome Cohen, a law professor at New York University and an adviser to Mr. Chen, said he was told by a prominent Chinese criminal lawyer that cases like Mr. Chen's were not unusual. ''They're only unusual because you know about them,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''I can tell you that there are thousands of cases like this.''
To those who study the system, its success makes it unlikely that party leaders will use the embarrassment of the Chen episode to push for changes that could themselves prove destabilizing.
''It would have implications not just in one city or one county, but for the entire country,'' Fu Hualing, a law professor at Hong Kong University, said in an interview. ''This is how they govern the population. If you punish the local government, if you dismiss the officials, then you have to tell all the other local officials that there's a different way of doing things now. And that would be a very fundamental change.''
A serious inquiry also would send a signal that when enough publicity and pressure is brought to bear, the Communist Party can be forced to change.
''The main problem with Beijing is that very often, they condone injustices even though they know that the local authorities are in the wrong,'' said Nicholas Bequelin of Human Rights Watch in Hong Kong. ''But many of the problems that come up in these cases are not isolated -- they're endemic. And Beijing fears that backing down on one case would open the floodgates.''
Mr. Chen's case, one of the few to get prolonged public scrutiny, offers some insights into the incentives that make repression the tool of choice to deal with dissidents and troublemakers.
A self-taught lawyer who is blind, Mr. Chen crusaded for social justice in his native Shandong Province, and in the process imperiled party officials' record not only on keeping order, but also on another important measure: enforcing the one-child population-control policy.
In August 2005, after he began a deftly publicized campaign to help citizens sue the local government over forced late-term abortions and sterilizations, the reaction was swift: a mob surrounded Mr. Chen's village home, trapping the family inside for weeks. Foreshadowing the events of this spring, Mr. Chen and a nephew eventually escaped to Beijing, only to be seized there and returned home by police officers sent from Shandong.
Neither action by the local authorities was legal. ''They used the justification of the one-child policy and stability maintenance,'' said Pu Zhiqiang, a prominent human rights lawyer.
After the detention generated international headlines, Mr. Cohen said, the public security minister sent emissaries to Shandong to discuss the case. Later, in 2006, Mr. Chen was convicted and imprisoned on what experts said were trumped-up charges, and his detention gained a legal basis.
But when he was released from prison in September 2010, Mr. Chen again found himself and his family sealed inside their village home, this time surrounded by a cordon of fences and security equipment and a contingent of guards around the clock.
For the layers of government overseeing Dongshigu, Mr. Chen's destitute, remote village, detention has become a lucrative industry. Mr. Chen has claimed that his captors told him it cost about $9.5 million annually to keep him under house arrest.
The target of that smothering security is now in a Beijing hospital, preparing to move with his wife and daughter to the United States to study law. But the costly crackdown continues unabated.
Outside Dongshigu, police vans dot the highway, their lights flashing, and carloads of plainclothes guards roam side roads, their license plates sometimes covered in camouflage cloth.
On Sunday, when journalists sought to visit Mr. Chen's home in Dongshigu, about 33 miles from Linyi, they were quickly and roughly escorted away by security guards in plain clothes. Later, in Yinan, the county seat, one man attacked a photographer who was recording a reporter's attempt to question him.
''Get out of China,'' the man yelled at a Chinese news assistant. ''You're not Chinese. You're a traitor.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Magnate Steps Into 2012 Fray On Wild Pitch

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and JEFF ZELENY; Kitty Bennett and Michael D. Shear contributed reporting

 BODY:
Joe Ricketts, an up-by-the-bootstraps billionaire whose varied holdings include a name-brand brokerage firm in Omaha, a baseball team in Chicago, herds of bison in Wyoming and a start-up news Web site in New York, wanted to be a player in the 2012 election. On Thursday he was, though not in the way he had intended.
Word that Mr. Ricketts had considered bankrolling a $10 million advertising campaign linking President Obama to the incendiary race-infused statements of his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., brought waves of denunciation from Mitt Romney, the Obama campaign and much of the rest of the political world.
Highlighting the perils of mixing partisan politics and corporate citizenship, the reverberations also swept through the Ricketts family's business empire. 
Liberal groups encouraged like-minded investors to drop their accounts with TD Ameritrade, the brokerage firm Mr. Ricketts founded. His family's plan to seek public financing for improvements to Wrigley Field, home of their baseball team, the Chicago Cubs, ran into new political opposition. And he was forced to write a letter to reporters at his New York news organization, DNAinfo.com, assuring them he believed that ''my personal politics should have absolutely no impact on your work.''
By early afternoon, Mr. Ricketts had announced that he had rejected the ad campaign as out of keeping with his own political style, a day after his aides indicated that it was still under consideration.
The episode all but ensured that Republicans would remain under intense pressure not to invoke Mr. Wright's provocative statements so directly for the balance of the campaign. And, in a year when the loosened system of campaign finance regulations is encouraging wealthy individuals to weigh in on behalf of candidates and causes, Mr. Ricketts became a case study in the risks of political neophytes with big checkbooks seeking to play at the highest and roughest levels of politics.
After a storied career, Mr. Ricketts, 70, set out to break into the exclusive but growing new fraternity of megarich, conservative ''super PAC'' donors, people willing -- and permitted as never before -- to pour millions of dollars into influencing an election. He has seemed motivated primarily by his belief that government spending is out of control and that Mr. Obama cannot be trusted to rein in the deficit and reduce the national debt.
But associates acknowledged that his experience on Thursday, when a confidential proposal for the Wright campaign became public in The New York Times, helped hammer home the high stakes of his decision to initiate discussions with some of the most seasoned and aggressive strategists in Republican politics about going after Mr. Obama in a high-profile way.
The proposal was drafted under the leadership of Fred Davis, a veteran political advertising strategist who worked for the presidential campaigns of George W. Bush, John McCain and, most recently, former Gov. Jon M. Huntsman Jr. of Utah.
In a statement on Thursday, a spokesman for Mr. Ricketts said the plan Mr. Davis's team submitted was ''merely a proposal'' and ''reflects an approach to politics that Mr. Ricketts rejects and it was never a plan to be accepted but only a suggestion for a direction to take.''
The president and general counsel of the Ending Spending Political Action Fund, Brian Baker, said through a spokesman that the plan was submitted to a group that included him and two of Mr. Ricketts's sons at a meeting in Chicago last week. ''I was surprised and troubled by what I saw,'' he said. ''It was not what we asked for.''
But on Wednesday, when Mr. Baker was asked in an interview whether Mr. Ricketts had rejected the advertising proposal, he said only that no decisions had been made.
A page in the proposal about potential staff members for the effort says, ''With your preliminary approval at the New York meeting, we have discussed this plan in highly confidential terms with the following proposed team members,'' who, it says, are ''ready to jump into action upon plan approval.''
Associates of Mr. Ricketts acknowledged that upon seeing a commercial Mr. Davis produced in 2008 for Mr. McCain featuring Mr. Wright, which Mr. McCain rejected, Mr. Ricketts said. ''If the nation had seen that ad, they'd never have elected Barack Obama.'' The quote was highlighted in the proposal.
Mr. Ricketts was shown the commercial at an initial meeting at Mr. Davis's offices in California, which Mr. Ricketts requested as he sought to build a team of top Republican strategists to lead his foray into the presidential campaign. (Aides acknowledge that a second meeting followed in New York, where, they say, he gave Mr. Davis general directions to move ahead with a proposal that would create maximum impact for $10 million but did not specifically approve one based on Mr. Wright.)
After retiring from Ameritrade's board in 2011, Mr. Ricketts began putting more energy into philanthropy and politics, initially with a nonpartisan group Taxpayers Against Earmarks. After Congress banned earmarks, the group shifted into a debt-focused organization, Ending Spending. The effort Mr. Davis was working on would have been undertaken by the group's political arm, the Ending Spending Action Fund.
Though newer to presidential politics, Mr. Ricketts has long been politically active in Nebraska. He was defeated in a local race for Republican Party chairman because he was seen as too moderate. He was a prolific donor to state candidates, investing money for ads that helped influence a United States Senate race this week.
Mr. Ricketts is described by friends as difficult to characterize politically.
He is not registered in either party in Wyoming, where he spends much of his time. He is a fiscal conservative who has grown increasingly frustrated at the economic and tax policies of the Obama administration. He also has supported Democrats who he perceives have a good record on spending restraint. ''Half the time he's a Libertarian and half the time he's Rush Limbaugh,'' said one associate, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
The Ricketts family is close, friends say, but politically divided. Two of his sons, Pete and Todd, attended the meeting in Chicago last week to review the advertising proposal, which was titled, ''The Defeat of Barack Hussein Obama.'' His daughter, Laura, is one of the top contributors to Mr. Obama's re-election bid and is a member of the campaign's national finance committee. His other son, Tom, is the general chairman of the Chicago Cubs and said he was not politically active.
Laura Ricketts, who is gay and is a proponent of same-sex marriage, embraced her family on Thursday and said her father and brothers were ''passionate about doing what is right for the country.'' In a statement, she added, ''Though we may have diverse political views, above all we love and respect each other.''
Tom Ricketts, whose baseball team is pursuing city and state assistance for a $300 million stadium renovation, said in another statement, ''I repudiate any return to racially divisive issues in this year's presidential campaign or in any setting -- like my father has. My focus is on one of the great American pastimes, baseball.''
But perhaps no comment received more attention on Thursday than that of Mr. Romney, who said at a press briefing in Jacksonville, Fla., ''I repudiate that effort.''
''I think it's the wrong course for a PAC or a campaign,'' he said.
Mr. Romney also said that he had been a victim of ''character assassination'' from the Obama campaign, referring specifically to a new campaign commercial that suggested his work in the private equity firm Bain Capital was meant to imply that, ''I'm not a good person or a good guy.''
Mr. Romney's statement was a clear signal to outside groups that he and his strategists have no desire to wade into the commentary of Mr. Wright, preferring to remain focused on Mr. Obama's economic record.
Mr. Baker said Thursday that whatever messages Mr. Ricketts backs during the rest of the campaign would ''be focused entirely on questions of fiscal policy, not attacks that seek to divide us socially or culturally.''

HEADLINE: Germany, the Crisis and the G-8

 BODY:
When the leaders of the Group of 8 gather at Camp David on Friday, President Obama and the others must press Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany to commit to a euro-zone growth package. This is no time to mince words: Her one-size-fits-all austerity program has been a failure, pushing heavily indebted countries deeper into recession, making it even harder for them to pay off their debts. It is putting the already-weak recovery in the United States at risk and is fueling instability and extremism in Europe. 
After months of obstinance, Ms. Merkel has softened her stance -- saying that Germany is open to stimulus to spur growth, employment and development in Greece and pledging to work with the new French president, Francois Hollande, on a program to promote growth across recession-racked Europe. It is unclear, however, whether her comments reflect a true and lasting change of heart.
Ms. Merkel's new talking points appear to be driven mainly by the defeat in France of Nicolas Sarkozy, her longtime partner-in-austerity, and the spreading chaos in Greece, where anti-austerity voters brought down the government this month and fears that the country could soon exit the euro have provoked a run on the banks and capital flight.
German officials made things worse by talking about the euro zone's ability to carry on without Greece. Ms. Merkel is now insisting that she wants Greece to remain, but it will take more than kind words to change things.
What is needed is a real ''growth compact'' to boost the capacity of the European Investment Bank and other European Union funds to invest in infrastructure and other job-creating projects in crisis countries. It would need to be coupled with a plan to soften or delay agreed-upon spending cuts. That would be a breakthrough but only a start on the road to recovery.
Germany still strongly opposes a sensible plan, endorsed by the International Monetary Fund, in which euro-zone members jointly issue bonds. Such bonds would both help pay for stimulus projects while easing borrowing costs for vulnerable countries like Spain and Italy.
Some German voters have also begun to question austerity. But after insisting for so long that the profligate must pay for their sins, Ms. Merkel will need political cover from her fellow leaders. And there is no question that many of the struggling countries need to reform.
Greece and many others need to collect taxes, reform their labor markets and commit to honest and transparent budgeting. France could also soften its resistance to stronger pan-European institutions. That would allow for more effective decision-making on financial reform, emergency aid, fiscal discipline and structural reforms.
Everyone needs a way out. At the G-8 meeting, world leaders must find one.

HEADLINE: Clinton and Reagan Draw Praise (but Not From Whom You'd Think)

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- It says something about American politics that it has come to this: For the record, Bill Clinton does not actually support Mitt Romney for president no matter how many times Mr. Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, cites him in his speeches.
And for that matter, just for clarity, Ronald Reagan certainly would not be supporting President Obama, either.
To listen to the candidates on the campaign trail these days is a form of political whiplash. Mr. Romney lavishes praise on the very Democratic Mr. Clinton for breaking with his party's traditional big-government orthodoxy, while Mr. Obama harks back to the very Republican Mr. Reagan for agreement that millionaires should not pay lower tax rates than the middle class.
The inside-out rhetoric, of course, is mainly about scoring points against the opponent in an increasingly fiery election year. When Mr. Romney refers favorably to Mr. Clinton, it is to make the point that Mr. Obama has abandoned the centrist legacy of his Democratic predecessor. When Mr. Obama invokes the spirit of Mr. Reagan, it is to argue that the Republican Party of Mr. Romney has drifted far away from its popular roots. 
But the admiration expressed for the two former occupants of the White House also testifies to the fluidity of presidential reputations. Lost to history, it seems, is just how much Democrats loathed Mr. Reagan in the 1980s as an anti-communist zealot who thought that ketchup was a vegetable. Or how much Republicans despised Mr. Clinton in the 1990s as a slick huckster who dishonored the Oval Office. In the space of time, polarizing presidents have become historic statesmen.
''Presidential candidates occasionally seem to recant their onetime political opposition to a recent president of the opposite party,'' said the presidential historian Michael Beschloss. ''One reason is that with some historical distance, they may sometimes come to genuinely appreciate leadership qualities they didn't notice before.'' But, he added, ''more often it's politics.''
Mr. Beschloss recalled that Gerald R. Ford and the elder George Bush opposed Harry S. Truman in 1948 but after entering the White House themselves cited him, genuinely, as a role model. Richard M. Nixon derided George McGovern for not living up to the legacy of Mr. Truman and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Even Mr. Reagan cited John F. Kennedy in arguing for tax cuts, overlooking his own past criticism of the Democrat's economic policies as ''old Karl Marx.''
Frank J. Donatelli, a former Reagan White House political director, said the flattery had less to do with genuine admiration than calculation. ''You want to show that your opponent is at odds with a respected former president from his own party as a way to marginalize him,'' Mr. Donatelli said. ''It's a bid for centrist voters who nevertheless admire Reagan and Clinton's records and results.''
Still, the notion that Democrats could hold out Mr. Reagan as a model or Republicans could do so with Mr. Clinton suggests how passions fade over the years. Both left office with high approval ratings and came to be appreciated for their successes, while failures and scandals have been overlooked. Mr. Reagan today is remembered for restoring national confidence and helping end the cold war. Mr. Clinton is remembered for reforming welfare and balancing the budget. It helped that both presided over periods of economic growth with comparatively little armed conflict overseas.
Mr. Obama began citing Mr. Reagan during the 2008 campaign as a political jab at his primary opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton. Unlike her husband, Mr. Obama said, Mr. Reagan had been a ''transformative political leader.'' Now with Mrs. Clinton in the cabinet and Mr. Clinton on the campaign trail alongside him, the president has dropped the comparison, but he still cites Mr. Reagan to make arguments in favor of economic, immigration and nuclear disarmament policies.
He quoted Mr. Reagan just last month as he pushed for a new tax on millionaires. ''That wild-eyed, socialist, tax-hiking class warrior was Ronald Reagan,'' Mr. Obama said. ''He thought that in America, the wealthiest should pay their fair share, and he said so.''
A couple weeks later, Mr. Obama was at it again. ''Ronald Reagan could not get through a Republican primary in this election cycle,'' he said. ''Could not get through it. Here's a guy who raised taxes. That in and of itself would have rendered him unelectable in a Republican primary.'' Standing with him that evening was none other than Mr. Clinton, no longer a poor shadow of Mr. Reagan in Mr. Obama's rendering but now a president who accumulated a ''remarkable record'' as he turned around a party that ''was a little bit lost.''
Mr. Clinton has become a frequent touchstone for Mr. Romney lately as well. Instead of the president impeached for lying under oath to cover up an affair with an intern, Mr. Clinton in this telling is the apostle of fiscal responsibility as opposed to that ''old-school liberal'' now in the White House.
''Almost a generation ago, Bill Clinton announced that the era of big government was over,'' Mr. Romney said this week. ''Even a former McGovern campaign worker like President Clinton was signaling to his own party that Democrats should no longer try to govern by proposing a new program for every problem.
''President Obama,'' he went on, ''tucked away the Clinton doctrine in his large drawer of discarded ideas, along with transparency and bipartisanship. It's enough to make you wonder if maybe it was a personal beef with the Clintons, but really it runs much deeper.''
From Mr. Romney's perspective, it does not hurt to remind centrist Democrats of the past tensions and disagreements between Mr. Obama and the Clintons.
Not that every president from another party becomes suddenly acceptable. Mr. Romney has implicitly compared Mr. Obama to Jimmy Carter, while Mr. Obama routinely links Mr. Romney to the policies of George W. Bush. When Mr. Bush endorsed Mr. Romney before ducking into an elevator this week, Mr. Romney made little note of it, but the Obama camp eagerly spread the news.
To guardians of the former presidents' legacies, the latest campaign-trail tributes ring hollow. John D. Podesta, a former Clinton chief of staff who now leads the liberal Center for American Progress Action Fund, said it was ''ironic that Romney is so exuberant in embracing Clintonomics'' since Mr. Clinton raised taxes on the wealthy, invested in education and technology, and balanced the budget. ''Maybe Romney was too busy firing people in the '90s to have noticed,'' Mr. Podesta said.
Craig Shirley, a conservative consultant and Reagan biographer, likewise said that Mr. Obama's invocations of Mr. Reagan were off base. ''At first blush, I would say good for him,'' he said. ''But deeper, I would say Obama is profoundly misinformed if he thinks Ronald Reagan would agree with any of his policies. The fundamental difference is Reagan believed in people while Obama believes in government.''

HEADLINE: White House Eases Limits On Investing In Myanmar

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS; Peter Baker contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration on Thursday lifted most prohibitions on Americans' doing business in Myanmar, ushering in a new era of diplomatic relations between the United States and what was until recently one of the world's most repressive countries.
With bipartisan support from Congress -- though criticism from human rights organizations -- the administration opened the door to the first significant investments in decades in an impoverished country of 55 million now undergoing a sweeping, if incomplete, political transformation. 
President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton have previously pledged to support nascent changes in Myanmar that began last year with the election of a new president, U Thein Sein, but relations between the United States and Myanmar are now warming with startling speed after a quarter century of tensions.
Only a month ago, the administration was moving more cautiously, considering just a limited easing of sanctions that would allow nongovernmental organizations to work in areas like health and education. Since then, however, the well-known opposition leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, has taken a seat in Myanmar's new Parliament along with other members of her party. That prompted the European Union and Australia to suspend their own sanctions, raising the prospect of a foreign investment boom that American corporations are eager not to miss.
''So today we say to American business: Invest in Burma,'' Mrs. Clinton said Thursday, referring to Myanmar by its former name as a matter of American policy.
She appeared with the country's foreign minister, U Wunna Maung Lwin, in the State Department's Treaty Room, framed by the flags of both countries -- a scene unthinkable a year ago -- and described the changes that had taken place so far as ''irreversible.'' She pledged full American political, diplomatic and economic support to bring the country out of decades of isolation.
Mr. Obama nominated his special envoy to the country, Derek J. Mitchell, to be the first American ambassador to Myanmar since 1990, when the government's responded to political protests and unrest by annulling an election won by Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi's party. Mr. Wunna Maung Lwinthen announced that his country's current representative to the United Nations, U Than Swe, would become the ambassador in Washington.
''As an iron fist has unclenched in Burma, we have extended our hand,'' Mr. Obama said in a statement.
The administration's steps received strong bipartisan support from Congress but also provoked criticism from human rights organizations, which warned that the administration was moving too quickly to embrace a country that had yet to enshrine basic freedoms or the rule of law fully.
Praising the administration's move, two Republican senators, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and John McCain of Arizona, said it struck ''an appropriate balance between encouraging the process of reform now unfolding in Burma, while maintaining sufficient leverage to continue pressing the Burmese government for additional progress.''
Mr. Obama did not end the sweeping American sanctions -- some of which require Congressional action to remove -- but suspended enforcement of most of them by granting American companies a general license to do business in Myanmar.
Mrs. Clinton said the sanctions would remain on the books as ''an insurance policy'' in the event the country's political transition stalled, though she emphasized that ''our goal and our commitment is to move as rapidly as we can to expand business and investment opportunities.''
Senior administration officials said that the Treasury Department's office that enforces sanctions would restrict American commerce with the country's armed forces or corporations closely linked to them in what is still an opaque, state-managed economy.
The officials said that American companies would have to ensure they did not support forces inside Myanmar that repress political rights or participate in ethnic conflicts, two major concerns of human rights groups.
Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, in a video link to a recent conference in Washington, expressed support for the administration's steps but warned against lifting sanctions entirely, saying that the changes in her country were ''not irreversible.''
Rights groups responded more harshly. The United States Campaign for Burma and United to End Genocide said American investments were premature given that the country still detained political prisoners and continued to fight civil wars in ethnic areas.

HEADLINE: A Festive Atmosphere at Facebook

BYLINE: By EVELYN M. RUSLI and PETER EAVIS

 BODY:
Facebook pulled it off.
As investors raced to buy shares, the sprawling social network raised $16 billion on Thursday, in an initial public offering that valued Facebook at $104 billion.
While the I.P.O. shares, 421 million of them, are being sold at $38 each, the feverish anticipation of their debut could drive them higher on Friday when the stock starts trading about 11 a.m. Newly public technology stocks - particularly ones that have captured investors' attention like Facebook - often achieven double-digit gains in a one-day pop.
Investors who buy Facebook shares are taking a stake in a unique and potentially valuable business. But they are also exposing themselves to the risks posed by a relatively young company operating in uncharted territory.
The I.P.O. signals a rapid evolution for the company. In just eight years, Facebook has gone from a scrappy college service founded in a Harvard dormitory to the third-largest public offering in the history of the United States, behind General Motors and Visa. 
Investors now consider Facebook more stalwart than start-up. At $104 billion, the social network's market value is higher than those of McDonald's, Citigroup, Amazon and all but a handful of other American companies.
''Facebook is here to stay,'' said Navin Chaddha, a managing director of the Mayfield Fund, a venture capital firm. ''It's a virtual economy where people are spending more time than any other Internet property.''
Facebook will be celebrating the occasion in the same style on which it built its reputation.
The social network planned to celebrate its 31st ''hackathon'' on Thursday night, with engineers coding into the wee hours, employees amped up on Red Bull and workers-turned-D.J.'s playing their tunes, Facebook said. Part work, part fun, the Facebook tradition, which will take place in an area of the company's campus known as Hacker Square, encourages employees to do what they do best: brainstorm, design and create.
On Friday,Mark Zuckerberg, the hoodie-wearing founder whose stake after the I.P.O. is worth $19 billion, is set to ring the opening bell for the Nasdaq from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., surrounded by executives, engineers and other employees. Shares of Facebook, which will trade under the ticker FB, will start trading shortly thereafter.
For now, Facebook seems to be a must-own stock.
As the largest player in the social media arena, Facebook has enjoyed blue-chip status from the start, with investors worried about missing out on what could be the next Google. The social network will also soon join the Nasdaq 100, the technology index, so money managers looking to track the benchmark will join the swell of demand in the coming months.
The frenzy for Facebook was on full display in the weeks leading up to its I.P.O.
On May 4, JPMorgan Chase, one of the I.P.O. bankers, redecorated its Manhattan headquarters with a giant Facebook flag and welcomed the company's management team to discuss the scheduled roadshow. Before an equity sales team of 300,Jamie Dimon, the firm's chief executive, made a rare appearance. Alongside him was the deal maker Jimmy Lee, who affectionately called Facebook ''the next great blue-chip.''
In the weeks that followed, investors packed hotel ballrooms to hear Facebook executives give their pitch. Bankers drew up waiting lists for the events, which included stops in New York, Boston and Palo Alto, Calif.
The tour yielded an avalanche of orders. With investors lining up for shares, Facebook raised its price range and increased the size of its offering. Even so, demand from investors in the United States alone outstripped the number of shares by 30 times, according to one person with knowledge of the situation, who requested anonymity because the matter was private.
On Thursday, the underwriters met one more time at Facebook's headquarters to settle on a final price. The bankers, along with Facebook's chief financial officer, David Ebersman, discussed a price as high as $40 a share, above the estimated range. While demand was strong even at that level, the largest institutional investors, the pillars of any offering, pushed back a bit on the valuation. By early afternoon, the stock price was set at $38.
Facebook landed its record I.P.O. in the face of doubts about the company's main source of revenue: advertising.
After years of courting Madison Avenue, Facebook is still trying to persuade companies to not only build a presence on its site, but spend real dollars on advertising. Just as important, the company has to find ways to insert advertising into its users' activity without making the site cluttered or irritating.
Inconveniently, General Motors, one of the country's biggest advertisers, said this week that it was discontinuing its advertising on Facebook. That amounted to $10 million, a drop in the ocean for Facebook, but it exposed the social network's Achilles' heel. Investors, experts caution, will have to be patient for Madison Avenue to come around.
''It could take many years to calculate Facebook's impact,'' saidMartin Sorrell, the chief executive of WPP, the large advertising company. ''There's a lot of pressure for them to monetize their content and demonstrate productivity, but you can't do it overnight.''
In addition, Facebook may struggle to generate advertising revenue from the mobile space. Last month, it paid about $1 billion for Instagram, a mobile photo-sharing application that has plenty of users but not a scratch of revenue. Given the growth of smartphone use and the increasing amount of time those devices command, solving the mobile question is widely seen as a necessity, not an option, for Mr. Zuckerberg.
At the moment, investors are willing to give Facebook the benefit of the doubt.
Facebook is set to trade at more than 100 times its earnings for the last 12 months. At that level, investors assume the company will be far more profitable than the rest of corporate America. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index trades at 14 times earnings.
Facebook's fans think the rich valuation is warranted, given the company's prospects for earnings. The company's net income could be $4.5 billion in 2014, up from $1.2 billion last year, according to Ken Sena, an analyst at Evercore Partners.
But Facebook's results will depend on whether companies are willing to shell out their marketing dollars for a chance to reach the social network's 900 million users - and it's not clear advertisers will be willing to pay.
While Facebook is often compared with Google, the search giant has a relatively straightforward, and proven, method of generating most of its advertising revenue. It matches ads with what people are searching for. By contrast, Facebook has the potentially more demanding task of finding ways to insert ads into users' activity without cluttering their experience.
Bullish investors point to Facebook's profit margins, which are much bigger than Google's. ''A lot of people don't understand how profitable Facebook is,'' said Thomas Vandeventer, manager of the Tocqueville Opportunity Fund, which already owns Facebook shares. In 2005, Google's operating profit amounted to 34 percent of its revenue. Last year, Facebook's were 47 percent.
Facebook's user activity could also provide the company with a richer array of data than Google. The company just needs to work out ways of using this data for advertisers.
Facebook, in many ways, is like a mining company sitting on valuable deposits that are hard to dig up and refine. At a market value of $104 billion, investors think Facebook is sitting on gold. But the share price could tumble at any sign that Facebook's management cannot unearth it.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: JPMorgan Chief Agrees to Appear Before Senate Panel

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS and NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
7:41 p.m. Updated
Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, agreed on Thursday to testify before a Congressional committee examining the bank's surprise trading loss.
The Senate Banking Committee will hold the hearing with Mr. Dimon this summer, once it has had separate sessions with the bank's regulators. The committee is expected to focus on the trade gone awry and its implications for the future shape of financial regulation.
Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan Chase, confirmed that Mr. Dimon would appear. ''As always, we will continue to be open and transparent with our regulators and Congress,'' she said. 
The announcement last week that the nation's largest bank by assets sustained significant losses on its derivatives trading provided fodder for advocates of increased financial regulation. They have cited the incident to underscore the dangers of Wall Street risk taking.
The calls for a crackdown have centered on the so-called Volcker Rule, which would ban banks from trading with their own money. Regulators are putting the finishing touches on the rule, a crucial piece of the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul law.
The Senate Banking Committee will begin a round of Dodd-Frank hearings on Tuesday, when it convenes a panel with the leaders of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The committee will hold a second hearing on June 6 with some of JPMorgan's main regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
The hearing featuring Mr. Dimon will come later in the summer. The chairman of the committee, Senator Tim Johnson, Democrat of South Dakota, has not yet issued a formal invitation and did not specify what day Mr. Dimon would be asked to attend.
''Our due diligence has made it clear that the banking committee should hear directly from JPMorgan Chase's C.E.O. Jamie Dimon, and following our two Wall Street reform oversight hearings I plan to invite him to testify,'' Mr. Johnson said in a statement.
A Republican member of the committee, Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, initiated the push for a JPMorgan hearing. He also caused something of a storm in Washington on Monday when he revealed that a regulator from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency had told him that the Volcker Rule would not have applied to the JPMorgan trade. The head of the agency has since acknowledged that the earlier statements to Mr. Corker were premature.
The two Democratic authors of the Volcker Rule - Senator Carl Levin of Michigan and Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon - have used the JPMorgan trading blunder as ammunition for their effort. On a conference call with reporters on Thursday, the lawmakers called for the closing of the ''JP Morgan Loophole.''
In an initial draft, the Volcker Rule allowed banks to hedge their exposure to various risks, as JPMorgan initially did in its trades. But the lawmakers argued that the only kind of hedging permitted for big banks should be for the purpose of neutralizing a specific risk, rather than broad economic concerns, putting the onus on banks to identify that risk.
''This dramatized the reason why you need a Volcker Rule and makes it much more difficult for the Wall Street lobbying effort to succeed,'' said Mr. Levin, who wrote a letter with Mr. Merkley on Thursday to top regulators reiterating the message about tighter regulation in the wake of JPMorgan's trading loss. ''This is a situation where the law is clear and the history is clear.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: China 'Princelings' Using Family Ties to Gain Riches

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA and SHARON LaFRANIERE

 BODY:
SHANGHAI -- The Hollywood studio DreamWorks Animation recently announced a bold move to crack China's tightly protected film industry: a $330 million deal to create a Shanghai animation studio that might one day rival the California shops that turn out hits like ''Kung Fu Panda'' and ''The Incredibles.''
What DreamWorks did not showcase, however, was one of its newest -- and most important -- Chinese partners: Jiang Mianheng, the 61-year-old son of Jiang Zemin, the former Communist Party leader and the most powerful political kingmaker of China's last two decades.
The younger Mr. Jiang's coups have included ventures with Microsoft and Nokia and oversight of a clutch of state-backed investment vehicles that have major interests in telecommunications, semiconductors and construction projects. 
That a dealmaker like Mr. Jiang would be included in an undertaking like that of DreamWorks is almost a given in today's China. Analysts say this is how the Communist Party shares the spoils, allowing the relatives of senior leaders to cash in on one of the biggest economic booms in history.
As the scandal over Bo Xilai continues to reverberate, the authorities here are eager to paint Mr. Bo, a fallen leader who was one of 25 members of China's ruling Politburo, as a rogue operator who abused his power, even as his family members accumulated a substantial fortune.
But evidence is mounting that the relatives of other current and former senior officials have also amassed vast wealth, often playing central roles in businesses closely entwined with the state, including those involved in finance, energy, domestic security, telecommunications and entertainment. Many of these so-called princelings also serve as middlemen to a host of global companies and wealthy tycoons eager to do business in China.
''Whenever there is something profitable that emerges in the economy, they'll be at the front of the queue,'' said Minxin Pei, an expert on China's leadership and professor of government at Claremont McKenna College in California. ''They've gotten into private equity, state-owned enterprises, natural resources -- you name it.''
For example, Wen Yunsong, the son of Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, heads a state-owned company that boasts that it will soon be Asia's largest satellite communications operator. President Hu Jintao's son, Hu Haifeng, once managed a state-controlled firm that held a monopoly on security scanners used in China's airports, shipping ports and subway stations. And in 2006, Feng Shaodong, the son-in-law of Wu Bangguo, the party's second-ranking official, helped Merrill Lynch win a deal to arrange the $22 billion public listing of the giant state-run bank I.C.B.C., in what became the world's largest initial public stock offering.
Much of the income earned by families of senior leaders may be entirely legal. But it is all but impossible to distinguish between legitimate and ill-gotten gains because there is no public disclosure of the wealth of officials and their relatives. Conflict-of-interest laws are weak or nonexistent. And the business dealings of the political elite are heavily censored in the state-controlled news media.
The spoils system, for all the efforts to keep a lid on it, poses a fundamental challenge to the legitimacy of the Communist Party. As the state's business has become increasingly intertwined with a class of families sometimes called the Red Nobility, analysts say the potential exists for a backlash against an increasingly entrenched elite. They also point to the risk that national policies may be subverted by leaders and former leaders, many of whom exert influence long after their retirement, acting to protect their own interests.
Chinese officials and their relatives rarely discuss such a delicate issue publicly. The New York Times made repeated attempts to reach public officials and their relatives for this article, often through their companies. None of those reached agreed to comment on the record.
DreamWorks and Microsoft declined to comment about their relationship with Mr. Jiang.
A secret United States State Department cable from 2009, released two years ago by the WikiLeaks project, cited reports that China's ruling elite had carved up the country's economic pie. At the same time, many companies openly boast that their ties to the political elite give them a competitive advantage in China's highly regulated marketplace.
A Chinese sportswear company called Xidelong, for example, proudly informed some potential investors that one of its shareholders was the son of Wen Jiabao, according to one of the investors. (A private equity firm Mr. Wen helped found, New Horizon, invested in the company in 2009, according to Xidelong's Web site.) ''There are so many ways to partner with the families of those in power,'' said one finance executive who has worked with the relatives of senior leaders. ''Just make them part of your deal; it's perfectly legal.''
Worried about the appearance of impropriety and growing public disgust with official corruption, the Communist Party has repeatedly revised its ethics codes and tightened financial disclosure rules. In its latest iteration, the party in 2010 required all officials to report the jobs, whereabouts and investments of their spouses and children, as well as their own incomes. But the disclosure reports remain secret; proposals to make them public have been shelved repeatedly by the party-controlled legislature.
The party is unlikely to move more aggressively because families of high-ranking past and current officials are now deeply embedded in the economic fabric of the nation. Over the past two decades, business and politics have become so tightly intertwined, they say, that the Communist Party has effectively institutionalized an entire ecosystem of crony capitalism. ''They don't want to bring this into the open,'' said Roderick MacFarquhar, a China specialist at Harvard University. ''It would be a tsunami.''
Critics charge that powerful vested interests are now strong enough to block reforms that could benefit the larger populace. Changes in banking and financial services, for instance, could affect the interests of the family of Zhu Rongji, China's prime minister from 1998 to 2003 and one of the architects of China's economic system. His son, Levin Zhu, joined China International Capital Corporation, one of the country's biggest investment banks, in 1998 and has served as its chief executive for the past decade.
Efforts to open the power sector to competition, for example, could affect the interests of relatives of Li Peng, a former prime minister. Li Xiaolin, his daughter, is the chairwoman and chief executive of China Power International, the flagship of one of the big five power generating companies in China. Her brother, Li Xiaopeng, was formerly the head of another big power company and is now a public official.
''This is one of the most difficult challenges China faces,'' said Mr. Pei, an authority on China's leadership. ''Whenever they want to implement reform, their children might say, 'Dad, what about my business?' ''
There are also growing concerns that a culture of nepotism and privilege nurtured at the top of the system has flowed downward, permeating bureaucracies at every level of government in China. ''After a while you realize, wow, there are actually a lot of princelings out there,'' said Victor Shih, a China scholar at Northwestern University near Chicago, using the label commonly slapped on descendants of party leaders. ''You've got the children of current officials, the children of previous officials, the children of local officials, central officials, military officers, police officials.We're talking about hundreds of thousands of people out there -- all trying to use their connections to make money.''
To shore up confidence in the government's ability to tackle the problem, high-ranking leaders regularly inveigh against greedy officials caught with their hand in the till. In 2008, for instance, a former Shanghai Party secretary, Chen Liangyu, was sentenced to 18 years in prison for bribery and abuse of power. One of his crimes was pressing businessmen to funnel benefits to his close relatives, including a land deal that netted his brother, Chen Liangjun, a $20 million profit.
But exposes in the foreign press -- like the report in 2010 that Zeng Wei, the son of China's former vice president Zeng Qinghong, bought a $32 million mansion in Sydney, Australia -- are ignored by the Chinese-language news media and blocked by Internet censors.
Allegations of bribery and corruption against the nation's top leaders typically follow -- rather than precede -- a fall from political grace. Mr. Bo's downfall this spring, for instance, came after his former police chief in Chongqing told American diplomats that Mr. Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, had ordered the murder of Neil Heywood, a British businessman, in a dispute over the family's business interests.
Evidence has surfaced of at least $160 million in assets held by close relatives of Bo Xilai, and the authorities are investigating whether other assets held by the family may have been secretly and illegally moved offshore.
Wen Jiabao, the prime minister, responded by demanding a more forceful crackdown on corruption. Without naming Mr. Bo by name, People's Daily, the official Communist Party newspaper, denounced fortune seekers who stain the party's purity by smuggling ill-gotten gains out of the country.
Some scholars argue that the party is now hostage to its own unholy alliances. Cheng Li, an expert on Chinese politics with the Brookings Institution in Washington, said it would be difficult for the Chinese government to push through major political reforms aimed at extricating powerful political families from business without giving immunity to those now in power.
And with no independent judiciary in China, he said, party leaders would essentially be charged with investigating themselves. ''The party has said anticorruption efforts are a life-and-death issue,'' Mr. Li said. ''But if they want to clean house, it may be fatal.''
Chinese tycoons have also been quietly welcomed into the families of senior leaders, often through secret partnerships in which the sons, daughters, spouses and close relatives act as middlemen or co-investors in real estate projects or other deals that need government approval or backing, according to investors who have been involved in such transactions.
Moreover, China's leading political families, often through intermediaries, hold secret shares in dozens of companies, including many that are publicly listed in Hong Kong, Shanghai and elsewhere, according to interviews with bankers and investment advisers. Lately, the progeny of the political elite have retooled the spoils system for a new era, moving into high-finance ventures like private equity funds, where the potential returns dwarf the benefits from serving as a middleman to government contracts or holding an executive post at a state monopoly.
Jeffrey Zeng, the son of the former Politburo member Zeng Peiyan, is a managing partner at Kaixin Investments, a venture-capital firm set up with two state-owned entities, China Development Bank and Citic Capital. Liu Lefei, the son of another Politburo member, Liu Yunshan, helps operate the $4.8 billion Citic Private Equity Fund, one of the biggest state-managed funds. Last year, Alvin Jiang, the grandson of former president Jiang Zemin, helped establish Boyu Capital, a private equity firm that is on its way to raising at least $1 billion.
Most recently, with the Communist Party promising to overhaul the nation's media and cultural industries, the relatives of China's political elite are at the head of the crowd scrambling for footholds in a new frontier.
The February announcement of the deal between DreamWorks and three Chinese partners, including Shanghai Alliance Investment, was timed to coincide with the high-profile visit to the United States of Xi Jinping, China's vice president and presumptive next president. The news release did not mention that Shanghai Alliance is partly controlled by Mr. Jiang, the son of a former president, Jiang Zemin. A person who answered the telephone at the Shanghai Alliance office here declined to comment.
Zeng Qinghuai, the brother of Zeng Qinghong, China's former vice president, is also in the film business. He served as a consultant for the patriotic epic ''Beginning of the Great Revival.'' The film exemplified the hand-in-glove relationship between business and politics. It was shown on nearly 90,000 movie screens across the country. Government offices and schools were ordered to buy tickets in bulk. The media was banned from criticizing it. It became one of last year's top-grossing films.
Scholars describe the film industry as the new playground for princelings. Zhang Xiaojin, director of the Center of Political Development at Tsinghua University, said, ''There are cases where propaganda ministry officials specifically ask their children to make films which they then approve.''
Zhao Xiao, an economist at the University of Science and Technology in Beijing, said, ''They are everywhere, as long as the industry is profitable.''

HEADLINE: White House Enlists 45 Companies to Invest in Food Production for the World's Poor

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
The Obama administration has drafted some of the world's largest food and finance companies to invest more than $3 billion in projects aimed at helping the world's poorest farmers grow enough food to not only feed themselves and their families but to earn a livelihood as well.
President Obama and the leaders of four African countries will introduce the group of 45 companies, the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition, on Friday at a symposium on food security and agriculture that will begin the summit meeting of the Group of 8 industrialized nations this weekend at Camp David in Maryland. 
''We are never going to end hunger in Africa without private investment,'' said Rajiv Shah, the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development. ''There are things that only companies can do, like building silos for storage and developing seeds and fertilizers.''
The alliance includes well-known multinational giants like Monsanto, Diageo and Swiss Re as well as little-known businesses like Mullege, an Ethiopian coffee exporter.
The introduction of the group will coincide with the administration's report on the progress of what is known as the L'Aquila Food Security Initiative, the largest international effort in decades to combat hunger by investing in the fundamentals of agriculture, including seeds, fertilizer, grain storage, roads and infrastructure.
The initiative, first agreed upon by the Group of 8 leaders at their meeting in L'Aquila, Italy, in 2009, was a pledge to put $22 billion into food and agriculture projects. Although much of the money had previously been earmarked for agriculture projects, about $6 billion was new.
Almost all of the $22 billion has now been ''budgeted and appropriated,'' and 58 percent of it has been disbursed, Mr. Shah said. ''I am confident that continuing into this year and the next, the U.S. and other countries will absolutely meet their commitments,'' he said.
He conceded, however, that not all of the money is being spent as promised, which has drawn complaints from many nongovernmental organizations and African countries.
''The grand promise of L'Aquila was, if you build a plan for agriculture, the donors will help them find the resources for it,'' said Gregory Adams, director of aid effectiveness at Oxfam America, an international relief and development organization.
''Now there are 30 plans of varying degrees of quality with shovel-ready projects donors could invest in today, but instead donors have put their money in other things.''
Some donor countries have insisted that their money be spent on traditional food handouts rather than the building blocks of an agricultural development program, Mr. Adams said.
Several companies that were contacted said the administration had asked them not to speak about their commitments until Friday.
Mr. Shah, however, offered a few examples. Tanseed, a Tanzanian seed company, will commit to spend $11 million over time to buy certified seed and sell it in little packets to meet the needs of small farmers.
Derek Yach, senior vice president for global health and agriculture policy at PepsiCo, a member of the alliance, said it grew from work the World Economic Forum had been doing on food security with the African Union.
''What's exciting about it is that the companies participating really extend across the value chain,'' Mr. Yach said, including seeds, plants, processing and financing.
Mr. Shah said that the administration does not plan for the private sector to take over.
''The president will commit to encouraging ourselves and our G-8 partners to seek to maintain the high level of commitment to agriculture and food security even as we go forward beyond the formal L'Aquila period'' of three years, he said.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Friday about the White House's drafting of a group of 45 companies to invest in projects aimed at helping the world's poorest farmers contained two misstatements, in some editions, because of incorrect information supplied by the United States Agency for International Development. The name of the group is the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition, not the Alliance for Food and Nutrition Security, and a $375 million pledge by an Indian company, Jain Irrigation, to bring its small-scale irrigation technology to Africa, is not final.

HEADLINE: Senate Confirms 2 Nominees to Federal Reserve Board

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Senate on Thursday confirmed two nominees chosen by President Obama for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, overcoming Republican objections and bringing the seven-member board to full strength for the first time since 2006, before the economic crisis.
The Harvard economist Jeremy C. Stein and the investment banker and lawyer Jerome H. Powell were confirmed easily after a morning of debate. The vote for Mr. Stein was 70 to 24, and for Mr. Powell, 74 to 21. 
Neither has widely known views on the central policy questions facing the Fed: whether to take more action to reduce unemployment or whether the economy is already at risk of a dangerous acceleration of inflation.
For months, Senator David Vitter, a Louisiana Republican and a member of the Banking Committee, held up the nominations, saying the two men would be ''rubber stamps'' for the policies of the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and, by implication, the Obama administration. Mr. Bernanke has already done more to increase economic growth and reduce unemployment than many of his conservative critics favor, while other critics -- predominantly liberal -- argue that he has not done enough.
After JPMorgan Chase's recently acknowledged trading losses, which raised questions about whether the Fed and other agencies had a tight enough hand on the regulatory reins, Senate Democratic leaders found enough votes to surmount objections from Mr. Vitter and others. Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, explicitly linked the vote to the JPMorgan Chase matter, saying the bank had been behaving as if its business were a game of craps.
In addition to setting interest rates based on the economy's condition, the Fed also is one of the main regulators of financial businesses.
Both of the new governors are experienced in financial regulation, Mr. Powell as a senior Treasury Department official under President George H. W. Bush, and Mr. Stein as an adviser to Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner.
Some Fed watchers have expressed concern that the institution has been operating below full capacity for so long. Mr. Obama had been slow to fill all of the vacancies, and Republicans had blocked some of his nominees.
In 2010, Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama, put a hold on the nomination of Peter A. Diamond, a Nobel laureate in economics, causing Mr. Diamond to withdraw last June. On Thursday, some senators expressed hope that the vote would lead to broader comity. For too long, said Senator Lamar Alexander, a Republican of Tennessee, being in the Senate had felt like ''being invited to join the Grand Ole Opry and not being allowed to sing.''
Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said, ''We hope it can set the tone for agreements well into the future, this year and in 2013 as well,''
A White House statement expressed gratitude that ''both parties have come together'' for the votes on Mr. Stein and Mr. Powell. ''Today's broad bipartisan vote in the Senate reflects their deep knowledge of economic and monetary policy, as well as their distinguished backgrounds and unique experience,'' it said.
Opening the debate on the Senate floor, Mr. Vitter made clear that he opposed the candidates, and that he opposed the Fed's monetary policy of low interest rates. ''This Federal Reserve has set essentially a zero interest rate policy, an extremely easy policy for an extended period of time,'' he said, calling it a ''very dangerous policy.''
On the regulatory front, Mr. Vitter said, approving the two new members would make it easier for the board to enact rules carrying out the Dodd-Frank financial regulation law and pushing ''those regulations to the left, if you will.''
The two nominees were confirmed by a voice vote of the Senate Banking Committee on March 29, and neither is controversial in his own right. But Senate Republicans have blocked many of Mr. Obama's nominees, out of a broader opposition to his policies.
Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, said he would vote to confirm the nominees, saying they were qualified even though he believed they were not as ''hawkish'' on inflation as he would like.
Mr. Corker expressed hope that, if Mitt Romney won the presidential election, Democrats would not stand in the way when he nominated the next Fed chairman and vice chairman.

HEADLINE: The Biggest I.P.O. Disruption: Rank-and-File Riches

BYLINE: QUENTIN HARDY


HIGHLIGHT: Mark Zuckerberg gets the billions and the headlines, but an even bigger effect from offerings like Facebook's is the many who score enough wealth to cover their worries, then go take risks. In the next few years, there could be tens of thousands of them. 

 BODY:
 Big tech offerings like Facebook's always generate a lot of publicity for the top executives, who walk away with personal scores worth hundreds of millions, even billions, of dollars.
Pay no attention to them. O.K., pay some, since there is a good chance that those lucky titans will buy something huge or make a potentially world-changing donation to charity. But the greater effect on the economy may well come from the riches that hit the rank and file.
These are the early employees, star engineers and little-discussed sales people, who typically own 15 percent of a company, pre-I.P.O. When the company goes public, they walk away with $2 million, $5 million, $10 million.
That sounds like, and is, a lot of money. In Silicon Valley, however, it is enough to go to middle class heaven: you own your house clear, say, and the kids' school is covered. You will not stop working, but you can take a few more risks, maybe in the form of a mind-charging sabbatical, maybe joining another start-up. You have a little money for angel investing, for that genius engineer with a good idea.
These people do not have the means of Mark Zuckerberg, but there are a lot more of them, and that incremental spending, investing and risking may well have more impact than anything the highly focused billionaire can do.
How many of them are there? In the next few years, perhaps 80,000 such employees at tech companies will pick up a few million dollars each, says Andrew Rachleff, a former venture capitalist who runs a financial advisory service called Wealthfront.
Mr. Rachleff, who started Benchmark Capital in 1995, then left full-time work there in 2004 to teach at Stanford's business school, figures it like this:
Including Facebook's $100 billion stock offering, in the next few years there is a good chance $500 billion will be raised from tech companies going public. Typically a young and high-growth company can trade at 10 times revenue, or $50 billion. On a conservative estimate of $40 billion in revenue among the companies, and $500,000 in revenue per employee, that is 80,000 people.
There is a lot of guesswork in his math, and not all employees get even $1 million in an initial offering. The broader point, however, is solid: A lot of people, perhaps 1,000 alone just from Facebook, are about to cover most of their lives' major worries. As a rule, they are young, smart and want to work. Something is bound to happen.

HEADLINE: New Classroom Science Standards Up for Review

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: New standards for science education for the first time include sections on climate change. 

 BODY:
The first substantial update to national science teaching standards in roughly 15 years -- and the first including the science of human-driven climate change -- is open for public comment through this month. Here's a short video description:
The effort has been directed by Achieve, an organization created by states and corporate backers eager to boost student performance and prospects as science and technology increasingly drive economies. The final (optional) standards will help guide states in shaping science curricula and requirements.
The foundation for the standards was laid in a National Academy of Sciences report. Other groups involved in the effort are the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the National Science Teachers Association and the Carnegie Corporation of New York, which has provided much of the money.
The standards were drafted by a team of 41 writers from 26 states, range from Bob Friend, a Boeing aerospace engineer, to Ramon Lopez, a physics professor at the University of Texas at Arlington to Rita Januszyk, an elementary school teacher from Willowbrook, Ill.
Click here for middle school standards on weather and climate and here for a section for high schools on managing human environmental impacts, including greenhouse-gas emissions. I like the way each such section links directly to the relevant section of the underlying National Academy of Sciences report -- "A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas."
The National Science Teachers Association has posted heaps of valuable background and context.
Juanita Constible, a wildlife ecologist who's spent time in Antarctica, has a piece summarizing the climate context at the Web site of the Climate Reality Project. Here's an excerpt from Constible's post:
The Next Generation Science Standards lay out core ideas K-12 students should understand about the basics of science - from biology, to physics and chemistry, to earth science. The last national standards were released back in 1996, and manmade climate change wasn't mentioned. However, the new standards recognize that students need to know human activities are changing our climate. They also recognize that schools are training the next generation of engineers and scientists who can help solve the problem.
In the standards for middle school, for example, one of the core ideas is that "human activities, such as the release of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels, are major factors in the current rise in Earth's mean surface temperature ('global warming')." The standards for high school note that "changes in the atmosphere due to human activity have increased carbon dioxide concentrations and thus affect climate." [Read the rest.]
Explore the standards and weigh in with your reaction, both on the Nextgenscience.org site and here.

HEADLINE: May 18, 1980 | Mount St. Helens Volcano Erupts

BYLINE: THE LEARNING NETWORK


HIGHLIGHT: On May 18, 1980, the Mount St. Helens volcano in Washington State erupted after a large earthquake, leaving 57 people dead and destroying 250 homes. 

 BODY:
On May 18, 1980, the Mount St. Helens volcano in Washington State erupted after a large earthquake, leaving 57 people dead and destroying 250 homes. The event was recorded as the deadliest and most economically devastating volcanic event in the history of the United States. As The New York Times described, "Mount St. Helens exploded at 8:39 a.m. today with a thud felt 100 miles away and with a drifting column of steam and pumice that turned day into night."
Two months before the eruption, there had been a magnitude 4.2 earthquake at Mount St. Helens. A bulge grew on the mountain's north side by the end of April, which indicated to experts that magma might be rising and that there was the possibility of a large explosion. The authorities asked residents to evacuate, but a few chose not to, including an 83-year-old Harry Truman (no relation to the former president), who became a minor celebrity when he refused to evacuate his home. Mr. Truman's body was never found after the 5.1 magnitude quake resulted in a huge collapse on the mountain.
The United States Geological Survey estimated that the eruption of gas and rock traveled 80,000 feet into the air and traveled 300 miles per hour as it covered the area within 230 square miles of the volcano. It destroyed the surrounding forest and immediately killed everything in its path. The 600-degree Fahrenheit gas and rock caused the mountain's snow to melt, creating mud flows known as "lahars." The eruption caused an estimated $3 billion in damage.
Connect to Today:
After the eruption, Mount St. Helens was designated as a national volcanic monument for "research, recreation and education."
A 2009 Times article examined the battle over the future of the site. Those in favor of granting greater public access to the mountain believed it should become a national park, which would bring better financing to the area. Mount St. Helens remains primarily a research zone.
Consider the more general question posed in the article: "How do landscapes recover after violent disturbance?"Given the increase in such events in the United States in recent years, what are your thoughts on how habitats and communities can best heal and move forward after a natural disaster has occurred?

HEADLINE: How Often Do You Interact With People of Another Race or Ethnicity?

BYLINE: DANIEL E. SLOTNIK


HIGHLIGHT: How integrated is your school? Your community? Your social and family life? How important do you think it is to interact with people of different backgrounds? 

 BODY:
In the article "Whites Account for Under Half of Births in the U.S.," Sabrina Tavernise writes:
Such a turn has been long expected, but no one was certain when the moment would arrive - signaling a milestone for a nation whose government was founded by white Europeans and has wrestled mightily with issues of race, from the days of slavery, through a civil war, bitter civil rights battles and, most recently, highly charged debates over efforts to restrict immigration.
While over all, whites will remain a majority for some time, the fact that a younger generation is being born in which minorities are the majority has broad implications for the country's economy, its political life and its identity. "This is an important tipping point," said William H. Frey, the senior demographer at the Brookings Institution, describing the shift as a "transformation from a mostly white baby boomer culture to the more globalized multiethnic country that we are becoming."
In another recent article, "Why Don't We Have Any White Kids?," N. R. Kleinfield examines a New York City school that is far from integrated:
In the broad resegregation of the nation's schools that has transpired over recent decades, New York's public-school system looms as one of the most segregated. While the city's public-school population looks diverse - 40.3 percent Hispanic, 32 percent black, 14.9 percent white and 13.7 percent Asian - many of its schools are nothing of the sort.
About 650 of the nearly 1,700 schools in the system have populations that are 70 percent a single race, a New York Times analysis of schools data for the 2009-10 school year found; more than half the city's schools are at least 90 percent black and Hispanic. Explore Charter is one of them: of the school's 502 students from kindergarten through eighth grade this school year, 92.7 percent are black, 5.7 percent are Hispanic, and a scattering are of mixed race. None are white or Asian. There is a good deal of cultural diversity, with students, for instance, of Haitian, Guyanese and Nigerian heritage. But not of class. Nearly 80 percent of the students qualify for subsidized lunch, a mark of poverty. The school's makeup is in line with charter schools nationally, which are over all less integrated than traditional public schools.
At Explore, as at many schools in New York City, children trundle from segregated neighborhoods to segregated schools, living a hermetic reality.
... Decades of academic studies point to the corroding effects of segregation on students, especially minorities, both in diminished academic performance and in the failure to equip them for the interracial world that awaits them.
Students: Do you think interacting with different people from different cultural backgrounds is part of a well-rounded education? Why or why not? How integrated is your school? Your community? Your social or family life? What might be better about a segregated community and school? What might be worse? What could students from a segregated community do to meet people outside their neighborhood? What role, if any, should the government play in seeking to integrate aspects of daily life?

HEADLINE: Guest Post | Teenager Writes About 'Crushing Weight of College Debt'

BYLINE: KATHERINE SCHULTEN


HIGHLIGHT: George Edwards, 17, a high school senior, writes about how the prospect of crushing student debt is affecting his future plans. 

 BODY:
This week, The Times is publishing a series on student debt that includes articles, video and interactive graphics, as well as an invitation to write in to tell about how student debt has affected life. On Tuesday, we published a lesson plan full of ideas for using the series in the classroom.
Now, we add another resource to our offerings: a personal essay from a high school senior about how the prospect of debt is affecting his future plans. 
The author - George Edwards, 17, a senior at Vanguard High School in New York City - comes to us from Youth Communication, a New York City organization that publishes true stories by teenagers, and lesson plans for teachers. 
Learning Network readers might remember that in March we ran our first piece from this organization, an essay by Anthony Turner, 19, about the Trayvon Martin case. Teachers and students responded enthusiastically: as of this writing,more than 300 people have posted comments.
We invite you to comment on this piece as well. 
The Crushing Weight of College Debt
By George Edwards
Total student loan debt just reached $1 trillion this year. That's higher than total credit card debt. In 2010, college seniors graduated with an average of $25,250 in student loan debt, according to the Institute for College Access and Success. At the same time, tuition rates keep rising: The College Board reported last year that tuition at public universities increased by more than 8 percent in 2011 alone.
Many students are starting to feel that college is out of reach. Yet with the unemployment rate still so high, they also fear entering the job market without a college degree.
While some students feel hopeless, some have opted to fight back. A lot of those participating in the Occupy Wall Street protests are college students. They are asking for more financial aid help through government grants and lower student loan interest rates. Some are even asking the government to wipe out student debt altogether.
Students Taking Action
Last November, a group of students from Baruch College got into an altercation with police after holding a demonstration to protest proposed tuition increases in the City University of New York system. CUNY students were later joined by students from other universities, who banded together in a movement called Occupy Student Debt, according to The New York Times. Across the country in California, students inspired by Occupy Wall Street have protested state budget cuts to higher education, limits on student enrollment at state universities, and ever-increasing tuition.
Students also gathered on Capitol Hill in March when they found out about the possible increase in student loan interest rates due to take effect this July. The interest rates on federally subsidized student loans are set to double from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent. President Obama, looking for the youth vote, is paying attention. In late April, he campaigned at colleges in several states to let students know he'd be urging Congress to prevent the increase.
Whenever I think about the high cost of tuition and the need for student loans, fear runs through me. I am a high school senior, and, like millions of other students this fall, I will face bills that could be anywhere from several thousand dollars to upwards of $50,000 per year to attend college. My family doesn't have that kind of money, but I want to go to college to pursue my dream of being either a journalist or a financial adviser.
Although I'm a good student, my chances of getting enough scholarship money to cover all my expenses are slim. That leaves me with one option: student loans.
Student loans aren't necessarily a bad thing, but they can be risky. The more money you borrow, the longer it will take to pay them back, and the debt will weigh on you.
I have a friend who doesn't plan on going to college because it is too expensive. She wanted to become a photographer and she plans to do it without college. It feels like thievery that the cost of education has increased so much that some kids don't even want to try going to college.
Inform Yourself
So what can you do to prepare for the financial burdens of college? I interviewed Cherild Diaz, a friend of mine who is already in college, about how she's financing her education. Diaz explains that being realistic when you choose a college is important. While it's good to have a dream school, it's necessary to have other options, too. Even when colleges offer a lot of scholarships or other forms of financial aid, it may not be enough to cover all your expenses. So you either have to take out big loans or go to a more affordable school.
"If you get accepted to a really good college, but scholarships and grants don't cover the cost, you'll have to downgrade to another college and might not get the same education as you would have at that great college," she said.
Diaz opted for a state school, the State University of New York at Stony Brook, instead of a private college. She thought it was a good tradeoff because she can always transfer into a better school if she keeps her grades up and finds some scholarships.
Even at a state school, Diaz had to take out loans, and she worries about ending up with a lot of debt. "You have to pay this money back in the future, and if you owe like $30,000 ... it's just really scary. Hopefully I can get a job that's good and I can pay them back slowly and be out of debt."
A Change in the Law?
Diaz's worries are shared by a lot of students. That's why some students are advocating for passage of the Student Loan Forgiveness Act of 2012, introduced by Representative Hansen Clarke, a Democrat from Michigan. The act would let borrowers (students and former students) be let off the hook for tens of thousands of dollars in student loan debt. Supporters of the bill, including many students, say it's only fair at a time when college is becoming so expensive, and that it will stimulate the economy by freeing up their incomes to buy houses, start businesses, and spend money instead of being trapped in a cycle of debt.
That may help students like me in the future, but I have to make a decision now about whether I am willing to take out loans to pay for my education. I decided to talk to my college adviser, Leylah Bighach, about whether it makes sense for students to finance their education with loans if their family can't afford to pay out of pocket.
"That's a hard question," she said. "[A few years ago], I would've had no problem encouraging a student to take out a maximum amount of money in student loans for their undergraduate degree. But because of the economy having student loan debt nowadays is not the same as it was 7 or 8 years ago, when it was much easier to get a good-paying job."
Dream College on Hold
Sometimes I feel as if I'll have to sell my soul in order to go to my dream college. If I take out loans that I can't pay back, loan officers and the school that I owe money to will stalk me. I imagine them circling me like a bunch of vultures after I graduate. (And simply not paying back your loans has consequences: It can mess up your good credit and prevent you from getting loans and credit cards in the future.) But I'll still take the chance, because I want the college experience, and in order to get my ideal job, I have to go to college.
I've decided to attend New York City Tech because my dream school, the University of Maryland, is too expensive. I'm going to work hard for two years so I can get a good scholarship and transfer to Maryland or Hunter College.
But too many students are taking out loans without even knowing the consequences. I would recommend that students do more research on financial aid options, starting in their junior year or even earlier. They should talk to their parents about what the family can afford, and discuss the pros and cons of applying for loans with a college counselor.
If your school offers a college prep class, that's another way to get good information about choosing a college that fits with your financial realities. The class I took covered the college application process and financial aid. We attended college fairs where representatives from both public and private colleges were available to answer questions, and we learned to fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, which is the way you get government grants, work study, and subsidized loans.
Just because college is expensive doesn't mean that you shouldn't apply. If you can't afford your dream school, then pick a cheaper runner up, like community college. In most cases, you'll have more job options and earn a lot more money over time with a college degree than you would with just a high school diploma.

HIGHLIGHT: Gary Braness, a pest management consultant and owner of Yosemite Environmental Services, is taking readers' questions. 

 BODY:
In this week's Real Estate section, Samantha Storey writes about that most common of New York City problems: pests.
In an ideal world, if all New Yorkers picked up after themselves, we would have far, far fewer cockroaches, rats, ants and moths to contend with inside our apartments. But there will always be supers who don't take out the trash on schedule and neighbors who hoard pizza boxes, making this metropolis a utopia for pests. 
And so we'll be collecting readers' questions about how to evict their unwanted roommates for Gary Braness, a pest management consultant and owner of Yosemite Environmental Services, to answer.
Submit your question in the comment box below.
Dr. Braness's answers will appear on Friday.

HIGHLIGHT: Highlights from the DealBook newsletter. 

 BODY:
Facebook to Begin Trading at $104 Billion Valuation | As investors raced to buy shares of Facebook, the sprawling social network raised $16 billion on Thursday, in an initial public offering that valued the company at $104 billion. While the I.P.O. shares, 421 million of them, are being sold at $38 each, the feverish anticipation of their debut could drive them higher on Friday when the stock starts trading about 11 a.m.
Investors who buy Facebook shares are taking a stake in a unique and potentially valuable business. But they are also exposing themselves to the risks posed by a relatively young company operating in uncharted territory.
The I.P.O. signals a rapid evolution for the company. In just eight years, Facebook has gone from a scrappy college service founded in a Harvard dormitory to the third-largest public offering in the history of the United States, behind General Motors and Visa. At $104 billion, the social network's market value is higher than those of McDonald's, Citigroup, Amazon and all but a handful of other American companies.
DealBook will have a live blog that will track the Facebook I.P.O. throughout the day. The New York Times will provide video analysis with Business Day Live at 10 A.M. and at the opening and closing of the Nasdaq market. Our charts will follow the latest share price as well as the value of the stock held by top people, including company executives and early investors.

HEADLINE: The Great Gatsby Curve, for the States

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: A back-of-the-envelope attempt to look at the relationship between income inequality and economic mobility in the 50 states. 

 BODY:
Earlier this year, Alan Krueger, the chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers and a former Economix contributor, presented what he called the Great Gatsby Curve: that is, a chart showing a negative relationship between intergenerational mobility and income inequality in rich countries. It suggested that a greater concentration of wealth might make it harder for people at the bottom to move up the income ladder.
Since then, Pew's Economic Mobility Project has released American state-level mobility data. I thought it might be interesting to look at whether states in which wealth is distributed more evenly also appear to provide poorer residents with opportunities for more upward mobility.
It's an exceedingly difficult question to answer (and Pew's report did not seek to do so), especially given the limited data available. But here's a rough, back-of-the-envelope first go.
The chart above shows inequality on the horizontal axis and relative income mobility on the vertical axis. Here are the exact metrics I used:
Pew produced several different measures for economic mobility (none of which was directly comparable to that used in the original Gatsby Curve chart, unfortunately). I focused on its metric for relative upward mobility.
This is calculated by focusing on the Americans who, when surveyed at some point between 1978 and 1997, were in the bottom half of the income distribution - that is, they earned less than the median American. The report's authors looked at what share of those people were able to move at least 10 percentiles up the income ladder when interviewed again exactly a decade later.
A higher number for each state means that a larger share of people at the bottom were able to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps. For example, in Connecticut, about half of the people who started in the bottom of the income distribution climbed up at least 10 percentiles.
Then I looked at a measure of income distribution called the Gini index, which runs from zero to one. A lower Gini coefficient means income is more equally distributed, and a higher value means income is more concentrated among the richest.
The Census Bureau offers household Gini index values by state for select years. I took an average of the values for 1979 and 1989 (the two years that fell within the survey period Pew looked at) and compared those to mobility values.
Again, this is a very rough take, but there seems to be a weak negative relationship at best. (For the nerds out there, the R-squared is a mere 0.048.)
I also tried plotting inequality against absolute income mobility - that is, the average percent growth of residents' earnings over a decade. For example, the average New Yorker had a 20 percent rise in earnings.
The relationship here is slightly stronger, but still pretty weak. (The R-squared was 0.09 in this case.)
One challenge you may notice with these data - besides the fact that the years are not precisely matched up, among other things - is that there's just not that much variation in inequality among the states. The Gini coefficients range from 0.3795 to 0.471, so the points are clustered relatively closely together.
Do you have thoughts on other ways to investigate how inequality affects mobility within the United States?
An earlier version of this post misstated, at one point, the relationship shown in the Great Gatsby Curve between intergenerational mobility and income inequality in rich countries. It is negative, not positive; therefore, as the post correctly stated, a greater concentration of wealth might make it harder for people at the bottom to move up the income ladder.

HEADLINE: What Will President Obama Say?

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: A prominent Democratic pollster gave Mr. Obama a 50-50 chance of re-election. What can the president do to improve his chances? 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney is decidedly unpopular. Polling by the Times and CBS News shows his approval rating languishing at around 30 percent. Other polls show voters think President Obama is more likely to have good ideas about improving the economy than Mr. Romney.
Peter Hart, the veteran Democratic pollster, wrote in a memo this week that participants in his focus groups call Mr. Romney "indecisive," "inconsistent," and a "flip-flopper."
"If he were a member of the family," Mr. Hart wrote, voters would consider him a "dad who is never home." The most recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, conducted by Mr. Hart and his partner, Bill McInturf, gave Mr. Obama an edge of about 30 points in areas like "cares about average people," and "compassionate."
Why, then, is Mr. Romney running even with the sitting president in national polling? Mr. Hart gave Mr. Obama only a 50-50 chance of re-election.

The first two shots by the Romney campaign in the advertising war provide some insight. One is a traditional 30-second spot released today that makes grandiose promises about the first day of a Romney presidency. The other, released on Tuesday, is a four-minute web video that accuses President Obama of killing jobs and destroying the economy.
Both are based on some pretty healthy fabrications (the TV spot says Mr. Romney will create thousands of jobs by approving the Keystone XL pipeline, which will create only a few hundred long-term jobs). But they outline a potent argument against Mr. Obama that many Americans seem to find convincing.
It goes like this: The President went on a spending spree that made the downturn much worse. Unemployment is still high. The national debt and the deficit (which the Republicans use interchangeably to confuse voters as much as possible) are mounting. People are hurting and worried they will be hurting more. Mr. Obama is just plain ineffective. One of the web video's "ordinary Americans" says that when Mr. Obama was running, "Everyone thought, man this guy is going to get something done." But now "it seems like nothing's getting done."
In a surface sense, this narrative is accurate. Mr. Obama passed the stimulus, but unemployment is still high. He promised hope and change, but Washington's dysfunctional. This line of thinking, however, doesn't get at why so many Americans are still struggling to find work, or who's actually responsible for "nothing getting done."
The stimulus did not stop unemployment dead in its track-fair enough. But, really, did anyone think it would? And part of the problem was that, as Paul Krugman and the editorial page have argued repeatedly, the stimulus was too small.
Republicans share a disproportionate amount of the blame for "nothing getting done." They oppose whatever Mr. Obama wants, whether it's good for the country or not. Congressional Republicans took the country to the brink of default in last summer's debt ceiling fight simply to serve that cynical aim.
Mr. Obama can make these points, and he probably will, at least indirectly, but it's hard to imagine that simply blaming the Republicans will get him re-elected.
So what will the president tell Americans to get them to vote for him?
Mr. Obama can go on energizing his base by doing things like endorsing marriage equality and protecting women's reproductive rights. And he needs to. Mr. Hart pointed that Republicans are much more focused on this election than Democrats.
He can also argue the country is indeed recovering from the recession-although his aides know he has to be careful on this point, since progress has been slow.
The president can also try to associate Mr. Romney with the failed economic policies of George W. Bush, and Ronald Reagan before him. I think it's obvious those policies were a failure, but the mythology of Republican competence in economic affairs is still alive and well.
The Obama campaign can, and certainly will, use Mr. Romney's record as governor of Massachusetts against him - not just his metamorphosis from a moderate to a "severe" conservative on issues like abortion and health care reform, but also his failure to create jobs.
We can expect to hear a lot from Mr. Obama about building an economy that is "built to last," which sounds like a positive message, and partly is. But it's also an attack, of sorts, meant to stir up Americans' deeply negative feelings about Wall Street and the big banks' focus on short-term gain.
Many voters understand that if we just let Wall Street run wild, we'll end up with more bubbles that hurt the economy when they pop. To that end, Mr. Obama will be pushing hard for financial regulation. The recent losses at JP Morgan Chase will help him make his case. Mr. Romney's tenure at Bain Capital may be useful here, too.
But ultimately the election may come down to a more ephemeral sense of how voters assess each candidate's philosophy. Mr. Hart said the recent NCB/WSJ survey showed that voters, by a margin of 10 percentage points, say they are more likely to vote for a candidate who will "fight for balance and fairness" and help the middle class than a candidate who "wants to restore the values of economic freedom, opportunity and small government." The poll said those voters identify Mr. Obama as the "fairness" candidate, also by a margin of almost 10 percentage points.
So I'll go way out on a limb and predict that we're going to hear "fairness" and "balance" a lot from Mr. Obama between now and November.
This post originally stated that the stimulus was too small because Republicans insisted on slashing it. It's true that Republicans opposed the stimulus, but it's not quite accurate to lay the blame for its size entirely on the G.O.P. House Republicans were in the minority at the time.

HEADLINE: G.M. Decides to Forgo Super Bowl Advertising

BYLINE: STUART ELLIOTT


HIGHLIGHT: For the second time in a week, General Motors is making news for advertising it will not be running rather than for advertising it is running. 

 BODY:
For the second time in a week, General Motors is making news for advertising it will not be running rather than for advertising it is running.
G.M. said it would not buy commercial time during Super Bowl XLVII, to be broadcast by CBS on Feb. 3, 2013. The company is not pulling out of the game, because it had not already agreed to buy any spots; rather, it has decided against a buy.
The disclosure, first reported by The Wall Street Journal on Friday afternoon, came three days after the company said it would discontinue its advertising on Facebook, worth about $10 million a year.
General Motors is a mainstay Super Bowl sponsor, but not a continuous one like Anheuser-Busch InBev, for beers like Bud Light and Budweiser. For example, G.M. was in the Super Bowl in 2008, but sat out the games in 2009 and 2010, then returned for 2011 and 2012.

"We understand the reach the Super Bowl provides, but with the significant increase in price, we simply can't justify the expense," Joel Ewanick, global chief marketing officer at General Motors in Detroit, said in a statement provided by e-mail to a reporter.
There have been reports that CBS is charging an estimated $3.8 million to $4 million for each 30-second commercial during Super Bowl XLVII. That compares with an estimated $3.5 million for commercials during Super Bowl XLVI in February 2012.
G.M. has made several moves this year that are aimed at seeking more efficient and effective ways to spend its giant ad budget, among them consolidating the duties for its media planning and buying. The company spent more than $4 billion last year to advertise in countries around the world, including the United States.
The automotive category is usually the largest in a Super Bowl game, but the number varies each year based on the economy and other factors.
For instance, G.M. was not the only automaker to forgo the game in 2009 and 2010 because of economic conditions. And Mercedes-Benz, after making a splash with a Super Bowl spot last year, decided against advertising in the game this year.
During Super Bowl XLVI, G.M. commercials included spots for the Chevrolet Sonic, the Chevrolet Silverado, the Chevrolet Camaro and the Cadillac ATS. Other automakers that advertised during the game included Acura, Audi, Hyundai, Kia, Lexus, Toyota and Volkswagen; Chrysler made headlines with a spot, featuring Clint Eastwood, that ran during halftime.

HIGHLIGHT: A case study in political neophytes with big checkbooks, and ahead of the NATO Summit, a lowered standard of success in Afghanistan. 

 BODY:
In Today's Times:

        
Having hoped to be a big player in the presidential race, Joe Ricketts found himself managing the reverberations from the news that he was considering financing a controversial advertisement linking President Obama to his former pastor the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. Jim Rutenberg and Jeff Zeleny report on the billionaire, whose holdings include a brokerage firm and a baseball team, and the case study offered by his entrance onto the political scene.

        
Ahead of the NATO meeting in Chicago, American officials quietly acknowledge that the bar delineating success in Afghanistan has been lowered after 11 years in combat, describing a hoped-for outcome that is less ambitious than what they once pictured, Helene Cooper and Thom Shanker report.

        
Mitt Romney praises Bill Clinton. Mr. Obama cites Ronald Reagan. While their words are intended to send a message to voters about how the other candidate has drifted away from his party's legacy, they are also a testament to the fluidity of presidential reputations, Peter Baker writes.

        
The House is preparing to vote on whether the military may detain without a trial terrorism suspects captured in the United States, a provision that had previously been left unclear, posing a legal controversy, Charlie Savage reports.
Washington Happenings:

        
Mr. Obama will speak Friday at the Symposium on Global Agriculture and Food Security, then meet with the newly elected president of France, Francois Hollande, at the White House to discuss cooperation on issues including the war in Afghanistan and the economy. Later, he will travel to Camp David, where he will host international leaders for the Group of 8 Summit.

        
The House Homeland Security Committee will hold a hearing Friday on terrorism financing since 9/11.

HEADLINE: Issues of Race and Religion Bubble Up in Campaign

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Questions about President Obama's race, religion and the place of his birth diverted the conversation from the economy. 

 BODY:
Perhaps the darker side of politics is always close to the surface.
President Obama and his rival,Mitt Romney, have said for months that the 2012 election will be about the economy. But on Thursday, it became - at least for the day - all about the long-simmering issues of race and religion.
The continuing economic struggles in the country are still certain to dominate the campaign debate in the next six months. The unemployment rate remains above 8 percent, the housing slump continues, debt is rising rapidly and overseas economies are flailing.
But the events of Thursday suggest that it does not take much to divert the presidential conversation back into the sensitive and politically dangerous questions of Mr. Obama's race, his religion and the place of his birth.
In the morning, a report in The Times exposed a secret plan by Republican strategists and financiers to rekindle questions about the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Mr. Obama's onetime pastor and his angry, black-power rhetoric.
By the afternoon, the conservative Drudge Report Web site published a headline: "BORN IN KENYA," based on a three-decade-old promotional booklet for a publisher that included an inaccurate biography of Mr. Obama. It stayed on the site for much of the afternoon.

The headline linked to a report at Breitbart news, another conservative site, which suggests that the booklet represents "a pattern in which Obama - or the people representing and supporting him - manipulate his public persona."
Mr. Romney on Thursday repudiated the plan to use Mr. Wright's religious rhetoric as a racially tinged cudgel against Mr. Obama. But the report served to once again divert the campaign away from the economy and onto the tricky terrain of racial politics in America.
And that led reporters to recall previously ignored comments that Mr. Romney made in February suggesting that Mr. Obama wanted to make America into "a less Christian nation." Asked if he stood by those comments, Mr. Romney said that he did.
"I'm not familiar, precisely, with exactly what I said, but I stand by what I said, whatever it was," Mr. Romney said.
Aides to Mr. Obama say they were not surprised by the day's events and that they remained prepared to respond even more forcefully - with television ads, if necessary - if the religion or race-based attacks return later in the year.
"To the extent that this ever raises its head, we will certainly be ready with a forceful response," said one adviser to Mr. Obama's campaign, who requested anonymity to discuss strategy. "But the fact is, the American people will be as well."
Mr. Obama's campaign advisers said they believed the American people had largely dismissed the questions about his birth and about links to his former pastor. They pointed to polls that show that the president remains personally likable among a majority of voters.
"The American people know who he is. They know him as a leader and a father. They know his character," the adviser said. "While it's clear that there are some on the other side who would be willing to engage in these attacks, we don't think they will be effective."
But, especially in the era of "super PAC" politics, it is clear that issues that were thought to have been disposed of long ago can roar back into the public arena with a vengeance. Mr. Obama believed he had dealt with questions about race and Mr. Wright in a speech in 2008, only to see the issue bubble back to the surface this week.
Mr. Romney discovered the staying power of personal attacks during his primary campaign last year, when ugly questions about his Mormon faith were revived by conservative pastors who called Mormonism a "cult."
It has been nearly four years since Mr. Romney gave a well-received speech about his faith during his first presidential campaign, and no political opponent has attacked him directly on his religion. But as the speeches by the pastors proved, it does not take much to raise the issue.
Mr. Romney's advisers have rejected another religion speech, saying members of the public know Mr. Romney and his personal history in a way they did not back in 2008. But it is interesting to wonder what the campaign might be forced to do if a super PAC raised his religion in an attack ad.
On Thursday, Mr. Romney sought to divert attention from the super PAC attack plan by accusing Mr. Obama of conducting a campaign of "character assassination" over the past several months. He said Mr. Obama's attacks on his record at Bain Capital were designed to accuse him of not being "a good person."
But in truth, Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney and their campaigns have shied away from the charged issues of race and religion as they begin the final six months of campaigning for the White House. Their actions suggest that - at least for now - there remains a line that neither side is willing to cross.
The question is: will the super-rich backers of super PACs play by the same rules?
Politicians, consultants and voters are all bracing for the answer.

HEADLINE: Romney Unveils First Ad of General Election

HIGHLIGHT: Called "Day One," the ad focuses on a number of economic policies that Mr. Romney considers priorities. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney unveiled a series of television ads in English and Spanish on Friday, kicking off his campaign's general election advertising effort with a short and straightforward commercial that lays out what "President Romney" would accomplish on his first day in office. 
Called "Day One," the ad focuses on a number of economic policies that Mr. Romney considers priorities. And while it is not an attack ad in the conventional sense, it takes a few swipes at President Obama, accusing him of standing in the way of job creation and stymieing growth through government-mandated health care. 
The ad highlights Mr. Romney's support for the Keystone Pipeline, an expansive system of pipes that would deliver oil from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. The president's efforts to slow the development of the project have infuriated many conservatives and become a flash point in the debate over the Obama administration's energy policy. 
 "What would a Romney presidency be like?" the commercial asks. "Day one, President Romney immediately approves the Keystone Pipeline, creating thousands of jobs that Obama blocked. President Romney introduces tax cuts and reforms that reward job creators, not punish them. President Romney issues order to begin replacing ObamaCare with common sense health care reform. That's what a Romney presidency will be like."
The Spanish version, called "Dia Uno" is identical in its message. Mr. Romney, who has often been criticized by Hispanic leaders for embracing tough illegal immigration laws, has not been nearly as visible as President Obama has in his television advertising efforts to reach Hispanics.

HEADLINE: 'Stay Classy,' Crossroads Admonishes Obama Camp

BYLINE: SARAH WHEATON


HIGHLIGHT: An Obama campaign official's new practice of using an abbreviated vulgarity to describe conservative ads draws rebuke - and page views. 

 BODY:
Capping off two weeks of debate on whether adolescent bullying and a former pastor are fair game is the latest affront to political discourse: abbreviated cussing.
In a series of viral Web videos, Stephanie Cutter, a deputy campaign manager for President Obama's re-election, has taken to using a colorful phrase to describe advertisements financed by outside conservative groups. 
The video Ms. Cutter released on Thursday, "Get the Facts on Karl Rove's B.S.," is a substantive, point-by-point rebuttal of Crossroads GPS's latest advertisement, which accuses the president of breaking a series of major campaign promises on the economy.
On Friday, Crossroads served up its own volley, objecting to broken promises.
Steven Law, the president of Crossroads GPS, systematically offers evidence to back up the claims from the group's original minute-long ad. But his kicker is more about etiquette than the economy. "One more thing: Stay classy, Chicago," Mr. Law says, winking.
"One could very classily interpret" the admonition as a reference to Ms. Cutter's language in the video, said Jonathan Collegio, a Crossroads spokesman.
But Chicago evidently would rather stay viral. The Obama campaign is pleased with the hundreds of thousands of people who have proved willing to sit through several minutes of policy talk.
But it might already be losing its novelty. Ms. Cutter's first call - against an advertisement by Americans for Prosperity - has drawn more than 615,000 views on YouTube since May 2. Thursday's video has so far netted not quite 37,000.

HEADLINE: Reaching Catholics

BYLINE: JIM ARKEDIS


HIGHLIGHT: To win over Catholic swing voters, President Obama needs to emphasize social and economic justice. 

 BODY:
In 2012, once again, Catholics should be the swing voters of a presidential race. They're one of the country's most divided and complex voting blocs, too. One third of Catholics are staunch social conservatives who view abortion as a litmus test when choosing a candidate, but Gallup polling finds the rest of Catholics slightly to the left of the country on most "values" issues.
Recent events have highlighted these divisions. After Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a Catholic, said he was "entirely comfortable" with same-sex marriage in early May, President Obama reportedly accelerated his announcement endorsing it. Church leaders condemned Obama, while 68 percent of Catholics - five points higher than the country as a whole - support legal gay and lesbian relationships, and 51 percent support same-sex marriage.
In February, the Obama administration thought it had come to an understanding with the United States Council of Catholic Bishops over a federal mandate compelling Catholic institutions to pay for health care plans that cover birth control. But in the end the bishops rejected an "unjust and unlawful" deal, which Mitt Romney called an "attack on religious tolerance." Fifty-eight percent of Catholics - including 62 percent of Catholic women - sided with the Obama administration, three points more than the rest of country.
Then there is the Hispanic vote. At 50 million, Hispanics are the fastest growing bloc in the country, solidly Catholic, and focused on the politics of immigration. In 2001, Karl Rove said that increasing the Republican share of the Hispanic vote was his mission, but the 2012 Republican Party doesn't seem to be paying attention to that line of thinking. Mitt Romney promised to veto the Dream Act, a proposed law that would provide a pathway to legal status for children of illegal immigrants, provided they serve in the military or attend college.
Catholics are up for grabs this year. A Gallup poll from April has President Obama and Mitt Romney tied among Catholics, 46 percent each. At nearly 20 percent of the population, Catholics have roughly mirrored the popular vote in the last eight elections. They voted for Ronald Reagan and George Bush, but switched to Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996. In 2000, Catholics, like the country, went under 50 percent for George W. Bush; but against John Kerry, Bush took 52 percent; by 2008, they'd flipped to Barack Obama, 54-45.
It's unclear whether the Obama campaign will specifically organize Catholic supporters or try to persuade moderate ones. This Monday, the campaign hired Michael Wear as its faith vote director. That's an excellent first step, and Wear's experience organizing faith-based outreach for Obama in 2008 and in the White House indicates that the Obama campaign is taking people who make their faith a priority seriously. Wear might have too much on his plate, however - the campaign Web site groups Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Southern Baptists and Muslims under a one-size-fits-all "Voters of Faith" outreach program. It's a mistake to treat the Catholic vote just like the rest.
Perhaps no presidential candidate since John F. Kennedy has been able to unite this disparate flock. But President Obama's task isn't that tough. The key to winning the Catholic vote is to understand its composition - litmus-test abortion voters, moderates, women and Hispanics - and to aim to carry persuadable Catholics by healthy margins in crucial swing states. Failure to deliver them could cost the president re-election.
Recent events suggest that these vast groups of Catholic voters (again: women, moderates, Latinos) are now more open to a progressive faith-based message than they have been perhaps since Kennedy-Nixon. The Obama campaign should tread lightly, however, and resist any poll-driven urge to drive a wedge between the faithful and official church positions on women's issues or same-sex marriage. Divisive messaging probably won't fly among most Catholics, who may grumble about their religious leaders' positions, but don't seek overt separation from them. I can't say that there's any scientific evidence to support this theory, but it comes from my observations over a lifetime in the Catholic community.
The Obama campaign's message should unequivocally stand with the church and Jesus Christ's humble message of social justice, equality and inclusion. These are distinctly Catholic themes that draw sharp contrasts for Catholics who have tired of a Republican Party with less room for those who are not straight, male, white and self-sufficient.
Mitt Romney's embrace of Representative Paul Ryan's budget bill, replete with radical cuts to social-safety net programs, is a good place to start. The budget which Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, put together, and which the House passed, was rejected by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, who said that the plan failed a "basic moral test." Some 90 members of Georgetown's faculty wrote a letter to Ryan that read, in part, "your budget appears to reflect the values of your favorite philosopher, Ayn Rand, rather than the gospel of Jesus Christ." The letter went on:
We would be remiss in our duties to you and our students if we did not challenge your continuing misuse of Catholic teaching to defend a budget plan that decimates food programs for struggling families, radically weakens protections for the elderly and sick and gives more tax breaks to the wealthiest few.
For its part, the White House protested that the Ryan budget imposes "a particular burden on the middle-class and the most vulnerable." This argument should form the bedrock of Obama's faith-based appeal to persuadable Catholics.
A broad, upbeat theme of social justice will be enough for Obama to reach persuadable Catholics, who can interpret the message in concert with their beliefs. The president might quote Pope John Paul II, who once said, "Radical changes in world politics leave America with a heightened responsibility to be, for the world, an example of a genuinely free, democratic, just and humane society." They must hear the message often and at least 15 percent of the time in Spanish.
Newly available data show the Obama campaign exactly where to target persuadable Catholics. On May 1, the United States Religious Census published a survey detailing where Catholics live on a county-by-county basis across the country. It was not terribly surprising. They heavily populate the Northeast, the upper Midwest, south Florida, southern Colorado and northern New Mexico, and California. In other words, there are a lot of Catholics in crucial swing states.
Separate, openly available county-by-county demographic data identifies where moderate or progressive voters, from a variety of backgrounds, live.
Overlaying a map of densely Catholic counties on top of a map of persuadable voters shows that the Obama re-election team has a unique chance to focus its social justice message on prized areas: heavily Catholic, moderate counties within swing states.
This strategy prescribes very specific Catholic outreach efforts. The re-election campaign should target the west side of Cleveland through the Indiana state line, but shouldn't waste resources on conservative Catholics in east-Cleveland suburbs. Northern Wisconsin is in play, but certain Milwaukee suburbs aren't. Greater Pittsburgh is likely to reap higher returns than Philadelphia. The campaign should run up the score with Hispanic voters in Colorado and New Mexico. In total, there are approximately 200 counties nation-wide that should end up on the campaign's list.
What would a Catholic voter outreach program look like? The Roman Catholic Church doesn't exactly let political operatives walk in the front door and set up shop, but there are several progressive Catholic organizations - Catholics United, Catholics in Alliance, Catholic Democrats - that the campaign could engage first to build a volunteer corps. Within each district office, the campaign could identify Catholic precinct captains to recruit Catholic door-knockers to reach out to their friends from church. Then there's advertising. It would be more difficult to construct this architecture from scratch, but however it's done, it's a must: a positive social justice message could be what tips the balance toward re-election for the president.
As a moderate Democrat and a Catholic, I disagree with my party when I say that I believe life begins at conception or that abortions should be performed only in cases of rape, incest or when a pregnancy threatens a mother's life. In another era, those beliefs might have made me a Republican target. But I'm a Democrat, in part, because of the party's deep belief in social justice: We're the ones who make equality and inclusion central to our very being; we stick up for the little guy; we don't believe everyone should fend for themselves all the time. That's what Jesus said, and that's the society President Obama wants to build.

HEADLINE: Facebook Builds Network of Friends in Washington

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- For nearly five years, Facebook has quietly and deftly befriended the nation's top lawmakers by giving them a little tech support.
In a typical session behind closed doors on Capitol Hill, Facebook staff members have walked them through how best to use the site: what kinds of pictures to post on their profiles, how to distinguish between valuable constituents and the random gadfly, how to write compelling messages. Members of Congress have asked: How do I get more Facebook followers?
The answers have come from familiar faces: former political aides from both Republican and Democratic quarters, now employed by Facebook. Patrick Bell, an aide to Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Republican from Washington, recalled a meeting last fall where a onetime Republican aide, Katie Harbath, counseled a room full of Republican lawmakers on how to use the site to communicate with voters. ''We had a Republican from Facebook talking to Republicans. They love that,'' he said. 
Facebook, whose long-awaited Nasdaq debut on Friday left it with a market value of nearly $105 billion, does much more in Washington than this kind of in-person hand-holding. It has hired a stable of seasoned, well-connected insiders from both parties, stepped up its lobbying and set up a political action committee. Its lobbying budget -- $1.35 million in 2011 and $650,000 so far this year, according to figures from the Center for Responsive Politics -- still pales in comparison to major companies in more established industries, like military and pharmaceuticals. But Facebook stands out for having staked out a Washington strategy so early in its history.
This engagement with lawmakers is likely to matter much more to Facebook in coming months, as the company confronts the need to turn the data provided by its 901 million users into faster, greater returns for its new, hungry shareholders.
It is likely to do so mostly through targeted advertising, so any legislation that restricts how it collects and uses data will be potentially damaging -- and now that Facebook is a public company, potentially infuriating to investors.
The training sessions, at least, seem to have been highly effective so far. A majority of lawmakers have embraced Facebook as a way to reach voters.
''It's smart advocacy 101,'' said Rey Ramsey, chief executive of TechNet, an industry group that includes Facebook and other Internet companies. ''It starts with giving people an education. Then you start explaining more of your business model. What you ultimately want is for a legislator to understand the consequences of their actions.''
According to privacy advocates who follow Facebook's lobbying efforts, the company will want to stave off legislation that could limit the use of location data from mobile devices, for instance, or restrict what information can be shared with advertisers. The company could be especially damaged by more aggressive scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission, which has already subjected Facebook to a costly 20-year audit of its data use policies.
Facebook cites government policy as a risk factor to prospective shareholders. ''Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation and could harm our business,'' it states in its offering document with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
A Democratic aide in the Senate, who did not want to be named because he was not authorized to speak to reporters, said Facebook realized it needed to engage with lawmakers to protect its business. ''It reflects an increased awareness that what the people's representatives in Washington think matters, as opposed to a sole focus on what their user base thinks, or a sole focus on innovation without explanation.''
Critics have questioned whether an embrace of Facebook as an increasingly vital political tool would make lawmakers go soft on the company on issues like privacy.
''That's clearly something they do to curry favor with members of Congress,'' said Bill Allison, editorial director at the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan group that advocates for greater government transparency. ''Clearly Facebook has something members of Congress want. They are taking advantage of a product they have to get closer to members of Congress.''
Representative Mary Bono Mack, a California Republican who oversees a subcommittee responsible for online privacy, dismissed that criticism, arguing instead that familiarity breeds a deeper understanding of consumer privacy issues. Ms. Bono Mack has 5,000 friends on her personal Facebook page, she said, and uses it to post things ranging from pictures of her dog to legislation proposed on the Hill.
''If anything, having an understanding of it, I have a keen awareness of the issues, I have a keen awareness of my own privacy,'' she said, adding that she planned to watch whether Facebook's approach to privacy would change as it faced extra pressures to make money. ''Now that they are a public company, there will be an opportunity to watch what happens.''
Joel Kaplan, vice president for United States public policy at Facebook, said in an e-mail that the company's efforts in Washington ''reflect our commitment to explaining how our service works, the actions we take to protect the more than 900 million people who use our service, the importance of preserving an open Internet and the value of innovation to our economy.''
That Facebook is a global business, with more than half of its users outside the United States, complicates matters. The European Commission, based in Brussels, has already proposed new rules that would constrain how Internet companies use personal information. They would allow consumers to transport their data from one site to another and ask Web site owners to delete their personal data forever -- provisions that several Internet companies, including Facebook, have described as burdensome. And there would be hefty fines for noncompliance.
''The fight will eventually be in Washington and Brussels about what they'll be allowed to do,'' said David Eastman, chief executive for North America for the advertising agency JWT and its worldwide digital director. Facebook, in many ways, has profited from the experience of the technology companies that came before it. Microsoft eschewed Washington until it got in trouble over antitrust matters; Google set up a Washington office after going public in 2004.
Facebook established a foothold in Washington in 2007, first by hiring a young political aide, Adam Conner, to work out of his apartment, and then by plucking several well-known Washington insiders. It invested early in educating lawmakers on the advantages of using its site. Lately it has been encouraging them to humanize their pages by posting photos of personal milestones. Several, including House Speaker John A. Boehner, have uploaded childhood photos.
Representative McMorris Rodgers, Republican of Washington, credited the company with ensuring that 85 percent of House Republicans had Facebook pages. ''A key driver of that growth is Facebook's D.C. team, which has been eager to explain how their platform works and quick to suggest innovative ways for members to stay more connected to the constituents we represent,'' the congresswoman said.
Facebook has hired well-connected political aides with access to top leaders in both parties. They include Mr. Kaplan, who was a White House deputy chief of staff under President George W. Bush; Marne Levine, a former Obama administration economic adviser; and Erin M. Egan, one of the capital's most influential privacy lawyers.
Even beyond Washington, Facebook is peppered with politicos. President Bill Clinton's chief of staff, Erskine Bowles, sits on its board. A former Clinton press secretary, Joe Lockhart, is part of its communications team. Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, served under President Clinton, too, as a chief of staff to Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers. And its general counsel, Ted Ulyot, was chief of staff in the Justice Department under President Bush.

HEADLINE: Markets End Week With a Losing Streak Intact

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL POPPER

 BODY:
Investors drove American stock indexes to their worst weekly performance of the year after excitement about Facebook's stock offering failed to chase away the pessimism that has increasingly gripped investors in recent weeks.
Friday's declines sealed the first string of three down weeks since the dark days of last summer when markets took a dive on the twin concerns of the European debt crisis and the prospect of a double-dip recession in the United States.
While those fears faded early this year, they were revived after Greek elections pushed the country toward leaving the euro currency and threatened to pull down the European banking system. More recently, several economic releases have suggested that growth in the United States and China may be weakening. 
The yields on Treasury bonds, which go down when investors are looking for a haven, have fallen even lower than they did last summer, sinking to levels that many analysts thought were unlikely.
With several investor surveys showing bearish sentiment at its highest level since last year, many strategists are bracing for a long summer.
''We're on storm watch for the summer of 2012,'' said Jack Malvey, the chief global market strategist at BNY Mellon.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 4.3 percent for the week and 0.7 percent on Friday to close at 1,295.22. That takes the index back to where it was in mid-January. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.6 percent, or 73.11 points, to 12,369.38.
The interest rate on the 10-year Treasury bond ended the week at 1.72, hovering around the lowest level in decades.
Around the world, Switzerland, Australia and Mexico joined the list of countries where stocks have erased all of their gains since the beginning of the year.
This is the third year in a row that markets have headed south in the spring. In the last two years the markets eventually recovered, but only after months in the red. The S.& P. 500 had risen nearly 12 percent earlier this year, but now stands up just 3 percent.
Facebook's initial public offering was supposed to help lift some of the gloom that settled over the stock markets. In the hours before its debut, technology stocks saw gains.
But as the I.P.O. stalled and ended the regular-trading day essentially flat at $38.23, it brought other hot technology stocks down with it. The Nasdaq composite index ended the day down 1.2 percent and fell 5.3 percent this week, to 2,778.79. The frantic trading in Facebook shares did push up the volume of trading on the nation's exchanges. But one-day spikes are not expected to erase the trend of shrinking trading volumes as investors seek refuge in less risky assets like bonds.
Sectors of the economy that rely on global exports, like energy and materials, have been heading down for weeks. But recently sectors that are focused more on the United States economy, like consumer staples and utilities, have also suffered.
The biggest sign of the potential problems for the economy came on Thursday when the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia reported that its monthly business outlook survey for the Middle Atlantic region unexpectedly turned negative in May. That confirmed fears raised by recent government data suggesting that companies had slowed their hiring.
''We've seen some softer data,'' said Michelle Girard, the senior United States economist at RBS. ''It has led to some disappointment for those who had hoped we were on to something more.''
Financial stocks fell more sharply than any other sector in the S.& P. 500 this week after JPMorgan disclosed late last Friday that it suffered billions dollars in unexpected trading losses on a corporate trading desk. The bank ended the week down 9.4 percent. Finance industry professionals worry that the incident could lead banks to cut back on some types of riskier lending, which could in turn dampen the economy.
Looking forward, market strategists and traders have also been increasingly focused on the possibility that United States politicians could, as they did last year, fall into paralyzing debate over tax increases and the federal debt.
The economic picture has by no means totally soured. This week brought the latest batch of data suggesting that the housing industry, including residential real estate prices, might have finally begun a slow improvement.
More important, any further weakening of the economic picture could provoke the Federal Reserve to embark on another round of asset purchases like the ones that helped bolster the economy when it slowed the last two years. The notes from the Federal Reserve's most recent meeting, released on Wednesday, indicated that a growing number of the central bank's board members were open to such measures.
''It's hard for portfolio managers to get too negative because in the back of their head they know the Fed could come in at any time and change the game,'' said Rick Bensignor, the chief market strategist at Merlin Securities.
The picture could change drastically if the European situation entered full crisis mode, and fears of this have escalated further than they did last year. The euro currency reached its lowest level in two years this week and was trading at $1.27 on Friday.
Greece is the leading problem, but if Greece leaves the euro currency there is widespread concern that Spain, with a much larger economy, would follow it. The cost of insuring Spanish debt rose to its highest level this week. Investors are watching the international summit meetings in Washington and Chicago this weekend, where European leaders could discuss measures to contain the problems.
''We are at a crossroads here,'' said Mr. Malvey. ''Fateful decisions are going to be made by politicians over the next two to four months.''

HEADLINE: Pentagon Study Says China Military Getting Stronger

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- China is pressing a long-range modernization of its military, part of a strategy aimed at maximizing its leverage over Taiwan, extending its influence farther abroad, but avoiding conflict around its borders or with the United States, the Pentagon said on Friday in an annual report to Congress.
Chinese leaders, the report asserted, view this as a time to ''focus on internal development while avoiding direct confrontation,'' although they expect tension, competition, and territorial flare-ups from time to time, and they do not expect the status quo, however satisfactory they find it, to last indefinitely. 
The United States, decades ahead technologically, spends much more, and in pivoting its strategy toward Asia and the Pacific, ''seeks to build a military-to-military relationship with China that is healthy, stable, reliable, and continuous,'' the annual report said.
Two months ago, Beijing announced an 11.2 percent increase in its annual military budget to roughly $106 billion. While economic comparisons and analysis have always been difficult, there is no doubt that the past few decades have seen steady expansion in China's military spending, and the Pentagon's estimate is that China is investing more than it says, but still only about a fourth of what the United States spends each year on the military.
For its money, China is getting more weapons, and better ones.
Its air force is ''transforming into a force capable of offshore offensive and defensive operations,'' the report said, with prototypes of a stealth fighter seen starting last year. Other areas of investment include defenses against ballistic missiles, early warning and air-defense missiles, and their land and naval equivalents.
But the developments cited in the report unfold only over decades. For example, China's first aircraft carrier, purchased from Ukraine in 1998, set out on its shakedown cruise last summer, but China still has no planes equipped to land on its deck, and its naval pilots are still training ashore. ''We expect it'll take several additional years for an air group to achieve a minimal operational capability aboard the aircraft carrier,'' said David Helvey, a Pentagon official handling regional issues, at a briefing on the report.
In many ways, the modernization shows a Chinese military that has watched what the United States has done in the past generation or two, and is exploring the same avenues of growth. From the restructuring of its army to the new ascendancy of information technologies in warfare, there are parallels.
To be sure, there are profound differences, as the People's Liberation Army, or P.L.A., plays a distinct role in Chinese society, government, and economic affairs.
The two militaries are already operating more frequently in overlapping territories, and the 2012 report traced the same themes as last year's, but a bit more succinctly.
In the past year, it noted, the P.L.A. ''deployed assets to support noncombatant evacuation operations from Libya, extended its presence in the Gulf of Aden for a third year of counterpiracy operations, took on leadership roles in United Nations peace operations, and conducted medical exchanges and a service mission to Latin America and the Caribbean using the P.L.A. Navy's hospital ship.''
These are examples of what the Chinese call ''new historic missions'' for the P.L.A., and while they are generally not threatening to other nations, they demonstrate a new assertiveness that the Pentagon, and some allies of the United States, look upon warily.
''China's actions in 2011 with respect to ongoing land and maritime territorial disputes with neighbors,'' the report said, ''reflected a mix of contentment with the status quo, renewed efforts to reassure wary neighbors, and continued willingness (particularly through the use of paramilitary maritime law enforcement assets) to assert Chinese claims.'' This has been especially notable in the South China Sea, where tensions with the Philippines continue.
However, ''China notably took steps to ease relations with Japan and dampen suspicion among rival South China Sea claimants after China's assertive posture in 2010 increased regional tensions. These steps included high-level engagement with Tokyo and confidence-building measures with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), even as Chinese maritime law enforcement assets continued to defend Chinese claims in disputed areas,'' the report said.

HEADLINE: Refugee Farmers Find Solace in a Floodplain

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN

 BODY:
BURLINGTON, Vt. -- Unpredictability has been a life companion for Clothilde Ntahomvukiye and her fellow refugee farmers from Burundi, who were out clearing stubborn hillocks of weeds and dandelions with hand hoes the other day in a spring drizzle.
So last August, when the ferocious torrents of the Winooski River unleashed by Tropical Storm Irene destroyed the farmers' kidney beans, maize and other crops on the cusp of the harvest, the sense of loss and disappointment was at once bewildering and familiar. 
''If a baby dies, what do you do?'' said Mrs. Ntahomvukiye, with a sadness many of the Burundian mothers here have experienced at least once. ''You get another baby. It is the same with farming.''
She and her husband, Michele Mpambazi, are among the new Vermonters who have replanted after last summer's devastating flood. Wearing African wrapped textile skirts and down jackets, Burundian and Somali Bantu farmers gather daily on the industrial edge of Burlington known as the Intervale, where the soil is made fertile by the fickle pearl-grey river.
On the day of the flood, Ambika Gautam, a 4 1/2-foot-tall Bhutanese refugee originally from Nepal who never learned to swim, felt as if the waters would carry her downstream. Her anguished comrades yelled warnings from a bluff above the fields of the Ethan Allen Homestead, a historic site with quill pens and butter churns, which overlooks the field where the refugees grow mustard greens.
''We can plant crops next year,'' recalled Sabitri Gurung, one of 30 or so farmers who were unfurling spools of white plastic trellis the other day against the damp black earth. ''But we couldn't get our friend back.''
Vermont's 100 or so refugee farmers, from Africa and South Asia, lost an estimated $25,000 worth of vegetables and equipment in the flood, including pumps and irrigation lines.
''Our families are looking forward to becoming productive members of the community,'' said Jacouba Jacob Bogre, the executive director of the Association of Africans Living in Vermont, a nonprofit organization that sponsors the New Farms for New Americans project, financed by the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement. ''So seeing the floodwaters taking the crops was not easy to bear.''
The flood was the worst to strike Vermont in 83 years, coming after the ground was saturated by heavy spring rains. It damaged some 450 commercial farms throughout the state -- dairy farms, feed crop operations, vegetable growers, maple sugaring businesses -- an estimated 10,000 acres in all. In some places, the topsoil washed away, with volunteers swooping in to help shovel mud out of barns. The United States Department of Agriculture's Farm Service agency received $4.5 million in requests to restore farmland to productive use, an effort that continues, said Robert Paquin, the agency's state executive director.
Although their modest plots of beans, amaranth and sweet potatoes do not yet yield enough income to support a household, for many refugees who initially rely on public benefits, the very act of planting -- albeit in a precarious floodplain -- is an anchoring force. Most were subsistence farmers in their countries of origin until their lives were repeatedly uprooted.
Vermont's 1,200 or so African refugees began arriving 12 years ago, first from Sudan and then Bhutan and Burma. Mrs. Ntahomvukiye, 64, and her husband, 65, had been farmers in Burundi, tending the family's bananas, cassava, coffee and sweet potatoes. In 1972, they fled the mass killings of Hutus by the Tutsi-dominated army, first to a refugee camp in Zaire, now Congo, and shortly afterward, to another camp in Rwanda. In 1994, the Rwandan genocide forced them back to Zaire and then across Lake Tanganyika to Tanzania.
Hunger, malnutrition and disease were ever-present in the camps. ''If you had two weeks of rations it would last 11 days at most,'' recalled Noel Mukiza, who speaks four languages besides Kirundi, the Burundian mother tongue. ''Gardening some vegetables was a survival technique.''
In Vermont, plantains, cassava and cardamom have been replaced by tomatoes and cippolini onions. The Intervale Center, a nonprofit that helps the farmers sell some of the produce to restaurants like American Flatbread in Burlington, Community Supported Agriculture subscribers and food co-ops, also encourages refugees to experiment with best sellers like mesclun and arugula. Some have become entrepreneurs in their own right: Fatuma Malande, a Somali Bantu, has a thriving business selling her homemade samosas at several farmer's markets.
Once filled with Irish, Italian and Quebecois families, the city's Old North End, with its blocks of tidy wood frame houses, has been transformed anew, this time with markets like the Somali-owned Community Halal grocery, a store that has made it possible to buy frozen Australian camel meat in Vermont.
Many refugee families struggle with language barriers, poverty and unemployment while coping with the loss of family members. The association's greenhouse in Winooski, a city next to Burlington, has become something of a town square for the new New England, where farmers from Bhutan, Burundi and Somalia meet to nurture tender shoots, a common language. In a meadow of songbirds beside the field, Ashok Dahal, a 65-year-old refugee from Bhutan, said he believes that with hard work, this summer's crop will be the most abundant yet, helped by new soil from the flood. Like all farmers, he has optimism in his veins. ''Without a garden,'' he said, ''it wouldn't be home.''

HEADLINE: Getting to Retirement With Minimal Financial Risk

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
JPMorgan Chase's giant trading loss began as an effort to manage the bank's risks -- a move that turned into something that now looks more like a speculative bet. But don't think this is solely a big-bank problem. Even small investors can run into trouble discerning the fine line between hedging and risk taking.
Investors can try to limit their risks by holding down their stock exposure through diversified investments. But many people are still depending on the market's engine -- perhaps more than they might think -- to maintain a comfortable lifestyle in retirement, say, or pay for their children's college educations.
While this strategy has worked for many people and is considered prudent by financial advisers, it's still a wager. Your portfolio can take a painful nose dive just before you retire, which means you may have to work longer (if you can) or cut spending. But somewhere along the way, as pensions vanished and 401(k)'s took hold, investing in stocks for retirement was viewed as a manageable risk. After all, even after the market collapse in 2008-9, what other choice is there? 
There are other approaches to risk management, but all of them involve their own set of trade-offs, costs and risks. And, as in JPMorgan's case, going too far can also create problems.
''The caveat to most risk management techniques is the simple acknowledgment that, taken to extremes, they are no longer risk management techniques but the introduction of new risks or bets themselves,'' said Michael Kitces, director of research at the Pinnacle Advisory Group in Columbia, Md., who also blogs about financial planning at Nerd's Eye View.
Whatever approach you take is going to cost you something, even if you avoid the stock market altogether. So how you deal with investment risk will ultimately depend on what you're willing to give up. Here are some different approaches:
ELIMINATE MOST RISK Trying to squeeze out risk is still going to require some sacrifices. The idea is that you save enough money to meet your goal -- say, covering your basic expenses in retirement -- without investing in risky assets. The big caveat is that you'll need to save aggressively, perhaps much more so than if you turned to the stock market for some assistance (assuming it provides a decent return during your time frame).
But some academics like Zvi Bodie, a finance professor at Boston University, say they believe it can be done by taking a ''safety first'' approach, where you start by figuring out what your bare essentials will cost in retirement. Then, you save aggressively to cover those expenses, and put the money into virtually risk-free investments, like Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) or I-Bonds. (I-Bonds never decline in value, are issued by Treasury and pay a fixed interest rate, currently 0 percent, as well as a variable rate that keeps pace with inflation.)
The idea is to create a safety net once you stop working. So if you bought $10,000 of I-Bonds each year over a 40-year career -- the maximum you can buy each year, though Professor Bodie expects the amount will be adjusted for inflation -- you would leave the work force with $400,000. Today, a 65-year-old man could take that money and buy an annuity that would provide roughly $15,000 in inflation-adjusted income annually (with spousal survivor benefits). This could be used with Social Security income -- for a retiree at full retirement age today, a maximum of about $30,000 annually -- to cover the basics.
''That's not too bad,'' added Professor Bodie, co-author of ''Risk Less and Prosper'' (Wiley 2011).
He also suggested creating something that approximated a personal pension through a so-called TIPS ladder. Here, you would figure out your basic spending needs each year, and buy TIPS with varying terms so that the bonds mature over time, as you need the money. (Given the tax treatment of TIPS, he recommended doing this in a tax-deferred or tax-sheltered account. It also takes significant planning since TIPS are sold in five-year maturities.)
Mr. Bodie said he did not have a problem investing money in riskier assets for discretionary spending. He also said that younger people could handle somewhat more risk since they had the luxury of time to make adjustments.
Still, this approach isn't foolproof either. You may be sacrificing more than you need to if the markets do well. You can also lose the ability to save aggressively if you are laid off, for example, or have an expensive medical issue. And then there are all of life's other costs -- college tuition, saving for a down payment on a home, health insurance.
''The trouble is, of course, that almost no one can accumulate that much money -- in rough terms, about 25 years of living expenses after Social Security and pensions -- just by investing in safe assets,'' said William J. Bernstein, author of ''The Investor's Manifesto'' (Wiley 2009) and other investing books. ''You have to take some risk to get there, and because you're taking that risk, you may not get there. But taking that risk is still your best shot.''
There are several different ways to figure out how much that kind of low-risk approach may cost you. But let's say you decided that saving $1 million was enough (that is, $1 million in inflation-adjusted dollars, meaning it keeps pace with inflation over time). You may be able to get there after 30 years by saving $750 a month, or $9,000 annually, and investing that money in a portfolio evenly split between stock and bonds, which earned 4.7 percent after inflation. But to avoid the stock market altogether, you would have to increase your monthly savings to $1,250 a month, or $15,000 a year, and receive a 2.5 percent return after inflation in a diversified bond-only portfolio, according to calculations by Kent Smetters, a risk management professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School and founder of Veritat Advisors, which takes an approach similar to the one advocated by Professor Bodie.
REDUCE RISK, LIVE WITH SOME Investing in a diversified portfolio -- split among different types of stocks and bonds, while gradually reducing your exposure to risky stocks -- is the classic way to reduce your risk. But it doesn't eliminate risk. ''In a crunch, or even in a normal sharply down market, like we've had the past few weeks, there are only risky and riskless assets,'' Mr. Bernstein said. ''So in the short term, diversification among different stock asset classes is usually of no help. They all get taken out and get shot. But over a decade or longer, diversification among stock asset classes is nearly magic.''
And when you add a healthy helping of bonds, you further reduce that risk. The trick is finding a level of risk you're comfortable with so that you don't bail out at the worst possible time. This approach also requires you to consider what a worst case might feel like, and what sort of changes you need to make to adjust.
You can also reduce your risk through hedging techniques. One relatively straightforward strategy is buying ''put'' option contracts, which give you the right to sell a fixed number of shares (say, of an exchange-traded fund that tracks a stock index) at a certain price within a certain period of time. This essentially puts a floor on your losses. If the shares don't drop, you lose only the cost of the option.
So while this allows you to hedge your risk, it can weigh on your total return because you are paying for the insurance the puts provide. The downside, of course, are the costs and the hassles of such a strategy. ''You can approximate any hedging strategy you might want far more cheaply simply by selling some risky assets,'' Mr. Bernstein said. ''There is no risk fairy who will write you a cheap option that will take stock risk off your hands.''
TRANSFER OR SHARE RISK This approach to risk management typically involves buying insurance. If you're about to retire, you could buy a single-premium immediate annuity, where you pay an insurance company a pile of cash and, in return, the company pays you a stream of income for the rest of your life. The downside is that you just surrendered a pile of cash, which means you will not be able to use that money in an emergency. And if you die prematurely, your heirs won't receive it either. There's the risk, too, that the insurance company could run into financial trouble.
Annuities can also feel expensive. They may pay out approximately 4 or 5 percent of your investment, according to Professor Bodie, depending on the options you choose. An investment of $500,000 will buy slightly less than $2,400 in monthly income for a 65-year old man and his 62-year-old wife, according to a rough estimate from ImmediateAnnuities.com. But inflation-adjusted payments will cost more.
''Any insurance is going to cost you,'' said Professor Bodie, who says he believes annuities may make sense for some retirees. ''There is no free lunch.''

HEADLINE: Shouldering the Burden of College Debt

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''A Generation Hobbled by College Debt'' (''Degrees of Debt'' series, front page, May 13):
Despite the state of the job market, only 4.6 percent of borrowers at private nonprofit colleges are in default. To the extent that colleges are not adequately counseling students, institutional policies must be revised so that students are given the information they need to make an informed decision.
Private colleges are working hard to keep students' out-of-pocket costs as low as possible. Inflation-adjusted net tuition at nonprofit colleges has actually dropped by 4.1 percent in the last five years. The average yearly increase in list price over the last three years is the lowest on record. 
A college degree is still a great investment for students. We must restore the compact that once existed among colleges, the state and federal governments, corporations and foundations that promised all hard-working students access to a quality higher education at an affordable price.
DAVID L. WARREN President, National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities Washington, May 14, 2012
To the Editor:
We take issue with your portrayal of the experience of millions of students who borrow to finance their college education.
You highlighted students graduating with six-figure or near six-figure debts, citing specific examples that ranged from $65,000 to $120,000 and averaging more than $85,000. But that is well above the average student debt level of $23,300 that the article noted in passing.
That is not to minimize the challenge that students and families face in financing a college education, the potential burden of student loan debt, or the need for colleges and universities to counsel their students better. The reality is that every student and family must carefully weigh what they believe a degree is worth against the price of a particular institution.
If students and their families borrow not with their heads but over them, dire consequences can easily follow. But for most students, borrowing for higher education will be the best investment they will ever make.
MOLLY CORBETT BROAD Pres., American Council on Education Washington, May 16, 2012
To the Editor:
The increasing cost of tuition and a high unemployment rate for recent graduates have created a student loan debt crisis. We should not further hinder our next generation by forcing them to pay high taxes when they already have overwhelming levels of debt.
That is why I introduced the Student Loan Interest Deduction Act, to alleviate the heavy tax burden that rests on our children's shoulders.
Today's students are the engine of our nation' future. College education allows them opportunities to succeed and contribute to our economy. We should make college more affordable so that America remains globally competitive in the 21st century.
CHARLES B. RANGEL Member of Congress, 15th Dist., N.Y. Washington, May 14, 2012
To the Editor:
College debt is not only a personal but also a societal burden. A country whose economic capital is increasingly intellectual, not physical, whose employees work with capital they own -- their minds, rather than machinery owned by others -- has shifted the cost of productive capital from the corporation to the employee. This is counterproductive.
After World War II, the G.I. Bill was a highly productive investment in human capital. It paid enormous societal dividends. Ditto adequately financed state university systems.
Demonstrating that student debt will pay personal dividends misses the societal point. Yes, for many it pays. For many others it is a personal burden that impedes social mobility. But the larger point is that our economy needs to return to the public investment in human capital that helped us grow.
HUGH M. CLARK Columbus, Ohio, May 14, 2012
To the Editor:
In addition to the financial burden these students incur, they are not leaving college with substantive skills.
Although politically incorrect to admit, universities today are failing their students by not requiring them to master skills like critical thinking, cogent writing, basic math and a grasp of economics. All of these are required for our democracy to thrive.
These students and their families pin their hopes and financial assets on a degree that promises to deliver a lifetime of dividends. Instead, the ones who manage to graduate face a future with a piece of paper that signifies little other than four to six years spent listening to professors blather on without any exchange of useful skills.

HEADLINE: It's Their Party

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
Our subject for today is: Presidential nominating conventions -- why are they still around?
Other possible subjects were: The Facebook phenomenon and why does its board of directors look like a reunion tour of the Backstreet Boys and their managers?
Or: The new sensation of dancing dogs on TV talent shows and how many of them do you think were ever made to ride on the roof of a car? 
But, no, I think we should go with the conventions. The Republicans are having theirs in Tampa, Fla., in August and then the Democrats will be in Charlotte, N.C., at the beginning of September. The presidential nominees have been chosen, but there's still a lot to look forward to. The speeches! The funny hats! And, um ...
Little-known factoids about the upcoming conventions:
The Democrats have an official barbecue sauce. Actually, three. You can buy them on the official Web site, along with a bunch of T-shirts and a very fetching oven mitt.
The Republican National Convention says that it is expecting 13,000 to 15,000 members of the news media, which would make it ''the single largest media event in the world except for the Olympic Games.'' The convention should try to use this Olympic theme more extensively, perhaps decking out all the potential vice presidential nominees in Speedos and recounting heartwarming stories involving ailing family members who are rooting for them back home.
The governor of Florida has rejected Tampa's attempt to ban the carrying of concealed weapons downtown during the Republican convention. I guess this is one way to ratchet up excitement, but I'd prefer Donald Trump nominated for vice president.
You, the taxpayer, are paying the bill. Yes! Back in the 1970s, after a Watergate scandal involving lobbyists who traded huge donations to the Republican convention for special favors from the Nixon administration, Congress passed a law providing federal funding. Indexed for inflation, it's now about $18 million per.
''It's the one part of the public funding program both parties seem more than happy to accept,'' said Anthony Corrado, a professor of government at Colby College and an expert on the financing of political conventions. (Isn't it reassuring that there are people struggling to get the country worried about presidential nominating convention finances? It reminds me of the year I was in charge of making it fun to read about the New York City Charter Revision Commission.)
The parties swear, when they take the cash, that they won't solicit additional contributions. But in American politics, when there's a law against raising money you want to raise, the answer is:
A) Break the law.
B) Find a crazy billionaire.
C) Form a committee.
Option C wins! The cities that want to be a convention site create committees, which promise to raise copious cash if chosen. The host committee in Charlotte, for instance, is pledged to raise $36.65 million.
This is turning into something of a struggle, particularly since the Democrats, in a little-noted reform effort, prohibited the host committee from accepting donations above $100,000, or money from lobbyists or corporations. (The Republicans will pretty much take anything from anybody.) Instantly, like a daffodil in spring, a new committee popped up in Charlotte, called New American City. Its mission is to ''showcase all that the city and region has to offer'' during the convention and, of course, it has none of those irksome limitations.
While they were banning corporate contributions, the Democrats also reduced this year's convention to three days from the usual four. However, the eliminated day will be turned over to a celebration at the Charlotte Motor Speedway, during which viewers will have the opportunity to note the close ties between the Democratic Party and Nascar dads. And since it is happening before the official opening gavel, it can be paid for by New American City.
Do not tell me that this country has lost its capacity for innovation.
In a sane world, the conventions could run one day and $18 million would be plenty. They could skip almost everything but the speeches by the candidates, and President Obama will actually leave the convention to make his at Charlotte's unfortunately-named Bank of America Stadium.
Why do they stretch it out? Well, there are a lot of politicians out there yearning for a chance to address an empty auditorium at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. And our public officials have to deal with an endless line of really irritating people who are impossible to make happy. A convention is a mound of favors they can do for their special interests -- a party invitation, a seat in the vicinity of Joe Biden, or just the opportunity to mingle on the floor with the South Dakota delegation. (Good hats!) If it wasn't for the need to treat the monied troops, the Republicans could hold their convention at Mitt Romney's vacation house. Which I hear is much more pleasant than Tampa in late August.

HEADLINE: Medicaid Overpaid New York On Disabled Care, U.S. Says

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
ALBANY -- The federal government paid New York State $700 million more in 2009 than the state needed to care for residents with developmental disabilities who lived in its institutions, according to the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services in Washington. 
The finding suggested that billions of dollars earmarked for institutional care in New York had been used for other purposes over the last several years. No penalty is recommended, however, because the payments were approved by federal regulators.
Instead, the report recommends that federal and state officials do what they have already been trying to do for the last several months -- negotiate a more accurate system of how Medicaid reimburses the state for care of those with developmental disabilities. The report also recommends that the new reimbursement system comply with federal requirements that ''payment for services be consistent with efficiency and economy.''
Most of the people with developmental disabilities in residential care in New York are not in institutional settings, but rather in group homes spread across communities throughout the state. State officials have said that extra Medicaid dollars earmarked for institutions have been redirected to other parts of its system of care, including group homes. But the inspector general's office is considering a further review of how the excess money was spent.
Concerns about inflated reimbursements to the state for its institutions have been discussed for some time. In 2010, The Poughkeepsie Journal reported that Medicaid was spending more than $4,000 a day on residents of institutions for people with developmental disabilities. The inspector general's report said the actual cost of care was about $1,500.
The findings help explain one of the reasons New York spends roughly $10 billion a year caring for people with developmental disabilities -- more than California, Florida, Illinois and Texas combined -- while serving fewer than half as many people. As part of the continuing negotiations, federal officials plan to scale back reimbursements to New York, but over a period of several years.
The report was drafted by the office of Daniel R. Levinson, the inspector general of the federal health department. In comments appended to the report, both New York and federal regulators agreed to work together to address the issues raised in the report.

HEADLINE: The Number of Those Working Past 65 Is at a Record High

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
THE retirement dream seems further away for a lot of baby boomers, and they appear to be responding to that by holding on to their jobs if they can. But that may have worsened the employment prospects for younger workers. 
Labor Department figures indicate that the percentage of workers over the traditional retirement age of 65 is at a record high. But, the figures show, job totals fell sharply for men under 55 during the recession and have only started to recover, while the proportion of women ages 25 to 54 with jobs also slid and is close to the lowest level of the last two decades.
''The fact of the matter is that this aging-but-not-yet-aged segment of the baby boomer class can't afford to retire,'' said David A. Rosenberg, the chief economist of Gluskin Sheff, a Canadian firm, noting that overall household net worth was 15 percent lower than at the prerecession peak. ''Dreams of the 5,000-square-foot McMansion being a viable retirement asset have morphed into nightmares of a deflationary ball and chain.''
The accompanying charts show the percentage of various age groups with jobs since the end of 2006, when the overall percentage of people with jobs hit its cyclical peak. Each of the charts has a different range, but the same spread between the top and the bottom, so that a move of a given size represents the same gain or loss in percentage points.
For the first time since the government began keeping track of the numbers in 1981 -- and probably the first time ever -- one in nine American men over the age of 75 was working in April. About one in 20 women over that age have jobs.
The government collects the statistics from a monthly survey of about 60,000 households. Because the pool of older people is relatively small, the Bureau of Labor Statistics does not try to measure seasonal patterns. The figure shown in each chart for workers over 55 is the average of the 12 most recently monthly surveys. That adjusts for seasonal patterns and smooths out the sometimes volatile data.
For workers under 55, the government does do seasonal calculations. The charts showing the average of men and women in the prime working ages -- 25 to 54 -- show the seasonally adjusted data as well as the 12-month averages shown for the other categories.
In general, for workers it was better to be older in the current cycle. The employment-to-population ratios are higher now than before the recession began for both men and women in all age groups above 65. More than a third of men ages 65 to 69 are working, as are more than a quarter of women.
But the proportion of both sexes working is down from the peak for all age groups under 60.
As the recovery continues, there is limited evidence that younger workers are starting to benefit. Over the most recent 12 months, the seasonally adjusted proportion of men ages 25 to 34 with jobs rose 2.3 percentage points, to 82.5 percent. The proportion of women in that age group with jobs rose one percentage point, to 68 percent. Those are larger gains over that period than for any other group. But gains for middle-age workers have only started to appear.

HEADLINE: G.M. Won't Advertise In 2013 Super Bowl

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
5:59 p.m. Updated For the second time in a week, General Motors is making news for advertising it will not be running rather than for advertising it is running. 
G.M. said it would not buy commercial time during Super Bowl XLVII, to be broadcast by CBS on Feb. 3, 2013. The company is not pulling out of the game, because it had not already agreed to buy any spots; rather, it has decided against a buy.
The disclosure, first reported by The Wall Street Journal on Friday afternoon, came three days after the company said it would discontinue its advertising on Facebook, worth about $10 million a year.
General Motors is a mainstay Super Bowl sponsor, but not a continuous one like Anheuser-Busch InBev, for beers like Bud Light and Budweiser. For example, G.M. was in the Super Bowl in 2008, but sat out the games in 2009 and 2010, then returned for 2011 and 2012. ''We understand the reach the Super Bowl provides, but with the significant increase in price, we simply can't justify the expense,'' Joel Ewanick, global chief marketing officer at General Motors in Detroit, said in a statement provided by e-mail to a reporter.
There have been reports that CBS is charging an estimated $3.8 million to $4 million for each 30-second commercial during Super Bowl XLVII. That compares with an estimated $3.5 million for commercials during Super Bowl XLVI in February 2012.
G.M. has made several moves this year that are aimed at seeking more efficient and effective ways to spend its giant ad budget, among them consolidating the duties for its media planning and buying. The company spent more than $4 billion last year to advertise in countries around the world, including the United States.
The automotive category is usually the largest in a Super Bowl game, but the number varies each year based on the economy and other factors.
For instance, G.M. was not the only automaker to forgo the game in 2009 and 2010 because of economic conditions. And Mercedes-Benz, after making a splash with a Super Bowl spot last year, decided against advertising in the game this year.
During Super Bowl XLVI, G.M. commercials included spots for the Chevrolet Sonic, the Chevrolet Silverado, the Chevrolet Camaro and the Cadillac ATS. Other automakers that advertised during the game included Acura, Audi, Hyundai, Kia, Lexus, Toyota and Volkswagen; Chrysler made headlines with a spot, featuring Clint Eastwood, that ran during halftime.
Not long after the word that General Motors would forgo the Super Bowl began to spread around Madison Avenue, another automaker that had advertised during the most recent Super Bowl volunteered that it was glad to be re-upping.
''We are extremely pleased to be an advertiser on the 2013 Super Bowl,'' Steve Shannon, vice president for marketing at Hyundai Motor America, said in an e-mail sent to a reporter late on Friday afternoon.
''The Super Bowl is a perfect venue for a brand like Hyundai,'' Mr. Shannon said, because it is ''far and away the best-watched television program in the U.S.'' and because ''the social media opportunities continue to grow every year.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Some European Companies Try Bonds to Raise Cash

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
Among the midsize, family-owned companies that power the German economy, it has long been an article of faith: credit comes from the friendly local banker, not from cold and distant capital markets.
So Peter H. Leibold was breaking from the norm last year when he decided to finance the expansion of his company, which makes wood pellets for heating and energy generation, by selling corporate bonds. The company, German Pellets, raised more than 80 million euros ($102 million).
Now he is a convert.
''The advantage of a bond is that you can raise a large amount from a completely different group of investors,'' said Mr. Leibold, the founder and chief executive of the company, which is based in Wismar, on the coast in northern Germany. 
Corporate bonds -- essentially, interest-bearing i.o.u.'s that companies sell to whomever is willing to buy -- have long been an essential borrowing tool for companies in the United States.
But in Europe, borrowing from banks, whether local ones or big multinationals, has traditionally been the preferred way to raise money. Just 9 percent of corporate credit in the euro zone comes from debt markets, according to the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, compared with 64 percent in the United States.
But as the euro zone's financial crisis has forced many banks to hoard cash and curtail lending, more European companies are turning to bond markets. If the trend continues, it could not only begin reversing the Continent's longstanding preference for bank credit, but also make the region less prone to banking crises.
There might be resistance, however, from European regulators, who regard such borrowing as a form of shadow banking that they cannot control. In addition, bank lobbyists might fight what they see as competition.
''People are afraid of a financial system not based on what they know, which is financial intermediation by banks,'' said Nicolas Veron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research group in Brussels.
The fears are not unfounded. The propensity of banks in the United States to turn loans into securities that can be sold to investors arguably helped create the subprime mortgage crisis.
But later on, there was an upside: the practice meant that the fates of companies in the United States were less coupled to those of banks. Not so in Europe, where the problems of credit institutions remain a grave threat to the rest of the economy.
''Euro-area firms are particularly vulnerable to reduction in bank credit because of their greater reliance on banks for funding,'' the International Monetary Fund said in a report last month.
Companies' tapping of euro zone bond markets has surged this year, more than doubling to $107 billion in the first quarter, according to Dealogic, a data provider. For the first time since 2009, bond issues surpassed syndicated bank loans as a source of financing for larger companies.
When even large European banks are cutting back on risk, bond issues enable companies to raise money from investors outside the euro zone who are less affected by the crisis.
It remains unclear, though, to what extent debt markets can fill the vacuum left by troubled European banks. Bond markets might not help the thousands of smaller companies that form the backbone of the euro zone economy but are too small to attract investors' attention.
''The corporate sector in Europe still comprises mostly small- and medium-sized enterprises that will continue to rely on bank loans,'' Andreas Dombret, a member of the executive board of the Bundesbank, said in an e-mail.
The countries that need credit most desperately are also the ones with the highest proportion of small firms least able to gain access to debt markets. Companies with 50 employees or fewer employ 68 percent of the work force in Italy and 62 percent in Spain, according to Goldman Sachs. Those figures compare with 40 percent in Germany.
''For smaller firms in particular, the fixed costs can simply be too high, rendering a bond issuance uneconomical under all circumstances,'' Dirk Schumacher, an economist at Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt, wrote in a report last month.
But the experience of German Pellets, which had sales of 275 million euros ($350 million) last year and has 500 employees, suggests that bonds could be an alternative for at least some midsize companies.
Mr. Leibold said that it initially had taken some effort to explain to investors why wood pellets were an interesting business. The pellets are a source of renewable energy and are cheaper than oil or natural gas, he told them.
Mr. Leibold, who founded the company in 2005 after he saw wood pellets being made by small operations in Sweden and realized there was an opening for a mass producer, says his sales are rising -- even in Greece -- as people and companies look to cut costs.
Eventually, investors came around. The company used the money it raised to make several acquisitions and build new manufacturing plants, including one in Woodville, Tex., that is to employ 250 people when it is completed later this year.
German Pellets also continues to draw on traditional bank financing, Mr. Leibold said. But the bond market provides a diversity of fund sources, without the drawbacks of a stock listing. Like many European entrepreneurs, Mr. Leibold expresses an aversion to going public.
The company reflects his spirit and that of his colleagues, he said.
''If German Pellets was listed on an exchange, it would change the company from that day on,'' he said.
While there has been no broad effort to curtail debt issues, regulators at the European and national levels are now scrutinizing so-called shadow banking. That is a broad category that includes hedge funds and other activities outside the traditional banking system, as well as corporate bond issuance.
In practice, corporate debt is typically handled within the banking system, with banks earning hefty fees for marketing the bonds. But because the business is dominated by large investment banks, the concern by some regulators is that smaller institutions have trouble competing in that market and could lose revenue as a result.
Mr. Veron of Bruegel said central bankers might also worry that a shift from traditional banking could make it harder to control interest rates -- their main policy tool.
''The European Central Bank sees a need for more credit,'' he said. ''At the same time they are concerned about losing the monetary policy transmission channel.''
For all that, though, officials do not seem to be terribly concerned.
Mr. Dombret of the Bundesbank said that the sale of debt by companies was ''limited in scope'' and a ''rational and welcome response'' by companies to tighter lending by banks in many parts of the euro zone.
Risks that banks will be bypassed ''seem to be rather low at this stage,'' he said, but he added that the Bundesbank would ''continue to monitor this area.''
Mr. Leibold of German Pellets, for his part, said he was happy with his bond experience and planned to tap debt markets again. But he was not sure bonds would work for all companies.
''You need a story for investors,'' he said.

HEADLINE: With Natural Gas Plentiful and Cheap, Carbon Capture Projects Stumble

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A federal proposal to ban the construction of coal-fired power plants that release all of their carbon dioxide into the atmosphere would seem to smooth the way for carbon capture, a budding technology that traps the greenhouse gas for storage or other uses.
But even as the Environmental Protection Agency prepares to open hearings on the proposed rule, unveiled in March, industry experts say the persistently low price of natural gas is threatening the viability of the nation's carbon capture projects. 
Natural gas is so cheap and plentiful that utilities have little incentive to build coal-fired plants with the capture technology. And the proposed rule exempts existing coal- and gas-fired plants.
In the tiny universe of American carbon capture projects, the first casualty may be the Taylorville Energy Center, a project in the coal fields of Illinois. The plan was to cook coal into methane, capture the carbon dioxide released in the process, then burn the methane in a conventional natural gas-style power plant.
But Taylorville's backers, unable to persuade the state legislature to approve the project because of its estimated $3.5 billion price, are considering deferring the coal element and simply building the gas-burning plant for one-third the cost.
''It's primarily due to the low natural gas prices, and how that affects the political environment,'' said Bart Ford, a vice president of Tenaska, the developer. ''We're not changing the nature of the facility, just deferring the synthetic natural gas portion.''
Still, Tenaska is continuing to seek permits to inject carbon dioxide underground at the site, Mr. Ford said. ''This allows us to say, we'll wait until the price impact is lower because the price of natural gas is up,'' he said.
Making synthetic natural gas from coal makes economic sense only if the ordinary natural gas that it displaces is more expensive.
The advent of hydraulic fracturing, a drilling method that has opened vast new supplies of natural gas, has helped to keep gas prices low. The industry's expectation is that the price will rise somewhat from its current depressed level -- near $2 per million B.T.U., compared with as much as $14 before the recession -- but that it will not recover fully for many years.
Edwardsport, a ''capture-ready'' Duke Energy coal plant, is scheduled to begin commercial operation this year. The plant, in Edwardsport, Ind., will cook coal into a fuel gas and could be retrofitted to capture carbon dioxide released in that conversion. But Duke, the builder, has no plan to capture the carbon dioxide and no place to sequester it for now. It is exempted from the new rule because construction began five years ago.
The plant cost nearly $3 billion to build, about $1 billion over budget, and carbon capture would cost $380 million, not counting storage.
Only two other major carbon capture projects are on the drawing boards in the United States. Neither is affected directly by low natural gas prices. But the ebbing interest in coal-fired construction may signal that even if the technology works well, there may be few commercial projects where it could be deployed.
One is FutureGen 2.0, a $1.6 billion plan to burn coal in oxygen, generating exhaust gas that is pure carbon dioxide, and pumping it into geologic formations thousands of feet below the earth's surface.
The Recovery Act of 2009 is covering $1 billion of the cost of the project, which is in Meredosia, Ill. But the project, originally expected to be running by 2015, has run into a variety of bureaucratic problems and is now scheduled to be in service in 2017, barring further delays. An earlier version, FutureGen, was rejected by the Energy Department in 2008 to save money.
The other venture is the Southern Company's Kemper County project in Mississippi, which will turn coal into a cleaner gas and use it to power a turbine. The captured carbon dioxide is expected to be sold and travel through a pipeline to Texas, where it will be pumped under ground to force oil out of old oil fields, a process known as enhanced oil recovery.
At the moment the market prospects look favorable, given that the price oil drillers will pay for the carbon dioxide depends partly on the price of oil, which is relatively high. But construction is just beginning, so the long-term picture is unclear. The plant is expected to start operating in 2014.
Some in the power industry are debating whether the Obama administration's carbon regulation will be blocked by Congress or a new administration. Still, the absence of a rule would not change the economic equation discouraging investment in capture technology for coal plants.
Kelly Ziegler, a spokeswoman for the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a nine-state consortium on the East Coast that seeks to limit carbon dioxide output, said that no regulation was necessary to stop new coal plants. ''Natural gas has already done that for you,'' she said.
Hearings on the rule are to begin on May 24, and the E.P.A. is taking public comments until June 25. The agency may issue a final rule this year.

HEADLINE: Luxury Liner's Removal to Begin Off Italian Coast

BYLINE: By GAIA PIANIGIANI

 BODY:
ROME -- One of the most expensive and challenging salvage operations ever planned, the removal of the luxury liner Costa Concordia from granite rocks off the Tuscan coast, where it ran aground in January, will begin next week, the companies in charge announced Friday.
The companies, Titan Salvage, which is based in Florida, and Micoperi, an Italian underwater construction and offshore contractor, plan to lift the half-submerged vessel with pullers mounted on a platform and a subsea platform to roll it on, using water-filled caissons to stabilize it, and finally tow it to a yet unidentified Italian port. There, it will be demolished. 
''This is the largest ship removal by weight in history,'' Rich Habib, Titan's managing director, told reporters in Rome. ''The magnitude of the job and the magnitude of the techniques used are something unprecedented.''
The operation is estimated to cost at least $300 million, more than half the value of the ship, and will be covered by its operator's insurers.
Ships like the Costa Concordia ''are the biggest industrial objects built to move in the world,'' said Emilio Campana, the director of the research institute for naval and maritime engineering at Italy's National Research Council. ''Their gigantism creates the main challenge to this operation, because it's like raising from the ground a floating city. It's very delicate and complex.''
The 951-foot-long Costa Concordia is estimated to weigh 54,000 tons, 6,000 of which are the water and debris that have been cramming its 17 decks for four months. Raising such a tremendous weight from its right side, now deformed by the granite rocks underneath, has to be an inch-by-inch movement, experts said. Just rolling it onto the platform will take a few days, the company said.
''It would have been easier to cut it up in sections, but it'd have produced a tremendous amount of debris,'' said Joseph Farrell Jr., chief executive of Resolve Marine Group, based in the United States, which had also bid to salvage the Costa Concordia. ''Authorities wanted to have it removed in one hunk.''
Salvagers are set to stabilize the wreck by the end of August and then start building the underwater platform to help rotate the vessel. According to the companies' schedule, the ship will be rotated at the beginning of December and floated one month later.
All operations, including the removal of all the structures on site, are expected to take up to a year, a long time for a tourism-dependent island, Giglio, that is now approaching its peak season. To minimize the operations' impacts, the equipment will be stored at the nearby Tuscan port of Piombino.
During the work, oil-response devices will be in place, and salvagers will monitor the quality of the water daily and clear any debris that might come out of the vessel. After removal, a protected type of sea grass surrounding the pylons needed to anchor the ship will be replanted.
While some argue that the strong winds and waves of another winter could cause the ship to slide into the 300-foot-deep sea bottom, the local authorities agree that sea and weather conditions capable of significantly moving the ship are unlikely.
In January, the vessel's captain, Francesco Schettino, steered the ship, carrying 4,229 people, too close to shore, where it hit a rock and capsized, killing 32. Two bodies are still missing. Since then, the Costa Concordia has been resting in a relatively stable position, and the winds and waves are not very strong in the nine-mile-wide channel between the island and the mainland, the authorities said.
''Of course we are worried about next winter and the impact of the salvage on the seabed, but there is no way out,'' said Mayor Sergio Ortelli of Giglio. ''There is a huge, extraneous object right off our harbor. Leaving it there is by far a larger damage to our environment and our economy.''

HEADLINE: Hollande Tells Obama Troop Pullout Will Proceed

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER and JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Francois Hollande used his first visit with President Obama as France's president on Friday to restate his pledge to withdraw combat forces from Afghanistan by the end of the year, two years earlier than originally planned.
In a visit that both leaders appeared keen to present as the start of a new relationship that maintains the countries' friendly ties, Mr. Hollande nonetheless said he would stand by his campaign promise to bring French troops home. American officials, for their part, appeared resigned to losing the troops, and they said their hope was that France would make up for the loss of troops by helping the American-led NATO mission in other ways. 
''I recalled to President Obama that I had made a promise to withdraw our combat troops from Afghanistan at the end of 2012,'' Mr. Hollande said, appearing next to Mr. Obama before reporters in the Oval Office after their meeting. ''I also stipulated that there would still be support in another form.''
Mr. Obama said he expected NATO states to make good on their promise to help the Afghans build their security forces. The United States is trying to drum up money from its allies for training and financing the Afghan national security forces once the NATO mission winds down at the end of 2014.
European officials say that one possibility would be for French trainers to remain in Afghanistan after the combat troops depart. Polls show that a majority of the French want their troops home from Afghanistan.
Mr. Hollande, a Socialist who rode to power on a wave of economic discontent, is one of the leaders of the Group of 8 industrial nations who are meeting near Washington this weekend before next week's NATO meeting in Chicago.
Mr. Obama got on well with Mr. Hollande's predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy, with the two cooperating closely on Libya, Syria and Iran. In fact, eyebrows in France were arched last November when Mr. Obama, in Cannes for an economic summit meeting, appeared side by side with Mr. Sarkozy in a televised interview, which many French interpreted as an impolitic gesture of support during Mr. Sarkozy's re-election bid. Mr. Hollande defeated Mr. Sarkozy in the election on May 6.
But there remains plenty of room for Mr. Obama to strike a chord with Mr. Hollande, particularly on coordination of Europe's response to the global economic downturn. The White House has been pushing hard for the Europeans to adopt more measures that would stimulate growth, as opposed to the all-austerity approach pushed by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, with the support of Mr. Sarkozy. Mr. Hollande is viewed as much more pro-growth, and he is expected to be on the same page as Mr. Obama during the G-8 meeting.
Administration officials said they hoped to use that meeting to encourage Germany and the rest of Europe to move toward more policies to advance growth.
Mr. Obama and Mr. Sarkozy enjoyed ''an incredibly productive and constructive relationship,'' Thomas E. Donilon, the national security adviser, said Thursday. ''We will build the same kind of relationship with President Hollande.''
While there is some question whether Mr. Hollande will be as tough in his language on Iran as his predecessor was, American officials say they believe that Mr. Hollande's policies will strongly support the sanctions that have been put in place to rein in Tehran's nuclear ambitions.
Separately on Friday, Mr. Obama called for a renewed effort to combat hunger and malnutrition in Africa, despite tough economic times, announcing $3 billion in private pledges to increase agriculture and food production.
The president used the opening of the G-8 meeting to call for a spreading of the burden for food aid to include companies and nongovernmental organizations. He said that 45 companies worldwide had pledged more than $3 billion for nutrition in poor countries as part of the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition. The alliance has a goal of pulling 50 million people from poverty in 10 years, Mr. Obama said.
At the G-8 meeting in L'Aquila, Italy, in 2009, Mr. Obama appealed to other leaders for larger donations for the effort, citing his family's experiences in Kenya. As a result, the initiative grew over three years to $22 billion from the $15 billion that had been pledged. The United States promised $3.5 billion.
The initiative is now requesting an additional $1.2 billion over the next three years from old and new donors.
''As the wealthiest nation on earth, I believe the U.S. has a moral obligation to lead the fight against hunger and nutrition and to partner with others,'' Mr. Obama said Friday morning in remarks in Washington.

HEADLINE: Race and Religion Rear Their Heads

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Perhaps the uglier side of politics is always close to the surface.
President Obama and his Republican rival, Mitt Romney, have said for months that the 2012 election will be about the economy. But on Thursday, it became -- at least for a brief moment -- about the always touchy issues of race and religion.
The continuing economic struggles in the country will almost certainly dominate the debate in the next six months. The unemployment rate remains above 8 percent, the housing slump continues, debt is rising rapidly and overseas economies are flailing. 
But the events Thursday suggest that it does not take much to divert the presidential campaign conversation back into the sensitive and politically dangerous questions of Mr. Obama's race, his religion and the place of his birth.
A report in The New York Times on Thursday exposed a secret plan by Republican strategists and financiers to rekindle questions about the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., Mr. Obama's onetime pastor, and his angry black-power sermons.
Mr. Romney repudiated the plan to use Mr. Wright's words as a racially tinged cudgel against Mr. Obama. But the report served to once again steer the campaign away from the economy and onto the tricky terrain of racial politics.
Reporters brought up Mr. Romney's comment in February suggesting that Mr. Obama wanted to make America into ''a less Christian nation.'' Asked if he stood by that comment, Mr. Romney said that he did.
''I'm not familiar, precisely, with exactly what I said, but I stand by what I said, whatever it was,'' Mr. Romney said.
Aides to Mr. Obama said that they were not surprised by the day's events and that they remained prepared to respond even more forcefully -- with television ads, if necessary -- if the religion- or race-based attacks return later in the year.
''To the extent that this ever raises its head, we will certainly be ready with a forceful response,'' said one adviser to Mr. Obama's campaign, who requested anonymity to discuss strategy.
Mr. Obama's campaign advisers said the American people had largely dismissed the questions about his birth and about links to his former pastor. They pointed to polls that show that the president remains personally likable.
''The American people know who he is,'' the adviser said.
But the issues of race and religion never go completely away, at least in some extreme quarters of the American electorate.
On Thursday, the Drudge Report posted a link on its Web site to a report that sought to revive the long-discredited assertion that Mr. Obama was not born in the United States. And as election season heats up, so does publication of books promoting various conspiracies and theories, including a new one seeking to focus new attention on Mr. Obama's dealings with Mr. Wright.
The Romney campaign has kept a considerable distance from the anti-Obama fringe. It only turns off moderate and independent voters, while stirring up Mr. Obama's base.
And Mr. Romney has his own experience with the staying power of personal attacks. During the Republican primary campaign, ugly questions about his Mormon faith were revived by a few conservative pastors who called it a ''cult.''
Mr. Romney's advisers have rejected the idea of a religion speech like the one he gave in 2007, saying members of the public know Mr. Romney and his personal history in a way they did not back then. But it is interesting to wonder what the campaign might do if a ''super PAC'' raised his religion in an attack ad.
On Thursday, Mr. Romney sought to go on the offensive by accusing Mr. Obama of conducting a campaign of ''character assassination'' over the past several months. He said Mr. Obama's attacks on his record at Bain Capital were intended to suggest that he was not ''a good person.''
But in truth, as the final six months of campaigning begin, both the campaigns and the candidates have shied away from the charged issues of race and religion. Both men have powerful incentives to keep the campaign from becoming a nasty dissection of their personal backgrounds. Both want to avoid a focus on what might strike some voters as exotic backgrounds that set them apart from middle-class Americans.
Their actions suggest that -- at least for now -- there remains a line that neither side is willing to cross. The question is: will the superrich backers of super PACs play by the same rules?
Politicians, consultants and voters are all bracing for the answer.

HEADLINE: Romney Supporters Hopeful About New Hampshire

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO and MICHAEL D. SHEAR; Michael Barbaro reported from Hillsborough, N.H., and Michael D. Shear from Washington.

 BODY:
HILLSBOROUGH, N.H. -- In the days and weeks after the 2008 election, it seemed as if President Obama had permanently yanked independent-minded New Hampshire out of the reach of Republicans.
But much has changed since he triumphantly won here four years ago. Republicans surged back to power in the State Capitol in 2010, and Mitt Romney's campaign now views the Granite State as a real opportunity to pry four electoral votes away from Mr. Obama in November.
In an appearance Friday at an abandoned 19th-century bridge that was repaired with $150,000 of federal stimulus money, Mr. Romney sought to tap into the one thing that gets mild-mannered New Hampshire voters riled up: wasteful spending. 
''This is the absolute Bridge to Nowhere if ever was one,'' Mr. Romney said, to knowing laughs. ''That's your stimulus dollars at work.''
Mr. Romney is hoping his message of lower taxes, less regulation and an emphatic denunciation of Mr. Obama's economic record is in sync with voters whose local economy is better than the nation's but still struggling. Aides have privately identified it as potentially crucial to victory in a close election, and a potent symbolic win.
He is also betting that his personal connection to the state will help him. Aides said on Friday that he planned to spend the night at his family's vacation home in Wolfboro, N.H., before heading to his home in Boston.
But the Republican candidate is playing catch-up in New Hampshire, where polls show the president with a lead. Mr. Obama has spent months building a campaign operation in the state even as Mr. Romney was forced to shift his New Hampshire resources to other states during the primary. Mr. Romney's state director started just this month.
''The Obama campaign's had well over a dozen people up here since before the primary, and they never slowed down,'' said Steve Duprey, a Republican who worked for John McCain in 2008.
''We Republicans are still putting the pieces together after the primary campaign, and not even running on all cylinders yet,'' said Michael P. Dennehy, a veteran Republican operative. ''I think it's going to be a very close race -- two, three, four points, maximum.''
That would fit, historically. In 1992, Bill Clinton won the state by about a percentage point. In 2000, George W. Bush won by about the same amount. Four years later, John Kerry snatched it back, winning by about two percentage points. Polls suggest it will be a close race again this year.
President Obama and his top surrogates -- Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.; Michelle Obama, the first lady; and members of the cabinet -- have repeatedly traveled to New Hampshire in recent weeks.
At a campaign event in mid-April in Exeter, N.H., Mr. Biden hammered the president's theme of tax fairness -- an argument that Mr. Obama's top advisers believe will help the president keep the state in line with the rest of the Democratic Northeast.
''When you all pay your taxes next week, you and every citizen in New Hampshire and my home state of Delaware ought to be able to know that everyone else is paying their fair share as well,'' Mr. Biden said. ''But the truth is you know they're not.''
Terie Norelli, the House Democratic leader in the state and a member of Mr. Obama's steering committee, said Mr. Romney and the New Hampshire Republicans were not ''in touch with the people'' of the state. ''People think that President Obama is on the right track,'' she said.
But Tom Rath, a longtime Republican operative in the state who is working for Mr. Romney, said that the combination of forces that propelled Mr. Obama to victory in New Hampshire in 2008 were simply not present this year: exuberant young voters hanging on Mr. Obama's every word and a general distaste for the former president, Mr. Bush.
''This election will not be a referendum on George W. Bush anymore,'' Mr. Rath said. ''It will be a referendum on Barack Obama.''
In interviews, voters at Mr. Romney's event on Friday said they were drawn to his message of austerity after years of excessive government spending. Even independent voters here who backed Mr. Obama in 2008 say they are keeping an open mind about Mr. Romney.
''We're willing to listen,'' said Arnold Husemann, 70, who said he and his wife, Vicki, 68, were ''staunch Obama'' supporters last time around.
But Mike Stellato, 70, who also listened to Mr. Romney on Friday, said he worried about government spending and said: ''We are going to end up like Greece in a little while. That's terrible.''
Mr. Stellato pointed to the unfinished bridge, calling it a ''dumb thing to do.''
Outside Mr. Romney's event, supporters of the bridge noted that it had been built in the 1860s and there had been bipartisan agreement, even among local Republicans now supporting Mr. Romney, to preserve the landmark along with a park as part of the area's history.
''We built them without mortar of stone split from boulders strewn on our fields by ice age glaciers,'' the supporters wrote in a ''Note to Mr. Romney'' that they handed out at the event. After qualifying for stimulus financing, they wrote, ''it went ahead to completion.''
The future of the bridge may no longer be in doubt. But the winner of the state's electoral votes very much is.

HEADLINE: U.S. Officials See Promising Signs For Iran Meeting

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Steven Lee Myers and David E. Sanger contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- American negotiators, heading into a crucial round of talks with Iran over its nuclear program next week in Baghdad, are allowing themselves a rare emotion after more than a decade of fruitless haggling with Tehran: hope.
With signs that Iran is under more pressure than it has been in years to make a deal, senior Obama administration officials said the United States and five other major powers were prepared to offer a package of inducements to obtain a verifiable agreement to suspend its efforts to enrich uranium closer to weapons grade.
These gestures, the officials said, could include easing restrictions on things like airplane parts and technical assistance to Iran's energy industry, but not the sweeping sanctions on oil exports, which officials said would go into effect on schedule in July.
The oil sanctions, which the Iranians are seeking desperately to avoid, are one of several factors that American officials believe may make Tehran more amenable to exploring a diplomatic solution. In addition, the recent decline in oil prices has magnified the pain of the existing sanctions on Iran; a new government coalition in Israel has strengthened the hand of its hawkish leader, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu; and Americans believe that recent blustery statements from Iranian officials are laying the groundwork for concessions by Tehran. 
None of this guarantees success. Several officials played down the prospect of a major breakthrough from the meeting on Wednesday, which will include Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China, in addition to the United States. Mr. Netanyahu on Friday repeated his skepticism that there would be any progress.
But American officials said that at a minimum, the Baghdad meeting should be a genuine test of Iran's willingness to do more than talk. ''They're nervous enough to talk,'' said a senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the negotiations. ''Whether they're nervous enough to act, we don't know yet.'' Another senior official said, ''We have a tail wind going into this.''
For President Obama, the stakes are huge. A successful meeting could prolong the diplomatic dance with Tehran, delaying any possible military confrontation over the nuclear program until after the presidential election. It could also keep a lid on oil prices, which fell again this week in part because of the decrease in tensions. Lower gasoline prices would aid the economic recovery in the United States, and Mr. Obama's electoral prospects.
In a sign of the increased diplomatic efforts, the International Atomic Energy Agency said Friday that its director general, Yukiya Amano, would travel to Tehran on Sunday to try to negotiate access to a military site where Iran is suspected of having conducted tests on nuclear-weapons triggers. It would be the first visit by the agency's head to Iran since 2009, and it could add to the momentum in Baghdad.
''The Iranians are in the position of needing to pursue diplomacy, if anything, even more than they did before,'' said Dennis B. Ross, one of Mr. Obama's senior advisers on Iran until last year and now at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. ''It's not like they have any other good news right now.''
Moreover, Mr. Ross said, Iran's recent statements signal that its leaders are preparing their domestic audience for concessions. Iranian officials have declared that the West has effectively endorsed Iran's right to enrich uranium, a step they portrayed as a major strategic coup. American officials insist the United States has not done that and has been deliberately ambiguous about whether it would ever grant Iran the right to enrichment.
Still, as Mr. Ross said, ''if you're looking for a way to present a compromise, you want to present it as a victory.''
Like other experts, he added a cautionary note. After an initial meeting in Istanbul last month that served mainly to test if Iran was willing to talk seriously about its nuclear program, the United States and its partners must now get into the kinds of nitty-gritty issues that torpedoed previous negotiations with Iran.
The major powers' initial goal is to halt the activity that most alarms Israel: the spinning of thousands of centrifuges to enrich uranium to 20 percent purity, which is within striking distance of the level needed to fuel a nuclear weapon. That would buy time for negotiations over the ultimate fate of a program that Iran claims is for peaceful energy purposes, but that the United States and Israel fear is in pursuit of at least a nuclear weapons capability.
In addition to halting enrichment, officials said, Iran must agree to ship out its stockpiles of 20 percent uranium and to cease operations at an enrichment facility buried in a mountainside near the holy city of Qum, which Israel says could soon be impregnable to an airstrike.
If Iran agrees to those interim steps, officials said, the talks could shift from high-profile meetings once a month to more regular meetings, at working levels, where officials could delve into technical details, like how to ship out the uranium or monitor Iran's suspension of operations at the plant near Qum, known as Fordo. European Union and Iranian officials have already met in Geneva to prepare the agenda for the meeting in Baghdad.
''You could really use the summer to have weekly, if not daily, meetings to get to the point where the U.S. could say, 'We think there is a deal out there to avoid war,' '' said R. Nicholas Burns, who led talks with Iran under President George W. Bush and is now a professor at Harvard. But, he added, the Obama administration ''has also got to be willing to walk away from it.''
On Tuesday, the American ambassador to Israel, Daniel B. Shapiro, sought to reassure an Israeli audience that the United States not only was willing to use military force to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, but had made preparations to do so. And Mr. Netanyahu's public position on the negotiations has remain unchanged, while his ability to order military action may actually be enhanced by his new, broader coalition, analysts said.
In his comments on Friday, Mr. Netanyahu reiterated his demand that Iran cease all enrichment, even to 3.5 percent purity; ship out all stockpiles of enriched uranium; and dismantle, rather than simply switch off, the Fordo facility. ''When this goal is achieved, I will be the first to applaud,'' he said during a visit to Prague. ''Until then, count me among the skeptics.''
Analysts said it was hard to gauge what kinds of concessions from the Western nations, Russia and China would draw a positive response from Iran, beyond lifting the oil embargo. European officials have suggested that the European Union could suspend a ban on insuring oil tankers that has had a far swifter effect on Iran's sales elsewhere in the world than originally intended.
The major powers, officials said, are also likely to offer a variation on an earlier proposal to enrich uranium removed from Iran and ship it back into the country for use in medical research.

HEADLINE: A Whisper of Nuclear War Spurs a Sell-Off in a Russian Stock Market

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- An unusually candid reference to nuclear war by Russia's prime minister prompted a sell-off in the nation's stock market this week, underscoring how nervous traders here have become about worsening relations with the West, a street protest movement in Moscow and an overall slump in emerging markets.
In remarks Thursday afternoon, the prime minister, Dmitri A. Medvedev, uttered the phrase ''nuclear weapons'' in a reference to the United States. Although oblique, the comment rattled traders, who sent the main stock market index down 3.5 percent within four hours. 
By the time the smoke had cleared at the end of trading Friday, the damage had been done: a $24 billion drop in the stock market value of Russia's publicly traded companies.
In his comments at a conference for lawyers in St. Petersburg, Mr. Medvedev started out by ruminating on the unintended outcomes of military campaigns. That is a theme often taken up by Russian officials as a line of criticism for what they see as America's interventionist policies in the Middle East.
''The recent, hasty military operations inside foreign states usually end with the arrival of radicals in power,'' Mr. Medvedev said shortly before 1 p.m. on Thursday.
He went on to add that: ''At some moment, such actions, which undermine sovereignty, can end with a full-fledged regional war, or even, and I don't want to scare anybody, the use of nuclear weapons.''
People were nonetheless frightened.
The Russian Micex index, a gauge of large blue chips traded on the domestic market, fell sharply. By the market closing, the index had lost 3.5 percent and ended the day at its lowest level in seven months. Some large Russian companies tumbled even further. Sberbank, the country's largest lender, dropped 7 percent.
Those losses were partly recouped in a midday surge on Friday -- before stocks dipped yet again.
The index typically closely tracks the price of oil, a major export commodity. And global oil prices were also down, providing another explanation for the drop. Other international markets were also down.
When Mr. Medvedev spoke ''traders were looking for any excuse to sell,'' Vladimir Osakovsky, the chief economist for the former Soviet states at Merrill Lynch Bank of America in Moscow, said in a telephone interview.
The prospect of nuclear Armageddon, per se, did not frighten investors. At issue was the comment's significance for a looming macroeconomic transition in Russia known as the ''twin deficits.''
Though Russia's economy appears in rude health today from high oil prices, rising consumer spending and government outlays will push both the budget and balance of payments into deficit within two years, economists say.
After that, the Kremlin will rely on lending from abroad, a dynamic last seen in the late Soviet period and in the 1990s.
Attracting foreign investment hinges on the Kremlin assuaging worries about the eruption of a new East-West conflict and instituting reforms at home.
Yet Vladimir V. Putin, now president, may well choose a hawkish foreign policy stance to deflect attention from the middle-class protest movement simmering in the capital, analysts of Russian politics say. In one signal, Mr. Putin canceled a visit to Washington, where he was to attend a Group of 8 industrialized nations meeting this weekend.
Mr. Medvedev, who will attend in Mr. Putin's place, favors reform, and during his term as president welcomed the detente between Russia and the United States under the administration of President Obama.
The nuclear talk brought back memories of a more tense relationship.
''This kind of stuff is really not market-friendly,'' Mr. Osakovsky said.

HEADLINE: Mongolia Wrestles With Dinosaurs, NATO and Politics

BYLINE: DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW


HIGHLIGHT: Two events on Sunday, the sale of a Tyrannosaurus skeleton and a NATO summit in Chicago, promise to raise the global profile Mongolia. 

 BODY:
Squeezed between geopolitical giants Russia and China, Mongolia has long struggled for independence and visibility.
Two events on Sunday promise to raise the global profile of the country of just 2.8 million people: the planned sale in New York of a stunning skeleton of Tyrannosaur bataar, an Asian cousin of Tyrannosaurus rex; and a meeting in Chicago of NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which Mongolia will attend as a formal, though not full, partner, for the first time.
The events are freighted with very different emotions.
Mongolia has protested the planned sale of the nearly intact dinosaur skeleton - its teeth alone are six inches (15 centimeters) long - by Dallas-based Heritage Auctions.
The origins of the eight-foot-high, 24-foot-long (2.4 meters high, 7.3-meters-long) raptor is unclear but there are suspicions it came from Mongolia, as this statement from President Elbegdorj Tsakhia shows.
In promotional material, the auction house mentioned the dinosaur inhabited the Gobi Desert, long ago, and in his statement, President Elbegdorj noted that, saying if the skeleton originated in Mongolia, the auction was illegal and "the fossil must be returned to Mongolia." He called on the auctioneers to immediately disclose its origins.
David Herskowitz, director of natural history at Heritage Auctions, told Bloomberg Business News that the fossil was initially exported to Japan and then to England, from where it entered the U.S. legally and was prepared.
The skeleton is on public display today at Center 548 (548 W. 22nd Street,) New York.
From dinosaurs to a more modern kind of might: President Elbegdorj is due to attend NATO's annual meeting in Chicago on Sunday, representing a freshly minted partnership with the alliance.
NATO's Web site reports here on Mongolia's participation in the new "Individual Partnership and Cooperation Programme" (Mongolia is the first country to have formal relations with NATO on this basis):
Since 2005, Mongolia has collaborated with NATO, in Kosovo and Afghanistan, as a way to counter the enormous power of neighbors China and Russia, neither of which are NATO members. Just over 1,300 Mongolian soldiers have served alongside NATO- or American-led forces, NATO said.
Dubbed the "Third Neighbor" policy, Chinese analysts are following the balancing act closely.
Huo Wen, a Mongolia-based reporter for the state-run People's Daily, wrote that NATO was "roping in" Mongolia as an "important part of its eastwards expansion strategy." In the article, he wrote:
"Especially against the background of the United States 'return to Asia' strategy, Mongolia's position within NATO's strategy becomes increasingly important."
The China Daily noted the development too, adopting a low-key tone.
As if all that weren't enough, the country is embroiled in a politics-and-corruption scandal that some fear endangers Mongolian democracy, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal entitled "Genghis Democracies."
For a Mongolian take on some detail of the corruption allegations rocking politics, follow a report in The UB Post and another by Reuters.
Perhaps as part of maneuvering for elections set for June 28, the current president and his popular predecessor, Nambaryn Enkhbayar, are locked in an intense rivalry that may have led to Mr. Enkhbayar's recent jailing on corruption charges, Bloomberg Business News reported.
Mr. Enkhbayar was granted bail on Monday and will remain hospitalized after refusing water for 10 days to protest his detention. He and his family have said his arrest last month, on charges dating as far back as 2000, was an attempt by the government to keep him from taking part in the elections, Bloomberg reported.
The vote is likely to be contentious. At stake is management of a massive resource boom that has seen Mongolia's economy surge 16.7 percent in the first quarter of 2012, after very fast growth in 2011.
Mongolia is debating how to retain control of its wealth in the face of Chinese interest - China currently accounts for more than 80 percent of its import and export trade - and interest from foreign mining companies, according to a report from Bloomberg.
"Our struggle to get political freedom was a long one and we cherish that. We will not let foreign government-owned entities control strategic assets in Mongolia," Vice Finance Minister Ganhuyag Chulu said.

HEADLINE: What Chen Guangcheng's Arrival in America Means

BYLINE: MARCUS MABRY


HIGHLIGHT: Chen Guangcheng arrived at Newark's Liberty International Airport on Saturday night, a face-saving sign of a maturing superpower rivalry between the United States and China. But this is not detente. 

 BODY:
The world seemed to be watching United Flight 88 from Beijing to Newark, New Jersey, across the bay from New York City, as Chen Chenguang, made his way with his wife and two children out of China. 
In a face-saving compromise, the Chinese activist was headed to the United States to study on a law fellowship at New York University - not to seek asylum.
That Mr. Chen landed at Newark Liberty International Airport on Saturday evening local time was lost on no one. Though how he made time for the check-in formalities might have been. Mr. Chen seemed to be on his cell nonstop talking to international news media, as has been the case during the month he spent in a hospital in Beijing.
As Time magazine's Hannah Beech reported: "Seven long years of various forms of detention should have taken a greater toll. Yet each phone conversation we at Time have had with him, Chen has surprised us with his calm, soft-spoken demeanor. But early on the afternoon on May 19, Chen's voice changed. He was positively ecstatic, his excitement thrumming over the phone line. 'I'm at the airport, and I'm going to the U.S.,' he told my colleague Chengcheng Jiang. 'I'm standing in line and about to go through the security check.' "
"I don't know when I'll come back, but I'll definitely come back," Mr. Chen said in a telephone interview broadcast today by Hong Kong Cable Television, Bloomberg News reported. 
The Wall Street Journal had a brief interview with Mr. Chen's wife. The Journal reported, "Yuan Weijing said they had left the Beijing hospital where they had been staying without any interaction with Chinese officials. She said they received passports shortly after arriving at the airport.
"They came in and told us to get everything together at 12:30 and we left at 1 o'clock," the Journal reported Ms. Yuan as saying. 
"They had been driven directly to Beijing International Airport by employees of Chaoyang Hospital, where Mr. Chen was being treated for intestinal problems and for the foot he broke during his escape," my colleagues Andrew Jacobs and Steven Lee Myers wrote. "Once on board, flight attendants promptly drew a curtain around their business class seats and barred other passengers in the cabin from using the toilet while the plane was on the runway." 
It was unclear how Chinese media inside China were covering the story, or if Mr. Chen was still missing from coverage in China itself, as Rendezvous reported last week. 
In mature superpower relationships, like the one between the United States and the U.S.S.R., relatively small-potato crises often lead to negotiated settlements - there is too much at stake, strategically, politically, economically - for things to end otherwise. 
Indeed, such run-ins - which can be over principles and people that are, of course, important in their own right, just not as important as the entire relationship between the powers - can often lead to better understanding and the development of ways to cooperate and defuse confrontation. Developments that are crucial to the peaceful cohabitation of great powers whose actions and interests are bound to conflict from time to time (or more often) as they go about their global role.
Could the Chen episode be one of those opportunities for the burgeoning U.S.-China superpower rivalry?
As Andrew and Steven wrote, "The American role in aiding Mr. Chen - spiriting him into the embassy after he escaped with the help of other dissidents - infuriated the Chinese, who complained fiercely about what they considered interference in their internal affairs, but in the end they quietly engaged with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and a team of diplomats to defuse what could have evolved into a full-blown diplomatic crisis."
Of course, the relationship between China and the United States is not the epoch-defining test that the confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union was, yet. And many students of international relations argue it does not have to be. 
After all, who could imagine The Empire State Building being adorned in the colors of the Soviet Union's flag on 60th anniversary of founding, as it was for China's
Of course, deals can unravel. For instance, what happens if Mr. Cheng decides to seek asylum in the United States after all? Many observers see those remaining in China after Mr. Chen's departure - including his mother, whose home, Time magazine reports, is being surrounded by electric fencing, and his dissident colleagues, including those who helped him make his daring escape -provide Beijing with an unsavory insurance policy.
Who can tell us what the Chinese media are reporting?

HEADLINE: The Most Powerful Special Interest in Washington: The Acronym

BYLINE: MICAH COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: A linguistic plague is creeping through the nation's capital - the "bacronym," where a PAC or bill name is chosen so that the initial letters of each word form a desired word. 

 BODY:
A linguistic plague is creeping through the nation's capital. From the House to the Senate, a demon lurks, luring the country's leaders to twist and mangle words into grotesque amalgamations.
In Washington, there is nowhere to hide from the acronym. And the English language may not survive the scourge.
The specific strain of the acronym virus infecting most of Washington is called "the bacronym." A bacronym is a premeditated acronym, where a phrase is chosen so that the initial letters of each word form a desired word. The bacronym may hold little appeal for most, but in Washington bacronym-fever is rampant.
"Leadership" PACs - committees established by members of Congress to support other candidates -- have been hit particularly hard. There are 487 such PACs in the Federal Election Commission's database for the 2012 election cycle. Twenty percent of these PACs are titled with an acronym.
There's Representative Michele Bachmann's Many Individual Conservatives Helping Elect Leaders Everywhere PAC (MICHELE PAC).
There's Senator Rand Paul's mind-boggling Reinventing a New Direction PAC (RAND PAC). Mr. Paul, if a direction has already been invented, how can it be new?
The Because All Responsible Taxpayers Like Every Truth Told PAC (BARTLETT PAC) naturally belongs to Representative Roscoe Bartlett of Maryland's Sixth District.
The House majority leader, Eric Cantor, voiced his commitment to fellow Republicans by establishing the ERIC PAC (Every Republican Is Crucial). But perhaps some Republicans are more crucial than others, because the ERIC PAC gave $25,000 to the Campaign for Primary Accountability, which is dedicated to challenging incumbent members of Congress, including Republicans.
All of the above are Republican PACs. Indeed, Washington's acronym infection-rate is highest amongst Republicans -- 67 of the 97 acronym-named PACs are affiliated with the G.O.P. But Democrats are not immune.
Representative Diana Degette, from Colorado's First District, christened her political action committee the Individuals Dedicated to Ethics and Science PAC (IDEAS PAC).
And just in case democracy was feeling discouraged, Representative Ted Deutch, of Florida's 19th District, founded the TED PAC, which stands for Together Encouraging Democracy.
The acronym pandemic has also reached the nation's laws. It was not always so. On July 2, 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed a law encoding civil rights for minorities and women. The law was called the Civil Rights Act of 1964. But such simplicity and elegance is long gone.
What will Americans of the 22nd century think when they look back and see that in 2011 alone, the following were just a few of the acronym-titled bills introduced in Congress.

        
Diaper Investment and Aid to Promote Economic Recovery Act (DIAPER)
        
Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act (DREAM)
        
Fair Allocation of Internal Revenue Credit for Renewable Electricity Distribution by Indian Tribes Act (FAIRCREDIT)
        
Helping Agriculture Receive Verifiable Employees Securely and Temporarily Act (HARVEST)
And there were no fewer than three HOME Acts:

        
Hardship Outlays to protect Mortgagee Equity Act
        
Housing Opportunities Made Equal Act
        
Housing Opportunity and Mortgage Equity Act.
Patient zero may be Representative Darrell Issa, who represents California's 49th District. Mr. Issa not only named his leadership PAC the Invest in a Strong and Secure America PAC (the ISSA PAC), he also sponsored the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act (the DATA Act), the Promoting Automotive Repair, Trade, and Sales Act (the PARTS Act) and the Classified Information Accountability Act (the CIA Act),
The most recent affront to linguistic decency comes courtesy of Senators Charles Schumer of New York, and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania. Outraged by The decision of the Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin to renounce his American citizenship in advance of Facebook's IPO, thereby saving himself millions of dollars in taxes (although Mr. Saverin denied that was his motivation), the two senators introduced the Expatriation Prevention by Abolishing Tax-Related Incentives for Offshore Tenancy Act (the EX-PATRIOT Act).
The word "patriot" was also involved in perhaps the most famous example of acronym-obsessed legislators forcing unwilling words into line. In 2001, Congress passed the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act (the USA PATRIOT Act).

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at the president's weekly address and a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
Today's Times

        
The cost of a part for an Army helicopter proves that the power of earmarks endures in Congress, critics say. Eric Lichtblau reports on controversy surrounding $17,000 oil drip pans made by a company whose owners donate to Representative Harold Rogers, a Kentucky Republican. 

        
The House on Friday beat back an unusual coalition of liberal and conservative lawmakers and approved a broad military policy bill that would break Pentagon spending caps agreed to last summer, Jonathan Weisman reports. The measure would thwart the Obama administration's efforts to close the military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and would impede its ability to carry out the nuclear arms reduction treaty ratified by the Senate in 2010.

        
Both President Obama and Speaker John A. Boehner have signaled that the summer is likely to bring a potential replay of last year's damaging showdown over the debt ceiling. Jackie Calmes reports that the administration believes it has greater leverage this time around, though Mr. Obama's stance on increased taxes for the wealthy leaves open the question of whether election-year politics will play to his advantage.

        
Mitt Romney is hoping that his message of lower taxes, less regulation and an emphatic denunciation of President Obama's economic record is in sync with New Hampshire voters, Michael Barbaro and Michael D. Shear report. Mr. Romney's aides have privately identified the state as potentially crucial to victory in a close election, and a potent symbolic win since Mr. Obama took New Hampshire in 2008.
Weekly Address

        
President Obama used his weekly address to push for Wall Street reform, reminding taxpayers of the financial crisis that "cost our economy millions of jobs, hurt middle-class families and left taxpayers holding the bag." Although he said the White House has put tougher rules in place to prevent another financial downturn, Mr. Obama warned against Washington lawmakers who are trying to reverse those measures. "For the past two years, too many Republicans in Congress and an army of financial industry lobbyists have actually been waging an all-out battle to delay, defund and dismantle Wall Street reform," he said. With the recent $2 billion loss reported by JP Morgan bank, reassessing the nation's financial market has taken greater priority within the administration.
Around the Web

        
The first 500 people to donate $100,000 to the Mitt Romney campaign will receive "green room" passes for debates and election night, as well as a summer retreat in Park City, Utah, Politico reports.
Happenings in Washington

        
While President Obama hosts the G-8 leaders at Camp David on Saturday, Michelle Obama will invite their spouses to the White House for a guided tour and intimate lunch. On Sunday the president and first lady will meet NATO leaders in Chicago. Mrs. Obama will take the spouses to a youth center on the city's South Side.

        
The sixth annual G.I. Film Festival will conclude on Saturday at the Naval Heritage Center with screenings of movies representing every branch of the military.

HEADLINE: In Land's Bounty, A Political Chip

BYLINE: By LYDIA POLGREEN

 BODY:
BINGA, Zimbabwe -- More than a decade after Zimbabwe's government began seizing sprawling white-owned commercial farms, a new fight is brewing here over who will profit from the nation's vast bounty of platinum, chromium, nickel and diamonds.
In a move rooted in politics, the party of the aging president, Robert G. Mugabe, has begun pressuring companies operating in the country to comply with a law requiring that black Zimbabweans own more than half their shares.
Mr. Mugabe has ruled the country since its independence in 1980 but has seen his popularity recede considerably in recent years. He won fewer votes than the opposition in the 2008 election and was forced into an awkward power-sharing government in the violent aftermath.
As Mr. Mugabe pushes for new elections this year, the drive to put more wealth into the hands of black Zimbabweans is seen by allies as a politically popular path to victory. 
Senior officials of Mr. Mugabe's party, ZANU-PF, say that foreigners operating inside the country must not be allowed to profit at the expense of indigenous, or black, Zimbabweans.
''Am I going to assign another man to make my wife pregnant and get a child?'' asked Savior Kasukuwere, the ZANU-PF minister overseeing the process known as indigenization. ''Zimbabweans must be masters of their own destiny. Indigenization is a core feature of the values of our party: freedom, equality, peace.''
The opposition Movement for Democratic Change, along with many independent economists and analysts, says that the law, which was passed in 2010, but only widely enforced in the last year, spells disaster for the country's economy just as it is beginning to expand after years of withering.
''Our position is empowerment, yes,'' said Morgan Tsvangirai, the prime minister and leader of the opposition. ''But we are more concerned about the state of employment. How do we encourage creation of more jobs rather than destroying the few jobs we have?''
Zimbabwe's economy has been making a slow recovery after more than a decade of political and economic crisis brought on by the seizure of commercial farms. The introduction of the United States dollar eliminated the hyperinflation that made life here impossible, and investors are slowly returning to a country that is richly endowed with natural wealth.
Much of that wealth is folded within a geological formation known as the Great Dyke: a 340-mile-long river of stone formed 2.5 billion years ago by molten rock that pushed up from the earth's core through the Zimbabwe craton, an even more ancient chunk of continental crust. Over millenniums the rock folded and twisted back on itself, and within its layers lie rich deposits of valuable elements like platinum, nickel, copper and chromium.
According to Zimbabwe's indigenization law, black Zimbabweans must own 51 percent of shares of foreign companies operating here. About 20 percent of the shares are supposed to go to community trust funds, which in theory will pay for local development projects, and company employees. The rest must go to black Zimbabweans.
But exactly how these aims are to be achieved is unclear. Many of these companies are publicly held, and their shares are not the companies' to give or sell. On top of that, few black Zimbabweans have the means to buy large numbers of shares at market value.
Still, a handful of companies have already agreed to comply, under intense pressure from Mr. Kasukuwere, a 41-year-old former official of Zimbabwe's fearsome Central Intelligence Organization.
In March, the South African mining company Implats -- whose subsidiary, Zimplats, mines platinum in Zimbabwe -- said it would give community organizations interest-free loans, to be repaid from dividends, for their shares, and do the same for employees.
But it said it expected full market value for the other 31 percent of shares required under the law, an amount few private investors in Zimbabwe could muster. Officials from Implats and other companies affected by the new law did not respond to requests for comment.
Government officials say that they will not pay a cent for those shares.
''Our contribution is the platinum they are taking from our soil,'' said George Charamba, Mr. Mugabe's spokesman. ''They will get nothing more.''
Mr. Mugabe, at the age of 88, is rumored to be in poor health. In April, rumors spread in Harare that he was on his deathbed in Singapore, but he appeared at the country's independence day celebration a few days later, looking fit as he walked around a soccer stadium under a blazing sun for 30 minutes unaided to review a military parade.
But after three decades with one man at the helm, Mr. Mugabe's party is riven by infighting over who will succeed him, and party leaders are eager to hold elections soon while Mr. Mugabe is still able to campaign. The opposition argues it is a mistake to rush the process while important reforms remain undone.
Many here worry that the already wealthy supporters of the ruling party will reap almost all the benefits of the law. That would be a replay of the land seizures, which led to huge farms being handed over to people who had no expertise in commercial farming and left them fallow, further hobbling the economy.
''What they seek to do is transfer wealth from rich white people to rich black people,'' said Tendai Biti, Zimbabwe's finance minister and a leader of the Movement for Democratic Change. ''You are not creating any wealth, you are not creating any new jobs.''
It is also unclear whether the community trusts, which are trumpeted as the main way ordinary people will benefit, represent new funds or simply a replacement for existing corporate social responsibility programs.
''It is all political smoke and mirrors,'' said Derek Matyszak, an analyst at the Research and Advocacy Unit, a research institution in Harare, who has closely examined the existing indigenization deals. ''So far, no one has actually parted with a brass farthing as far as I can tell.''
But for ZANU-PF, which under the power-sharing agreement retains control of the most powerful levers of government -- the army, the police and the intelligence service -- indigenization could be a powerful political tactic.
On a recent Saturday morning, Mr. Kasukuwere demonstrated just how useful the policy could be in drumming up support, boarding a rattling police helicopter for the hour-and-a-half trip to Binga, a remote and impoverished town on Zimbabwe's arid western edge.
He had arrived with a stack of four giant checks for local community groups drawn from a fund set up by Old Mutual, an insurance company that has already begun to comply with the law.
Over a squealing, distorted amplifier, a master of ceremonies called out the names of the organizations receiving loans to start fishing businesses.
''To the Tutambule Kapenta Fishing Cooperative, 25,000 United States dollars!'' the M.C. shouted. The cooperative's members rushed to the front of the crowd, hooting and hopping like contestants selected for ''The Price is Right.'' They danced in a joyous circle around Mr. Kasukuwere, holding their oversized check aloft.
''Who stands for the youth? Only Kasukuwere!'' the assembled crowd sang. ''Who can empower the people? Only Kasukuwere!''
Andrew Muleya, a 31-year-old carpenter, said there were few jobs available in this remote corner of the country and he was grateful to Mr. Kasukuwere for coming to Binga to inject some cash into the community.
''ZANU-PF will win this election because they are helping the poor people,'' he said. ''People are getting something for the future.''
Heavyset with a powerful, cleanshaven head, Mr. Kasukuwere stood out from the wiry villagers who had gathered to watch his presentation. Dressed in a blue blazer with brass buttons, and with a Mont Blanc watch on his wrist, he presided over the proceedings like a young prince who hopes to be king.
The son of a liberation war veteran and a former intelligence official, he is a rising star in the party. He is also one of more than 100 senior Zimbabwean politicians under European Union sanctions, accused of participating in violence against opponents of Mr. Mugabe's rule.
After a particularly energetic song and dance performance by a group of local children, Mr. Kasukuwere pledged them a gift of $50. When an old man rushed up to him to offer some crudely carved animals for sale, he handed the stunned man a $100 bill.
''No change,'' Mr. Kasukuwere said with a shrug as he ambled back to the helicopter.

ARE THE RICH WORTH A DAMN?
My natural instinct is to react angrily and dismiss the hypercapitalistic arguments of Edward Conard. But as I thought about it a little bit more, I decided he should be applauded. In a country where the 1 percent seem all too content to hide behind vague and self-serving arguments, Conard openly shares opinions that he has formed after considerable thought. I may not be interested in seeing these ideas carried out to reality, but this clarity helps me better understand fiscal conservatives and their logic. If I were a politician in this battle, I would feel better equipped to bridge an ever-widening partisan gap.
JEFF KRIMMEL,
Cleveland, posted on nytimes.com 
The story's author, Adam Davidson, did not go far enough to explore the ramifications of Conard's argument, which is essentially that people's lives are better just because they can buy a Big Mac, and it doesn't much matter if they can afford to raise a child, get her educated or get her a doctor when she is sick. There is little concern from this guy for the heartbreak of struggling to raise a child when you have to work two jobs to support her and you can't afford to get her into activities that will keep her out of trouble. I certainly don't see a problem with developing cheap burgers or a better way to make a soda can,but to say that that is the way to make a better life and a better country shows just how stunted the 1 percent really is. Conard's argument is a justification for heartlessness.

The United States' rise in productivity is not translating into higher wages for the average worker, as it always has in the past. During the past decade, productivity increases have been especially steep, while the median income has declined slightly. Rising productivity is great, but why isn't it shared? Conard says it's because the workforce includes a lot of rifraff who have ''below-average productivity'' -- young people, the ''marginally employed,'' ''near-retirees,'' women who will later drop out to raise children. But even if you accept Conard's claim that these workers are less productive than average, which I'm inclined to doubt, the United States' workforce has always included these categories of worker. And previously, when productivity went up, median income went up, too.

Conard is essentially correct, but blunders in trying to make his case on the basis of benefits to the masses. Don't apologize. Be proud of your wealth! Why is it anyone's business how much someone makes? What right does anyone have to hate the rich, which the article's author implies is the norm? If you don't dream, fine. But don't snarl like a vicious predator when someone else does.

It is commonly known that a child who uses a certain brand's product will generally continue to use that brand's product when they are older. In advertising-speak, it's called brand loyalty. It's bad enough that McDonald's food is appallingly bad for your health and for the environment, but instrumentalizing young mothers in order to create consumers of rubbish food out of their children? That takes the cake (er, Happy Meal).
BRIAN HAMAN,
New York, posted on nytimes.com
McDonald's is a business. It isn't their responsibility to ensure that their food is healthful. Yes, they need to make sure their food isn't causing people to spontaneously combust, and they need to follow the law, but they aren't responsible for serving a nutritious meal. If they want to introduce ''nutritious'' options, then it's a business decision on their part meant to attract new customers, retain existing customers or get some good P.R. That's it.
You know who's responsible for making sure you eat healthfully? You are. And you know who's responsible for making sure kids eat healthfully? Their parents are. Too few people take responsibility for their own actions anymore. People just blame the big bad rich corporations because it's easy: ''It's not my fault I'm fat. It's McDonald's fault because they serve me garbage.''

OBAMA'S NOT-SO-HOT DATE WITH WALL STREET
It's not surprising that President Obama is having a hard time raising money from Wall Street donors, including some who enthusiastically supported him the last time. But what is surprising is the degree to which the shift in donor behavior seems driven not by cold calculations of political interest (which is how you expect interest groups to behave) but by a mixture of pique and paranoia. . . . A culture of aggrieved petulance pervades politics, and nowhere is it more intense than on Wall Street, where it is a kind of psychological buffer against the terrible responsibility the banks bear for their central role in the economic disaster that we're all still muddling through. So any slight must be taken literally. And politics is no longer mainly about defending interests (though, of course, it is still mostly about that). It's about payback and, ultimately, cheap emotional gratification.
JOHN McQUAID,
posted on forbes.com
I don't understand the people who say that Obama should avoid Wall Street donors entirely. Raising all of your campaign money from small donors is a great idea in a world where 10 billionaires can't easily match the donations of 1,000,000 small donors. But we don't live in that world .

HEADLINE: On the Streets of San Francisco With a Gallon of Gas to Go

BYLINE: By NICK CZAP

 BODY:
San Francisco
THIS eye-pleasing city has plenty of popular tourist sites as well as a less famous but equally beguiling attraction, the 49 Mile Scenic Drive. This meandering route ties together many well-known landmarks -- including Coit Tower, Fisherman's Wharf and the Golden Gate Bridge -- while also venturing into areas seldom featured in travel guides.
Devised to promote the Golden Gate International Exposition of 1939-40, the scenic drive originally terminated at the exposition's fairgrounds on Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay. Today, the somewhat modified route is marked by signs featuring a sly-looking seagull, which peers down from lampposts across the city.
I'd been meaning to take the drive for nearly as long as I've lived here -- some 20 years -- but until recently I never got around to it. Procrastination was a factor, but it was also a matter of waiting for the right opportunity. Such an occasion finally presented itself a few weeks ago in the form of a test car: an urban-oriented subcompact that could, in theory, complete the 49-mile loop on less than a gallon of gasoline. 
The car was the 2012 Prius C, the newest, smallest and -- with a base price of $19,710 -- least expensive member of Toyota's expanding Prius family of hybrids. Aimed at young, budget-wary city dwellers, this more petite Prius (the C is for city) deploys Toyota's gas-electric drivetrain in a sporty-looking four-door hatchback.
On the face of it, a Prius C with a gallon in the tank should be able to handle the scenic drive with miles to spare: its city fuel economy rating is 53 miles per gallon. Toyota says its new hybrid baby has the ''highest-rated city fuel economy of any vehicle without a plug.''
Still, I wondered how it would fare on an urban road course punctuated with preposterously steep hills and intermittently horrendous traffic, as well as some less congested stretches of curves and twisties that encourage the right foot to explore its primitive urges.
Unlike its larger sibling, the familiar hybrid now called the Prius Liftback, which has the aesthetic appeal of a slug on wheels, the Prius C is an attractive little car. Where the Prius Liftback is all monolithic planar mass, the Prius C is all curves and flares and bulges. And while the Liftback's top-heavy look suggests a predilection for straight-line travel, the C's wide, low-slung, wheels-to-the-corners stance hints at a penchant for playing.
The sense of sportiness continues indoors. The front seats are firm and assertively bolstered, with excellent lumbar support. The thick-rim, flat-bottom steering wheel has easy-to-reach thumb pads for the radio, navigation and climate controls, and for toggling among the hybrid information displays.
The dashboard, clad in handsome plastics, is pleasingly spare and uncluttered. The test car, outfitted at the top trim level (the so-called Prius C Four, with a sticker price of $25,140) featured a touch screen with audio and navigation controls as well as the Entune interface for smartphones.
After examining a map of the 49 Mile Scenic Drive, I chose a starting point: an Inner Sunset gas station, where I would fill the tank before and after. Like all Prii, the C displays trip fuel economy to tenths of a gallon, but I would take a redundant measurement. In the interest of staying on course, I enlisted my wife as navigator in chief, and on a partly sunny, partly foggy, altogether typical San Francisco morning, we set off.
After filling up with regular-grade 87 octane at Seventh Avenue and Lincoln Way and clicking the hybrid systeminto Eco mode to hedge our bets -- it slows the throttle opening and dials back the air-conditioner -- we made our way toward Twin Peaks.
At an elevation of 922 feet, it is San Francisco's second-highest point (after Mount Davidson, not far to the southwest). The road that winds to the top offers panoramic views, and for the skittish, an unnerving proximity to many long, steep drop-offs.
Happily, the car's handling lived up to its looks, its suspension (MacPherson struts in front and torsion beam in the rear) dispatching curve after precipitous curve with sure-footed confidence -- no trace of jitters or notable body roll.
The C's road-holding ability is aided, no doubt, by the placement of its battery pack: it sits beneath the rear seats for a fairly low center of gravity.
Although the C is almost 20 inches shorter than the Liftback, its width and height are nearly identical to the bigger car's. The rear seats are more cozy, but for a subcompact the cabin feels spacious. Getting in and out is a breeze, a plus when scenic overlooks beckoned.
After a brief stop at the Twin Peaks lookout, where the test car, in a shimmering blue called Summer Rain Metallic, generated a fair amount of chatter from a gaggle of tourists, we headed back down to the bustle of the city. The long, steep grade offered an opportunity to move the shifter to ''B'' -- for braking -- putting the hybrid drive system into a mode that enhances the car's regenerative energy gathering, banking electrons in the nickel-metal-hydride battery for later use.
The shifter for the continuously variable transmission, by the way, is not the stubby dash-mounted flipper of the Liftback, but a conventional looking lever set into the console between the seats.
On the convoluted streets of Ashbury Heights and the Upper Castro, the Prius C felt decidedly nimble, partly owing to the test car's optional 16-inch alloy wheels, which come with a quicker steering ratio, and the electric power steering system's surprisingly convincing simulation of tactile feedback. Steering on the 2012 Prius Liftback, by comparison, feels weirdly abstract, and in a way illustrates a certain metaphysical difference between the two cars.
At the wheel of the Liftback, I could never quite shake the uncanny sensation that it was driving me, rather than the other way around, that I was merely there to help it achieve its uncompromising mission of maximum m.p.g.
The Prius C, on the other hand, despite an identical degree of technical sophistication, never left me feeling like anything less than an equal partner in our brief automotive marriage.
From Ashbury Heights, the route swooped down through the Mission District, then east toward Mission Bay, an area in transition from industrial grit to biotech sparkle. On a section of road under construction, the taut suspension did an admirable job of soaking up bumps while extending an invitation to the sport of slaloming around them.
From Mission Bay, the route zinged over to the Embarcadero, where the driver and navigator stopped at a Ferry Building diner to refuel on veggie burgers and consult the map.
Hunger sated, we set off at a brisker pace, as, two hours into the escapade we still had 38 miles to go. Even in Eco mode, the car has plenty of around-town oomph, not just from its relatively low-torque Atkinson-cycle gasoline engine -- rated at 99 horsepower and 82 pound-feet -- but also from the 45-kilowatt electric motor that kicks in extra boost.
Toyota states that acceleration to 60 m.p.h. from a standstill takes 11.5 seconds, a leisurely pace. Speed limit signs along the route prevented verification of this number. But like its siblings, the Prius C tends to shift one's perception of performance from a measure of brute force to one of calculated frugality, to the extent that being smoked by a minivan doesn't pose a threat to the ego.
The rest of the trip was a blur of starts and stops for photo ops, from SoMa to Japantown, Union Square to Chinatown, North Beach, Fisherman's Wharf and the Marina. After a dash through the Presidio to the Pacific, our tour culminated in a winding warmdown run through Golden Gate Park.
As we pulled back into our designated filling station, I tapped the steering-wheel-mounted thumb pad to summon the trip odometer, which claimed that in the course of traversing 49.1 miles of San Francisco streets, the Prius C had achieved no less than 53.7 m.p.g.
To test the computer's math, I refilled the tank using the same pump and nozzle, its handle hooked to the same notch.
The pump shut itself off at 0.858 gallons, which when subjected to some rudimentary algebra, yielded a fuel economy figure of 57.2 miles per gallon.
However you cut it, 53.7 m.p.g. or 57.2 m.p.g. or something in between is quite an achievement. Doing it at a price within striking range of a Ford Fiesta or a Honda Fit is another thing entirely.
INSIDE TRACK: More cute, less filling.

HEADLINE: Blessed With a Talent That Offends His World

BYLINE: By ANITA GATES

 BODY:
If you are unfamiliar with the actors in the excellent new Long Wharf production of ''My Name Is Asher Lev,'' just imagine Kevin Kline and Mary Beth Hurt as the parents and a very young Richard Thomas as their son. The cast sometimes evokes those colleagues of theirs. But do remember Ari Brand, who plays the title role, a boy in 1950s Brooklyn who horrifies his Hasidic Jewish parents and community by becoming an artist. And the kind of artist he becomes.
Mr. Brand never officially made his Broadway debut in 2009, although he was the understudy to the male lead in Neil Simon's ''Broadway Bound.'' (It was the scandal of that New York theater season that ''The Neil Simon Plays,'' directed by David Cromer, died at the box office before the second play even had its first preview.) But Mr. Brand did burst onto the New York stage scene last year as the unguarded groom-to-be in A. R. Gurney's ''Black Tie.'' And in between, he played the title character's teenage love interest in the Westport Country Playhouse's production of ''The Diary of Anne Frank.'' 
Now, the Manhattan-born Mr. Brand appears on the Long Wharf main stage in a haunting performance as a child who grows into a man, suffering the torture of a talent that offends the world into which he was born. As readers of the 1972 Chaim Potok novel on which this adaptation is based know, Asher loves his family. It might have been a great deal easier for him if he didn't.
Aaron Posner, who also adapted Mr. Potok's novel ''The Chosen'' for the stage (as a musical), has distilled ''Asher Lev'' into an economical, almost painfully potent 90-minute one-act play. The adaptation had its world premiere in Philadelphia in 2009.
At least one formerly fundamentalist Protestant woman in the audience at a recent performance was overwhelmed by the palpable emotional parallels between Asher's departure for Paris from his parents' city apartment at the play's end and her own departure for New York from her mother and father's rural ranch house. Parents wonder who these strangers (their children) are, and young adults are unable even to contemplate the mystery of how the parents must feel.
''It is absurd to apologize for a mystery,'' Asher says at the beginning. He means the larger one, the one that questions the origins of an artistic gift (heaven or hell) and the proper way to deal with it. Is it all right, at least, to feel guilty?
Gordon Edelstein has directed his three-person cast with humor and a sense of incurable remorse. My favorite character reactions (mixing pride, shock, awe, embarrassment and childish glee) are those of Asher's parents, especially his mother, learning how much people pay Asher for his paintings -- and which museums have hung his work.
Mark Nelson, whom Long Wharf audiences saw most recently in ''A Doll's House,'' is strong and virtuously stubborn as Ari Lev, the father, but he is even more enthralling as Jacob Kahn, a passionate artist who becomes Asher's mentor and passes along sacrilegious wisdom: that art itself is a religion.
Melissa Miller does a lovely, deeply felt job as Riv, Asher's mother, who is torn between supporting her son in his joy and being loyal to her husband, who is often traveling, opening yeshivas all around the world. He counts on her to raise their only child properly. Ms. Miller plays other roles too, but they are so small and the scenes are so short that they have little impact. It does seem an awkward necessity of budget-crunched contemporary theater that the woman who plays Asher's mother also plays the first nude artists' model he encounters.
Eugene Lee's set design, which serves mostly as the Levs' apartment, is spare yet comforting with frosty skylights and a Star of David above the front door. Christopher Akerlind's lighting design and John Gromada's original music and sound design make their contributions quietly during most of ''My Name Is Asher Lev,'' but when these elements do speak up, they do it in harmony and with an eloquent moodiness.
It is a blessing -- a brakha? a mitzvah? -- that Mr. Posner has given us so much of Mr. Potok's language in Mr. Brand's voice. And that when Riv reprimands her son, ''This is no kind of talk, Asher,'' it feels like ''I won't have talk like that in my house, young lady'' or, perhaps more damning, from one parent to the other, ''Where on earth do you think he (or she) gets that?''
''My Name Is Asher Lev,'' by Aaron Posner, adapted from the novel by Chaim Potok, is at the Long Wharf Theater, 222 Sargent Drive, New Haven, through May 27. Information and tickets: (203) 787-4282 or longwharf.org.

BYLINE: By GABY WOOD

 BODY:
The flat-fronted buildings in the Grunerlokka District of Oslo, where the actor Anders Danielsen Lie and the model Iselin Steiro live, are crisp, stately and designed for sunlight. They were built in the late 19th century for workers in the factories along the Akerselva river. Then, people slept 10 to a room. Now the area has become establishment-hip, and the facades have been painted a range of powdery shades: pale peach with a light gray and a dark gray stripe; faded mustard; dusky rose; Wedgwood blue with black window frames. The effect is striking -- half severe and half serene, as if the colors of the South of France had hit an iceberg.
When I mentioned to Steiro how lovely I found the streets, she wrinkled her nose. ''Really?'' she asked. ''I always think Stockholm and Copenhagen are so much nicer.'' Lie nodded: ''Oslo is more barbarian -- in every sense.'' 
Meet Oslo: a city with a long-held inferiority complex and the central character in Joachim Trier's devastating and beautiful film ''Oslo, August 31st.'' The movie, an updated city symphony disguised as gritty realism, was acclaimed at Cannes and Sundance, has had a very successful run in France and will be released in the United States on May 25. It is both a portrait of a man in difficulty -- a recovering drug addict played astoundingly by Lie -- and a hymn to a capital in flux. At parties, in parks, in restaurants and in the homes of friends, Oslo offers glimpses of something like redemption. Although the film takes place over the course of 24 hours, the title is not the date on which the action unfolds but the date on which it ends. The dawn rises, the film closes, and its title becomes less a setting than a form of punctuation: a bearer of history, a monument to a moment.
''I wanted to try to capture part of the melancholy of the change of a city,'' Trier told me.
''We wanted to say: What's the anxiety of this generation? Norway has not been affected that badly by the recession yet, and there's a strange feeling of hope and expansion. But I also see a lot of hip, young, creatively ambitious people getting quite lost.'' The film is loosely based on the 1930s French novel ''Le Feu Follet,'' made into a movie by Louis Malle in 1963, and Trier feels that what's happening in Oslo now is similar to the social change in Paris during those two periods.
Trier and his co-writer, Eskil Vogt, wrote the script with Lie in mind. (He also played a central figure in their previous film, ''Reprise,'' about two troubled young novelists.) Trier compares him to Daniel Day-Lewis, a cerebral actor whose face leaves you guessing at what he's grappling with, and ''Oslo, August 31st'' rests entirely on the richness and unpredictability of Lie's performance. He can seem like both a child and a madman, becomes genuinely more intriguing as the plot progresses, yet remains unknowable to the end.
Steiro and Lie, who met in 2007 and married soon after (''I just diffused into your life,'' Steiro said, laughing in Lie's direction), are part of the group of gifted 20- and 30-somethings Trier described. On one wall of their light-flooded apartment is a set of Polaroids from Lie's 30th birthday party three years ago; many of the people in them are recognizable from ''Oslo, August 31st'' and ''Reprise.''
Steiro, who comes from a small town in the Arctic, has been modeling since she was discovered in London at 14. (She is now 26.) Glamorously severe in photographs, in person she has a charismatic touch of goofiness. Although still very recognizable from Chloe ads, among others, she's taking a break to go to architecture school.
Lie, the Oslo-raised son of a doctor and an actress, made a childhood foray into acting that yielded ''Herman,'' a movie about a boy who goes bald that became such a hit it almost put Lie off for good. So now he is finishing his medical internship at a hospital two hours away. His friends describe him as a renaissance man, but that's a fairly bland summation of the strange span of his gifts. He's an actor, he's a doctor, he has released a rock album (''This Is Autism'') based on recordings he made as a child. His affect is so deadpan that it would be difficult to exaggerate the extent to which his smile transforms his face. It's memorable when it happens in the movie, and in life Lie's solemnity tends to crack in response to Steiro, who is fiendishly friendly, a perfect foil.
Late one Sunday morning, they took me to Kaffebrenneriet in the upscale Frogner district, and persuaded me to try the local geitost, a brown goat cheese that tastes like caramel. (''Even in Sweden they're like: 'What?,' '' Steiro said.)
Lie returned to his joke about Oslo being ''barbarian,'' and explained that although Norway boasts Henrik Ibsen, Edvard Munch and the best-selling thriller writer Jo Nesbo as native sons, it has been slower than Sweden or Denmark to put itself center-stage culturally. ''Whenever there's a discussion about a new museum for Edvard Munch, who is probably the best thing we have, there's a lot of debate about how much to spend,'' he said, raising an eyebrow. ''Whereas if Norway's going to have another winter Olympics, we don't talk so much about price.''
The couple then spoke about the effect on the city of last July's events, when a bomb in the government quarter and a gunman on a nearby island left 77 dead.
Lie said, ''I think the civic pride of people from Oslo is a little more subtle than that of people from other cities.'' Steiro went on: ''But after this very dramatic incident in the summer, the patriotism of Oslo was really forceful.'' A rose parade was organized on Facebook, and more than 100,000 people turned out, without security, holding flowers. ''It was very important to show that we were going to respond to this with more love, more openness and more democracy,'' Lie said.
The expansion that was already under way then has become an earnest act of retaliation. The Oslo Opera House, which opened in 2008 and was designed by Snohetta, the firm in charge of the 9/11 Memorial Museum pavilion in Manhattan, is expected to have something of a ''Bilbao effect.'' All around it are construction sites that will become condominiums, office buildings, university buildings, a museum and a library -- all part of a plan to turn the city toward the water and to try, as Steiro explained, ''to give cultural status to a place that used to be more industrial.'' Not that Oslo doesn't have other charms: a 20-minute metro ride will take you cross-country skiing, and a quick ferry trip across the fjord will get you to the beach. ''There's a lot to do here,'' Lie said, ''which makes it a very good city to live in, and raise children.''
As for children, there are plans -- part of what Steiro endearingly termed their ''multi-happening life.'' The couple are engaged in so many different things that they are sometimes frustrated or uncertain. But overall, they like it that way, and it seems in keeping with the changing nature of Oslo itself. ''Maybe our lives are going to be like this forever,'' Steiro said. ''We'll never 'end up' as anything, we'll just continue doing stuff in between.'' Maybe, like a city, they'll always be in the act of becoming.

HEADLINE: A Drama Queen With Her Head On Straight

BYLINE: By CORI ELLISON

 BODY:
NEW YORK likes to think of itself as being the classical music capital of the world. Yet every so often it falls off the flight path of certain eminent musicians. Cecilia Bartoli, Carlos Kleiber, Birgit Nilsson and Brigitte Fassbaender are just a few of the great artists who have skipped New York for long stretches.
The same goes for the superb Nina Stemme, widely considered the world's reigning dramatic soprano. When the Swedish Ms. Stemme (pronounced (STEH-muh) made her Metropolitan Opera debut, as Senta in Wagner's ''Fliegende Hollander'' in 2000, Anthony Tommasini praised her ''cool, radiant and often penetrating sound'' in The New York Times and called her portrayal ''lustrous and winning.'' But she has logged a mere 11 New York appearances in all, having returned to the Met in 2010 for five performances of Strauss's ''Ariadne auf Naxos''. And she won't resurface there until the 2016-17 season, when she will star in both Strauss's ''Elektra'' and a new Willy Decker production of Wagner's ''Tristan und Isolde.'' 
Until then New Yorkers will have to content themselves with a glimpse of her on Thursday evening at Carnegie Hall, where she will sing the title role in Strauss's ''Salome'' in a concert performance with the Cleveland Orchestra and its music director, Franz Welser-Most.
Ms. Stemme, though now 49, comes about as close as any soprano ever has to the ''16-year-old princess with the voice of an Isolde'' that Strauss envisioned for his Salome. Video excerpts from her first Salome, in a provocative update at Barcelona's Gran Teatre del Liceu in 2009, reveal a heroine both formidable and diminutive, hot and cold, every inch the ''chaste virgin'' with ''the simplest, most dignified gestures'' specified by the composer. After an eerily chaste encounter with the severed head of John the Baptist, she rears backward like a high-school girl after her first kiss, bewildered by the strange new sensations it stirs.
''Who she is offstage is so different from who she is onstage,'' said Francesca Zambello, who directed Ms. Stemme in her first complete Wagner ''Ring'' cycle, at the San Francisco Opera last summer. ''In life, she often seems so understated. Then she gets onstage, and some sort of primal creature takes over. She's an absolutely fearless singing actress for whom no challenge is too much.''
Ms. Stemme, speaking recently from a Berlin hotel between concert performances of Wagner's ''Walkure'' in Paris and ''Tannhauser'' in Berlin, said: ''I am the mother of three teenagers, so I had excellent material for researching Salome. Teenagers are still so innocent in many ways. Often they don't begin to realize the messages they are sending out.''
Ms. Stemme also handily delivers Strauss's ''voice of Isolde.'' Since tackling ''Tristan und Isolde'' in 2003, in the Glyndebourne Festival's first-ever Wagner production (preserved on an Opus Arte video), she has gradually emerged as today's pre-eminent Isolde (never a crowded field, to be sure). Her Isolde can also be heard on a 2005 EMI Classics recording with Placido Domingo as Tristan. Isolde is now on Ms. Stemme's itinerary at least once a year, and next season she will perform it at the Houston Grand Opera.
No one could be more surprised at all this than Ms. Stemme herself. ''When I was first asked if I'd ever consider singing Isolde,'' she recalled, ''I said, 'You must be joking.' ''
Ms. Stemme's journey to Isolde and Salome was long and circuitous. Growing up in Stockholm in a family of enthusiastic amateur musicians, she began piano lessons at 6 and later took up violin and viola. And with Scandinavia's mighty choral tradition, she could hardly avoid singing.
''Music was a big part of my life,'' she said. ''But there was no thought of a career. In Sweden, nobody is supposed to stick out from the crowd.''
America can perhaps claim some credit for nudging Ms. Stemme into the limelight. During a year as an exchange student at Langley High School in McLean, Va., where she joined the chorus, she began singing solos and winning awards.
After returning to Sweden, Ms. Stemme began studies in business administration and economics at the University of Stockholm. ''I wanted to become a normal person,'' she said. ''But I didn't quite succeed in that. At the same time, I was studying singing more and more, and beginning to sing and act in small venues. It became obvious where I really wanted to go.''
In her mid-20s, she left the university and directed all her energies toward singing, enrolling in a two-year program at the Stockholm Opera Studio. Struggling with her higher range, she trained as a mezzo-soprano and made her operatic debut as Cherubino in Mozart's ''Nozze di Figaro'' in Cortona, Italy, in 1989. But one astute vocal coach asked her to sing through some soprano arias from Puccini's ''Boheme'' and Wagner's ''Lohengrin,'' then urged her to switch vocal categories. In 1990, she was admitted to the University College of Opera in Stockholm, where she completed her studies in 1994.
While there, she scored minor roles with the Royal Swedish Opera, later graduating to larger assignments including Euridice in Gluck's ''Orfeo ed Euridice,'' Diana in Haydn's ''Fedelta Premiata'' and Rosalinde in Johann Strauss's ''Fledermaus,'' light lyric roles all but unthinkable for her today. She remains a company member and in 2006 was named Hovsangerska, or court singer, a recognition awarded by the Swedish monarchy.
Working in Stockholm allows Ms. Stemme precious time at home with her husband, the stage designer Bengt Gomer, and their three children. The company has also been a friendly proving ground for her new roles. She recently took on Puccini's ''Fanciulla del West'' there and will test-drive ''Turandot'' there next season.
Ms. Stemme's career went international in 1993, when she became a finalist in the Cardiff Singer of the World competition and a winner of Mr. Domingo's first Operalia competition. Mr. Domingo later invited her to join him in concerts in Paris and Munich.
In a video of the 1993 Cardiff finals, the 30-year-old Ms. Stemme, singing selections by Puccini, Debussy and Strauss, wields a supple, naturally dark voice that might well have been mistaken for a mezzo. Her top notes, already clarion, dispel such thoughts, though like a puppy with large paws, she has yet to grow into her generous vibrato.
''Those competitions opened the door to the opera world,'' Ms. Stemme said. ''I got an audition for the Vienna State Opera and was offered a contract right away. But I felt I wasn't really ready yet. My technique was not settled enough.'' Ioan Holender, then the company's director, ''was not amused,'' she added, ''but now we can laugh about it.'' Last month Ms. Stemme was awarded the prestigious title of Kammersangerin by the company.
''I knew it was the best thing for me to do,'' she said of initially passing up Vienna. ''I just tried to be true to myself. I'm always so sad to hear about young singers burning out early in their careers. Everyone is eager to succeed, but it doesn't happen overnight. You have to prepare for a very long time.''
Ms. Stemme instead spent four years in the resident ensemble of the humbler Cologne Opera. ''It let me develop more calmly, and also to raise a family,'' she said. ''At first I did only very lyric roles, like Pamina in 'Zauberflote' and the Countess in 'Figaro.' Then I jumped into a concert 'Butterfly' and did well enough that they asked me to do Mimi and Suor Angelica. Eventually I did Tosca, at the same time I started singing lyric Wagner like Elisabeth in 'Tannhauser' and my first and only Elsa in 'Lohengrin.' ''
Though German opera has since occupied most of Ms. Stemme's schedule, she deliberately keeps a handful of Italian roles in her repertory. She recently added Amelia in Verdi's ''Ballo in Maschera'' and Leonora in ''La Forza del Destino.''
Her first ''Aida'', from Zurich in 2006, is available on Bel Air DVDs. ''Today, that's the risk,'' Ms. Stemme said. ''Everything you do may be recorded for all eternity, even if it's not quite ripe yet.''
Ripe or not, Ms. Stemme's filmed Aida displays seamless legato line, impressively organic portamento and admirable Italian style and diction. These, fused with the inherent pliancy and plangency of her voice, make her a viable Verdian, though the glinting ''passage'' between her middle register and her top betrays her Wagnerian pedigree and leaves her just shy of being completely idiomatic.
''Italian opera requires a different approach, a different temperament, and I really want to find the color of it, which is a stretch for me,'' Ms. Stemme said. ''It helps the Wagnerian singing to do Italian repertoire.''
Ms. Stemme's capacious voice is clearly made for Wagner and Strauss. It is perhaps better described not as a standard-issue dramatic soprano but as a bionic lyric soprano with a brilliant top. Its natural warmth and lyricism, suggesting the lighter Wagnerian heroines like Sieglinde, Elsa and Eva, make its Brunnhilde-strength amplitude and intensity almost startling.
Ms. Stemme continues to go where her voice leads her, judiciously adding new roles to her already broad repertory. She is already knee-deep in new projects, the Stockholm ''Turandot,'' to be reprised in Zurich and at La Scala in Milan, and the ''Elektra'' for Vienna and the Met.
''For me it is business as usual,'' Ms. Stemme said. ''My way is to hurry slowly.''

HEADLINE: The Nation Needn't Fit Into Skinny Jeans

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. SHILLER. 
Robert J. Shiller is professor of economics and finance at Yale.

 BODY:
WHY is there such strong political support for fiscal austerity, for government cuts and layoffs, at a time of widespread unemployment?
Maybe it's because we have the wrong metaphor stuck in our minds, and it's framing policy choices in a misleading way.
Clearly, metaphors and other symbols carry real weight in our thinking, as has been shown by George Lakoff, a cognitive linguist at the University of California, Berkeley, and Mark Johnson, a philosopher at the University of Oregon. In their 1980 book, ''Metaphors We Live By,'' they argue, ''Our ordinary conceptual system, in terms of which we both think and act, is fundamentally metaphorical in nature.''
Our metaphors are like the icons on our computer screen, little pictures by which we condense complexities into manageable packets to refer to in our decision-making. Our brains may be hard-wired for them.
Consider our current thinking about taxes and government spending. We seem caught up in a ''family belt-tightening'' metaphor, in which the nation is a family that has outspent its income and is trying to get back in control. The family must cut profligate spending, save and pay down debts. It's a powerful thought, of course, because we know that mismanagement of household finances can lead to a family's ruin. 
But perhaps the most important lesson conveyed by the great economist John Maynard Keynes is that this metaphor, when applied to the national economy, is fundamentally misleading: what is smart for the family is not smart for society as a whole. This idea, sometimes known as the paradox of thrift, is that when we all tighten our belts at once, the economy is so weakened that we end up failing to save more, and instead are all worse off. When that happens, some collective action -- government stimulus -- is needed.
Unfortunately, econometric research can't prove definitively whether Keynes is right. That is because any rigorous, scientific, controlled experiment is impossible -- especially one involving a suitably large sample of whole nations. Hence, abstract theory, intuition and metaphors loom especially large in our thinking.
I have previously argued in this column that a different approach, a ''winter on the family farm'' metaphor, should be stressed in bad times. When winter comes, and there aren't the usual jobs in planting and harvesting, we should all keep busy anyway. We should demand that everyone help out with long-term projects on the farm, like fixing the barn, digging a well or building a fence. The farm requires that all members pay a sort of tax, by donating labor.
IN the early 1940s, William Salant, then a member of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's White House staff, and Paul Samuelson, then of M.I.T., developed a ''balanced-budget theorem.'' It asserts that if a country raises taxes and expenditures by the same amount in a time of high unemployment, and if monetary policy is accommodating, the national income grows by exactly the amount of the tax, so that after-tax income is unchanged. In other words, the ''balanced-budget multiplier'' equals one. Like the farm in winter, the nation -- through taxation -- can require full employment, and does not need to go into debt to stimulate the economy.
Consider some measures proposed in France by its new president, Francois Hollande. He said during his campaign that he wanted to deal with his nation's high unemployment rate, which has hit 10 percent, by hiring 60,000 teachers and to raise taxes by putting a 75 percent tax rate on incomes of more than a million euros.
If that higher tax, combined with the additional tax revenue from the new teachers, matched the increase in expenditures, the balanced-budget theorem would apply, causing a one-to-one effect on the economy. (The effect might be even greater than one to one, given that the tax increases would focus on high-income people, and the new teachers would be more likely to spend their money immediately.)
Surprisingly, Mr. Hollande's policy has been criticized as profligate. But if his tax increases matched the cost of the teachers, there would be no increase in the French national debt. Instead, people who are now idle would have jobs, and young people would receive a better education.
Another criticism has been that the French government is already too large. General government final consumption expenditure, the actual amount that national and local governments spend on goods and services, was 25 percent of France's gross domestic product in 2010, much larger than the 17 percent in the United States. And if a balanced-budget stimulus raised French G.D.P. by 5 percent, the theorem implies that the government would temporarily account for 29 percent of G.D.P. [(25 + 5)/(100 + 5) = 29 percent].
But what would be wrong with that, on a temporary basis? Government stimulus does not mean government control of our lives, as some seem to believe. Remember that when a central government provides funds for teachers, it doesn't need to take control of their hiring and supervision, which can be delegated broadly to all the separate communities and schools, and parents can be given some choice of teachers.
Fiscal stimulus is often called ineffective for relatively open economies because it can ''leak'' to other nations. France has such an economy. It is relatively small when compared with that of the surrounding European Union, and its imports account for 28 percent of G.D.P. If France tried to stimulate its economy by cutting taxes, leaving its expenditures constant and thus raising the national debt, leakage would occur because its people would spend a good deal of that money abroad. At least in part, the government would be stimulating other countries' economies instead.
But if France followed a balanced-budget stimulus strategy, there should be no such leaks, according to the theory of Mr. Salant and Professor Samuelson. If the government spent the stimulus money directly on hiring teachers, and not at all on imports, it would create one more euro of G.D.P. for every euro it spent. And there should be no change in the French people's own expenditures, whether on imports or domestic items, because after-tax income would be unchanged.
The April 2012 World Economic Outlook from the International Monetary Fund endorsed balanced-budget stimulus, but, beyond this, there is hardly ever any mention of it these days. The concept of Mr. Salant and Professor Samuelson remains, unfortunately, almost forgotten. And the family belt-tightening image continues to dominate public discussion worldwide, making the public-stimulus debate largely off-center and irrelevant.
Clearly, if we want to garner public support for some much-needed balanced-budget stimulus, we have to work on our metaphors.

HEADLINE: Cramming for Degrees in Hybrids

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
LIKE many college students, Katherine Bovee, a master's degree candidate at Ohio State University in Columbus, struggled to find a focus for her undergraduate studies. Wanting to sample a broad range of possibilities, she enrolled in a mechanical engineering program.
As of her junior year she still hadn't found the direction she was looking for, but things began to click when she signed up for courses in thermodynamics and internal combustion engines. Through her professor, Dr. Yann Guezennec of Ohio State's Center for Automotive Research, Ms. Bovee connected with the team working on the university's entry in EcoCAR, a green-technology competition conducted by the Energy Department and General Motors.
Solving real-world problems and working directly with an automaker proved so valuable that Ms. Bovee, 24, went on to join the EcoCAR 2 program, a three-year competition that aims to reduce the fuel consumption and tailpipe emissions of Chevrolet Malibus. Judging of the first year's work-- the design and simulation phase -- done by the 15 participating teams began Friday in Los Angeles and runs through Wednesday.
In this project -- Ohio State's entry will use a sophisticated plug-in hybrid architecture -- Ms. Bovee is concentrating on the systems that distribute energy from the vehicle's battery. 
''Everything I'm doing now is based on what's in the automotive industry,'' said Ms. Bovee, who received a research fellowship from the National Science Foundation, which she is using to study the control systems in hybrids.
''They're always amazed at the work we're doing, how we can build a car in three years,'' she said of the auto company engineers she had been working with.
Ms. Bovee's shift in the emphasis of her studies, from mechanical to other engineering disciplines, mirrors changes under way not just in the auto industry but in the classes of engineers graduating from universities. As automakers increase their efforts to design vehicles that are more fuel-efficient and friendlier to the environment, engineering programs are likewise adapting their curriculums, preparing students to build vehicles increasingly powered by batteries and managed by computers.
Brian L. Yoder, a director at the American Society for Engineering Education, said that ''mechanical engineering has come to be viewed as the general engineering degree,'' while electrical engineering degrees were considered more specialized and less susceptible to ''offshoring.'' In other words, electrical engineering jobs are not as likely to be outsourced to engineers overseas.
To design hybrids, plug-in hybrids and pure-electric vehicles, students need a deep understanding of the battery technologies, computer controls and diagnostic programs that form the interconnected systems of modern vehicles. This imposes a collaborative approach on the development process, requiring engineers to work in groups and consider the entire vehicle, not just its individual components.
The growing complexity of these vehicles is one reason automakers, especially domestic brands that reorganized during the recession, are eager to work closely with universities to augment their downsized research and development departments. Instead of just donating money or parts to universities, automakers are expanding internships and other partnerships to help find students capable of creating autos that use alternative powertrains.
''G.M. needs to be much more externally focused because technology is going to move so rapidly that we need to gather new innovations from anybody and everybody,'' said Thomas Stephens, who recently retired as chief technology officer of G.M., where he helped coordinate the company's alliances with universities. ''To compete, you're going to have to have this innovation and you're not going to be able to do it all yourself.''
G.M. is a lead sponsor of the EcoCAR 2 program, which is also supported by an array of industry suppliers. But automakers like Honda and Ford, as well as industry stalwarts like Allison, Cummins and Delphi, are also working with universities, providing parts to students involved in experimental programs and offering internships for engineers who may later become employees.
''We consider our competitions to be the minor leagues for the auto industry,'' said Kristen De La Rosa of the Argonne National Laboratory, who directs the EcoCAR program as part of the Energy Department's Advanced Vehicle Technology Competitions. ''It's absolutely about workplace development and developing the next generation of automotive engineers.''
The intersection of academia, automakers and the government is paying dividends, most notably for students. G.M. and other car companies hire about 80 percent of their interns because they are familiar with their development process and have shown they can work in groups, a critical skill in developing today's highly complex vehicles.
Their course work, too, most likely included a multidisciplinary focus on next-generation vehicles. At Ohio State, courses are intended to push electrical engineers to know more about thermodynamics and mechanical engineers to know more about electrical engineering. Every automotive engineering course at the University of Michigan has been modified to include the electrification of the vehicle, even classes on crash tests. The university has also added new courses on energy systems.
''I want to have every electrical engineer comfortable in the machine shop and every mechanical engineer comfortable in the electrical lab,'' said Giorgio Rizzoni, director of the Center for Automotive Research at Ohio State. ''You need people who know so many things. Our observation is, the auto industry likes to hire people with an advanced degree who have been exposed to a broad level of disciplines.''
Despite the complexity of blending mechanical, electrical and chemical engineering with computers and other technologies, students are rising to the academic challenge. Schools are finding that prospective engineers arrive with an interest in hybrids and other advanced cars, viewing them less as outliers and more as the way all vehicles will look in the future.
''A lot of the undergraduates now were in elementary school when the Prius came out, so they've always lived with them,'' said Gregory Shaver, an associate professor of mechanical engineering at Purdue University in Indiana. ''They've grown up with alternative fuels.''
Purdue offers engineering candidates an opportunity to work on a larger scale. The university received a $1 million Graduate Automotive Technology Education federal grant, which it is using to develop more efficient medium- and heavy-duty trucks.
While established automakers and parts suppliers remain favored destinations, a growing number of students are forgoing a bigger paycheck and more job security and going to work for start-ups and smaller companies, or in developing countries, where they can have greater influence, according to Margaret Wooldridge, director of the Automotive Engineering Program at the University of Michigan.
''There are personalities that don't want to go to a big, old stable company,'' Ms. Wooldridge said. ''What's different now is the change-the-world attitude. They're very, very genuine and unusually willing to sacrifice.''

LENGTH: 623 words

HEADLINE: Cardio, Cooking and Choir

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
Dennis M. Walcott recently completed his first year as chancellor of New York City's Department of Education: He is responsible for 1.1 million students at some 1,700 schools, and says he often wears his ''chancellor hat'' at weekend events. Otherwise, Mr. Walcott, 60, devotes his Sundays to exercise (he ran in the New York City Marathon last year), singing in his church choir and cooking. He and his wife, Denise, 61, live in a 1930s brick Tudor in Cambria Heights, the Queens neighborhood where he grew up. They have four children, Dejeanne, Dana, Shatisha and Timmy, and two grandsons, Justin and Gavin. 
RISE AND RUN I wake up around 6, or maybe 6:15 on Sundays, about half an hour later than I normally get up. I go straight for a run, first thing. I drive to the Cross Island Y.M.C.A., park the car and go for a five-mile run up through Alley Pond Park, which is very woodsy. As the weather gets warmer, I up it to seven or eight miles. The two sides of my brain have different answers on whether I'll run another marathon: the logical side says no, but the macho, competitive side says to run it again so I can beat last year's time. After the run, I do a quick workout at the gym, lifting weights.
CHURCH AND CHOIR I go back home, fix some oatmeal and then change and get ready for church. I don't drink coffee; I think I've had a half a cup in my life. And I only drink tea when I'm sick. We attend St. Alban the Martyr, an Episcopal church, and I guess it was three or four years ago that we decided to join the choir. I like to challenge myself to do new or different things I'm not that comfortable with. I wear a choir robe and stand in the back row with the basses.
HOME FOR WAFFLES Normally after church we'll go home and I make waffles with turkey kielbasa. I use nonsweetened soy milk and sugar-free syrup for the waffles. I don't bother reading the packaging of the turkey kielbasa because I don't want to drive myself crazy. It's probably 100 percent fat.
PICK A CAR You can measure which hat I'm wearing on the weekend by which car I'm driving. For personal things, like going to church and the Y, I drive my own car. It's a maroon Honda. If I have an event to attend, I drive my Department of Education car, a black Taurus.
TIME FOR GRANDSONS I like to spend some of the afternoon hanging with my grandsons. They live in Jamaica, so if the weather's nice, I'll ride my bike over there. Or they come to our house, and we'll go over and play in the park.
RELAXING AT HOME But around 4, I get into my Sunday at-home routine, just relaxing around the house, and during football season we watch the games: My wife is into football big time. She can dissect it. I used to play in an adult league on Staten Island until around 1980, when our first daughter was born; I was 35 pounds heavier then, a linebacker for the Buffalo Soldiers.
CLEANING AND COOKING We'll have the TV on, or listen to the radio, and we clean the house. I'm very domesticated: I can do everything except sew. On Saturdays, I go grocery shopping. I can tell you all the price points. My Sunday cooking routine is to make two or three different meals, one for Sunday night and the rest for during the week. I'll do a fish, and baked chicken, and turkey meatloaf makes a great office lunch during the week. I'm economical. We don't have a dishwasher; we have basic cable, and if it was up to me, I'd still have a rotary-dial phone.
TV AND A SHAKE We'll watch ''60 Minutes'' and maybe the old ''Law and Order'' reruns on Channel 9, but I can't think of any special Sunday night shows that we watch. Around 8 or so I'll make a soy milk shake with fruit and honey. We don't really go out that much. We can go a couple of years without getting ourselves out to a movie!

HEADLINE: The Vanishing Valley

BYLINE: By KEN and MELANIE LIGHT. 
Ken Light is a social documentary photographer and a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, Graduate School of Journalism. Melanie Light is a writer and West Coast editor for La Lettre de la Photographie. Their latest book is ''Valley of Shadows and Dreams.''

 BODY:
For five years, we roamed the Great Central Valley, the agricultural center of California. It is a dream for a photographer and a writer -- an amazing mix of startling light, and a kaleidoscope of faces and stories. Like so many of our fellow Californians, we hadn't really thought about the communities and people that provide our food, or the labor that has made the state what it is. 
The valley supplies half of the fruits and vegetables for the United States. Everywhere we turned, people's stories pulled us in deeper, and their circumstances seemed to get more and more desperate the longer we worked there. We followed the valley's workers as they stood in a food line in Mendota, danced in Tulare, and sailed out across the San Joaquin River on a rope swing. They are hardworking people, fighting to preserve their livelihoods and traditions.
We saw this fruit bowl of America being planted with its final crop of ticky-tacky cookie-cutter houses and gated communities with homes overlooking artificial lakes. How were these projects approved during a severe drought (which ended in March 2011) and against the growers' constant requests for more water, more water, and more water? During the years of easy credit, even unskilled laborers in the region were moving into homeownership. After the bust, new homes were left to deteriorate while local residents struggled to find housing in trailers, apartments and even cars.
Humans were not the only ones struggling for a home. The valley is one of the greatest North American flyways for millions of migrating birds, and their nesting ground has been stripped down to contain almost unimaginably big fields of crops that don't accommodate animal life. The use of pesticides on this scale was mind-boggling. The Central Valley has provided the dream for many, but it is also deeply shadowed.
The issues in the valley are the global challenges of our generation: water, land use, population, growing economic disparity.

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: In the Central Valley of California, booming housing developments, in places like Stanislaus and Tulare Counties, near Interstate 5, are spreading across once rich agricultural land. How will this development affect the workers, the air and water, the land and the people of California, not to mention the global food markets?
 While some farmworkers do attain a working-class way of life or obtain citizenship, getting there is a formidable uphill trek. Work, when they can get it, is backbreaking and exploitative. Many farm workers and their families, like Yolanda Prada and her son Mark Anthony in Mendota, Calif., live in dilapidated trailer parks.

HEADLINE: A Half-Century-Old Road to Today

BYLINE: By NEIL GENZLINGER

 BODY:
IF there is such a thing as a visionary time capsule, the newly released boxed set of ''Route 66'' is it. Watch these discs (from Shout! Factory) and you are transported back to a version of the United States that was still basking in postwar success, a country rich in blue-collar jobs and industrial production and somewhat oblivious to its problems. But while enjoying that return to America as it was, you may also be struck by how often this half-century-old black-and-white television series tackled issues that seem very 21st century.
''Route 66,'' which ran from 1960 to 1964 on CBS, was an earnest, ambitious serial about two young men on a random journey across North America in a Corvette. It was shot on location, something hard to imagine given the bulkiness of equipment at the time. Viewed today, a scene on a shrimp boat in New Orleans or at the half-built Glen Canyon Dam in Arizona prompts admiration for the producers, camera operators, electricians and others who made the shots feasible.
It was seat-of-the-pants television, demanding for everyone. 
''You were always behind schedule, working 14, 15, 16 hours a day,'' recalled George Maharis, who starred with Martin Milner in the initial seasons. ''But it was fun. It was like being a pioneer, going over the mountains.''
There was pioneering in the structure of the show as well, and in its scripts. The series was created by Herbert B. Leonard and Stirling Silliphant, who earlier had combined on ''Naked City,'' and they seemed intent on shining a light into every out-of-the-mainstream corner of America.
Mr. Maharis played Buz Murdock and Mr. Milner was Tod Stiles, friends who embark on a cross-country odyssey after Tod inherits the Corvette. They are among the least fleshed-out lead characters in television history, jarringly so by standards today, when Tony Soprano has inspired entire books. Buz was a hard-slugging guy from New York (not unlike Mr. Maharis himself), and Tod seemed rather preppy, but their main purpose each week was usually to get the show, literally and figuratively, to a place where it could tell a story about someone else.
And what stories they were. This was an era when television hadn't yet settled into the pattern of silly sitcoms and not-too-taxing dramas that would define it for decades. A TV script -- Mr. Silliphant, who died in 1996, wrote many for ''Route 66'' -- could still aspire to be literature. That made for some clunkiness. Writers hadn't fully grasped that television shows were not stage plays. But even at its most awkward, ''Route 66'' reached high.
Take, for instance, this slice of dialogue from a 1962 episode called ''Aren't You Surprised to See Me?'' A religious nut takes Buz hostage in Dallas and threatens to kill him if the city's population fails to follow the Ten Commandments for the next 24 hours. The man (played by David Wayne) explains himself in a dizzying monologue that foreshadows both the anti-establishment mood of the Vietnam era and the current laments of the religious right.
''Drop the scales from your eyes,'' he tells Buz. ''Consider the present society of the world. Are we still individuals, or are we prisoners of bureaucracy? Insects in vast, grinding systems, carrying out antlike, apparently rational actions with no human idea of the ends they serve? Ours is no longer a guilt culture in which control of wrongdoing is self-imposed by conscience. Instead we have a shame culture, one in which acts are judged good or evil solely on the basis of whether one is caught or not, in which the worst punishment is public humiliation, not private guilt. Ours is a world, Murdock, in which conscious morality is treated with derision and reason with scorn. This is an age which no longer waits patiently through this lifetime for the rewards in the next, but instead mills anxiously about overindulging, driven to cheat, driven to crime. So I have killed six men.
''Well, let me tell you that each time, I died with them. Each time I killed myself, too. So what is that insignificant sacrifice against the gigantic moral collapse of the world?''
And that's just an excerpt.
If that character sounds as if he could be any of today's unbalanced zealots with a gun, he is not alone. The series was full of people and plot lines that would fit easily in 2012.
Those doomsday preppers who have been the subject of several reality shows would have had a lot to talk about with the central character in ''A Fury Slinging Flames,'' a 1960 episode in which a physicist expecting a New Year's Day nuclear attack takes shelter in the Carlsbad Caverns with a group of followers. ''Eleven, the Hard Way'' (1961), about a small town that sends a gambler to Reno to try to win it a return to prosperity after the local mine goes bust, seems like a metaphor for all those states that hope a casino economy can replace their lost manufacturing revenue. ''City of Wheels'' (1962), about an embittered veteran in a wheelchair, feels like a precursor to any of the post-traumatic stress disorder plots that are so common in television drama today.
Mr. Maharis, now in his 80s, cited ''City of Wheels'' as among his favorites. In it, he plunges into a pool to stop a suicide. Another episode that also involved an icy dip, ''Even Stones Have Eyes'' from late in Season 2, may be his least favorite, not because of the story but because of the aftermath. The script called for him to dive into a pond to rescue a blind woman.
''The water was like 40 degrees,'' he recalled in a telephone interview from his home in Los Angeles. ''They couldn't get my clothes on over the wet suit.'' So he went without the wet suit.
''It was 4 in the morning,'' he said. ''It was freezing. My jacket froze on me. They had to pour hot water on me; you can see it in the shot, the steam rising.''
He became thoroughly ill, and soon he found himself with hepatitis (later linked to a B12 shot, Mr. Maharis said). Though he continued to appear into Season 3, he said the lingering illness ultimately knocked him out of the series. Mr. Milner went on alone for a time, then acquired a new partner played by Glenn Corbett, but the show was never quite as strong.
''If I had it to do all over again, the only thing I'd change would be getting that bug,'' Mr. Maharis said. Among the pleasures, he said, was working with numerous actors who would go on to have substantial careers. The doomsday character in Carlsbad Caverns was played by Leslie Nielsen, later so successful in, among other things, the ''Naked Gun'' movies. That gambler sent to Reno carrying his town's hopes? Walter Matthau.
Martin Sheen, Barbara Eden, Robert Redford, Robert Duvall, Julie Newmar and other now familiar names also make appearances. Most had yet to achieve fame, but as its reputation grew the series was able to attract a different order of star. ''Lizard's Leg and Owlet's Wing,'' from 1962, features the horror greats Peter Lorre, Lon Chaney and Boris Karloff as themselves.
Mr. Milner, 80, went on to roles in ''Adam-12'' and many other shows. (He had a stroke a few years ago, acquaintances said.)
The other star of the series was the Corvette, which was actually a series of Corvettes. Though in references to the series the car has been described as red, Mr. Maharis said that was never the case.
He recounted how he ended up with a nice perk through a bit of subterfuge. ''I said to them, 'Listen, I would like to bring my car on location with us; is that O.K.?' And they said, 'What are you driving?' And I said, 'A Ford Thunderbird.' ''
They gave him his own Corvette.

HEADLINE: A Man Who Creates Coincidences

BYLINE: By ZACH BARON

 BODY:
ON a recent Saturday afternoon in New York, Diplo, the Los Angeles D.J. and producer, was in a bar on the top floor of the Standard hotel, reminiscing about being arrested. He had been invited to New York last year to work with Beyonce. The first day had gone well.
But that night, ''I got in a fight here,'' he said, gesturing at the bar. ''I got arrested, and I think they kind of lost interest in me or something, because I didn't show up for the second day of the sessions.''
While he was in jail, a snowstorm kept judges from coming to work the next day, which meant he couldn't get out. ''My bags were just in my room at the Gansevoort for, like, three days,'' Diplo said. ''They thought I got kidnapped.'' 
This visit was shaping up to be smoother. In a few hours, Milk Studios was scheduled to hold a party for a new book of photographs by Shane McCauley, ''128 Beats per Minute: Diplo's Visual Guide to Music, Culture and Everything in Between'' (Universe/Rizzoli). After that there was an after-party, back at the Standard, some studio sessions -- a photo he posted to Twitter late Sunday night showed him posing with Kanye West, the Harlem rapper ASAP Rocky and others -- and on Monday, a plane to Las Vegas, where he has a weekly residency at the club XS.
Few currently working in pop music bridges high and low, mainstream and underground, quite like Diplo. He's a controversial figure who has emerged in the last few years as one of the most dynamic forces in an unsettled industry. The position he's carved out is unconventional but prescient -- instructive, even. He is less an artist or a producer than a negotiator, a collaborator, a generator of interesting coincidences.
In a pop music landscape in which old benchmarks like record sales matter less than they once did, successful artists have had to learn and employ a whole new set of tools. They've had to become ubiquitous, online and in real life, occupying new platforms the moment they arrive. They play shows constantly. They are brands -- spokesmen, tastemakers, fashion plates -- as much as they are performers.
Diplo, more than almost anyone else, appears to have assimilated these lessons. ''Climax,'' the ethereal single he produced for Usher, is in the Top 20 in the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Last year, he was nominated for a Grammy for his work on Chris Brown's ''Look at Me Now.'' Major Lazer, Diplo's dance hall duo with the London producer Switch, spent two weeks in April touring Europe. ''Express Yourself'' (Mad Decent), a solo EP, is set for digital release on June 12. Somewhere in there, Diplo said, he does ''about 300'' live D.J. sets a year. Last week he announced plans to tour Canada by train.
But Diplo is not just a musician. He runs his own label, Mad Decent, and shelters a host of promising artists under that umbrella. He has deals with Blackberry, Ax and Red Bull. He has regular radio shows on Sirius XM and the BBC. Few artists manage to be so present in so many different worlds. There was a moment during the 2010 Blackberry ad campaign Diplo starred in that his ubiquity was so total that even he had to marvel at it.
''I was in the World Series -- it was my face in between commercial breaks,'' he said. ''I could just lie and say it's all part of my whole ploy of just making as much nonsense as possible. Doing that, going from Beyonce to jail to Blackberry to whatever.''
Born Thomas Wesley Pentz, Diplo, 33, began his career putting on parties in Philadelphia in the early part of the last decade, free-for-alls that mixed genres like hip-hop, pop and dance music. Soon he began collaborating with an artist who called herself M.I.A. The partnership ended up making both of them famous: ''Paper Planes,'' the deceptively winsome track they produced for M.I.A.'s second album, ''Kala,'' in 2007, sold more than three million copies and was nominated for a record-of-the-year Grammy.
''Paper Planes,'' with its soft-hard interpolation of an airy Clash sample and a chorus backed by gunshots, became a calling card, reaching more established stars like Usher, who identified Diplo as a person who could wed traditional commercial sounds and something, as Usher put it, more ''alternative.''
After trips to Coachella and the dance music center Ibiza, Spain, ''I was really infatuated with the idea of kind of bridging the gap between soulful music and indie music,'' Usher said. ''And I wanted to work with a producer that I felt like would understand that.''
''Climax,'' one of the songs that resulted from their sessions together, was written in only an hour, Usher said. But with its mournful chord progression, squawky bursts of electronics and a bridge arranged by the composer Nico Muhly, ''Climax'' is a departure for Usher -- it's all tension and no release, the rare pop song that manifests its power through how much it holds back.
''To put those kinds of things together and then make him feel comfortable to write a record like he did, and make it so it's an Usher record, I don't think Swedish House Mafia or someone else could do that,'' Diplo said, referring to the powerhouse dance music act.
Leah Whisler, an editor who worked on ''128 Beats per Minute'' for Universe/Rizzoli, said ''he's doing something interesting musically.'' But the press, she added, was equally interested in Diplo's ''role as a cultural curator.''
''128 Beats per Minute'' illustrates the mechanics of Diplo's global hustle: there are photos of the producer in Jamaica with the dance hall star Busy Signal, in Mexico with the new-school cumbia artist Toy Selectah, and in Britain with the dub king Lee ''Scratch'' Perry. ''Look at Me Now,'' the song Diplo produced last year for Chris Brown, marries Dutch house music and hip-hop; ''Express Yourself,'' from Diplo's coming solo EP, pulls textures from dubstep and features the New Orleans bounce artist Nicky da B. Future projects include work with Snoop Dogg on his new album and with the rising rapper Azealia Banks on hers.
Diplo is, in other words, an intermediary: someone who is comfortable everywhere, whose primary skill is his ability to translate -- on Twitter, where he has more than 500,000 followers; in marketing campaigns, where his good looks help sell products -- between far-flung musical subgenres and Top 40. He is valued by the industry precisely for the way in which he manages to keep a measure of distance from it.
Diplo ''is in that fortunate place where he can do a D.J. party literally at a kid's apartment building,'' said his manager, Kevin Kusatsu. ''And then he could go be the main support for Tiesto at his biggest show ever.''
Diplo is a savant at maintaining a presence in worlds glamorous and otherwise. In February, he flew from a small club tour in Florida with the Brooklyn noise-pop duo Sleigh Bells to attend the Grammys in Los Angeles, then immediately flew back.
''To be honest, I'd rather go to see a Clippers game at the Staples Center than the Grammys,'' he said. ''I'm not in that world of really winning a Grammy. I don't care about it. I don't even know where I'd put it.''
Success has been a mixed blessing for Diplo, whose work has depended on making connections between racially and economically diverse groups of artists and consumers ever since the release of his first mixtapes, ''Favela on Blast,'' a collection of baile funk and Carioca sounds he compiled while on a trip to Brazil. While many of Diplo's collaborators remain relatively unknown, he's grown more visible, giving rise to awkward asymmetries.
Some detractors, like Venus X, a member of the New York D.J. collective GHE20 G0TH1K, have criticized Diplo for appropriating the work of others without giving proper credit. Because relatively few listeners are as well versed in global dance music as Diplo is, ''they don't know that he's just recreating things that exist already,'' she said. Instead, she added, ''Diplo's making himself the middleman.''
Diplo is used to the sentiment. ''I'm pretty and I'm in Blackberry ads,'' he said. ''Because of that stuff, I'm always going to be an easy target.''
He added: ''Everything I do I try to be fair'' when it comes to the foreign or lesser-known artists he works with and whose music he often helps package for bigger American markets, whether on his label or in his production work. ''But I can't always shine the light on them as much as the light's being shined on me.''
Later, he donned an electric blue blazer for the ''128 Beats per Minute'' party. His 1 1/2-year-old son, Lockett, had made the trip to New York with his mother, Kathryn, with whom Diplo lives in Los Angeles, and was sleeping peacefully on a nearby windowsill. Diplo crouched down for a photo with his son, throwing up a peace sign.
The next day was Easter Sunday, and he'd asked his manager to locate some eggs so he and Lockett could have a hunt. Nearby, two women danced to a remix of Rihanna's ''Birthday Cake'' in front of a giant photo of a block party his label had held in Philadelphia.
''In five years, something else will be influential,'' he said, gesturing at the photo. ''So I'm lucky that we have that documented. Because we're going to be forgotten, too.''

HEADLINE: Hurry if You Want a Pool

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

 BODY:
IF you're late to book your country house in Litchfield County this summer, do not despair. There are still plenty of houses available. Just don't expect a place with a pool -- most in Litchfield have already been snapped up.
Agents throughout the bucolic northwest corner say that summer rentals have been moving at a steady pace. But because so many more homeowners are offering their houses for all or part of the season, supply remains plentiful in many towns. 
''Inventory has been pretty strong,'' said Chris Garrity, an agent in the Sharon office of David Bain Real Estate, ''and that's a reflection of the perennial individuals who rent out their homes, combined with the fact that more people, given the economic times, are considering renting a house that they're not using.''
As in years past, many houses will not find tenants this summer, says Roger Saucy, an agent with Klemm Real Estate, in Washington Depot. ''The reason is, people want a pool or waterfront,'' he explained. ''Properties without either aren't popular.''
The typical summer renter, agents say, is a family from New York City with younger children. On their list of must-haves are at least four bedrooms, a dazzling kitchen, air-conditioning and that all-important pool. The most impressive properties are typically reserved for the season (Memorial Day to Labor Day) by mid-March.
Season-long rates for a house with a pool or on the waterfront usually range from $30,000 to $50,000, though a few trophy properties can bring as much as $100,000.
By this time of year, rates are often more negotiable, as property owners who have given up on finding a renter for the season may be eager to fill the house at least for July, August or both months.
''There's usually a bit of a flurry of shorter-term rentals as we get toward June,'' Mr. Saucy said.
The economy-driven increase in the number of available rental properties in recent years means more intense competition for some longtime landlords. ''Last year, our house just sat there empty for the month of August, which really shocked us,'' said Gary Gunas, a former producer of Broadway shows (''The Who's Tommy,'' ''Jekyll & Hyde'') and the owner of a home in Sharon.
Since retiring and moving to London 10 years ago, Mr. Gunas has solicited renters for his country house year-round. A renovated colonial, it is artfully furnished with antiques, buffered by 30 wooded acres and, most important, has a heated saltwater pool.
Mr. Gunas says the reliably plugged-in fellow who takes care of his lawn alerted him that a lot more property owners in the area are trying to rent their homes for at least half the summer. But this year, at least, he's all set: the Bain agency found him a season-long renter in February.
Heather Jurewicz, another homeowner, says she lowered the rate by about 10 percent on her rental property in Sharon this summer. Earlier in the process, before their listing on HomeAway.com yielded any renters, she and her husband, Tony, had been a little nervous. The house, a former mill alongside a brook, is also now fully leased, to two different renters, through the end of September. The couple, who live in Scottsdale, Ariz., bought the property five years ago with the intention of spending their summers there when they retire.
''When we saw it, we decided we had to do what it takes to get it,'' said Ms. Jurewicz. ''And what it takes is to rent it out to other people right now.''
Some areas of Litchfield have fewer rentals than others. In Norfolk, home to the Yale Summer School of Music, ''you would be hard-pressed right now to find anything,'' says Tom McGowan, of Elyse Harney Real Estate. ''It's hard to get into this town. There are fewer people who aren't using their houses during the summer.''
But closer to New York, in the Washington-Roxbury-Kent area, inventory is still ''very high,'' according to Stacey Matthews, with William Raveis Real Estate. Nearly all her season-long rentals are gone, but Ms. Matthews still has one house with a pool left for the month of July. A converted barn in Washington, the house is listed for $15,000.
Some of her clients would prefer to sell their homes, but either can't or won't until the market improves, and are renting in the meantime. Other people ''who never thought about renting before are now thinking, 'Wow, we can get some extra income,' '' Ms. Matthews said.
In Lakeville, a section of Salisbury, Rebecca Ward, another agent with Klemm, says she has rented several pool-equipped homes for the season -- more than last year, and enough to give her reason to believe that city dwellers who have been putting off buying second homes because of the poor economy may be growing impatient. Shoppers often use summer rentals to try out an area before settling on where to buy.
Leslie Bell, a rental specialist in the Salisbury office of Elyse Harney, says she, too, has been busier this year than last. Recently, one renter had to back out of a summer-long deal for a four-bedroom house with a pool. Within a few days, someone else signed for the $50,000 rental.
A figure like that causes other stay-at-home property owners to wonder whether they're foolishly missing out. As Ms. Bell put it, ''I have had the conversation very often: 'What if I put in a pool? How much can I get?' ''

HEADLINE: Navigating New Trenches After a Breakup

BYLINE: By KATE McGOVERN. 
Kate McGovern is a writer in Cambridge, Mass.

 BODY:
SOME years ago, when I was living in Britain, I received an e-mail from a college friend who had recently announced her first pregnancy. ''We have become good friends with a black/white couple,'' she wrote. ''They have a precious baby boy -- you and Dan are going to have the cutest kids!''
Yes, Daniel was black and I was white -- a British Jamaican and an American half-Jew, respectively -- and yes, I suspected that we would have cute kids. But her well-intentioned e-mail made me roll my eyes. It was hard to imagine commenting to a white couple that their future children would be attractive simply because you'd seen some other white parents with a good-looking child.
Now that Daniel and I have broken up, no one tells me how cute my kids are going to be anymore. To be fair, that's probably because I'm 30 and single again and my friends are trying to be sensitive by not talking about my future children at all. But to me, this is all part of a strange new landscape I am navigating, as I renegotiate both my singleness and my whiteness. 
O.K., let's not mince words. Whiteness is indelible. With and without Daniel, my skin color has allowed me countless minuscule and immense privileges, most of which I don't even notice unless I choose to.
But when I fell in love with Daniel, my whiteness no longer told the whole story. With Daniel, I was white as ever, but I was also part of a unit that was half white and half black. Coming out of that, I've learned, is complicated.
Daniel and I were one of those couples that made a good story. We met in New York. I was living there when he came for a week to see a mutual friend. There was a dinner party; we locked eyes and ignored everyone else in the room for the rest of the evening.
A few days after Daniel returned to Britain, I stood in front of the mirror in my apartment in Queens and said out loud to my reflection, by way of trying to convince myself not to e-mail him -- ''What are you going to do, move to England?''
I e-mailed him. Seventeen months later, I moved to England.
And then, three years after that, I came home to Boston for what I expected would be a monthlong visit, and he called me on Skype and told me it was over.
There had been no warning, no gradual deterioration. Not two months earlier, we had spent more than $1,000 on my new spousal visa. We had been through trying times -- the trans-Atlantic distance, a long stretch of unemployment and, most devastatingly, the sudden death of his mother -- and through it all, we'd been solid. But now he wanted out.
He shipped my things. I got a job, an apartment and carried on with my life -- broken in strange places, but functional.
At the end of a serious relationship, you are left feeling somewhat flummoxed by who you are on your own. I missed small and large things: long drives through the English countryside, damp summer afternoons at the pub. I missed cooking Jamaican rice and peas with Daniel every Sunday, the smell of scallions and red chile peppers and crushed garlic sizzling in ground nut oil.
I missed my best friend. I'd lost my other half, my daily source of raucous laughter. I was without the man I'd moved across an ocean to wake up next to, the man I believed would be the father of my children.
And for us, race was part and parcel of all of those things. Daniel and I talked about race a lot. Some of our friends, other mixed-race couples, never really acknowledged their differences: they chose the path of ''colorblindness,'' whatever that means. This approach wasn't for us. Daniel often joked that if our children came out of the womb without Afros, he was putting them back. His blackness mattered to him and was a source of pride and power; it was a cornerstone of his identity. If I failed to see that, I failed to see him.
When Daniel and I talked about our future, our eventual children were ever-present. Peggy Orenstein once wrote that when she was pregnant, she imagined that as the woman in the relationship, she would be in charge of talking to her daughter about gender, and that her Japanese-American husband, as the person of color, would be in charge of race. She learned that this was not the case: they were both responsible for nurturing their daughter's gendered and racial identities.
Becoming the kind of white woman who was equipped to do that, who was able to be a valuable partner to a black man and eventually a strong parent to black children, required not only learning how to respond effectively to racial bias, but also learning to accept that my loved ones would inevitably experience the world in ways I'd never fully understand. This was an active, continuing process: love isn't enough. I was working on it. Working on it became part of who I was.
So we talked about race a lot. We talked about it when a pair of cops stopped to interrogate Daniel about what he was doing in front of our London flat one night as he put my empty suitcase in the backyard shed. We talked about it when a woman at the gym asked about the ''colored man'' I worked out with. And we talked about it when it was reported that Oxford had accepted just one British Caribbean undergraduate for the 2009 incoming class. These conversations came up as we cooked, as we rode the Tube, as we lay in bed. They were part of our daily life; they mattered to us both.
I envisioned us navigating those trenches forever. But then we broke up, and I found myself wondering if I was the same kind of white person I'd been before.
Of course, in many ways I was. Daniel didn't teach me that race matters, nor was that his job. I was raised to think critically about such things, and my professional life working in schools furthered my understanding of the intractable nature of institutionalized racism. Migrating among a nearly all-black school in Harlem and nearly all-white schools elsewhere in Manhattan, I saw the grossly different daily lives of children who lived blocks from one another. I already knew that wrestling with the racial realities of this country, with what it means to bear privilege and in doing so inevitably inflict damage on those who don't, is a lifelong, messy process.
But regardless of my relative awareness of the racist structures I lived within, it was hard for me -- it's hard for white people, period -- to feel racism personally. Racism can matter to us, make us angry, but it usually isn't personal. Personal is yourself, or your mother, or your child.
Or your partner. Understanding intellectually that black men are at risk in this world is one thing; fearing for Daniel's safety was something else entirely. And that doesn't go away just because Daniel has.
So when I began to dip my toes, tentatively, back into the dating world -- when I finally accepted the possibility that my shattered heart could be somehow repaired and then proffered up again, to someone new -- I had to ask: Could I be with a white guy?
Ridiculous question, I know. But Daniel often used to say (with only a hint of irony): ''You can't talk to white people about this stuff.'' Could I be with someone who didn't concern himself with the fact that young black men are punished disproportionately in school compared with their white peers? Or that they are stopped and searched far more frequently, even though they are less often found with drugs in their possession? Could I be with someone who thought such things didn't matter? Or who believed that we had gotten past them when we moved a black family into the White House?
I think not. But that's only another feature of my future partner, like a sense of humor and a commitment to parenthood, that could be present in a person of any race. I should know that.
The real work, I understand more and more, is learning that a relationship changes you, and yet you are still you. If it ends, you take some things with you, you leave some behind, and hopefully you're better for it.
So I will keep working on it. And on a Sunday, if I miss rice and peas, I can just whip some up. If the man in my life one day is Italian, Chinese, or anything other than Jamaican (which seems likely: it's a small nation), I hope he'll enjoy my Jamaican cooking anyway. Or we could learn to cook something else.

HEADLINE: Seeing Bailouts Through Rose-Colored Glasses

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
THE multibillion-dollar trading loss at JPMorgan Chase has revived the idea of paring down banks that are too big to manage. That's a good thing, if we ever hope to get off the boom-bust-bailout track.
As the battles over financial regulation rage in Washington, it's crucial that American taxpayers understand the costs associated with rescuing behemoth institutions. Getting a straight answer on this question can be tough, given the politics now surrounding the bailouts that occurred in 2008. 
The total cost of those salvage efforts isn't yet known. The problems at the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have not been resolved, and the taxpayers' current $151 billion bill will undoubtedly shift in size.
Nevertheless, an accurate accounting of the 2008 rescues should include the value of the bailout subsidy provided by the taxpayers, as well as a hard-nosed cost-benefit analysis. Unfortunately, neither was included in a recent United States Treasury analysis of the various rescue programs, including TARP.
That didn't stop the Treasury from crowing: ''The latest available estimates indicate that the financial stability programs are likely to result in an overall positive financial return to taxpayers in terms of direct fiscal cost.'' These returns are expected to exceed the costs at Fannie and Freddie, the Treasury added.
It's enough to make you want to break out the Champagne.
But the rosy scenario, delightful though it may be, is incomplete. And the first clue is that the return estimated by the Treasury Department is based on ''the direct fiscal cost.'' The indirect costs of the rescue efforts, including subsidies provided to the recipients by taxpayers, loom large. But they are unmeasured in this analysis.
This point was made in Washington this month by a group of respected economists, who also contend that a large portion of the payments that the Treasury said will accrue to taxpayers should not be included.
Edward J. Kane, a professor of finance at Boston College and an authority on analyzing subsidies, was one of those economists. In an interview last week, he called the Treasury's analysis deficient.
First, Mr. Kane objected to the Treasury's inclusion of $179 billion in interest income that it expects the Federal Reserve to generate on investments through 2015. These include Treasury securities and other assets bought by the Fed under various rescue programs.
Including such income is improper, Mr. Kane said, because -- from the taxpayers' point of view -- the Fed's balance sheet and income statements should be consolidated with those of the Treasury. When the Fed receives income on its government securities, for example, that money comes from the Treasury. Characterizing that as a gain for the taxpayer is a reach, he said.
AN even larger problem with the Treasury analysis, Mr. Kane said, is its failure to calculate the value of the subsidy that taxpayers provided to rescue recipients. ''You would not pass Economics 101,'' he said, ''if you didn't understand the opportunity costs involved in providing the subsidy.''
The programs provided enormous amounts of money at below-market terms for extended periods, he said. Had those guarantees been priced at their true market value -- what a private investor would have charged to lend during those dire days -- taxpayers should have received far higher returns.
Timothy G. Massad, assistant Treasury secretary for financial stability, said: ''We believe the fact that we took strong, forceful action resulted in us preventing significant economic costs, including the risk of a second Great Depression. But a specific counterfactual analysis is something that can be done in a variety of ways, and for the government to endorse one particular approach is not something we think is appropriate in this case.''
Charles W. Calomiris, is a professor at Columbia Business School, as well as Columbia's School of International and Public Affairs, and a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research. He worked with Mr. Kane on the critique of the Treasury's analysis and said in an interview last week: ''Pretending that when providing these subsidies all you have to do is get your money back and not get an adequate return accounting for risk -- that is not a good accounting for cost.''
Another problem with the Treasury's presentation is that it does not give taxpayers a cost-benefit analysis. ''We are not saying that the benefits weren't there,'' Mr. Calomiris said. ''We're not saying that it wasn't worthwhile to create these programs. Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't. But it requires a fuller analysis of what the benefits were.''
When the subject of bailout benefits comes up, policy makers usually characterize them in broad and nebulous terms. The rescues avoided another Great Depression, as Mr. Massad said, or staved off Armageddon.
This is insufficient, in Mr. Calomiris's view. ''It's not good enough to say it would have been the end of the world,'' he said. ''If you do a cost-benefit analysis you have to take into account all relative alternatives.''
Better to estimate the damage that would have been done to the economy as a whole if the rescues hadn't taken place and then argue that the amount spent was worthwhile.
''If you think you avoided a major credit contraction and you have some model of what the disruption would have been to gross domestic product,'' Mr. Calomiris added, ''that might tell you the benefits were far in excess of the costs.''
Recognizing all the costs associated with bailouts and formulating an estimate of the benefits provided by those costs is something that taxpayers have a right to expect from their government. Being honest about the costs and benefits is the only way we can analyze the response to the crisis and correct any mistakes that were made.
Focusing on whether the programs made money misses the point, Mr. Kane said. ''The real issue,'' he said, ''is how well the government used the money and what are the lessons.''
We're still waiting for that.

BILLY LYNN'S LONG HALFTIME WALK
By Ben Fountain
307 pp. Ecco/HarperCollins Publishers. $25.99.
Ben Fountain was the lead subject in a 2008 New Yorker article by Malcolm Gladwell about ''late bloomers.'' Whereas the precocious likes of Jonathan Safran Foer had books published practically the moment they got out of college, Fountain's first collection of stories, ''Brief Encounters With Che Guevara,'' did not appear until he was 48, in 2006. Now, six years later, comes a novel that, appropriately enough, takes a while to bloom.
The Billy Lynn of the title is a member of the Army's Bravo Company, eight of whom come out physically unscathed from the battle of Al-Ansakar Canal, a fierce firefight in Iraq. Caught on film, the skirmish is shown on Fox News and turns the men -- branded ''Bravo squad'' -- into heroes overnight. 
The Iraq war has been covered to such high literary effect by reporters like David Finkel and Dexter Filkins that news of an imminent war novel is likely to be greeted with a shrug. Who needs it -- even if it is, as the Vietnam vet turned novelist Karl Marlantes claims in a blurb, ''the 'Catch-22' of the Iraq war''? (A version of Joseph Heller's proverbial paradox crops up in the book: investors won't commit to a film of Bravo's exploits until a star comes on board, and no star will commit until investors do.) Fountain gets around this problem by bringing the war home, setting his novel in ''the sheltering womb of all things American -- football, Thanksgiving, television, about eight different kinds of police and security personnel, plus 300 million well-wishing fellow citizens.'' Like the flag raisers of Iwo Jima, the men of Bravo have been whisked back to the United States for a two-week victory tour, climaxing, on the day of the novel, with an appearance at the Dallas Cowboys' stadium.
We first meet 19-year-old Billy and the rest of the squad en route from their hotel, ''where overcaffeinated tag teams of grateful citizens trampolined right down the middle of his hangover.'' The language in these early pages seems over/caffeinated and underperforming, amping itself up to little purpose. There are also distracting typographical effects: odd words -- ''terrRist,'' ''nina leven,'' ''currj'' -- scattered on otherwise blank pages to mime Billy's dispersed attention. The other members of the squad gradually make themselves seen and heard (Fountain has the synesthetic knack of making us see by hearing), but it is the absent Shroom, killed at Al-Ansakar, who is ever-/present in Billy's consciousness. Also along for the ride is Albert, who, like Lawrence Schiller in ''The Executioner's Song,'' has obtained the rights to Bravo's story and is trying to piece together a Hollywood deal before they ship back to Iraq.
Within 50 pages things are coming nicely into focus, from ''the woody grain of the turkey'' served up as part of a gigantic buffet, to the shifting choreography of the squad's dealings with their adoring public. Concerned about the violence they've been exposed to, an amiable old man is slightly taken aback by their sergeant's assurance that they ''like violence,'' are ''the most murdering bunch of psychopaths you'll ever see.'' Maybe this low-grade band of brothers isn't ''the greatest generation,'' one character observes, ''but they are surely the best of the bottom third percentile of their own somewhat muddled and suspect generation.''
''Brief Encounters'' was brightened by flamboyant and fizzing similes -- vividly symbolized by the tropical birds that ''streaked about like meteor showers'' through the jungle in the opening story -- and here, too, the shell casings of fired-off metaphors are soon cascading around our feet. Once the initial resistance wears off we feel sufficiently secure in the linguistic firepower at Fountain's disposal to share Billy's delight at seeing his buddies A-bort and Crack ''approach, grinning like cheetahs with bits of flesh and bone stuck between their teeth.''
Any thoughts of quitting the book have evaporated by the time it flips back a few days to Billy's quick visit to his hometown in Texas. He spends an afternoon swilling beer and lying in the sun with his sister, horribly conscious of his pleasure in her bikini-clad proximity -- ''a small gold cross lay on the swell of one of her breasts, a tiny mountaineer going for the top'' -- and of something still more taboo that she urges him to consider: the possibility of quitting, of not returning to Iraq.
Back in the stadium, Bravo is introduced to the fictional owner of the Cowboys, Norman Oglesby, a ''king of self-/esteem'' whose megawatt charm is betrayed by ''a faint arthritic creak in every smile and gesture.'' Norm and his Bush-adoring cronies make quite an impression on Bravo, but it's the cheerleaders' sculptured tummies and supple thighs that really get their blood racing. Billy thinks he might have made some special eye contact with one of them. He's deluding himself, surely, but then she smiles again, ''silently laughs and crinkles her eyes at him,'' and he dares to hope.
This is brilliantly done; by now, in fact, everything is brilliantly done. Within the tight schedule of Bravo's three or four remaining hours of liberty, and without leaving the gigantic confines of the stadium, Fountain keeps the reader's plate piled high. It all happens in tandem; by the time Billy falls for his cheerleader we are in love with the book, and that love finds expression in more and wilder laughter. In an episode of devastating comedy -- and mutual incomprehension -- the squad is introduced to a weird strain of ''industrial-sized humans'' otherwise known as football players. Aghast at the sheer amount of food they consume, Billy gains new insight into America's economic might: ''Any other country would go broke trying to feed these mammoths.''
Billy is a decent, thoroughly uneducated kid, but his responsiveness to the America thrust in his face is as highly developed as Rabbit Angstrom's. An obvious satirical impulse -- the Cowboys' relentless merchandising operation leads Billy to wonder at what point ''America became a giant mall with a country attached'' -- does not detract from the close-up drama of the day. Will Billy get to see his cheerleader again? Will he respond to his sister's texts encouraging him to jump ship? What will happen to the film deal if Norm agrees to put up some dough?
All this unfolds amid the constant attention of the public. Left to themselves, the Bravos act like a bunch of street-/corner pervs who snap into politeness when required. Events are complicated by the halftime fireworks, which risk setting off P.T.S.D. flashbacks among the soldiers, who, if provoked, are primed to respond as a pack. After an inevitable altercation they take their seats again in a by now freezing afternoon. One of their number has been hit in the mouth, and when a ''nice boojee lady'' sees him passed out under the falling sleet, a chunk of his smashed lip ''dangling like a squashed bug,'' she covers him with a Snuggie (''one of those personal lounging blankets with built-in sleeves as advertised on late-night dumb-dumb TV''). His buddies assure her that such kindness is unnecessary, especially when she gets up to leave without taking the blanket. ''He grew up in a ditch, he don't know from being cold!'' ''It's like giving a pig a Rolex, ma'am, he's got no appreciation for the finer things in life.'' The lady, the reader's embedded conscience and representative, ''laughs and waves them off.'' It's a touching and hilarious scene, but by now the book seems like nothing else so much as a single wonderful scene -- with a brief intermission at Billy's home -- from which all traces of initial uncertainty have been removed. If at the end there's a hint of contrivance as we hurtle toward the denouement, this doesn't detract from Fountain's achievement -- grand, intimate and joyous.

HEADLINE: The Neighborhood Drinking Problem

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
Late last year, the New York City health department unveiled the latest installment in a subway advertising campaign meant to illuminate the perils of heavy drinking. Featuring young people who would seem to have aggressively exceeded the city's recommended limits for alcohol consumption -- no more than one drink a day for women, no more than two for men -- the posters depict the ugly consequences of a kind of night life that draws many 22-year-olds to the city in the first place.
In one of the newer ads, a young man, face bruised, his neck in a brace, is being hauled away in an ambulance. ''Two drinks ago,'' the copy reads, ''this wasn't your ride.'' Two drinks ago, one infers, our subject wasn't drinking a Rhone Valley white. 
The campaign arrived amid discomfiting statistics that made it hard to dismiss as hysteria. In 2009, alcohol was responsible for more than 8,840 hospitalizations in New York, a 36 percent increase over 2000. Additionally, the proportion of alcohol-related emergency-room visits among New Yorkers ages 21 to 64 doubled from 2003 to 2009. There were 70,000 such visits just in 2009.
So the question arises: Ought we to do something? Or rather, should we think harder about drinking as a matter of urban policy?
The problem with modern-day temperance initiatives in New York -- beyond the obvious risk of their seeming hoary in a place where a wine bar provides the ultimate imprimatur of gentrification -- is that they so often take the form of entitled neighborhood grievance. Recently in Chelsea, residents protested the potential opening of a gastro pub that had the well-known club owner Amy Sacco attached. Fearing that the place would cater to traders who wanted to get drunk and models who didn't want to eat, residents proclaimed the place was really just posing as a restaurant and ultimately blocked Ms. Sacco's involvement.
In the same vein, this month, Brooklyn Speaks, an amalgamation of civic organizations and community groups concerned about the development at Atlantic Yards, drew up a petition calling on the State Liquor Authority to end alcohol sales at the Barclays Center arena no later than 10 p.m. The group worried that drinking at the stadium could linger on until 4 a.m., even though no amount of N.B.A. overtime -- or encores at a Bon Jovi concert, for that matter -- would ever likely last that long. (The group was seeking to end drinks sales at basketball games at half time; at Madison Square Garden, they are permitted until the beginning of the fourth quarter.)
These outcries, however warranted, have received far more attention than the existing threat to civic and social life elsewhere. Not long ago, Assemblyman Francisco P. Moya, representing the 39th District in western Queens, asked the State Liquor Authority to conduct research that determined that his own Corona neighborhood was second only to downtown Manhattan in the number of beer and wine dispensaries. The stretch of Roosevelt Avenue that runs through Corona is packed with bars, many operating, legally or illegally, as dance clubs. On weekend mornings, it is common to see people passed out on the sidewalk, the assemblyman said. Most of these bars stay open past 4 a.m., and many, he said, are not in the practice of cutting people off.
On Thursday evening, I visited the area with Mr. Moya. He sent me to a particularly notorious bar where, at 7 p.m., I found a patron with his head buried on his table. Around the block, a pair of business cards lay scattered on the sidewalk, advertising La Marina, a nearby bar, with pictures of women in lingerie offering specials on Monday and Thursday nights: six beers for $20. In 2010, Corona, neighboring Elmhurst and Jackson Heights led the city in drunken-driving arrests.
The police have designated Corona a high-impact zone, meaning that the streets have a heavy law-enforcement presence because of high crime. Two police officers stationed on a corner of Roosevelt Avenue on Thursday night said they were besieged with calls both during the day and at night about problems related to unfettered drinking. Often, they'll escort someone out of a bar only to see him re-enter not much later. (I say ''him'' because in some of the bars that offer men $2 dances with women, female customers are not permitted.) Western Queens is among the areas in the city with the highest proportion of alcohol-related emergency-room visits.
Mr. Moya's district has a huge population of Ecuadorean immigrants, many of them poor and separated from their families back home. What is happening in the area is analogous to the kind of predatory lending that plagued poor neighborhoods in advance of the housing crisis. Here, bars keep opening with few checks and balances, soliciting the lonely and vulnerable. Mr. Moya would like to see a moratorium on the opening of bars in certain highly concentrated areas of his district, but that will be hard to achieve, he said.
''Ten years ago, none of this was here,'' he told me. ''This has all changed the community, and obviously not in a better way.''
The Bloomberg administration, for its part, is adamant that it is not seeking to reduce the number of bars in the city, a spokesman said. (''The answer is no.'') Responding to inquiries earlier this year about whether the city might discourage the opening of more bars, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's press secretary, Stu Loeser, said, ''We're deeply committed to encouraging entrepreneurs to start and expand small businesses in the city.''
In this instance an interventionist administration that recently called for residential buildings to regulate smoking seems oddly satisfied simply to play advertiser in chief.

HEADLINE: Letters: Logic and the Mandate

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''Slippery-Slope Logic, Applied to Health Care'' (Economic View, May 13), Richard H. Thaler criticizes the slippery-slope arguments of those who question the health care law's mandate to buy insurance. But the column overlooks that such arguments are often invoked with good cause. After all, sometimes slopes really are slippery. 
Yes, logical fallacies are a thorn in the side of rational discourse. We've all seen slippery slopes become colossal mudslides. However, history vindicates others. British appeasement of Nazi Germany during the late 1930s really knocked down the rest of the dominoes. Critics of the initially modest Social Security legislation of the 1930s predicted the entrenchment of a new entitlement with remarkable accuracy.
No one reasonably thinks that insurance mandates will lead to broccoli mandates. But those concerned about health care reform's expansion of federal power are not slipping down a speculative slope. Rather, they know that the road to serfdom is traveled one step at a time.
Brett J. Gall

To the Editor:
We've heard them before -- the cries against a nanny state forcing us to do things it says are for our own good. Recall the debate over requiring people to wear seat belts? If we allowed the government to tell us what we had to do in our cars, opponents warned at the time, what would federal bureaucrats be sticking their noses into next?
As it turned out, not much. Not only is it hard to see what all the fuss was about, but who can believe that seat-belt laws have led to increased government intrusion in our lives?
Most of us reflexively buckle our seat belts when we drive and insist that our passengers do so as well. It took a federal law to make us more aware of the benefits. Over time, we will feel the same way about acting responsibly when it comes to health insurance. Our Supreme Court justices should be more concerned with allowing sensible solutions aimed at making care more affordable than with protecting us against the phantom menace of storm troopers forcing us to eat broccoli. Libertarians who fear a nanny state should be equally suspect of a nanny court.
Louis Montesano
Manhattan, May 14
To the Editor:
The column failed to distinguish fallacious slippery-slope arguments from the crucial ability to think in principle. When the purported justification behind a particular action is a specific principle, it is perfectly logical -- and good practice -- to explore what other types of actions would be permitted by adopting that principle. That exploration can help us determine whether the principle, and the immediate action in question, are truly justified.

 BODY:
In '' 'Why Don't We Have Any White Kids,' '' on the cover of last Sunday's Metropolitan section, N. R. Kleinfield profiled Explore Charter School in Brooklyn, where 92.7 percent of the students are black. Hundreds of readers responded on NYTimes.com, debating the causes and consequences of de facto segregation in New York City schools. A selection of their comments is below.
The school has no resources: few computers. No playground. No athletics. Worst of all, the staff is inexperienced. They are young, and there is lots of turnover. There has been a parade of principals. 
Yet this article suggests the real problem is a lack of integration? Much more troubling problems are laid bare in the article.
The rules of English grammar are no different in an integrated school. How to balance a chemical equation is no different in an integrated school. Algebra is no different in an integrated school. It's not that integration is unimportant, as many factors contribute to success in school and beyond. But these children are not getting the basics.
First and foremost, these children need a stable, experienced faculty, not some ''diversity.''
Massysett,
Washington DC
As someone who went to (court-ordered) desegregated schools in the '70s, I can say that they did help prepare me for mixing with different races later in life. Yet, simply desegregating a school does not lead to equity for all. In addition, what happens in the family, in the neighborhood, in the extended family, often influences attitudes about learning, access to ''enrichment'' activities and other important factors.
KM,
New York
The truth is that NYC doesn't care at all about anyone from the bottom class receiving an education -- black, white or purple. This city is for rich people. If you're poor, you are treated like a nuisance, at best. You will be sent to schools that feel closer to prisons. You will be fed food that assures you will have diabetes by 30. And if you graduate from high school, you will probably still only be reading at the fourth-grade level. Of course, the unemployment rate for blacks in the city is over double that of whites -- but NYC doesn't have a racial problem. No, we are tolerant and enlightened here. The South has a racial problem, not us.
The hypocrisy and denial are an abomination. NYC shows no signs of changing. The gap between rich and poor, black and white, is absolutely staggering and deeply, deeply shameful.
Elsie,
Brooklyn
As an elementary-school teacher in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, I see that some middle-class parents go elsewhere (Park Slope) to enroll their children where there are more parents like themselves and the kids are mostly white. There must be a mixture of racial classes in schools where high-poverty children get an opportunity to be educated with middle-class students. This will in turn open more dialogue for more services, more extracurricular activities and more community involvement to get after-school services and community-based organizations in the neighborhood. Children would benefit from the lobbying that the parents would be doing to get more services into the schools.
Martin,
Bklyn, NY
I live in a borderline neighborhood in the city and spend a very high percentage of my income to send my two kids to private school. It is not that I don't want them interacting with other races -- the class is actually very diverse, but I do want to avoid having my kids interact with kids who have more challenged family and socioeconomic situations. There are two black kids in the class, and their parents are professionals -- as are the Indian, Asian, white and other kids. Is that wrong that I don't want to send my kids to a public school? I am almost certainly contributing to the ''segregation'' of the public schools, but I am very comfortable with that. MH,
Brooklyn
My children are the only white students in an otherwise all-black K-8 school. (I think there might be one other white student ... otherwise it's just my kids.) When I've suggested to white acquaintances that they enroll their children in the school, I get a few nervous laughs and a ''I'll think about it.'' The main problem I see in the school is a general lack of academic motivation or competition. There is also a good deal of grade inflation because no one wants to fail the kids (and who can blame them?). Otherwise we've had no serious problems, no racial taunting or anything like that. It's not a great school, but it's good enough, and the main cornerstones of education take place at home, anyway. Too often parents blame the faults of their children's feet on their shoes. Islandmommy,
Staten Island, NY
You don't want your child to be the only drop of cream in the coffee ... I don't want mine to be the only drop of chocolate in the milk. Diversity, true diversity, is important going both ways. I hate that in order to give my child the education he deserves, I have to unwillingly isolate him from other people who look like him. So he comes home, as he has recently, saying that he wants to be white, and to have blond hair, etc. I feel as if I am accidentally teaching him to dislike himself, by placing him in an environment that seems to suggest that in order to be ''good'' or successful, you must be white.
This is why having black teachers, black peers and a more diverse environment overall is critical. It demonstrates that success is not limited to one race, or ethnicity, or skin color. That is an important lesson for ALL children to learn.

BYLINE: By IHSAN TAYLOR

 BODY:
SWIM BACK TO ME, by Ann Packer. (Vintage Contemporaries, $14.95.) Packer's novels, ''Songs Without Words'' and ''The Dive From Clausen's Pier,'' confront loss head-on. In this piercing collection of stories, characters struggle against devastation: the broken promise of a second marriage, the resurfacing of old family wounds, the death of a nearly grown child.
ALMOST A FAMILY: A Memoir, by John Darnton. (Anchor, $16.95.) Darnton was 11 months old when his father, a correspondent for The New York Times, was killed in 1942 while covering the war in the Pacific. In this memoir Darnton, a Pulitzer-winning former Times reporter, debunks myths about the circumstances of his father's death, and tries to make sense of his family's decline and his mother's despair. 
CALEB'S CROSSING, by Geraldine Brooks. (Penguin, $16.) Bethia Mayfield, a restless minister's daughter and the heroine of Brooks's historical novel, must learn to exist within the confines set for women by the Massachusetts Bay Puritans. Writing a ''spiritual diary'' on scraps of scavenged paper, Bethia describes the secret bond she forges with the son of a Wampanoag chief. '' 'Caleb's Crossing' could not be more enlightening and involving,'' Jane Smiley wrote here.
SCRIBBLE, SCRIBBLE, SCRIBBLE: Writing on Politics, Ice Cream, Churchill, and My Mother, by Simon Schama. (Ecco/Harper/Collins, $16.99.) The distinguished historian delivers a robust smorgasbord of essays, reviews, lectures, celebrity profiles, travelogues and more, held together not by any overriding theme but by a richly analytical authorial style.
2030: The Real Story of What Happens to America, by Albert Brooks. (St. Martin's Griffin, $14.99.) In the future America of Brooks's ingenious first novel, the national debt has long since surpassed the gross national product and Los Angeles is in ruins after an earthquake. There's a cure for cancer, but the breakthrough has left spry hordes of senior citizens hogging the country's remaining resources.
THE ORIGINS OF POLITICAL ORDER: From Prehuman Times to the French Revolution, by Francis Fukuyama. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $18.) Fukuyama draws on biology, anthropology, economics and political philosophy to tell the story of how the state, the rule of law and accountability evolved in various societies before their combination in 18th-century Britain. Our reviewer, Michael Lind, called this book, the first of a projected two volumes, ''ambitious, erudite and eloquent.''
THE SNOWMAN, by Jo Nesbo. Translated by Don Bartlett. (Vintage Crime/Black Lizard, $14.95.) Inspector Harry Hole, Nesbo's maverick detective on the Oslo crime squad, is at the center of another fiendishly complex thriller: for years a psychopath has been waiting for the first snowfall to build menacing snowmen outside the homes of his victims.
THE USE AND ABUSE OF LITERATURE, by Marjorie Garber. (Anchor, $16.95.) Garber, the author of ''Shakespeare After All,'' traces the ever-changing use of the very term ''literature'' -- ''What once wasn't literature,'' she writes, ''is now at the heart of the canon'' -- and examines reading methods that have gone in and out of academic fashion, among them the New Criticism and deconstruction.

HEADLINE: Insurance Firm Is Set Up for Land Trusts, Which See Legal Costs Soaring

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
NEW LONDON, Conn. -- The $4 million estate on the Connecticut River in Lyme had everything: a six-bedroom home, a pool and a dock, all surrounded by 17 acres of native meadows, brush and woodlands. It also had a decades-old conservation restriction, held by the local land trust, requiring the property to remain largely in its ''natural wilderness'' state.
But after buying the land in 2007, Brian and Beverly Platner went for a more manicured look, installing a sweeping lawn and gardens with sculptured borders.
The Lyme Land Conservation Trust was not pleased, and in 2009, it sued to enforce the restrictions, which were adopted in the 1980s. In turn, the Platners sued the trust's president, accusing him of defaming them. 
When landowners defy established conservation restrictions -- and informal resolution efforts fail -- the country's 1,700 or so land trusts find that they have little option but to take them to court. ''Whoever holds the easement has an absolute responsibility to defend it,'' said Darla Guenzler, executive director of the California Council of Land Trusts.
But some trust officials worry that the litigation costs could ruin their largely volunteer organizations and erode their ability to protect land. The national Land Trust Alliance came up with the idea of creating an insurance company to help trusts with legal costs, and it petitioned the Internal Revenue Service to grant the new company, called Terra Firma, nonprofit status. On Thursday, the I.R.S. approval came through.
In East Haddam, Conn., defending one case against a landowner took almost a decade and cost the local trust $415,000, about half of which was covered by insurance. ''It nearly brought us to our knees,'' said Anita Ballek, a co-founder of the East Haddam Land Trust.
The wave of lawsuits is rooted partly in the rapid expansion of the trusts. Many took advantage of bargain prices during the recession and significantly increased their holdings -- with the total protected acreage nearly doubling to 47 million acres in the decade ending in 2010, according to a census by the Land Trust Alliance. At the same time, trust officials said they began noticing a new disregard for their covenants, particularly among the wealthy.
''It's unfortunate that this is happening more often,'' Leslie Ratley-Beach, the conservation director of the national alliance, said in a recent interview. ''But that is something we expected as the land that's conserved changes hands.''
Mobilized by its California members, the alliance began raising money to start the insurance company. So far it has raised $3 million of the $4 million required.
Terra Firma will sell policies providing up to $500,000 in legal coverage to 1,000 or more small trusts around the country. Annual premiums for land trusts would be $60 per landholding or easement. More than 460 smaller trusts have already signed up.
An exact count of legal challenges around the country is not kept. But a 2009 poll by Adena R. Rissman, an assistant professor of forest and wildlife ecology at the University of Wisconsin, showed that about 47 percent of trusts surveyed had faced a significant legal challenge or easement violation. She found that the average cost of such legal challenges for trusts was $37,700.
A Land Trust Alliance fact sheet said that 85 percent of trusts had budgets under $250,000; fewer than 20 had legal defense funds of $70,000 or more.
The idea of land trusts dates back a century, but it was after World War II, when housing development surged, that the practice of private groups preserving native landscapes took off. In the past three decades, hundreds of new trusts have been created.
Among the incentives for donors of conservation easements are one-time tax deductions. In return, the I.R.S. seeks to ensure that the land is conserved ''in perpetuity.'' The consequences of breached conservation easements are far reaching, experts say. If too many are abrogated, future proposals may face more skepticism from the tax authorities.
Jessica Jay, a Colorado lawyer who founded the firm Conservation Law PC, explained, ''It's just at the point when the easement transfers from the original grantor to a successor that we need to be sure the permanence is there.''
There has been a rich variety of other cases. In Washington State, a landowner was jailed briefly last year after he was found to have repeatedly strung zip lines on protected land and sold rides. Near North Carolina's Cold Mountain, a gravel ford was built over a protected trout stream to simplify access to a neighboring property. New owners of conserved land in Ohio sued the local trust, arguing unsuccessfully that the previous owner was senile when she donated the 28 acres and that they should thus be allowed to build 39 houses there.
Land trusts usually win in court -- though many cases are settled, according to alliance records. One common denominator: the wealth of the property owners challenging restrictions.
In 2001, Timothy Mellon, the owner of the small Goodspeed Airport in East Haddam, cut down 300 trees on conserved wetlands near his runway, according to a judicial ruling in the case.
Mr. Mellon, the son of the philanthropist Paul Mellon, argued in court papers that federal aviation laws regarding runway obstacles trumped conservation restrictions. Despite a decade of litigation, his argument did not prevail. Mr. Mellon's defamation claims against land trust officials were also dismissed.
A lawsuit was filed in Vermont involving a conservation easement adjoining a vacation home that Jonathan Rothberg, an entrepreneur and scientific pioneer of rapid genome sequencing, bought near the Harriman reservoir. The Vermont Land Trust's 2003 suit claimed that 50-foot trees on the conservation easement were cut, improving the home's view and extending its lawn.
Dr. Rothberg and the previous landowner deny cutting protected trees. Dr. Rothberg said he was abiding by an out-of-court settlement. ''We stopped mowing the grass, we planted seeds and haven't heard anything since,'' he said.
Battles are inevitable, said Annette Lorraine, a lawyer with the Land as Legacy consultants group in Montpelier, Vt. ''Even an easement written today with the best knowledge that land trusts have will be challenged, just because some lawyer will tell a client that they can beat this,'' she said.
In the countersuits over the Platners' property, neither side is talking. The defamation suit against the Lyme trust's former president, George Moore, cited his public remark that the Platners ''have chosen to disregard the easement and do what they want when they want.''
Mr. Moore declined to comment on the case, but the alliance's 2010 annual report gives his account. The Platners claimed in court papers that the restrictions were invalid and that no ''natural and native grasses and vegetation'' were there to begin with. Their lawyer, Steve Karlson, said they were overseas and would not discuss the case because settlement talks were under way.

HEADLINE: Making Schools Work

BYLINE: By DAVID L. KIRP. 
A professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and the author of ''Kids First: Five Big Ideas for Transforming Children's Lives and America's Future.''

 BODY:
AMID the ceaseless and cacophonous debates about how to close the achievement gap, we've turned away from one tool that has been shown to work: school desegregation. That strategy, ushered in by the landmark 1954 Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education, has been unceremoniously ushered out, an artifact in the museum of failed social experiments. The Supreme Court's ruling that racially segregated schools were ''inherently unequal'' shook up the nation like no other decision of the 20th century. Civil rights advocates, who for years had been patiently laying the constitutional groundwork, cheered to the rafters, while segregationists mourned ''Black Monday'' and vowed ''massive resistance.'' But as the anniversary was observed this past week on May 17, it was hard not to notice that desegregation is effectively dead. In fact, we have been giving up on desegregation for a long time. In 1974, the Supreme Court rejected a metropolitan integration plan, leaving the increasingly black cities to fend for themselves. 
A generation later, public schools that had been ordered to integrate in the 1960s and 1970s became segregated once again, this time with the blessing of a new generation of justices. And five years ago, a splintered court delivered the coup de grace when it decreed that a school district couldn't voluntarily opt for the most modest kind of integration -- giving parents a choice of which school their children would attend and treating race as a tiebreaker in deciding which children would go to the most popular schools. In the perverse logic of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., this amounted to ''discriminating among individual students based on race.'' That's bad history, which, as Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote in an impassioned dissent, ''threaten[s] the promise of Brown.''
To the current reformers, integration is at best an irrelevance and at worst an excuse to shift attention away from shoddy teaching. But a spate of research says otherwise. The experience of an integrated education made all the difference in the lives of black children -- and in the lives of their children as well. These economists' studies consistently conclude that African-American students who attended integrated schools fared better academically than those left behind in segregated schools. They were more likely to graduate from high school and attend and graduate from college; and, the longer they spent attending integrated schools, the better they did. What's more, the fear that white children would suffer, voiced by opponents of integration, proved groundless. Between 1970 and 1990, the black-white gap in educational attainment shrank -- not because white youngsters did worse but because black youngsters did better.
Not only were they more successful in school, they were more successful in life as well. A 2011 study by the Berkeley public policy professor Rucker C. Johnson concludes that black youths who spent five years in desegregated schools have earned 25 percent more than those who never had that opportunity. Now in their 30s and 40s, they're also healthier -- the equivalent of being seven years younger.
Why? For these youngsters, the advent of integration transformed the experience of going to school. By itself, racial mixing didn't do the trick, but it did mean that the fate of black and white students became intertwined. School systems that had spent a pittance on all-black schools were now obliged to invest considerably more on African-American students' education after the schools became integrated. Their classes were smaller and better equipped. They included children from better-off families, a factor that the landmark 1966 Equality of Educational Opportunity study had shown to make a significant difference in academic success. What's more, their teachers and parents held them to higher expectations. That's what shifted the arc of their lives.
Professor Johnson takes this story one big step further by showing that the impact of integration reaches to the next generation. These youngsters -- the grandchildren of Brown -- are faring better in school than those whose parents attended racially isolated schools.
Despite the Horatio Alger myth that anyone can make it in America, moving up the socioeconomic ladder is hard going: children from low-income families have only a 1 percent chance of reaching the top 5 percent of the income distribution, versus children of the rich, who have about a 22 percent chance.
But many of the poor black children who attended desegregated schools in the 1970s escaped from poverty, and their offspring have maintained that advantage. Of course desegregation was not a cure-all. While the achievement gap and the income gap narrowed during the peak era of desegregation, white children continued to do noticeably better. That's to be expected, for schools can't hope to overcome the burdens of poverty or the lack of early education, which puts poor children far behind their middle-class peers before they enter kindergarten. And desegregation was too often implemented in ham-handed fashion, undermining its effectiveness. Adherence to principle trumped good education, as students were sent on school buses simply to achieve the numerical goal of racial balance. Understandably, that aroused opposition, and not only among those who thought desegregation was a bad idea. Despite its flaws, integration is as successful an educational strategy as we've hit upon. As the U.C.L.A. political scientist Gary Orfield points out, ''On some measures the racial achievement gaps reached their low point around the same time as the peak of black-white desegregation in the late 1980s.''
And in the 1990s, when the courts stopped overseeing desegregation plans, black students in those communities seem to have done worse. The failure of the No Child Left Behind regimen to narrow the achievement gap offers the sobering lesson that closing underperforming public schools, setting high expectations for students, getting tough with teachers and opening a raft of charter schools isn't the answer. If we're serious about improving educational opportunities, we need to revisit the abandoned policy of school integration.
In theory it's possible to achieve a fair amount of integration by crossing city and suburban boundaries or opening magnet schools attractive to both minority and white students. But the hostile majority on the Supreme Court and the absence of a vocal pro-integration constituency make integration's revival a near impossibility.

 BODY:
ONE prescription for avoiding another real estate bubble is that banks tighten up mortgage requirements. Now, a new Federal Reserve report indicates that lenders have indeed been doing just that.
A majority of banks are less likely to offer loans to people with a FICO credit score of 620 and a 10 percent down payment than they were in 2006, according to the report. Lenders were also less likely to do so even for those with a score of 720.
Such stricter standards have drawn the attention of Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, who last week told a bankers group that ''current standards may be limiting or preventing lending to many creditworthy borrowers.'' 
For those with lower credit scores, the math is stark: A borrower with a credit score of 720 can expect a rate of 3.70 percent on a 30-year, $300,000 fixed-rate mortgage, according to myfico.com, while someone with a score of 620 to 639 can expect a 5.07 percent rate -- or an extra $242 per monthly payment.
''If you don't have good credit, you're not going to get that crazy low rate,'' said Deborah MacKenzie, the director of counseling at the Housing Development Fund, a nonprofit group in Stamford, Conn. But she and other experts said there were tactics that consumers could use to raise their scores.
First, though, it is worth noting that median credit scores are rising, as people reduce debt and spend less in tight economic times, said Joanne Gaskin, the director of product management and global scoring at FICO, the provider of one of the most popular credit scores used by lenders. Some 18 percent of Americans now have scores of 800 to 850, while 15 percent are below 550, according to FICO data. Through ''good behavior,'' Ms. Gaskin said, you could raise your credit score by as much as 100 points in a year.
Often lenders will review your scores from the three big credit agencies, and they use the middle number to evaluate you. ''That becomes your risk number,'' said Tracy Becker, the founder of North Shore Advisory in Tarrytown, N.Y., a national credit score specialist.
Start by obtaining your three credit reports (available free once a year at AnnualCreditReport.com, or call 1-877-322-8228), and study them carefully for errors or omissions. If you think your score labels you as a higher risk, Ms. MacKenzie suggests signing up for a first-time homeowners class through a counseling agency certified by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.
According to FICO, the two biggest factors in your credit score are your payment history, which accounts for 35 percent of the score, and the amounts owed, accounting for 30 percent.
Knowing that, Ms. Gaskin said, an effective way to raise your score is to reduce your balances on credit cards. She notes, however, that if an account is in collection, it is too late to improve your credit score by paying it off. The notation that an account is in collection is what lowers the score, she said, so consumers may get more mileage by paying down active credit-card balances and other debts first.
Though mistakes and bankruptcies may stay on your credit report for seven years, lenders will generally be more likely to overlook late payments that happened two or more years ago than more recent ones, Ms. MacKenzie said. ''A late payment that occurs this month when you're applying for a mortgage is deadly,'' she said.
Another way to bolster your credit is by asking creditors with whom you have a good track record to report to a credit agency, Ms. Gaskin said. That could include a landlord or a utility.
Improving your credit could take three to four months, or it could take as long as 18 months. ''It isn't an easy fix,'' said Carol Yopp, a program manager for the Long Island Housing Partnership and a former mortgage underwriter. ''Don't expect it to happen overnight.''

HEADLINE: Before Leaping, Listen To a Giant

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
WHAT are ordinary investors to make of the puzzling swings in Facebook's first-day share price on Friday? Or of the fact that this company, all of eight years old, is now worth more than $104 billion on the stock market? For some perspective, I turned to Harry M. Markowitz, who may have had a greater influence on current theories of finance and investing than any other living person.
Mr. Markowitz, a 1990 Nobel laureate in economics, is the father of modern portfolio theory. His advice: Don't worry too much about Facebook's oscillating stock price. Or, for that matter, about gyrations in another big stock in the news, JPMorgan Chase, after the disclosure of a precarious multibillion-dollar hedging strategy.
In a week like the one we've just had, perhaps Mr. Markowitz's most immediately relevant insight is that most people don't need to think much about individual stocks. ''You can put yourself in a position to say, ho-hum: Facebook, JPMorgan, they may be up, they may be down -- it doesn't really matter,'' he says. 
But in a wild market like this, how can such equanimity be achieved? ''The answer is contained in two words,'' Mr. Markowitz, 84, told me last week. ''They are 'portfolio selection,' and they are the two most important words I ever wrote.''
Those words are the title of a now-canonical paper that he developed as a graduate student at the University of Chicago and published in 1952 while working at the RAND Corporation in Santa Monica, Calif. The math behind it is complex, but the basic thought is not. Rational investors ought to assemble rigorously diversified portfolios of stocks and bonds with a mix of risk and return optimized for their own needs and beliefs. ''The title wasn't 'Securities Selection' or 'Stock Selection,' '' he said in a two-hour telephone conversation last week. ''It was 'Portfolio Selection.' That was revolutionary.''
Building diversified portfolios instead of hunting for hot stocks may not be revolutionary today -- 60 years later -- yet with Facebook frenzy in the air, the idea may be more important than ever.
Not putting your eggs in one basket is ancient wisdom. But Mr. Markowitz's theory provided what the late Peter L. Bernstein called a coherent mathematical ''process for investing.'' ''Markowitz's most original contribution was his insistence on distinguishing between the riskiness of an individual stock and the riskiness of an entire portfolio,'' Mr. Bernstein, formerly a contributor to Sunday Business, wrote in the book ''Capital Ideas.''
At its simplest level, Mr. Markowitz said last week, his theory translates into this advice for unskilled investors without inside knowledge of the market: Forget about individual stocks like Facebook and buy broad low-cost stock and bond index funds instead. Allocate them in a proportion that gives you a level of volatility with which you are comfortable.
Understand that with more bonds and, presumably, less risk, you may end up with a lower long-term return, he continued. Rebalance periodically, and change the allocation if your needs or beliefs change. Then, unless investing is your hobby or profession, move on (or employ a professional to customize a portfolio for you). Enjoy yourself. Do things that are personally more rewarding.
Born and reared in Chicago, where his parents, Jewish immigrants from Poland, ran a grocery store, he read copiously as a boy, starting with comic books and adventure magazines like ''The Shadow'' and ''The Green Hornet,'' and extending to serious works of philosophy. David Hume's skepticism has had a lifelong impact. In a brief autobiography Mr. Markowitz wrote in 1990, he said he was struck by ''Hume's argument that, though we release a ball a thousand times, and each time, it falls to the floor, we do not have a necessary proof that it will fall the thousand-and-first time.''
Such skepticism is embedded in his theories. He does not, for example, make absolute claims about future portfolio returns or investor behavior. And he advises caution about ''financial engineering'' -- including hedges like the one made at JPMorgan -- which can wreak havoc if not perfectly calibrated.
We live in a condition of fundamental uncertainty, he said, and must make difficult decisions based on changeable beliefs. ''We're always making choices,'' he said. ''Even if you try to rely on history as a guide, you're making a choice. Which history, which years, which investment returns are you using? And if the facts change, your beliefs may need to change -- that's natural. But you can use a rational process'' to incorporate those beliefs into your portfolio.
He observed that investor behavior is often idiosyncratic, and certainly much more complex than traditional theory allows. In fact, his 1952 insight that people respond to changes in wealth -- as opposed to states of wealth -- provided one of the main building blocks of behavioral economics, according to Daniel Kahneman, who cites Mr. Markowitz's theories in his recent book ''Thinking, Fast and Slow.'' Mr. Kahneman, a professor emeritus at Princeton, was a Nobel laureate in economics in 2002.
At the University of Chicago, where Mr. Markowitz earned his undergraduate and graduate degrees, he became interested in ''the economics of uncertainty,'' a lifelong pursuit. He said several ''giants'' were his teachers, including Leonard J. Savage, Jacob Marschak, Tjalling C. Koopmans and Milton Friedman. Both Mr. Koopmans and Mr. Friedman also won Nobels. Mr. Friedman taught him ''Economics 101'' and had a major influence, advising him to ''read Adam Smith, which I did and I do,'' he says.
When Mr. Markowitz defended his doctoral dissertation -- a treatise on portfolio theory -- Mr. Friedman raised a disturbing objection. Portfolio theory wasn't economics, Mr. Friedman said, and the university couldn't grant a degree in economics based on it.
A few minutes later, Mr. Markowitz learned that he would receive his degree after all, but he endured some nervous moments. Years later, Mr. Friedman clarified his position somewhat, telling Mr. Markowitz that while he was startled by his student's novel approach, he was kidding about not granting the doctorate. ''Harry, you know we don't flunk anybody at that late stage,'' Mr. Friedman told him.
Now, Mr. Markowitz says: ''It's possible he really didn't think it was economics. It's O.K. At the time it was not economics -- but now it certainly is.''

HEADLINE: The Beginning of the End of the Census?

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL. 
An economics reporter for The New York Times.

 BODY:
THE American Community Survey may be the most important government function you've never heard of, and it's in trouble.
This survey of American households has been around in some form since 1850, either as a longer version of or a richer supplement to the basic decennial census. It tells Americans how poor we are, how rich we are, who is suffering, who is thriving, where people work, what kind of training people need to get jobs, what languages people speak, who uses food stamps, who has access to health care, and so on.
It is, more or less, the country's primary check for determining how well the government is doing -- and in fact what the government will be doing. The survey's findings help determine how over $400 billion in government funds is distributed each year. 
But last week, the Republican-led House voted to eliminate the survey altogether, on the grounds that the government should not be butting its nose into Americans' homes.
''This is a program that intrudes on people's lives, just like the Environmental Protection Agency or the bank regulators,'' said Daniel Webster, a first-term Republican congressman from Florida who sponsored the relevant legislation.
''We're spending $70 per person to fill this out. That's just not cost effective,'' he continued, ''especially since in the end this is not a scientific survey. It's a random survey.''
In fact, the randomness of the survey is precisely what makes the survey scientific, statistical experts say.
Each year the Census Bureau polls a representative, randomized sample of about three million American households about demographics, habits, languages spoken, occupation, housing and various other categories. The resulting numbers are released without identifying individuals, and offer current demographic portraits of even the country's tiniest communities.
It is the largest (and only) data set of its kind and is used across the federal government in formulas that determine how much funding states and communities get for things like education and public health.
For example, a question on flush toilets -- one that some politicians like to cite as being especially invasive -- is used to help assess groundwater contamination for rural parts of the country that do not have modern waste disposal systems, according to the Census Bureau.
Law enforcement agencies have likewise used the data to predict criminal activities like methamphetamine production.
Their recent vote aside, members of Congress do seem to realize how useful these numbers are. After all, they use the data themselves.
A number of questions on the survey have been added because Congress specifically demanded their inclusion. In 2008, for example, Congress passed a law requiring the American Community Survey to add questions about computer and Internet use. Additionally, recent survey data are featured on the Web sites of many representatives who voted to kill the program -- including Mr. Webster's own home page.
The legislation is expected to go to the Senate this week, and all sorts of stakeholders are coming out of the woodwork.
''Knowing what's happening in our economy is so desperately important to keeping our economy functioning smoothly,'' said Maurine Haver, the chief executive and founder of Haver Analytics, a data analysis company. ''The reason the Great Recession did not become another Great Depression is because of the more current economic data we have today that we didn't have in the 1930s.''
She added that having good data about the state of the economy was one of America's primary competitive advantages. ''The Chinese are probably watching all this with glee,'' she said, noting that the Chinese government has also opted not to publish economic data on occasion, generally when the news wasn't good.
Other private companies and industry groups -- including the United States Chamber of Commerce, the National Retail Federation and the National Association of Home Builders -- are up in arms.
Target recently released a video explaining how it used these census data to determine where to locate new stores. Economic development organizations and other business groups say they use the numbers to figure out where potential workers are.
Mr. Webster says that businesses should instead be thanking House Republicans for reducing the government's reach.
''What really promotes business in this country is liberty,'' he said, ''not demand for information.''
Mr. Webster and other critics have gone so far as to say the American Community Survey is unconstitutional. Of course, the basic decennial census is specifically enumerated in the United States Constitution, and courts have ruled that this longer form of the census survey is constitutional as well.
Some census watchers -- like Andrew Reamer, a research professor at the George Washington University Institute of Public Policy -- say they do not expect the Senate to agree on fully eliminating the American Community Survey (as well as the Economic Census, which would also be effectively destroyed by the House bill).
Rather, Mr. Reamer suspects, Republicans may hope that when the Senate and House bills go to a conference committee, a final compromise will keep the survey, but make participation in it voluntary. Under current law, participation is mandatory.
If the American Community Survey were made voluntary, experts say, the census would have to spend significantly more money on follow-up phone calls and in-person visits to get enough households to answer.
But Congress also plans to cut the census budget, making such follow-ups prohibitively expensive.
''If it's voluntary, then we'll just get bad data,'' said Kenneth Prewitt, a former director of the census who is now at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs. ''That means businesses will make bad decisions, and government will make bad decisions, which means we won't even know where we actually are wasting our tax dollars.''

Among the activities will be reunions from the original 1977 DanceAfrica, a late-night Soul Train dance party and, as always, the outdoor bazaar; (718) 636-4100, bam.org.
RIVER TO RIVER FESTIVAL June 17-July 15. The free, site-specific events in this Lower Manhattan festival haven't always been the most inspiring. But in recent years an effort has been under way to reimagine what River to River could be, and this summer, at long last, the lineup looks pretty darn great. Dance offerings include reworked versions of recent works by standouts like Luciana Achugar, Beth Gill and Maria Hassabi; showings by the veteran choreographers Wally Cardona (with an assist from Jennifer Lacey, hooray!) and Tere O'Connor; and a tap dance extravaganza in the World Financial Center.

LINCOLN CENTER FESTIVAL July 5-Aug. 5. Has it really been 16 years since the Paris Opera Ballet last came to New York? Thankfully, Lincoln Center is rectifying this situation, presenting five productions from the storied company's repertory. There should be a little something for everyone, including ''Giselle'' for the storybook lovers; one-acts by Serge Lifar, Roland Petit and Maurice Bejart for the Francophiles (all three are also set to music by French composers); and, for all those Pina Bausch fans, the American premiere of her dance opera ''Orpheus and Eurydice''; (212) 721-6500, lincolncenterfestival.org.
New York State
BARD SUMMERSCAPE Annandale-on-Hudson, July 6-Aug. 19. Belle Epoque France is this year's starting point for SummerScape, which will continue its customary dance opening with Compagnie Fetes Galantes. The troupe's founder, Beatrice Massin, will present ''Que Ma Joie Demeure,'' from 2002. Let us hope the title, which translates as ''Let My Joy Remain,'' sets the interdisciplinary festival off to an auspicious start; (845) 758-7900, fishercenter.bard.edu.
MOUNT TREMPER ARTS FESTIVAL June 9-Aug. 12. A free open studio showing of Jim Findlay's latest performance installation and a premiere from Ursula Eagly are among the highlights of this year's lineup.

AMERICAN DANCE FESTIVAL Durham, June 14-July 28. This American institution has been around for 79 years, and Charles L. Reinhart has been in charge for more than half of them. But now there's a (sort of) new sheriff in town: Mr. Reinhart's protegee and former co-director, Jodee Nimerichter, is taking over. She isn't throwing tradition out the window (yes, Pilobolus and Shen Wei are returning), and her choices are mainly safe ones. But there are signs of life, with festival debuts by the likes of Reggie Wilson and Jodi Melnick; (919) 684-6402, americandancefestival.org.

TIME-BASED ART FESTIVAL Portland, Sept. 6-16. This is a big transitional year for the Portland Institute for Contemporary Art: its 10th annual Time-Based Art Festival -- the best contemporary summer festival in the country -- is now being organized not by a guest curator but by the institution's new artistic director, Angela Mattox. Ms. Mattox's dance picks are outre and political, including Miguel Gutierrez, Keith Hennessy and Faustin Linyekula, all blue-chip contemporary stars and strong artists. (But why no women in the lineup, Ms. Mattox?); (503) 242-1419, pica.org.
PICA SYMPOSIUM: BODIES, IDENTITIES and ALTERNATIVE ECONOMIES Portland, June 21-24. Don't be turned off by the word ''symposium'' or the involved subtitle. This weekend extravaganza focuses on the work of the brilliant and generous San Francisco artist Keith Hennessy, welcoming audiences into a working residency for Mr. Hennessy's latest piece, ''Turbulence (a dance about the economy),'' ahead of its American premiere at the Time-Based Art Festival. Expect lots of lively art and conversation -- and, this being Portland, amazing food and drink just around every corner; (503) 242-1419, pica.org.
Pennsylvania
PHILADELPHIA LIVE ARTS FESTIVAL AND PHILLY FRINGE Sept. 7-22. This dual festival is, fittingly, going very big and very small this year. Sylvain Emard's ''Grand Continental'' (which will also be at River to River in New York) features more than 200 local dancers of all ages and backgrounds. Meanwhile, Headlong Dance Theater will perform ''This Town Is a Mystery'' inside four Philadelphia living rooms, to audiences of only 10 people; (215) 413-9006, livearts-fringe.org.

HEADLINE: A City Rises, Along With Its Hopes

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
Medellin, Colombia
FOR some time now, if you asked architects and urban planners for proof of the power of public architecture and public space to remake the fortunes of a city, they'd point here.
Twenty-odd years ago, this was Pablo Escobar's town, with an annual homicide rate that peaked at 381 per 100,000. In New York City that would add up to an almost inconceivable 32,000 murders a year.
But Colombia's second city has lately become a medical and business center with a population of 3.5 million and a budding tourist industry, its civic pride buoyed by the new public buildings and squares, and exemplified by an efficient and improbably immaculate metro and cable car system. Linking rich with poor neighborhoods, spurring private development, the metro, notwithstanding shrieks elsewhere in Colombia over its questionable construction cost, is for residents of Medellin a shared symbol of democratic renewal. Even on the rush-hour train I took the other morning, crowds stepped aside to let a cleaning woman with a mop and bucket scrub the floor. 
That evening I headed high up into a steep hillside slum where rival gangs still shoot unsuspecting trespassers who cross invisible borders. The city has recently installed an escalator ascending 1,300 feet, much debated at $7 million and disconnected from the rest of the city's transit network but shortening to a five-minute ride what had been a brutal 30-story climb for some 12,000 residents. I trudged by foot, past armed soldiers, past mothers taking breathers on the decrepit steps that meandered up the mountain, past toddlers on plastic tricycles plunging down vertical streets, to a brightly painted cinderblock hut, a ramshackle aerie overlooking a sprawl of tin houses and open sewers.
The shack is home to Son Bata, a cultural initiative founded by young black migrants from the Choco region of Colombia. Son Bata promotes Chocano music and dance, and it benefits from yet another Medellin initiative: participatory budgeting. Residents here have voted to direct a share of government financing to new schools, clinics and college scholarships. Son Bata got to hire music teachers and bought instruments and is adding a new recording studio to its headquarters. A group of players showed me the studio under construction. From another room, music drifted over the barrio and into the warm night air.
I arrived in Medellin to see the ambitious and photogenic buildings that have gone up, but also to find what remains undone. The murder rate, while hardly low, is now under 60 per 100,000. Architecture alone obviously doesn't account for the drop in homicides, but the two aren't unrelated, either. Around the world, followers of architecture with a capital A have focused so much of their attention on formal experiments, as if aesthetics and social activism, twin Modernist concerns, were mutually exclusive. But Medellin is proof that they're not, and shouldn't be. Architecture, here and elsewhere, acts as part of a larger social and economic ecology, or else it elects to be a luxury, meaningless except to itself.
The story of Medellin's evolution turns out to be neither as rosy nor as straightforward as fans of new architecture have tended to portray it. It's generally told as a triumph for Sergio Fajardo, the son of an architect who is the governor of the region and who was the city's visionary mayor from 2004 to 2007. He pushed an agenda that linked education and community development with infrastructure and glamorous architecture.
But the city's transformation established roots before Mr. Fajardo took office, in thoughtful planning guidelines, amnesties and antiterrorism programs, community-based initiatives by Germany and the United Nations and a Colombian national policy mandating architectural interventions as a means to attack poverty and crime.
What sets Medellin apart is the particular strength of its culture of urbanism, which acts now almost like a civic calling card. The city's new mayor, Anibal Gaviria, spent an hour describing to me his dreams for burying a congested highway that runs through the middle of town, building an electric tram along the hillsides to stem the sprawl of the slums, adding a green belt of public buildings along the tram, rehabilitating the Medellin River and densifying the city center -- smart, public-spirited, improvements. It's as if, in this country whose relatively robust economy has underwritten many forward-thinking projects, every mayor here has to have enormous architectural and infrastructural plans, or risk coming across as small-minded or an outsider.
Mr. Gaviria, local designers, businessmen and community leaders sketched for me a picture of a city in which violence, much of it today by small drug traffickers, remains a big problem and victories are fragile. People in Medellin were cautious about the future, about easy solutions and seeing architecture as an end in itself. At the same time, they stressed the social and economic benefits that public architecture and new public spaces can create, and the wisdom of long-term, community-based policies of urban renewal.
''A holistic approach,'' is how Alejandro Echeverri, one of the principal architects of the city's transformation under Mr. Fajardo, described the philosophy.
I came here from Bogota, whose renewal programs starting in the late 1990s -- like earlier ones in Barcelona before the Olympics in 1992 -- set the stage for Medellin's revival. But now Bogota is suffering, as strains multiply on its famed rapid bus system and residents' faith in the city's future plummets.
Medellin, by contrast, still counts on an almost fierce parochial pride, a legacy of decent Modernist architecture dating back to the 1930s, a cadre of young architects being aggressively nurtured and promoted, and a commitment by local businesses to improve social welfare that begins with the city's biggest business: its state-owned utilities company, E.P.M.
You can't begin to grasp Medellin's architectural renaissance without understanding the role of E.P.M., the Empresas Publicas de Medellin, which supplies water, gas, sanitation, telecommunications and electricity. It's constitutionally mandated to provide clean water and electricity even to houses in the city's illegal slums, so that unlike in Bogota, where the worst barrios lack basic amenities, in Medellin there's a safety net.
More than that, E.P.M.'s profits (some $450 million a year) go directly to building new schools, public plazas, the metro and parks. One of the most beautiful public squares in the middle of Medellin was donated by E.P.M. And atop the slums of the city's Northeast district, E.P.M. paid for a park in the mountaintop jungle, linked to the district by its own cable car.
Federico Restrepo used to run E.P.M., before he became the city planner under Mr. Fajardo. ''We took a view that everything is interconnected -- education, culture, libraries, safety, public spaces,'' he told me, pointing out that while fewer than 20 percent of public school students here used to test at the national average in 2002, by 2009 the number exceeded 80 percent.
''Obviously it's not just that we built and renovated schools,'' he said. ''You have to work on the quality of teaching and nutrition in conjunction with architecture. But the larger point is that the goal of government should be providing rich and poor with the same quality education, transportation and public architecture. In that way you increase the sense of ownership.''
But of course ownership can't just be bestowed on poor neighborhoods; it must also be declared, in small, critical ways. In the troubled Comuna 13, two members of Revolucion Sin Muertos (Revolution Without Deaths) -- started not long ago by a group of neighborhood hip-hoppers rejecting the gang culture -- took me on a graffiti tour. At a crowded street corner, Daniel Felipe Quiceno, known as Dog, and Luis Fernando Alvarez, who is called AKA, pointed to a mural of four of their own, murdered by local gangs. Revolucion Sin Muertos paints murals around Comuna 13; sometimes residents put their own tags on them, as if to signal support. Murals, Mr. Alvarez said, have helped people here vent frustration and proclaim ownership of the neighborhood.
Progress is hard. Venture a few yards from the heralded new squares, library and cable car stations in the Santo Domingo barrio, across town in the hills of the Northeast district, and it's clear just how dramatic but also tenuous change is here. Mr. Echeverri met me at the cable car terminal one morning for the ride into the Northeast slums.
''We were already working before Fajardo on how to use cable cars to transform the surrounding area, to have the cable car stations as the neighborhood nervous system,'' he recalled. ''The barrios always had lots of energy but the energy was disconnected from the city.''
Our car rose high above a sea of illegal houses, the cable car stations creating a spine of commercial development up the mountainside. In what used to be a district too risky even for the police to patrol, we got off and wandered through a souk of restaurants, schools and clothing stores, leading onto busy squares and then to the Espana library, the most conspicuous emblem of the new Medellin.
''A seed to plant trust,'' is how Mr. Echeverri described the neighborhood after its makeover. ''The main physical transformation is to public space, but it's only the beginning,'' he cautioned, gesturing toward the sprawl of poverty just beyond the new development. Mr. Echeverri said all the headlines about the recovery of this much-photographed barrio have been great, but they've also had the unintended effect of inclining some officials to look elsewhere, for less politically complex projects.
He showed me the $4 million Espana library: three linked black boulders perched 1,500 feet over the valley, designed by the gifted Bogotan architect Giancarlo Mazzanti, which has become a community center and civic symbol. It's impressive from the outside.
But there are serious problems on the inside. The buildings are steel-frame boxes clad in dark stone tiles, with floating concrete cores -- in effect, boxes within the boxes with reading rooms, a child-care center, an auditorium and other facilities. Construction is shoddy, navigation confusing, the interior claustrophobic; acoustics are awful, windows scarce.
More impressive but less flashy is another library in Medellin by Mr. Mazzanti: the Leon de Greiff library in La Ladera also a trio of buildings, in this case well-connected cantilevered pods on slate pedestals, splayed like a fan across the brow of a hill. The shared roof is linked to a park next door. Views are spectacular. The reading rooms and children's play areas look out through panoramic windows.
Mr. Echeverri took me down the hillside to Andalucia, another part of the Northeast slums. Formerly ruled by gangs who held opposite sides of a garbage-clotted creek, it's now remade with a sports complex and school, new sidewalks, new mid-rise housing blocks and a bridge over the creek. Dozens of shops have opened. Men were tinkering beneath cars in the hot sun, chatting over beers, when I visited; children dawdled on the way home from school, eating ice cream on the bridge. A thousand eyes were on the streets.
There I found Mateo Gomez, a 20-year-old on his way to work at a local beer company in the city center. The cable car had cut his commute in half, from two hours to one, he told me.
''The Espana library changed our conception of ourselves,'' he added. ''Before, we felt a stigma. But we're still missing cultural spaces, the library closes too early, the situation is still very uncertain.''
From the hills of the Northeast, I made the circuit of some of the other new architecture in Medellin, much of it in and around the Botanical Garden, which had been the city's Central Park before it became too dangerous to visit, and was shut down. For a while, the garden was intended for demolition. Then, a decade or so ago, thanks to Pilar Velilla, the garden's director at the time, and with the support of Mr. Fajardo, the area was turned around.
Mr. Echeverri has designed a dramatic new science museum and public plaza across the street from the garden, and the garden has been lovingly renovated, its walls taken down, a gem of a circular pavilion, by Lorenzo Castro and Ana Elvira Velez, added at the entrance.
After an initial scheme to hire Norman Foster to devise another pavilion was rejected, a local competition was held, with the idea of advertising Medellin's own young architectural talent. The winner, JPRCR Architects (Camilo Restrepo runs it), and Plan B Architects (Felipe Mesa and Alejandro Bernal), came up with the Orquideorama, a towering wood meshwork canopy rising 65 feet above a latticed patio. Its 10 hexagonal flower-tree structures, collecting fresh rainwater and woven together like honeycombs, shelter an orchid collection and butterfly reserves. The canopy is at once formally economical and spectacular.
But the most remarkable building of all is a few blocks away, a cultural center in the neighborhood called Moravia, next to a vast garbage dump. The center is one of the last works by the Colombian master Rogelio Salmona, a quasi-Moorish design of refined simplicity, all transparency, modesty and openness. Carlos Uribe, an artist, who runs the center, showed off the beehive of below-ground practice rooms, the dance studio and theater opening onto the outdoors, the library and courtyard, flanked by low ramps, providing a desperately needed safe and attractive public space, where small children romped before watchful teachers among burbling fountains that recalled the Alhambra.
The authorities have lately been moving residents from the unsafe landfill next door to new housing on the city's periphery, which is understandable but a striking case of thoughtless urban planning, because the move isolates the residents from their jobs and what had become their neighborhood, with Salmona's building as its anchor.
''Of course we will continue to improve schools and neighborhoods,'' Mr. Gaviria, the mayor, had told me. ''But we also need to care for the mountains and the river, which to us are like the rivers and Central Park in New York.''
My impression from that conversation was that it's politically easier to propose new plans for burying highways and building trams in the hills than to untangle old problems, and that the city still had to be vigilant when it comes to housing policies. I met just before I left with eight young architects at the Museum of Modern Art, a steel mill from the 1930s, handsomely converted. ''We're still not thoughtful in terms of social housing, mixed neighborhoods,'' agreed Veronica Ortiz Murcia, a partner at Arquitectura y Espacio Urbano.
''There's a general feeling among young architects of a missed opportunity here,'' said another architect, Catalina Ortiz. That view was echoed by Camilo Restrepo and Alejandro Gonzalez.
Their skepticism seemed almost the most encouraging sign I had encountered in Medellin. The city has made big strides, after all, using cutting-edge architecture as a catalyst. But here young architects press for yet more creative solutions. They take for granted as their jobs both formal innovation and also the humanitarian role of architectural activism, leapfrogging an older generation of architects and others who have remained fixated on eye-catching buildings to grace the covers of glossy magazines.
It's this restless energy among an up-and-coming generation, in a city where people already take seriously the goal of greater equality, that seems to promise change will continue.

HEADLINE: To the Heights and the Slope, Add 'Downtown'

BYLINE: By C. J. HUGHES

 BODY:
IF one motto could be said to have guided all those responsible for the waves of development sustained by Downtown Brooklyn over the years, it might have been ''Think no small thoughts.''
The first land rush came in the early 1800s, after Robert Fulton's regular ferry service eased the link to Manhattan. Country lanes were transformed into lively blocks of city dwellings.
A century and a half later, efforts at ''slum clearance'' demolished many of those same buildings. In place of some went Cadman Plaza, a linked collection of three high-rise co-ops, with shops and parks.
In the same spirit, the city in the 1990s closed streets near Flatbush Avenue for the creation of the 14-building MetroTech Center. Low-slung tenements were relegated to the wrecking ball in favor of hulking bank offices. 
Courthouses have come and gone, too. In the 1960s a dome-topped judicial building was razed for the main tower of Brooklyn Law School, and the elevated tracks of the Fulton Avenue subway, which once curved past Borough Hall, were ripped down to make way for Kings County Supreme Court.
Not that other parts of New York haven't undergone serial makeovers. But to hear its landlords, city officials and residents tell it, Downtown Brooklyn has become extremely familiar with wholesale reinvention schemes.
They are not over yet. The area, which according to census estimates has 15,000 people (plus about 10,000 college students in dorms) in the 0.5 square miles unfolding at the ends of the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges, has over the last decade solidified a reputation as a residential destination.
With a flurry of new projects, it is no longer merely ''near Brooklyn Heights'' or ''on the edge of Boerum Hill,'' said Nora McCauley, who has lived here for six years. ''I've started to say just that I live Downtown.''
The name points up a physical difference between neighborhoods. Previously, in Brooklyn Heights, Ms. McCauley rented a two-bedroom with access to a leafy garden. In 2006, she paid $660,000 for a two-bedroom condo that faces the urban bustle of Court Street. ''We definitely sometimes miss sitting on a stoop,'' said Ms. McCauley, a stay-at-home mother. Still, her children enjoy riding scooters on the bluestone pavers of Columbus Park in front of Borough Hall, which also hosts a year-round farmer's market. ''It's really hard to beat in terms of convenience,'' she said.
In February, Downtown officially became more similar to the Heights, in that the city approved its Borough Hall Skyscraper Historic District, which covers Ms. McCauley's building and more than a dozen others. Most of the Heights is contained within a similar district. Development is monitored and controlled in such zones, and because of that, opposition to the skyscraper district was fierce. One foe was 75 Livingston Street, an Art Deco tower that once contained bail bondsmen's offices and since 1982 has been a residential co-op.
Ellen Murphy, the co-op board president, said one big concern was windows. Landmark rules require that when it comes time to replace the single-pane windows in any of the 90-plus units, the new ones will have to have multiple panes. The single pane offers better views, Ms. Murphy pointed out, adding, ''In this city, people think of landmarking as the best thing for everyone, and that's just not true.''
That said, however, other residents say the designation may reflect a growing awareness of Downtown as special and worth preserving from the next crush of development.
For proof of people's newfound attachment to the place, look no farther than the sidewalks. Years ago they were empty on Saturdays and Sundays, after the courts adjourned. But the shoppers, tourists and bicyclists now punctuating them ''give the area a bit more life on weekends,'' said Serafin Pinol-Roma, who moved here in 2005.
In 2005, he bought a one-bedroom in Concord Village, a multibuilding co-op with more than 1,000 units. Last year he traded up to a two-bedroom, for which he paid $444,000. An instructor of cell biology at City College in Upper Manhattan, he used to keep to Manhattan for entertainment as well. But he has recently embraced Brooklyn. ''It took a little time to cut the umbilical cord,'' was how he phrased it.
WHAT YOU'LL FIND
Downtown constitutes roughly the shape created by Clinton Street, Atlantic Avenue, Sands Street and Ashland Place, according to some brokers -- though borders can sometimes be a source of disagreement.
Take for instance the new 34-story rental from Archstone at 180 Montague Street, with 193 units, from studios to three-bedrooms. It is just outside the new historic district but bills its location as ''Brooklyn Heights.'' Then there's the 43-story rental at 343 Gold Street that has been named ''Avalon Fort Greene,'' though it's not lost on many people that the tree-shaded streets of historic Fort Greene, quite dissimilar, are a few blocks away.
Brooklyn's tallest apartment, the 51-story Brooklyner on Lawrence Street, with 491 units, provides yet more evidence that residents are displacing office workers, having gone up on the site of MetroTech 14. And another residential arrival, BellTel Lofts, a 250-unit condo, took over the former Verizon building at MetroTech 7.
Students are among the many residents of area high-rises, which lease out housing units to institutions like Brooklyn Law, St. Joseph's College and St. Francis College -- as well as Long Island University, which recently opened dorms on Fulton and Hoyt Streets.
The Center for Urban Science and Progress, a new research institute from New York York University and its Polytechnic Institute, recently struck a deal to buy 370 Jay Street, a city-owned building that has facilities for the M.T.A. and the police. Renovations will delay it until 2017, but the center, which will teach 500 students, promises to open in temporary space nearby in 2013.
WHAT YOU'LL PAY
In mid-May there were 86 co-ops, condos and town houses for sale, at a median price of $692,000, according to Streeteasy.com.
They ranged from a studio in Concord Village, at $229,000, to a five-bedroom duplex penthouse at 189 Bridge Street, a new condo on the Dumbo border, for $5.5 million. In the middle of the pack, offered at $665,000, was a one-bedroom at the Oro, a condo at 306 Gold Street that has struggled to find buyers.
Prices remain soft. Last year there were 400 sales at a median of $466,000, according to Streeteasy. In 2007, at the market's peak, there were 451 sales at a median of $596,000 -- which means prices are down 22 percent.
''I think there was overbuilding here when the market was high,'' said Amy Krolak, a Halstead broker who grew up nearby, ''because we didn't foresee the pullback in the economy. But as the economy recovers, this neighborhood will, too.''
THE COMMUTE
There are three subway stations: Court Street-Borough Hall, with M, R, 2, 3, 4 and 5 trains; Jay Street-MetroTech, with A, C, F and R trains; and High Street, with A and C trains. Midtown is a 20-minute ride. There are also many local and limited bus lines, including the B25, B26, B38 and B41.
WHAT TO DO
Night life hasn't fully kept pace with the new arrivals, says John Foley, who sometimes misses the cafes of Carroll Gardens, where he used to live. ''There aren't a lot of storefronts here, which is a huge difference,'' he said.
A number of restaurants still cater to the weekday crowd, like the Hale & Hearty outlet on Remsen Street that had its metal shutters locked on a recent Sunday.
But residents praise a Trader Joe's market that opened in 2008 in a former bank. Also, a Shake Shack burger stand opened in December in Fulton Street Mall, a car-free retail strip that just finished a $15 million renovation to remove dated arches and light poles.
Its developer, Albert Laboz, the chairman of the Fulton Mall Association, is planning 50,000 square feet of retail on the lower floors of the Municipal Building, which was recently accorded landmark status. Stores will include a ''hip restaurant, which the neighborhood badly needs,'' he said.
THE SCHOOLS
The area is thick with grade schools, both private and public. One option for prekindergarten through fifth grade is Public School 261, on Pacific Street. On state exams last year, 57 percent of its fourth-graders met standards in math, 71 percent in English, versus 62 and 51 percent citywide.
A new middle school, soon open on Tillary Street, will be an extension of Public School 8, a popular elementary school in Brooklyn Heights.
For high school, a nearby possibility is Science Skills High School on Flatbush. SAT averages last year were 412 in reading, 418 in math and 397 in writing, versus 436, 460 and 431 citywide.
THE HISTORY
Walt Whitman, the poet, published his ''Leaves of Grass'' in 1855 at 96 Cranberry Street, which was razed for the Cadman complex but ultimately inspired creation of the three-acre Walt Whitman Park. Used for parking during the expansion of the federal courthouse next door, the park reopened in December after a $4.5 million renovation.

HEADLINE: Bangkok Rising

BYLINE: By PANKAJ MISHRA

 BODY:
One morning in January, I watched as young Thai men and women emerged from the Erawan Bangkok shopping mall, put down their Comme des Garcons and Burberry bags, and bowed with folded hands to the Hindu creation deity Brahma at the Erawan shrine conveniently located just outside. In Bangkok, it seemed, retail therapy was not a secular substitute for religious healing, but rather went together with it. This was merely one contradiction in a city famous for them. Walking past the massage parlors and transvestite clubs of the red-light district Nana and into the packed temples and spirit houses, I marveled at how the city combines the promise of guilt-free sex with a profound faith in the Buddhist cycle of karma.
Paradoxes of course come cheap in Asia, where embattled tradition still dictates terms to a triumphant modernity. But Bangkok appears to possess more of them than Mumbai, Hong Kong or Taipei. Its architecture adds to the impression of a fundamental incoherence: Disneylandish for the most part, it mingles Doric columns with Thai country houses, rampant neon and the giant concrete pylons of the expressways and elevated Skytrain network. 
Unlike its Asian neighbors, Thailand was never colonized by Europe, and its sense of continuity with the past has never been radically disrupted. The American war in Indochina, profoundly damaging on the other side of Thai borders, ushered Thailand into a profitable peace, as a whole industry of indulgence blossomed to cater to weary warriors. While Burma, Cambodia and Laos succumbed to civil war and genocide, Bangkok, bolstered by the American war chest, developed a modern economy.
Though military dictatorships maintained an artificial peace for decades, electoral democracy has stoked terrible social conflict in recent years. The military establishment resents the street power of populist politicians like Thaksin Shinawatra, Thailand's former prime minister. Since a 2006 military coup overthrew Thaksin and forced him into exile, protests and riots have repeatedly broken out on the streets of the capital. Still, the Thais' reverence for their monarchy remains seemingly unshakeable.
Visiting Bangkok recently after many years, I found it hard not to be charmed, even seduced, by the city. A few weeks before I arrived, Thailand's worst flooding in 70 years had inundated low-lying parts of Bangkok, killing 600 people, shutting down hundreds of factories and disrupting global supply chains of automobiles and computers. (If you are chafing at the increased prices of hard disk drives, blame the floods in Bangkok.)
Downtown Bangkok had mostly escaped the floods, but it had barely survived the intense rioting of 2010, when red-shirted supporters of Shinawatra, demanding early parliament elections, turned large parts of the financial district into a war zone. The violence left many buildings, including CentralWorld, one of Southeast Asia's largest shopping malls, in smoldering ruins.
Feeling cautious during my first couple of days in town, I crisscrossed the city in the Skytrain, never venturing too far from its elevated arcades, the cluster of malls and food courts around its stations, and its many television monitors incessantly cajoling you to buy the latest weight-loss programs and shampoos.
My fears felt absurd when I ventured out to Chatuchak, apparently the world's biggest weekend market, and saw the vast crowds moving serenely through stalls stocked with everything from jeans and DVDs to ceramics. Outside the CentralWorld Mall, where the red-shirted protesters had set up base camp, the traffic had been restored to gridlock. In 2011, Thais elected Thaksin's sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, as prime minister; Thaksin himself is said to be plotting an early return to Thailand. Despite the political instability, life, it quickly became clear, was going on. Indeed, for some, it had never been seriously disrupted.
Soon after arriving, I met the American writer and restaurateur Jarrett Wrisley in his neighborhood of Thong Lor. Wrisley had moved to Bangkok from Shanghai in 2009 with plans to set up a restaurant. But the next April, when the fighting broke out, he was confined to his home, cooking for himself and his wife throughout the riots while men outside smashed telephone booths and turned energy drinks into bombs.
Wrisley's restaurant, Soul Food Mahanakorn, opened to acclaim in late 2010. Then the floods came in the autumn of 2011, and he resignedly put up sandbags around the restaurant and left. He returned after five days to an unimpaired but seemingly unneeded business; news of the floods had driven away tourists and businessmen. Things were demoralizingly bad in the usually busy days of December. One night, he served only seven customers.
But on the January night when I met Wrisley, his restaurant, which specializes in northeastern Thai comfort food, was full. I was introduced to Pierre Metz, a businessman from Luxembourg who was off to Myanmar to set up a chocolate shop. As that country, one of the world's most isolated and potentially rich, rapidly opened up earlier this year, Bangkok's hotel lobbies and restaurants were awash with the anticipation of a new frontier town in Yangon. Wrisley himself was getting ready to go to Myanmar to write about that country's answer to Jay-Z, but he seemed in no hurry to open up a restaurant there; Bangkok was still the main place of opportunity.
Indeed, as I discovered, the city's sense of possibility barely seemed to have been dented by the floods and the riots. In the royal district of Dusit, the Thai pop star and actor Krissada Sukosol Clapp has, with the help of the architect Bill Bensley, turned his family's property into what promises to be Bangkok's leading resort hotel. The floods had postponed the opening of the hotel from autumn 2011 to June 2012, and when I visited the property, the ground around it was still soggy. But the setbacks had made Kriss, as he is called, and his wife, Melanie, more determined.
Proudly, they showed me around the hotel, which overlooks the Chao Praya River and has 39 spacious rooms, all furnished with the Sukosol Clapp family's collection of antiques and artwork. There are bits of history, too, in its restaurant, which comprises three traditional teak houses originally built in 1959 by Jim Thompson, a legendary American resident who after arriving in Bangkok as a spy for the O.S.S., the C.I.A.'s predecessor, went native.
Kriss, who is half American, had himself gone a bit native, having recently returned to Bangkok from New York. There was no place he'd rather be, he said. And in this he seemed to be like many other Thais -- at ease anywhere in the world but drawn inescapably to their old city.
At the Serindia Gallery off Charoen Krung Road, Bangkok's oldest street, I met Shane Suvikapakornkul, a curator and publisher. Born and brought up in Bangkok, Suvikapakornkul had also returned from a long residence in the United States to set up the gallery, from scratch, in 2009. He said he was happy to be in close proximity to his elderly parents. But the hopelessly congested and polluted city of his youth had also become more habitable, largely thanks to the Skytrain, he said, which made it possible to travel painlessly around the city.
I confided to him that I had become addicted to the Skytrain. The garrulous TV screens inside the train and on the platforms no longer annoyed me; I was transfixed by the scenes on view out the windows -- vacant parking lots, children bent over homework in tiny apartments.
The elevated train was giving me an attractive new perspective on a city that many people describe as shapeless and unprepossessing. Bangkok's pleasures, it seems, lie behind its gritty surfaces, and not only in the city's many fancy hotels and malls, its world-class aquarium or the much-visited temples to the Buddha, Wat Arun and Wat Pho.
There are lesser-known sites, like the temple of Wat Ratchanadda, with its ''Iron Palace'' built in the Burmese style. And few hotels in the world match the Art Deco Atlanta for sheer eccentricity. The floating markets, especially Taling Chan, remind you of the canals that once ran through the city. Wandering deeper into the sois (alleys) off Sukhumvit, you can still imagine the dreamy landscape of palm groves, rice paddies and gardens the city has supplanted.
Bangkok's street life has an effortless cosmopolitanism: Chinese jewelers mingling with bespoke tailors from the Punjab; Thai women in hot pants in Soi 4 coexisting easily with their compatriots in chador in the Arab quarter across the street. It is never quite clear what the next street junction might bring -- men smoking shishas on the sidewalks or more sushi and karaoke bars, designed for the tens of thousands of Japanese residents in the city. The city heaves with young people, casually but elegantly dressed, and possessed of a natural grace. And even the numerous shopping malls are rescued from the tedium of brand-sameness by their playful quality. The newly constructed Terminal 21 poses as an airport, with the floors offering simulacrums of Tokyo, London, Istanbul and San Francisco.
I made the unavoidable literary pilgrimage to the Mandarin Oriental and spent an idle hour on a veranda strewn with white wicker seats, sipping beer and wondering how the riverscape appeared across the decades to Joseph Conrad, Graham Greene, John Le Carre and Gore Vidal. I grew to like the sound of the riverboats' tires crashing into the pier's rotten wood and developed favorites among the organic fruit juice vendors at the Skytrain arcades. I ate mostly at the Indian eateries scattered around the city and noted, with the fascination of a lifelong vegetarian, the taxonomy of Bangkok's street food. For instance, small motorbikes with attached trays on the back turned out to be selling waterbugs and fried worms, grasshoppers and cicadas. Then there were fried fish, egg noodles, rice porridge, stir-fries, barbecued fatty pork skewers, sausages (sai krok Isaan) and grilled chicken with sticky rice and som tam. In Chinatown, the most popular dishes to my half-averted eyes seemed to be Cantonese-style roast duck and pork, and crispy pork belly (moo krob).
Venturing into the red-light alleys off Sukhumvit, I came across scenes that had appalled me when I first encountered them 15 years ago: the single men from rich countries looking for quick and cheap gratification with financially needy migrants from Thailand's poor north. I had seen these men, and their easy power over the locals, as the beneficiaries of large political and economic imbalances. This still seemed true, but my vision had shifted somewhat. Patpong, where women spat out Ping-Pong balls from between their legs, now seemed pure kitsch. And the buffoonish solicitations were more amusing than annoying.
The vicious class warfare on Bangkok's streets has dimmed the old image of Thailand as the ''Land of the Smiles,'' and of the Thais as an exquisitely mannered and hospitable people. Though Thailand escaped colonialism, it does not appear immune to the perils of globalization -- uneven growth, extreme inequality -- and Bangkok is now the main theater of the country's socioeconomic conflicts. The floods, damaging mostly poorer parts of the city and largely leaving the affluent bits alone, reinforced the city's bitter class divisions. But there are also many redemptive stories of solidarity, sometimes in unexpected places.
As the waters rose in late 2011, the Four Seasons Hotel, its grand lobby reminiscent of the Peninsula in Hong Kong, threw open its empty rooms to its staff and their families, the last of whom left in early January. For many staff members, it had been a strange experience to work so close to their families. And the hotel managers faced unfamiliar challenges: how to occupy the scores of children running around the hotel. (The schools were closed.) Meanwhile, a manhole near the hotel disgorged a python, a detail one Four Seasons executive reluctantly divulged, fearing it would deter people from visiting Bangkok.
She need not have been worried: occupancy rates are bouncing back -- Bangkok is simply too irresistible a destination to tourists and businessmen. Though confronted with serious losses, manufacturers appear unlikely to relocate their factories to Vietnam or Indonesia. And the economy, which contracted in the last quarter of 2011, is now picking up again.
One unusually cool evening in Lumphini Park, listening to a free concert by the Bangkok Symphony Orchestra, I wondered if the cliches about Bangkok needed to be updated. (All cities have them, these short and necessary guides to their character.) The musical fare varied from ''Love Me Tender'' to Vivaldi's ''Four Seasons'' to Thai pop songs. And the crowd -- trendy youth on casual dates, enviably svelte grandmothers resting from a bout of tai chi -- lapped it up. Then, when the national anthem was played, all arose in unison and stood patriotically solemn. Lying on the grass, watching the lights of the business district come on, I began to think that Bangkok, battered but unbowed by natural disasters and political violence, was revealing a new inner essence, and providing another useful cliche about itself -- that it is, above all, resilient.
HOTELS The Four Seasons Thirty years old next year, this is still one of the best places to stay in Bangkok. 011-66-2-126-8866; doubles from about $190. The Siam Hotel Opening in June at the riverfront, this deluxe property has 39 individually decorated rooms. 011-66-2-206-6999; doubles from $519.

The third floor of Siam Centre (Rama 1 Road; 011-66-2-2658-1000) is another showcase for Thai fashion designers -- cutting-edge, high quality and reasonably priced.

HEADLINE: Is Insider Trading Part of the Fabric?

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
EVEN before the news was official, it filtered out -- unofficially -- to Wall Street.
On a trading floor in Midtown Manhattan, the squawk boxes were set to relay a market-moving bulletin at 10 a.m. This was the news: An analyst at the investment house was raising his assessment of Amkor Technology, a big name in computer chips.
But it was only 9:30, and Amkor's share price was already rising. By the time the announcement came, it was up 4 percent. ''It was clear that my research had been leaked,'' the analyst, Ted Parmigiani, recalls.
But leaked how, and by whom? To Mr. Parmigiani, there was only one explanation: someone inside his own research department had tipped off the firm's traders, as well as some fast-money hedge funds. 
Nearly seven years later, the events of that June day -- and countless others like it, up and down Wall Street -- still rankle him. The fallout effectively ended his career. The firm he worked for, Lehman Brothers, was eventually undone by greed and hubris, its spectacular collapse in September 2008 a symbol of an age of financial excess.
Against the sweeping morality tale of Lehman, the story of one analyst may seem trivial. But it's a story central to post-crisis Wall Street, and to the regulators watching over it. Federal authorities today are trumpeting efforts to root out insider trading, and they've caught some big fish. Yet many on Wall Street suspect that the sort of chicanery that Mr. Parmigiani says he witnessed at Lehman may be as common as ever.
More worrying, from his perspective, is that he provided the Securities and Exchange Commission with evidence pointing to frequent insider trading involving analyst research at Lehman, but the S.E.C. ultimately did not bring a case. Mr. Parmigiani spent two and a half years giving information to the S.E.C. He produced materials indicating that Lehman sales representatives were tipped off to upcoming research changes; data showing suspicious trades in dozens of stocks; organizational charts and floor plans showing that some Lehman executives who were part of the research department were located near sales and trading desks. These departments are supposed to be separated.
With that ammunition, the S.E.C. opened an investigation, case HO-10864. Officials told him that his evidence was credible.
Then the case died. And after Lehman's collapse its employees have scattered across Wall Street.
Since the financial crisis, the S.E.C. has spent a lot of time and money trying to plug leaks. In a case worthy of ''Law & Order,'' prosecutors used wiretaps to ensnare Raj Rajaratnam, the billionaire Galleon hedge fund manager whose web of tipsters stretched from Wall Street to some of the mightiest corporations in the land. For his crimes, Mr. Rajaratnam, whom prosecutors called ''the modern face of illegal insider trading,'' was sentenced last October to 11 years in prison.
Mr. Rajaratnam's conviction, in the largest insider-trading scandal in a generation, handed a much-needed win to the beleaguered S.E.C. Only two years earlier, the commission had been lambasted for missing glaring evidence of Bernard L. Madoff's vast Ponzi scheme.
But Mr. Parmigiani and others suspect that the P.R. of the Galleon case glosses over risks that insider trading can and does occur regularly at many Wall Street firms. In their view, it has become institutionalized. The flow of information between a firm's analysts, its traders and its clients -- a lucrative heads-up on stock upgrades and downgrades, for instance -- can bolster trading profits, brokerage commissions and, ultimately, Wall Street paydays. Those in the know can get rich before the rest of us know what happened.
''Prosecutors say insider trading won't be tolerated, that this is justice,'' Mr. Parmigiani says of the Galleon case. ''But they refuse to acknowledge that their widespread net has a very big hole in it.''
What exactly happened at Lehman? Mr. Parmigiani says traders there were routinely advised of changes in analysts' company ratings before those changes were made public. That way, Lehman could profit on subsequent market moves. Here is how he describes it: First, research officials tipped off the traders; then Lehman's proprietary trading desk, which cast bets with the firm's own money, positioned itself accordingly. Lehman salespeople also alerted favored hedge funds. Only later, he says, were ratings changes made public.
Blowing the whistle on any big corporation, as Mr. Parmigiani tried to do in the case of Lehman, is almost always perilous. Shortly after noting the suspicious trading in Amkor, Mr. Parmigiani says, he was fired for not being a team player. He has since been unable to find work on Wall Street.
John Nester, a spokesman for the S.E.C., said it conducted a careful, thorough investigation of Mr. Parmigiani's allegations.
''Not only did we investigate the circumstances surrounding each of the research reports specifically identified by Mr. Parmigiani, we conducted a broader examination into the trading by Lehman clients in all companies in which there was a material change in the stock price following the issuance of a Lehman research report,'' Mr. Nester said. ''We also investigated the communications between 46 Lehman employees and 56 Lehman clients, including nearly 100,000 e-mails.''
The S.E.C. also analyzed voluminous trading data and interviewed numerous Lehman employees, he said. ''After all that, there simply was not any evidence in this case to support the conclusion that Lehman, its employees or its clients had committed insider trading.''
Publicly, the S.E.C. is taking a strong stance against insider trading. Officials say the commission is not only going after insider traders but also taking action against firms. A recent case against Goldman Sachs suggests that the S.E.C. recognizes the potential for improprieties that can occur if traders receive special access to research analysts' work.
In the case, the S.E.C. alleged that Goldman analysts had shared trading ideas and other information with select clients. Although the S.E.C. did not charge any individuals with insider trading or tipping, Goldman's activities ''created a serious and substantial risk that analysts would share material, nonpublic information concerning their published research,'' the S.E.C. said. Goldman paid $22 million to settle the matter. As is common in such cases, it neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing.
In an interview with Reuters in late April, Robert S. Khuzami, the S.E.C. director of enforcement, said: ''We have charged firms for having compliance failures even where there were no underlying violations. We want to send a message that businesses have to have controls in place in order to prevent fraud.''
Indeed, the S.E.C. filed roughly 60 insider-trading cases in its 2011 fiscal year alone. But aside from a few that sprang from the Rajaratnam case and a handful of other sizable cases, many involved minor players and small sums. Of the 93 people charged during that period, 37 had pocketed less than $100,000 on their inside trades, according to the S.E.C.; 19 made $50,000 or less; and one netted just $8,391.
Lewis D. Lowenfels, an expert in securities laws in New York, says the S.E.C. is wasting time and money by going after small fish.
''This raises questions about the allocation of resources at a time when there is a real hue and cry that the S.E.C. is not getting sufficient funds from Congress,'' Mr. Lowenfels says. ''When you see that such a disproportionate amount goes to this kind of insider trading, you really have to wonder if the S.E.C. is using this as a means to resuscitate their stature, post-Madoff.''
The real potential targets are much, much bigger. Many people, inside and outside financial circles, have long suspected that Wall Street firms alert favored clients to analyst research before the investing public.
Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who works closely with whistle-blowers, examined the material that Mr. Parmigiani brought to the S.E.C. Expressing disappointment in its handling of the allegations, Mr. Grassley said: ''This case emphasizes serious questions about the S.E.C.'s culture of deference to Wall Street and big players going back a long time. The S.E.C. obtained what appears to be clear evidence of, at a minimum, disregard for regulations designed to ensure that Wall Street firms can't leak inside information to preferred clients prior to public announcements. Yet there appears to have been no consequences.''
A Rare Kind of Case
When most people think of insider trading, they probably think of Gordon Gekko, the corrupt financier played by Michael Douglas in the 1987 film ''Wall Street.'' In the movie, the hot tips were about corporate takeovers.
Mergers and acquisitions are big, market-moving news, but so are corporate earnings announcements. These statements are ripe for insider trading, particularly when results take analysts and investors by surprise.
But while insider trading commonly involves nonpublic corporate information, advance warning on research changes can also yield quick, illicit gains. The S.E.C. said as much in a rare research case it filed in 2007 involving an executive at the Swiss banking giant UBS. In that case, eight individuals and three hedge funds were charged with profiting on tips about coming analyst ratings changes -- ''valuable and material, nonpublic information,'' the S.E.C. said. One executive went to jail, and others settled with the S.E.C.
Mr. Parmigiani says his experience at Lehman made him suspect that the firm was trying to profit by trading ahead of changes in analyst recommendations.
'' 'We're trying to monetize the research,' is what they would tell me when they asked for advance warning of rating changes,'' Mr. Parmigiani says. ''They would say: 'Just let me know. We've got to relay a heads-up to trading. We've got to protect the house.' ''
Clash With Superiors
Ted Parmigiani didn't take the usual road to Wall Street. In 1986, at the age of 17, he dropped out of high school to join the Navy. He served on the U.S.S. Midway and gained expertise in accounting and supply-chain aspects of technology.
Paul Dublino, who lives near Orlando, Fla., enlisted at the same time and considers Mr. Parmigiani a friend. Mr. Dublino says his old Navy buddy impressed him with his intelligence and honesty. ''No matter what he ever did, he excelled at it,'' Mr. Dublino says. ''I don't think he has any type of fabrication of any sort in him. He tells it how it is.''
Mr. Parmigiani resigned from active duty in 1990, went to college on the G.I. Bill and then collected a master's degree in finance. He joined Lehman in 2002.
At that time, Wall Street research was under a microscope. Eliot Spitzer, then the New York attorney general, had exposed how analysts routinely slanted research to win lucrative investment banking business. In 2003, Lehman was among 10 firms that reached a $1.4 billion settlement. They all promised to wall off research operations from other parts of their business.
But Mr. Parmigiani says he was asked to break those new rules. Lehman bosses, he contends, told him to write research that would support investment banking business -- a violation of the Spitzer settlement. He says he was warned not to make negative comments about companies, even when he thought they were merited, lest he antagonize corporate executives. In 2003, he says, he was chastised for downgrading a company that was a corporate finance client of Lehman's.
Most alarming, Mr. Parmigiani says, was that Lehman had created a system that gave its stock trading desks access to its analysts' research recommendations before those recommendations were made public. The Product Management Group, as this business unit was known, scheduled analysts' calls on the firm-wide squawk box system and was part of the research department.
Mr. Parmigiani says the Product Management Group often delayed the announcements of recommendation changes for no apparent reason. He says he began to suspect that the delays were meant to allow Lehman's traders to put on positions ahead of the news and to give the firm's top sales representatives time to alert favored clients.
On March 30, 2005, Mr. Parmigiani had been scheduled to meet with a series of hedge fund clients, including Moore Capital, to discuss his research. At the last minute, Jared Demark, a vice president in Lehman's institutional equity sales who covered the hedge funds and had planned to accompany him, bowed out. In an e-mail to Mr. Parmigiani, Mr. Demark wrote: ''Go to the Moore meeting without me, we have big ratings change looming ... ''
While Mr. Parmigiani did not learn precisely what Mr. Demark meant by that e-mail, it fueled Mr. Parmigiani's concern that Lehman was alerting hedge funds to analysts' pending changes.
Chris Boehning, a lawyer at Paul Weiss, said his client, Mr. Demark, would not comment.
he S.E.C. staff ''conducted a careful investigation beginning in the fall of 2008 and concluded that there was no basis to recommend an enforcement action,'' Mr. Boehning said. ''We were very pleased with the thorough way the S.E.C. went about its work.''
That same day of the e-mail, Mr. Parmigiani said, another salesman told him that he had received a message about an imminent industrywide downgrade and had to start alerting clients.
Even though the Product Management Group was part of the research department, it was on the second floor, next to the stock trading desks and close to the firm's top institutional sales representatives covering hedge funds.
Before long, Mr. Parmigiani and his superiors butted heads. In 2004, he says, he was asked to vet a company he had properly referred to Lehman's investment bankers for a securities offering. He recalled Stuart Linde, then director of United States equity research, prodding him to be positive in his analysis, to help ensure that the deal got done. When he questioned whether this followed the rules handed down in the Spitzer settlement, Mr. Linde took offense, he said. But he says he stood his ground.
''One of the things I took out of the military is the one rule and duty you have is a duty to disobey an unlawful order,'' Mr. Parmigiani says.
Mr. Linde, now director of United States equity research at Barclays Capital, declined to comment. A Barclays spokesman said Mr. Linde had never received a subpoena from the S.E.C. about the matter.
For Mr. Parmigiani, the final straw came on June 1, 2005, when he decided to change his rating on Amkor from ''sell'' to ''neutral.'' He had submitted his change to the Product Management Group that day, but then was told the switch wouldn't be announced until the following day.
The next morning, he sent his upgrade to the research committee, which agreed that he should discuss Amkor on the squawk box at 10 a.m. But before he could speak, Amkor stock jumped in unusually heavy trading. He accused firm officials of distributing his upgrade ahead of time.
About two weeks later, Lehman fired him, with two weeks' salary and no severance. On his permanent employee record filed with regulators, Lehman said he had been dismissed because he had ''failed to meet performance expectations.'' Those words effectively ended his Wall Street career, he says.
He filed a wrongful-termination case in May 2006, which was eventually settled for an undisclosed sum. The check was signed by Richard S. Fuld Jr., who, as chief executive, would later preside over Lehman's collapse.
Waning Interest at the S.E.C.
Unable to find work on Wall Street, Mr. Parmigiani took his story to the S.E.C. On a Friday in late April 2008, he left a message for Linda Chatman Thomsen, then the commission's director of enforcement. The next Monday, an enforcement attorney called back and invited him to conduct a conference call with S.E.C. officials. A two-hour conversation ensued, during which he described his experiences at Lehman.
Then, that April, S.E.C. officials asked him to come to Washington from his home in the San Francisco Bay Area. He spent a day with four enforcement lawyers. ''They copied all my stuff and we sat there for six hours,'' Mr. Parmigiani says. ''They asked me questions, they took notes. They were shocked.''
He says the S.E.C. lawyers told him they would get back to him.
But then, as the financial crisis flared that summer, the S.E.C.'s interest waned. After Lehman failed, Mr. Parmigiani got a call from two of the lawyers, signaling that the S.E.C. was probably not going to pursue the matter. The S.E.C. spokesman said the lawyers would not comment.
Mr. Parmigiani took his brief to Senator Grassley's office. Officials there sent a letter to the S.E.C., inquiring about the status of the investigation. By then, however, Ms. Thomsen, the enforcement director, had left the agency for private practice. Messages left for Ms. Thomsen were not returned.
Eventually, Mr. Parmigiani had another meeting with the S.E.C., in September 2010, and presented an analysis by Steven P. Feinstein, an associate professor of finance at Babson College. Relying on public information, Mr. Feinstein had analyzed the price movements of stocks in 361 downgrades by Lehman analysts between 2004 and 2008. The sample excluded any stocks that had been the subject of market-moving news -- like earnings reports or other announcements -- as well as shares that had been downgraded recently by other Wall Street firms.
Mr. Feinstein concluded that the stocks ''exhibited significantly different price behavior on the two trading days preceding a rating downgrade by Lehman Brothers than they did on other days.'' The results, Mr. Feinstein said, indicated that Lehman Brothers ''apparently engaged in tipping,'' and that stock prices were affected and that investors suffered damages as a result.
Mr. Parmigiani says the S.E.C. seemed impressed with the study. One lawyer, he says, told him that the commission ''really liked the case'' but that they did not have enough to go forward.
But Mr. Nester of the S.E.C. said a report connecting analyst actions with stock moves does not make an insider-trading case. ''Fortunately, our staff can and does interrogate witnesses, review contemporaneous documents, including e-mails, and scrutinize trading records,'' he said. ''That is evidence, and that is what determines whether insider trading has occurred.''Frustrated, Mr. Parmigiani called investigators for Preet Bharara, United States attorney for the Southern District of New York. These were the prosecutors bringing the Galleon cases.
''I told them that Galleon was one of the spokes of the wheel but that it was not the wheel itself,'' Mr. Parmigiani says, but his discussions led nowhere as well. Mr. Bharara's office declined to comment.
At his last meeting with the S.E.C., Mr. Parmigiani recalled, one of the officials said, ''We never doubted your credibility.''
Today, Mr. Parmigiani spends much more time with his two young children; his wife has become the family's breadwinner. He has paid a price for trying to blow the whistle on Lehman, but says he has no regrets. Still, he says, his experience suggests that the authorities are reluctant to go after high-level executives on Wall Street.
As he puts it: ''Law-abiding citizens should not have to beg civil servants charged with law enforcement to do their jobs.''

HEADLINE: Paying Less for That Rental Car

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
HITTING the road this summer? Better get booking.
As the busy summer car-rental season begins, prices are expected to climb. ''In early June through the end of August, these rates will spike,'' said Neil Abrams, president of Abrams Consulting Group, which tracks the car rental industry. Last July, for example, the average rate for a weekly airport rental of a compact car booked seven days ahead was $369.62, or 56 percent more than the $236.73 charged in March, according to the Abrams Travel Data Index. Here are some tips to keep costs down. 
Let go of name brands. Look beyond Avis, Hertz and other big national chains to independent agencies like Payless and Fox Rent a Car. Because of lower operating costs, their cars, which can be found at Web sites like CarRentals.com and CarRentalExpress.com, typically cost 15 to 30 percent less than rentals from mainstream agencies. Another company with an unfamiliar name, at least to most Americans, is the German agency Sixt, which has begun opening branches in the southeastern United States, including in Atlanta, Miami and Orlando, Fla. To boost brand recognition, the company, whose fleet includes BMWs, Mercedes-Benzes and Volkswagens, is offering deep discounts. For example, a Mercedes C-class cost $38.81 a day in late May at Sixt's Orlando airport location, according to a recent search. By comparison, the lowest rate offered by Hertz for the same dates was $50.57 a day for a Kia Rio or similar economy car.
Dig for virtual discounts. Search for discounts and coupons on sites like Promotionalcodes.com and CouponWinner.com, or type in the name of a rental company and ''coupon code'' into Google to see what turns up. Rental car companies offer discount codes to members of frequent flier programs, and other organizations they partner with, including AAA, Costco and BJ's, so check those sites if you're a member. But don't stop there. Most major car rental companies allow you to combine discount codes with a coupon code. For example, a full-size car from Hertz over Memorial Day weekend at Washington Dulles airport was $255.71 in a recent search. Plugging in the discount code 62455 for United Airlines frequent fliers and Hertz's promotional coupon code, 168210, brought the price down to $160.02.
Track rates through Autoslash.com. This site, which continually checks for lower rates and coupons until your trip date, can be used in one of two ways: You can track the price of a rental booked elsewhere, or you can book directly through Autoslash, which currently works with Payless, Sixt, Fox and E-Z Rent-A-Car, and the site will apply any discounts it finds.
The drawback with the second option is limited inventory. Major companies don't like the idea that Autoslash capitalizes on the fact that consumers can usually change or cancel car reservations at any time without penalty. Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group, as well as Hertz and Advantage, recently pulled its inventory from the site, as my colleague Ron Lieber recently reported. Enterprise, which owns National and Alamo, won't let AutoSlash list its cars either.
Avoid the airport. Off-airport locations are typically cheaper than airport locations, which tend to tack on fees that can raise the price by 30 percent or more. For example, a compact rental from Hertz at Boston Logan International Airport over the Fourth of July weekend was recently listed at $50.49 a day, or $219 a week with taxes at Carrentals.com, a unit of Hotwire. By taking the subway to the Arlington stop and walking a couple of blocks to the local Hertz lot, a traveler could cut costs to $39.98 a day, or $146.65 with taxes for the week.
Reserve the car for longer than you need it. This may sound counterintuitive, but tacking an extra day on to that weekly rental or even adding a couple of hours to extend it over a weekend -- with no intention of returning the car that late -- can actually lower your rate. The strategy takes advantage of lower prices aimed at leisure travelers who are more likely to travel on weekends, said Marty Paz, a telecommunications manager from Las Vegas who has become something of a car rental pricing sleuth since he began avidly renting cars to pad his frequent flier account. (Last year alone he rented more than 100 vehicles, accumulating a quarter-million miles.)
Mr. Paz said you are essentially tricking the system into thinking you're booking a two-day weekend rental, which typically has a lower base rate, with the goal of returning the car early. For example, the rate for a midsize car rental from Alamo at the Las Vegas International Airport, from noon on Thursday, June 7, to noon on Friday was recently listed on Alamo's Web site for $35.95 (or a base rate of $27.27 plus $11.41 in taxes and fees). But extending the return time to 2 p.m. -- two hours after the weekend rates ''officially'' kick in -- drops the base rate to $15.18 a day. Though the overall estimated cost shows an additional $10.12 extra in hourly charges, you can still return the car at noon and get the lower rate, said Mr. Paz, who added, ''Oops, you got there early.''
Negotiate. Even after you've booked the best possible rate, it can be worth swinging by the rental counter to see if you can finagle your way into a better car. ''You don't ask, you don't get,'' said Mr. Abrams, the rental car consultant. Success with this strategy can depend on everything from the type and number of cars on the lot to the mood of the clerk, he added. But some companies are happy to put you in a bigger, or less popular, vehicle for the cost of a compact -- if it's in their interest.
''I frequently need minivans for the volunteer activities I do with teens,'' said Marty Paz, the car-rental rate hacker, who has noticed by perusing the parking lot that there is often a glut of minivans at one location he frequently rents from on the weekend. ''Often times I've reserved an economy car for a Friday and just offered graciously: 'If there's a van, I'll take that. I don't mind,' and for the price of the economy car I get the minivan.'' (A larger vehicle, of course, will require more fuel.)
Prepay. Taking a page from hotels, rental car companies are offering discounts of up to 20 percent to travelers willing to prepay. In a recent search for weekly rentals at Boston Logan International Airport in mid June, for example, Hertz was offering economy cars for $173 a week at the ''pay now'' rate. The ''pay later'' rate was about $30 more. The trade off for locking in a low-rate? Cancellation penalties ranging from $10 with Budget to $50 if canceling within 24 hours with Hertz. And don't forget about Priceline.com and Hotwire.com, which offer deep discounts to travelers willing to be locked into a preset price before finding out the rental car company.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Practical Traveler column last Sunday, about paying less for rental cars, misstated the relationship of Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group to Hertz and Advantage, in a section about Autoslash.com, a site that checks for lower rates and coupons. Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group is a holding company that owns Dollar Rent A Car and Thrifty Car Rental; it does not own Hertz and Advantage.

HEADLINE: Amanda Burden Wants to Remake New York. She Has 19 Months Left.

BYLINE: By JULIE SATOW

 BODY:
AMANDA M. BURDEN, in a sheath dress, impossibly thin and with a blond bob reminiscent of the ''Mad Men'' '60s, wore a serene smile as she oversaw a recent public hearing in a drab hearing room near City Hall.
''Today, I am thrilled to vote on the department's latest sustainability initiative,'' said Ms. Burden, the director of the New York City Planning Department, her clipped diction and sophisticated dress contrasting with the worn-out rug and metal chairs of her surroundings. Ms. Burden was referring to Zone Green, ''the most comprehensive effort of any city in the nation,'' she said, to use zoning to spur environmentally efficient building.
It is the latest effort by Ms. Burden to transform the face of New York. Since 2002, when she was appointed to head City Planning, she has overseen the wholesale rezoning of the city, with 115 rezoning plans covering more than 10,300 blocks; by the end of her administration, the department is expected to have rezoned about 40 percent of New York, an unprecedented number. 
On Ms. Burden's watch, the Brooklyn waterfront has been transformed from a landscape of derelict industrial structures to one of glossy condominiums and parkland, the abandoned elevated railroad track that runs through Chelsea has been converted into the popular High Line park, and the once-desolate Hudson Yards neighborhood is poised for a rebirth as a commercial and residential hub.
''I like to say that our ambitions are as broad and far-reaching as those of Robert Moses, but we judge ourselves by Jane Jacobs's standards,'' Ms. Burden said.
''Creating fine-grained open spaces in combination with remaking the city's land-use blueprint is what I'm most proud of,'' Ms. Burden added, perched on a seat at the enormous round table that dominates her well-worn second-floor office at 22 Reade Street, zoning maps on the wall behind her, a photo of the Williamsburg-Greenpoint waterfront in Brooklyn propped in the corner.
Her fans say that Ms. Burden is a visionary who will leave behind a much-improved city. ''There is no question that under Amanda's leadership, New York has experienced a renaissance,'' said Vin Cipolla, president of the Municipal Art Society of New York, ''with more development of parkland, waterfront and infrastructure over the last 10 years than in the 100 years before it.''
But critics say that the sum total of Ms. Burden's ambitions will be a gentrified city that no longer has a place for working-class New Yorkers.
''The overall effect of the city's rezonings has been incredibly dramatic in terms of the creation of expensive, market-rate housing and typically middling at best in terms of affordable housing,'' said Andrew Berman, the executive director of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation.
Now, in Year 11 of Ms. Burden's likely 12-year tenure, she is pushing through her final priorities, which could affect the way New Yorkers live, work and play well into the 21st century and long after she and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg have left office. Among those current efforts are plans to rezone West Harlem in Manhattan, Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn and a key stretch of Fordham Road in the Bronx. The most sweeping final act may be the redevelopment of millions of square feet of office space along Park Avenue and surrounding Grand Central Terminal that proponents say is antiquated.
MS. BURDEN could have had a far different destiny. The former Amanda Jay Mortimer has a family tree populated with enough notable names to fill a small library. She is the daughter of the Standard Oil heir Stanley G. Mortimer Jr. and the fashion icon Barbara Paley, a k a Babe, and the stepdaughter of William S. Paley, founder of CBS.
When she was a sophomore at Wellesley, she left college to marry Carter Burden, a descendant of Cornelius Vanderbilt (his mother was the former Flobelle Fairbanks, an actress). Ms. Burden was an ''it girl'' of the go-go 1960s, with The New York Times fawning over her ''chestnut mane of Alice in Wonderland hair'' and going on to say that she and Mr. Burden were not merely ''known,'' but ''idolized, rhapsodized, fantasized and utilized.'' The fashion designer Halston called her ''the most beautiful girl going,'' and at 22, Ms. Burden bested Jacqueline Kennedy to top the New York Couture Group's Best Dressed List.
After divorcing Mr. Burden in 1972, she had a brief marriage to Steven J. Ross, who ran the communications giant Warner Communications, and has been squired around town by, among others, Senators Edward M. Kennedy and Christopher J. Dodd and the newsman Charlie Rose.
But Ms. Burden eschewed much of the trappings of that life -- ''It's horrible, really, the socialite thing; it's like some kind of tattoo you can't rub off,'' she once told a reporter -- to become an urban planner. Graduating from Sarah Lawrence College with a degree in animal behavior in 1976, she began working for William H. Whyte, the eminent urban planner and author of ''The Organization Man,'' analyzing underused public spaces in the city.
In the early 1980s, she worked for the forerunner to the Empire State Development Corporation, eventually moving to the Battery Park City Authority, where she established the master plan for that development and oversaw the design of its public spaces. While at Battery Park, Ms. Burden earned a master's degree from Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation, writing her thesis on recycling urban garbage. It was awarded best in her class.
In 1990, Andrew Stein, the City Council president, appointed Ms. Burden to the City Planning Commission, the department's policy-making body. In 2002, when Mr. Bloomberg, her Upper East Side neighbor, assumed office, he appointed her director of the department, though she was not the obvious choice. Ms. Burden had supported Mark Green, Mr. Bloomberg's opponent, in the mayoral race, and Daniel L. Doctoroff, then deputy mayor, wanted Alexander D. Garvin, then chief planner for the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, to run City Planning.
''I know this is a once-in-a-lifetime job,'' she said. ''Mike Bloomberg gave me an irreplaceable opportunity, and I appreciate it every day.''
Ms. Burden, who had a somewhat tumultuous relationship with Mr. Doctoroff -- he acknowledged in an earlier interview that the two clashed ''from time to time'' -- shares some of her accomplishments with him. His failed attempt to bring the 2012 Olympics to New York, for example, helped pave the way for the rezoning of the Hudson Yards and the Williamsburg-Greenpoint waterfront, among other projects.
Ms. Burden, who is also chairwoman of the City Planning Commission, is known for her laser focus on detail, and no project is too small for her attention. When an old concrete piling and makeshift pier at Stuyvesant Cove Park, a sliver of green along the East River from 18th Street to 23rd Street, was threatened with demolition, ''I contacted Amanda and asked for help,'' said Mark Thompson, chairman of Community Board 6, whose district covers the area. ''She actually came down, sat at the site, realized why we loved it, and decided to save it.''
''Amanda's background as a planner really allows her to get down to the granular level, street by street, and understand how this impacts a neighborhood,'' said Julie Menin, the chairwoman of Community Board 1, which covers Lower Manhattan. She has worked extensively with Ms. Burden.
''When you go into a meeting with her,'' Ms. Menin said, ''you know exactly where she stands. She doesn't rely on staffers to inform her.''
But that attention to detail has also received criticism. Ms. Burden's belief in contextual zoning, for example, under which new developments in a neighborhood are required to be in the height and style of surrounding structures, leads to ''profoundly conservative building,'' said Julia Vitullo-Martin, a senior fellow at the Regional Plan Association and director of its Center for Urban Innovation. ''New York's greatness as the dominant skyscraper city of the 20th century was the result of bold building, but the local zeitgeist has switched from big and bold to keeping everything small, nondescript and similar to everything else in the neighborhood.''
It has also become common under Ms. Burden's leadership for developers and their architects to have to negotiate their designs with City Planning. ''Development has become a game of second-guessing,'' Ms. Vitullo-Martin said. ''What will Amanda think of my project? What will I need to compromise on?
''There really doesn't seem to be any true as-of-right development anymore,'' she added, referring to the ability to build without obtaining permits or other approvals.
Take Tower Verre, planned for the West 53rd Street site next to the Museum of Modern Art. Designed by the Pritzker Prize-winning architect Jean Nouvel, the building was originally designed in 2007 with a spire rising 1,250 feet, rivaling the Empire State Building. Nicolai Ouroussoff, then The Times's architecture critic, predicted it would be ''the most exhilarating addition to the skyline in a generation.'' Ms. Burden, however, balked at the design presented to her, and demanded that Mr. Nouvel lop 200 feet from the top. The project stalled. Last year, Mr. Nouvel and the developer Hines filed new plans that were in keeping with Ms. Burden's guidelines, although construction has yet to begin.
Ms. Burden, who spends her leisure time walking the city, boating or birding, argues that ''good design is good economic development, and I know this is true.'' She unabashedly calls the administration ''pro-development,'' and points to the High Line, which the city says has generated $2 billion in private investment in the area and has created 12,000 jobs. ''What I have tried to do, and think I have done,'' she said, ''is create value for these developers, every single day of my term.''
But others say it merely created a boom market for real estate without any real benefits for the local community. ''The High Line didn't create any new affordable housing, only condominiums for the rich, and the park itself has no open spaces for kids, but is more something for tourists to walk through,'' said Miguel Acevedo, president of the tenants' association at the Robert Fulton Houses, an affordable-housing development in the neighborhood.
Ms. Burden argues that gentrification is merely a pejorative term for necessary growth. ''Improvement of neighborhoods -- some people call it gentrification -- provides more jobs, provides housing, much of it affordable, and private investment, which is tax revenue for the city,'' she said. On her watch, the administration has undertaken financing 165,000 units of affordable housing by 2014, of which more than 130,000 have been built, and has created projects like Via Verde, the handsome, eco-friendly subsidized development in the South Bronx. ''We are making so many more areas of the city livable,'' she said. ''Now, young people are moving to neighborhoods like Crown Heights that 10 years ago wouldn't have been part of the lexicon.''
FOR developers, the clock is ticking. Though the Bloomberg administration won't leave office for 19 months, most projects that require rezoning or other Planning Department approval can take at least 18 months to get through the process. And the administration's overall friendliness to development means that most builders with projects on the drawing board are scurrying to get them passed before the term's end, rather than face the uncertainty of the next administration. (Ms. Burden could stay on as the head of the Planning Department if the next mayor wanted her to, though she has given no indication that she plans to stay.)
Adding to developers' urgency is a market that appears to be on an upswing after years of sluggishness, and the desire to avoid getting mired in the coming city election year, when there is greater likelihood that projects could become politicized.
First, the projects must be certified, which involves conducting extensive environmental studies, including analyzing traffic patterns and air quality. Some projects take years and several iterations before they are certified. Projects then enter a seven-month public review, in which City Planning, the local community board, the borough president and usually the City Council hold public hearings and provide comments. During the public review, projects are often further modified, but it is rare that a certified project doesn't pass the public review.
One project that is on the fast track is the rezoning of Midtown East, which broadly runs between 40th and 57th Streets east of Fifth Avenue. Ms. Burden and her team are preparing a study they hope to release in June that could ease height restrictions in the area.
The buildings in Midtown East, especially those along Park Avenue, have an average age of 68 years, far older than London, at 60 years, and business centers like Shanghai, at 10 years. The area's current zoning has severe height limitations, and in fact, many of today's skyscrapers were grandfathered in when a new zoning resolution was passed in 1961. This means that if today's building owners were to tear them down and build anew, they would have to build smaller.
''That is a nonstarter,'' said Steven Spinola, the president of the business group Real Estate Board of New York. ''No developer will willingly tear down a building and replace it with something smaller.'' Under current zoning, for example, the Empire State Building would have to be rebuilt at less than half its height.
Mary Ann Tighe, a chairwoman at the brokerage firm CBRE and chairwoman of REBNY, said she hoped new zoning would double current height limits, and provide a tax incentive for developers. But even with modifications to height restrictions -- they are unlikely to be doubled -- it would take years before buildings could be emptied of tenants and rebuilt. ''It isn't like all of a sudden all these landlords will tear down their buildings and the neighborhood will be a huge construction zone,'' Mr. Spinola said. ''This is a long-term process that will take form over the next 10, 20, even 30 years.''
Ms. Burden said: ''There hasn't been any new investment in this area for a long period of time, while at the same time, this is the premier business district in the entire country. It has the cachet, which we must always keep, the majesty of Park Avenue, which must always be maintained.''
But while she hopes a new zoning plan will maintain this, she said, ''we know for sure that there are certain buildings that aren't going to survive over the long term in terms of accommodating a contemporary corporation.''
As for the affected community, Mr. Thompson of Community Board 6 said, ''we are interested in how a rezoning would impact residential neighborhoods like Turtle Bay.''
''What we don't want is for a 40-story skyscraper to be towering over a 4-story town house,'' he added.
While Ms. Burden still has much to do in her nearly 600 days remaining in office, she is taking a reflective look at her accomplishments. ''We have tried to diagnose the DNA of each neighborhood; I have spent a lot of time in the streets, talking to communities,'' she said.
The hundreds of rezonings Ms. Burden has overseen will shape the city for decades to come. As the city grows and shifts, her vision is of single-family homes and more suburban spaces outside the center, while allowing for greater density to be clustered around transit hubs throughout the five boroughs -- 87 percent of new housing, she notes, is within a 10-minute walk of the subway.
''New York is a city of neighborhoods,'' she said. ''And I'm hopeful that what we have done is ensure in the next 15, 20 years, as the city grows, the identity of these neighborhoods will remain intact.''

HEADLINE: The Income-Restricted Apartment

BYLINE: By JIM RENDON

 BODY:
WITH the median price of an apartment in Manhattan topping $1,000 a square foot, homeownership is often far out of reach. But there are options for those who cannot afford the market rate, including co-op apartments for buyers who earn a certain percentage of the area median income, or A.M.I.
These buildings are scattered all over the city. Some date to the 1950s; others are brand-new and still looking for buyers. Some are limited to those who earn less than the median income -- 60 or 80 percent, for example (the median for a family of four in New York City is $83,000). Others have apartments for those earning a bit more than that sum. Many new developments try to bring in owners from different economic backgrounds, and are likely to include market-rate units as well.
At one recent development, Atlantic Terrace, near the new Nets arena in Brooklyn, similar one-bedroom apartments were priced at $85,000, $113,000 and $232,000, depending on the buyer's income. A market-rate one-bedroom, nearly identical to the subsidized ones, was listed for $365,000. 
''When you walk through the hallways of our building, it should be like walking on a Brooklyn sidewalk,'' said Heather Gershen, the director of housing development at the Fifth Avenue Committee, which developed Atlantic Terrace. ''It should be diverse in every way.''
Many programs and organizations, including federal, city and state agencies and nonprofits, help finance and develop these buildings. The best known is the Mitchell-Lama program. Begun in 1955, Mitchell-Lama enabled the construction of new low- and middle-income rental and co-op buildings throughout the city.
Another program, run by the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board, works with the city on co-op conversions of buildings taken over from delinquent landlords. Tenants help with renovations and can eventually buy the units for low prices. About 30,000 apartments are in the program, which is administered by the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development.
Since 2003 the city's Housing Development Corporation has also been partnering with both for-profit and nonprofit developers to create new affordable apartments -- 1,767 units in 21 buildings.
The benefits of promoting homeownership in this way extend far beyond the individual owners, said Andrew Reicher, the executive director of the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board.
''In the Lower East Side, in Harlem, in Bed-Stuy,'' he said, ''these owners stuck it out and struggled to improve their block, and improvements spread from their work. And they are not displaced when the neighborhood turns around.''
Of course, the question for potential buyers is, ''How can I get one?'' The answer varies by program, but many have narrowly defined criteria and involve a lot of paperwork.
Lisa Leung, a procurement consultant, spent a year searching for an apartment for herself and her sister. She looked in the South Slope, Park Slope and Windsor Terrace in Brooklyn, but found nothing appealing in their price range. Eventually she expanded her search and came across an income-restricted development in Bushwick called Bushwick Gardens. Some two-bedrooms there were advertised for just over $200,000. ''The prices were so low, I thought it was a joke,'' she said.
Unlike other buildings she considered, Bushwick Gardens had no competitive bidding process. Here it was first come first served. For the apartments Ms. Leung looked at, buyers had to earn more than $90,000 a year and less than 250 percent of the A.M.I. ($153,500 for two people).
In October a buyer ahead of Ms. Leung dropped out, and then the vetting process began. She submitted three years of tax returns and statements from all of her bank accounts, her 401(k) and her investments -- to qualify, she could not have more than $141,000 in total assets.
In January she and her sister became the happy owners of a two-bedroom with a terrace. ''I like that there is a lot of diversity in the building,'' Ms. Leung said.
The building had been planned to encourage diversity. The city and the developer, the Ridgewood Bushwick Senior Citizens Council, determined the price of units for each income level. The goal is to make sure that no one pays more than 30 percent of his income for the mortgage and monthly maintenance combined, said Joan Tally, an executive vice president of the New York City Housing Development Corporation, which provides financing and helps structure these deals.
Buyers of these homes may find unusual financial arrangements. For example, some income-restricted buildings have high maintenance fees. That is because these projects are financed in part by mortgaging the entire building, as with a conventional co-op. Residents pay down the mortgage over time through their monthly maintenance fees.
At Bushwick Gardens, for example, Ms. Leung said the maintenance is about $1,500 a month for her two-bedroom. But given the low purchase price, she says the apartment is still a good deal.
Buyers hoping to flip these apartments for a big profit will be disappointed. Residents are expected to stay in them for long periods of time. Many of the co-ops require that anyone who sells within four or five years surrender 100 percent of the profits to the building. Those who stay longer return smaller percentages of the profits.
The city also wants to ensure that the units retain their income restrictions, which are often part of co-op bylaws and generally must be maintained for decades.
But some buildings eventually change to market rate. Many older buildings, including some built under Mitchell-Lama, have done just that in recent years. Mitchell-Lama buildings are required to keep their income restrictions for 20 years. After that, the co-op board can vote to change the status, and the underlying mortgage must be paid off, said Jeffrey S. Reich, a partner at the law firm Wolf, Haldenstein, Adler, Freeman & Herz.
Income-restricted co-ops are generally available only by lotteries announced through advertising in newspapers and on the Web sites of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development -- which has a list of open lotteries -- and associated organizations. Real estate brokers enter the picture only when an apartment is resold, or when the lottery fails to fill all the units, as was the case in Bushwick Gardens.
Often the developer gets the word out through churches and other community groups, said Ms. Gershen of the Fifth Avenue Committee. For Atlantic Terrace, she said, her group received 5,500 applications for 59 apartments. About 2,000 of those cleared the initial screening. Buyers must have stellar credit and stable employment, as they must qualify for mortgages, too.

HEADLINE: Little House on the Catastrophically Damaged Prairie

BYLINE: By WES ENZINNA

 BODY:
One problem with Treece, Kan., is that the ground keeps caving in. It has happened more than a hundred times over the last century. On most occasions, the subsidences -- that's what the scientists call them -- are small, like when a sofa-size crater opened up on 10th Street last year. Other times, they are much worse. In 1966, a 300-foot-wide, 200-foot-deep abyss swallowed up the road out on the edge of town. Somehow no one died.
I first visited Treece in 2010. From the airport in Kansas City, it's a half-day's drive down Highway 69, the industrial sprawl giving way to fields of sunflowers and prairie grass. Then you enter a dust bowl, land so flat it's more like a dustpan -- so flat, in fact, that in 2003 researchers discovered that the entire state is flatter than an actual pancake, which the team purchased from one of the IHOPs that dot the landscape. Getting nearer to Treece, there are junk shops and single-wide trailers selling kittens and breeze-box Baptist churches with signs announcing, ''Hell Awaits.'' 
At the entrance to Treece, something strange happens: Mountains appear on the horizon. Except they're not really mountains. They're mounds of toxic stone. Gray, treeless monuments to the town's more profitable past.
According to local legend, Treece was founded by accident. Two accidents, really. The first occurred in 1914, when the Picher Lead Company of Joplin, Mo., sent a crew out to deliver equipment to Oklahoma. When the truck got stuck in the mud between the two towns, the company ordered its workers to drill a hole to pass the time, and the crew unexpectedly hit a thick vein of lead and zinc underground. The company then bought mining leases for the area, creating the town of Picher, Okla. When, a few years later, a Kansas land surveyor accidentally moved the state line four blocks south into Picher, the north side of town became part of Kansas. A wealthy resident called the new town Treece, which also happened to be his last name.
Thousands of people from the Ozarks flocked to the two towns to work the mines. They would haul stones to the surface by the bucketful, then crush and grind them to extract the minerals, dumping the waste -- worthless rock called ''chat'' -- in piles across town. By the 1920s, the area was the No. 1 producer of zinc and lead in the country, supplying metal for most of the ammunition in World Wars I and II.
But when the minerals started to run out in the 1960s, the largest mining companies went bankrupt or left, and their workers left, too. By 1981, when the Environmental Protection Agency ranked the area around Treece and Picher as the most contaminated in the country, only a few hundred people remained. By the time I visited, Picher had been abandoned almost entirely, and only 170 residents still lived in Treece with those toxic towers of stone.
The towers are another problem in town. Some of them are 200 feet tall, and their dust, which on breezy days blows across the prairie, still contains enough metal to make blood-lead levels among young children here three times higher than the national average.
Then there's the water. The local Tar Creek is the color of orange juice, and it smells like vinegar. This is because when the mining companies left, they shut off the pumps that kept abandoned shafts from filling with groundwater. Once water flooded the tunnels, it picked up all the trace minerals underground -- iron, lead and zinc -- and flushed them into rivers and streams. Fish and fowl fled or went belly-up. ''The only thing polluted in Treece,'' says Rex Buchanan, interim director at the Kansas Geological Survey, ''is the earth, air and water.''
A local couple, Dennis and Ella Johnston, agreed to give me the pollution tour. In Dennis's blue Chevy truck, we drove through downtown -- a church, trailers, a one-room City Hall with a pair of its windows boarded up -- and then went down a dirt road to a pool formed by a caved-in mine. ''Local kids used to skinny-dip here all the time,'' Dennis said, grinning and pointing at the glassy water. ''We'd see kids with sunburns all over their bodies.'' But it turns out the kids hadn't been burned by the sun, he said; they had been chemically burned by all the acids in the water.
''Things have gone pretty far downhill here,'' Mayor Bill Blunk told me when I met him later that day at City Hall. Blunk, a 53-year-old with tattooed arms and a few missing teeth, apologized for the boarded-up windows: someone had smashed them out with rocks, so he nailed plywood over the glass. He explained that in the past year he'd taken to mowing the whole town's grass himself, and because the police didn't come here anymore, he patrolled the streets some nights with a ''kazillion-watt spotlight.'' But now there was no point, he said, because ''it was time to get the hell out of Dodge.''
There are 112 sites like Treece on the E.P.A.'s National Priorities List, an inventory of the most environmentally devastated places in the country. They're in varying states of restoration, but all of them were ruined by mining or extracting operations. Near Jefferson, N.C., a dam holding mining waste from abandoned copper mines is in serious danger of eroding or collapsing, and nearby rivers have already been poisoned. And at the Midnite Mine on the Spokane Indian Reservation in Washington State, years of digging for uranium have left piles of toxic rock on the landscape. Locals are safe enough living there -- as long as they don't eat the radioactive wild berries or the deer that forage on them. What's tricky about all these places is that they're not like Three Mile Island, where lives are immediately threatened by a catastrophic accident. It's not quite clear if they should be cleaned up or abandoned or if there's some other kind of solution.
Here in Treece, the E.P.A. and the Kansas Department of Health and Environment had just approved a buyout plan. The two agencies were going to use $3.5 million to get each and every resident to abandon the town. Then they were going to demolish all the buildings, fill in all the caves, replant native grass and turn Treece into a ''wildlife preserve,'' a grassy tabula rasa that would attract turkeys and quail and deer and wild prairie chickens -- just like before the mining companies ever came. It was an ambitious plan and, many locals believed, a necessary one. The future of Treece's residents depended on their town's erasure.
To emphasize that point, Blunk showed me a map tacked to the wall. Made by the United States Geological Survey, it showed the town from above, a photo of its streets and homes veined with hundreds of squiggling lines, each one representing a confirmed tunnel beneath us, some as deep as 450 feet. ''I don't want to scare you,'' Blunk said, putting his thumb over a smudge on the map and flashing me his gaping mayor's smile, ''but we're literally standing over our graves right now.''
A year passed before I made it back to Treece. By then, Blunk and his neighbors had made good on their promise to leave. Downtown looked terrible. Tepees of twisted boards stood where 12 months earlier there were two-room cabins; the roof of a tin trailer was peeled nearly off, like the torn-back lid of a sardine can. At City Hall, the plywood over the windows had been stolen and the rest of the glass smashed.
A few blocks away, I saw an immaculate double-wide trailer on a flowery corner lot. Its owners -- Della Busby, a shovel-jawed woman with short bangs like Bettie Page's and a raspy smoker's growl, and her husband, Tim -- had refused the buyout. Treece's official population was now just two people. ''To be honest, I don't know why everyone left,'' Della told me when I found her on her porch later that morning, still in the pink pajama pants and Las Vegas T-shirt she'd slept in. ''Despite the obvious, it's kind of nice out here. I've got the place to myself.''
She smoked and rocked in her chair as she explained to me why she decided to stay. (Tim didn't like reporters and remained in the bedroom while we talked.) For starters, she couldn't believe how low her buyout offer was. It arrived in the mail in February 2011, and she read it on her front lawn: ''Dear Mr. and Mrs. Busby . . . It will be necessary to buy your property.'' The offer was for $28,000. They had three months to accept or decline.
They paid only $7,000 for the place in 1985, but they put 25 years of work into cleaning the soil, which was littered with chat and burned television sets when they first moved in as newlyweds, and they had since moved two new trailer-homes onto the land. Besides, Della earned just above minimum wage as a clerk at a nearby craft store, and Tim did odd handyman jobs for his neighbors but was otherwise unemployed. Twenty-eight thousand dollars wasn't going to do them much good when the average cost of a home in noncontaminated towns nearby was far higher than that (real estate prices shot up around the time the buyouts were announced).
The Busbys weren't the only ones whose buyout offers made it tough for them to leave. One young couple, the Powells on Main Street, received a $19,000 offer for their house, which was enough for moving costs and a year's rent in a nearby apartment but not a comparable home. Another resident, 70-year-old Verla Baird, was O.K. with her $28,000 offer, but before she signed the papers to make the exchange official, her trailer burned down. With no insurance and now just a pile of smoldering ashes for a home, the K.D.H.E. revised its offer. She got just $9,300 for her land and took out a loan to cover the remaining expense of moving to a place 10 miles away in Baxter Springs, Kan.
Even though a group of eight residents, led by Mayor Blunk, had lobbied the state Senate for the buyout, this didn't mean everyone wanted to go. From the winter of 2010 deep into the spring of 2011, Treece residents regularly attended meetings to air their grievances to the five trustees of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, as well as to a sixth man, an affable, moon-faced guy named Bob Jurgens who coordinated the day-to-day details of the buyout.
At the earliest meetings, extra chairs had to be brought in to accommodate the crowds. Sometimes people complained that the E.P.A.'s trucks were stirring up too much dust, and wasn't the agency just wasting money cleaning up the town since it was being abandoned anyway? Other times they were curious about Dumpsters: would there be enough of them so that when folks left they'd have a convenient place to trash their stuff? And other times it was hotel rooms -- if someone moved their mobile home out of Treece, but it wasn't ready for them to sleep in right away, would the K.D.H.E. pay for a night's stay in the Econo Lodge?
''I don't think that's even been addressed,'' Jurgens said on one particularly tense Thursday evening. ''But I don't think that's going to be an option.''
''Just give us some of that money the E.P.A. is using to play in the dirt out there,'' a white-haired woman in enormous black aviator shades said.
Hand claps and a few you-tell-'ems came from the crowd.
''Trust me,'' Jurgens said, his face flushed, ''I understand your frustration.''
''Oh no you don't, honey,'' another woman said. ''No, you don't.''
''O.K.,'' Jurgens said, ''I'm not from here, so I'm not going to pretend that I understand what it's like to live here.''
At the front of the room, Mayor Blunk was nervously chewing on a pen next to his wife, Judy. She stood up. ''You're talking about our homes, Bob,'' she said. ''But you're also talking about a void, a void where our home is soon going to be, a void in our hearts. . . . Supposedly, we don't have to go. But I feel like we're being forced to.''
As the summer of 2011 approached, only 60 people had accepted their offers. Others explored the option of creating a newly chartered town, composed of the residents who didn't want to leave. The K.D.H.E. was alarmed by how many people said they planned to stay. ''We wanted a 100 percent buyout,'' Jurgens told me. So, in March, they raised everyone's offer by at least $5,000.
When the Busbys got another letter in the mail offering them $33,000, Della thought, Well, I'll be damned. She and Tim really considered taking it and even went house shopping. They found a place they liked -- a fixer-upper in Commerce, Okla., with crooked floors and mildewed walls. But it was $59,000, way out of their range. That's when they decided to stay put for good.
By the time the K.D.H.E. raised the offers for the holdouts yet again, Della had accepted -- even come to like -- the prospect of a future in Treece. The new offer of $44,500, she says, wasn't tempting in the slightest. ''Sure, you could say I'm stubborn,'' she said. ''If my house falls into a hole, then it falls into a hole.''
''I wish Della had moved out of that falling-down town,'' Pam Pruitt, the Treece City Clerk and Della's friend, said. Pruitt lived just a few blocks from Della, but she'd already accepted her adjusted buyout offer of $62,400 and purchased a new home in Baxter Springs. She wanted to move out as soon as possible. ''We needed to start over again. And some of us needed a push.''
As their neighbors prepared to leave, the Busbys prepared for life in a ghost town. They didn't just need a hearty frontier mentality -- they also needed $5,000 to pay for a new water system and septic tank to replace all the utilities that would soon be shut off. The Busbys used their entire savings to do it.
Not long after, the gas company stopped serving Treece. The water tower was drained by cranking open a fire hydrant in town, soaking the streets in 5,000 gallons of drinking water. Empire District Electric unstrung all the street lights. There had been three other families saying they'd stay behind with the Busbys, but with the utilities gone, even they saw no use in hanging around.
In August, there was an auction of the abandoned properties. The poster placed around town by the Chesnutt & Chesnutt auction company announced that everything must go -- ''even the water tower,'' which now sat empty and idle on the south side of town.
Colonel Jerry, the lead auctioneer, drove into Treece wearing snakeskin boots and a straw cowboy hat.
''How do you feel about auctioning off an actual town?'' one of the people there for the sale asked him.
''I feel fine,'' Colonel Jerry said, as he sat down on the steps of City Hall. ''We've auctioned off exotic animals.''
''Is this any different?''
''Not really. It's still stuff. I've auctioned off liquor stores bottle by bottle.''
''Is it sad?''
''I don't think about it that much.''
Colonel Jerry stood up, brushed off his pants and cleared his throat. He walked over to a microphone and addressed the 100 buyers assembled in the gravel parking lot of City Hall. ''All right, people,'' he said, ''we're going to start the auction here in the heart of America, beautiful downtown Treece, Kansas. . . .'' And in less than an hour, the artifacts of collective life in Treece were sold as scrap:
The 45,000-gallon water tower: $1,600
William and Holly Bruner's house on Kansas Avenue: $45
Jesus Name Pentecostal Church on Main Street, including each of its 11 pews: $50
It's never been so peaceful around here,'' Della told me a few months after the auction. She had the day off from work -- the crafts store where she is a clerk is a 10-mile drive away in Baxter Springs -- and we were sitting out on her porch, smoking cigarettes. The view was beautiful in its way: trees, undulating fields of sand, unearthly mounds and ruined prairie, all shaded pink by a setting sun.
The K.D.H.E. had hired wrecking crews to demolish the last few buildings in town. Among other concerns, they feared meth dealers would set up labs in empty homes, which is what happened years earlier when Picher was abandoned. The demo team only had a handful of houses to bulldoze before their work in Treece was done. Just to be safe, the Busbys had a ''Do Not Demolish'' sign staked in their yard.
''I'm not worried about vandals or scary people or cave-ins or lead poisoning or chat towers,'' Della told me. ''Even though it looks bad around here, no one's ever died from any of that stuff.'' And it was true -- while it was definitely dangerous for children to live in Treece, and while a lead-toxicology specialist told me that Treece residents were ''almost certainly'' poisoned by their environment, and while nearly everyone I interviewed offered anecdotes about friends or family suffering from lupus, multiple sclerosis, thyroid disease, cancer, eczema or emphysema, no scientific study has conclusively linked these diseases to pollution in Treece. Of course, no comprehensive scientific study has ever been conducted in Treece. The first and only official lead test in children wasn't carried out by the K.D.H.E. and the E.P.A. until 2009.
This April, officials abandoned their plan to turn Treece into a wildlife preserve. It had been a quixotic hope all along, dependent upon the desire of the Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism, which had nothing to do with the buyout, to take over the land from the Department of Health and Environment. The Wildlife Department wouldn't give an official statement, but one employee told me the agency wasn't interested in the land. ''It's not because that couple stayed,'' he said, referring to the Busbys. ''Not only because of that, anyway. That land is inadequate for supporting wildlife, or from what I hear, any other kind of life.''
Instead, another auction will be held this fall. The now-barren plots of land will be sold to buyers who can use the space to hunt deer and rabbits, or to grow crops (at their own risk). The land won't be cleaned up further except to dismantle the remaining chat towers by hauling the stones away and using them to fill local cave-ins, where the effects of airborne lead are mitigated. This could take years.
The state recently petitioned to remove the town's name from maps. The ''welcome'' sign out on U.S.-69 has been taken down, and a visitor today couldn't find the place unless she already knew the way. The Busbys will be allowed to stay in the ghost town as long as they like, but once they leave or die, it's very likely that no human will ever live in Treece again.
I was curious how Mayor Blunk was coping with the end of his town, so I visited him and Judy at their mobile home in February. They had relocated to a grassy stretch of highway in Columbus, Kan., about 10 miles north of where they used to be. Blunk said that he was fond of certain aspects of his new life here. He liked that if someone tried to break into his house, the police would actually come. He liked that he didn't have to drive 20 minutes to find a grocery store or gas station. He liked that he didn't have to see chat towers outside his window. And he said he didn't regret asking people to leave Treece or helping to make the buyout a reality, because he knew, in the end, ''we couldn't stay in our sick little town forever.''
But he said that he missed being mayor and that he had underestimated how strange it would be to have his hometown erased, to be ''plucked from his roots like a potato.'' His dad was a miner in Treece and Picher. His whole family grew up there. He didn't know quite what to do without his fellow ''chat rats,'' he said, and he had even taken to cruising around Treece with his kazillion-watt spotlight, ''just for kicks.''
I asked him what he saw out there on his drives.
Blunk took a sip of coffee and let the question linger for a while. ''I see an opportunity for a decent place to live,'' he said. ''Not a great place, maybe not even a good place, but a decent place to live -- and now it's gone down the drain.''

It was just one brief exchange about Afghanistan with an aide late in 2009, but it suggests how President Obama's thinking about what he once called ''a war of necessity'' began to radically change less than a year after he took up residency in the White House.
Not long before, after a highly contentious debate within a war cabinet that was riddled with leaks, Mr. Obama had reluctantly decided to order a surge of more than 30,000 troops. The aide told Mr. Obama that he believed military leaders had agreed to the tight schedule to begin withdrawing those troops just 18 months later only because they thought they could persuade an inexperienced president to grant more time if they demanded it.
''Well,'' Mr. Obama responded that day, ''I'm not going to give them more time.'' 
A year later, when the president and a half-dozen White House aides began to plan for the withdrawal, the generals were cut out entirely. There was no debate, and there were no leaks. And when Mr. Obama joins the leaders of other NATO nations in Chicago on Sunday and Monday, the full extent of how his thinking on Afghanistan has changed will be apparent. He will announce what he has already told the leaders in private: All combat operations led by American forces will cease in summer 2013, when the United States and other NATO forces move to a ''support role'' whether the Afghan military can secure the country or not.
Mr. Obama concluded in his first year that the Bush-era dream of remaking Afghanistan was a fantasy, and that the far greater threat to the United States was an unstable, nuclear-armed Pakistan. So he narrowed the goals in Afghanistan, and narrowed them again, until he could make the case that America had achieved limited objectives in a war that was, in any traditional sense, unwinnable.
''Just think how big a reversal of approach this was in just two years,'' one official involved in the administration debates on Afghanistan said. ''We started with what everyone thought was a pragmatic vision but, at its core, was a plan for changing the way Afghanistan is wired. We ended up thinking about how to do as little wiring as possible.''
The lessons Mr. Obama has learned in Afghanistan have been crucial to shaping his presidency. Fatigue and frustration with the war have defined the strategies his administration has adopted to guide how America intervenes in the world's messiest conflicts. Out of the experience emerged Mr. Obama's ''light footprint'' strategy, in which the United States strikes from a distance but does not engage in years-long, enervating occupations. That doctrine shaped the president's thinking about how to deal with the challenges that followed -- Libya, Syria and a nuclear Iran.
In interviews over the past 18 months, Mr. Obama's top national security aides described the evolution of the president's views on Afghanistan as a result of three rude discoveries.
Mr. Obama began to question why Americans were dying to prop up a leader, President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan, who was volatile, unreliable and willing to manipulate the ballot box. Faced with an economic crisis at home and a fiscal crisis that Mr. Obama knew would eventually require deep limits on Pentagon spending, he was also shocked, they said, by what the war's cost would be if the generals' counterinsurgency plan were left on autopilot -- $1 trillion over 10 years. And the more he delved into what it would take to truly change Afghan society, the more he concluded that the task was so overwhelming that it would make little difference whether a large American and NATO force remained for 2 more years, 5 more years or 10 more years.
The remaking of American strategy in Afghanistan began, though no one knew it at the time, in a cramped conference room in Mr. Obama's transition headquarters in late 2008. Gen. Douglas E. Lute, who had spent the last two years of the Bush administration trying to manage the many trade-offs necessary as the Iraq war consumed troop and intelligence resources needed in Afghanistan, arrived with a PowerPoint presentation.
The first slide that General Lute threw onto the screen caught the eye of Thomas E. Donilon, later President Obama's national security adviser. ''It said we do not have a strategy in Afghanistan that you can articulate or achieve,'' Mr. Donilon recalled three years later. ''We had been at war for eight years, and no one could explain the strategy.''
So in the first days of his presidency, Mr. Obama asked Bruce O. Riedel, a former C.I.A. officer with deep knowledge of the region, to lead a rapid review. At the time, the president was still speaking in campaign mode. He talked about remaking ''an economy that isn't dominated by illicit drugs'' in Afghanistan and a ''civilian surge'' to match the military effort. But he said little about the Riedel team's central insight: that Pakistan posed a far greater threat.
''If we were honest with ourselves, we would call this problem 'Pak/Af,' not 'Af/Pak,' '' Mr. Riedel said shortly after turning in his report. But the White House would not dare admit that publicly -- even that rhetorical reversal would further alienate the Pakistanis.
Mr. Obama agreed with Mr. Riedel, but thought the review did not point clearly enough toward a new strategy. To get it right, the president ordered up a far more thorough process that would involve everyone -- military commanders and experts on civilian reconstruction, diplomats who could explore a negotiation with the Taliban, and intelligence officials who could assess which side of the war the Pakistanis were fighting on.
But he also began to reassess whether emerging victorious in Afghanistan was as necessary as he had once proclaimed. Ultimately, Mr. Obama agreed to double the size of the American force while training the Afghan armed forces, but famously insisted that, whether America was winning or losing, the drawdown would begin in just 18 months.
''I think he hated the idea from the beginning,'' one of his advisers said of the surge. ''He understood why we needed to try, to knock back the Taliban. But the military was 'all in,' as they say, and Obama wasn't.''
The president's doubts were cemented as the early efforts to take towns like Marja in Helmand Province took months longer than expected. To Mr. Obama and his aides, Marja proved that progress was possible -- but not on the kind of timeline that Mr. Obama thought economically or politically affordable.
''Marja looks a lot better than two years ago,'' one senior official said at the end of last year. ''But how many Marjas do we need to do, and over what time frame?''
The tight group of presidential aides charged with answering questions like that -- of redefining the mission -- began meeting on weekends at the end of 2010. The group's informal name said it all: ''Afghan Good Enough.''
''We spent the time asking questions like: How much corruption can we live with?'' one participant recalled. ''Is there another way -- a way the Pentagon might not be telling us about -- to speed the withdrawal? What's the least we can spend on training Afghan troops and still get a credible result?''
By early 2011, Mr. Obama had seen enough. He told his staff to arrange a speedy, orderly exit from Afghanistan. This time there would be no announced national security meetings, no debates with the generals. Even Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton were left out until the final six weeks.
The key decisions had essentially been made already when Gen. David H. Petraeus, in his last months as commander in Afghanistan, arrived in Washington with a set of options for the president that called for a slow withdrawal of surge troops. He wanted to keep as many troops as possible in Afghanistan through the next fighting season, with a steep drop to follow. Mr. Obama concluded that the Pentagon had not internalized that the goal was not to defeat the Taliban. He said he ''believed that we had a more limited set of objectives that could be accomplished by bringing the military out at a faster clip,'' an aide reported.
After a short internal debate, Mr. Gates and Mrs. Clinton came up with a different option: end the surge by September 2012 -- after the summer fighting season, but before the election. Mr. Obama concurred. But he was placing an enormous bet: his goals now focus largely on finishing off Al Qaeda and keeping Pakistan's nuclear weapons from going astray. Left unclear is how America will respond if a Taliban resurgence takes over wide swathes of the country America invaded in 2001 and plans to largely depart 13 years later.

HEADLINE: Will Iran Take the Next Step?

BYLINE: By CAROL GIACOMO

 BODY:
The international community has not had much success trying to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions. For years, it was split on how much pressure to apply, and Tehran deftly exploited that division. Since President Obama took office, the major powers have imposed increasingly strong sanctions aimed at Iran's banks and oil trade. It is crucial to maintain that cohesion as a second round of negotiations opens this week in Baghdad. 
The initial talks in Istanbul last month were encouraging enough for both sides to agree to meet again. This time, Iran will have to offer concrete proposals to address core concerns. It could move significantly toward a solution by suspending all its uranium enrichment activities, which the United Nations Security Council first demanded in 2006. At a minimum, it needs to stop enriching to 20 percent purity (well beyond the 5 percent needed for civilian nuclear programs and a few steps from bomb grade) and to close its Fordo nuclear facility. If Iran does that, the United States and its allies -- Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China -- are expected to offer to take the stockpile of 20 percent enriched uranium out of the country, fabricate it into fuel rods for Tehran's medical research reactor and help with safety upgrades to Iran's civilian nuclear program.
What the Iranians really want, however, is an end to the sanctions, which are wreaking havoc on the economy. They may show just enough flexibility to encourage Russia and China to push to ease punishments prematurely. Tehran has played that game many times before, while plowing ahead with its nuclear program.
If Iran makes credible gestures, sanctions should be eased, but not significantly until it takes irreversible steps to roll back its nuclear activities. The international community must make that clear before the Iranians start making promises.

HEADLINE: New Hints at Looser Rules On Travel Stir Hope in Cuba

BYLINE: By VICTORIA BURNETT

 BODY:
HAVANA -- From her small, tidy apartment here, Niurka dreams of visiting Miami one day to see her son's home and the school where he is studying medicine. She also yearns to bid farewell to her late father at his graveside and to meet her brother's children while they are still young.
''Economic necessity has separated our family,'' she said. ''I want to put it back together.''
But making the 30-minute hop to Florida will not be easy for Niurka, a 45-year-old doctor, whose brother left Cuba a decade ago, followed by her father and then, five years ago, her 24-year-old son. Like all Cubans, she needs permission to leave, but as a member of the country's medical corps, she may be forced to wait years for an exit permit -- if she gets one at all. 
So Niurka, who asked that her full name be withheld lest she spoil her chance of traveling, anxiously awaits a promised reform of Cuba's migration rules that, for half a century, have controlled who can leave the island, who can return and how long they can be gone.
Any loosening of controls would be a step toward eliminating one of the most deeply resented restrictions on Cubans' liberty and a milestone on President Raul Castro's gradual march toward economic and social reform. Cuban officials have hinted for years that a change might be coming, but the bureaucratic system limiting travel remains in place.
If it does become easier for Cubans to legally leave the island, the reform could spur economic migration and deepen ties between the island and the two million members of the diaspora, whose money and business experience may be vital to the government's plans to drastically enlarge the private sector.
''If you have a significant change to the migratory law, it will be a watershed,'' said Arturo Lopez-Levy, a Cuban-born academic who left the island 10 years ago and lectures at the University of Denver.
''It could unleash the potential of the whole reform program and it could empower the actors who favor reconciliation between the Cubans on the island and the diaspora,'' he said. ''This is a critical juncture.''
Hundreds of thousands of Cubans have gone into exile or migrated over the past five decades, and thousands are believed to have died trying to cross the Straits of Florida in small boats -- partly because American policy promises residency to Cubans who make it ashore. Though many Cubans now pay smugglers to take them to the United States via Mexico, the United States Coast Guard continues to find would-be migrants at sea.
There was a swell of hope for new travel rules last August, when Mr. Castro told Parliament that the government was working on ''updating'' the law.
Then in an interview published this spring, Ricardo Alarcon, president of Parliament, said the government was planning a ''radical and profound'' reform in the coming months. Deputy Foreign Minister Dagoberto Rodriguez said during a video conference with Cubans overseas in April that progress on the issue was ''advanced.''
In lines at the migration office, on blogs and in conversations among islanders and members of the diaspora, Cubans question whether the government will part with such a lucrative bureaucracy or risk letting go health workers whose overseas missions earn Cuba billions of dollars each year.
''It's one thing for a foreign country not to let you in and another for your own country not to let you out,'' said Amparo Garcia, a jewelry seller whose daughter, 23, is in the process of getting a permit to visit her father in Angola. ''If you have the money and you want to travel, you should be able to buy a ticket and go to the airport. That simple.''
Jorge Martinez, who charges $1 to type up migration papers in the front seat of his 1969 Volkswagen Beetle, said more people than usual were applying for passports because they believe the government will scrap the exit permit and increase passport fees to make up for lost revenue.
''People have been talking about this for years, but right now there's a lot of expectation,'' he said.
Cubans and analysts said any kind of change would pique interest in travel but would be unlikely to provoke a mass exodus, because many countries restrict the number of Cubans allowed to visit by requiring them to seek a visa beforehand. The United States requires a visa for legal travel; however, Cubans who present themselves at an American border checkpoint or who manage to reach the American shoreline may stay and, after a year, seek permanent residency.
Under current rules, Cubans who wish to go abroad face a bewildering -- and expensive -- array of permits and provisions.
To get a Cuban exit visa, they often have to provide a letter of invitation from the country they plan to visit, pushing the cost of the whole process above $300 -- a significant sum in a country where average salaries are about $20 per month.
Many Cubans obtain permission to leave in days or weeks, but the government tightly restricts travel by children, medical personnel and other professionals, as well as members of the security forces. Niurka, for example, must be ''released'' from duty by the Public Health Ministry before she can apply for an exit permit.
The government also frequently denies travel permits to dissidents or critics, like the activist and blogger Yoani Sanchez, who has written of being turned down 19 times.
Once overseas, Cubans must pay the nearest Cuban consulate if they stay more than 30 days. The fee is about $60 a month in Europe and $150 a month in the United States. After 11 months abroad, Cubans usually lose their rights as a citizen.
The government has hinted that it will change the 11-month rule, which would improve its relationship with Cubans abroad. Officials have softened their once-caustic language against overseas Cubans and promoted talks with them about their role in the island's future.
Cubans living overseas, particularly in the United States, send at least $1 billion -- some estimates are double that -- in remittances each year. They are investing money in relatives' businesses and, on the sly, buying houses and cars on the island.
''Today, the overwhelming majority of Cubans who emigrate do so for economic reasons,'' Mr. Castro said in August.
For people like Niurka, though, the reform may bring less relief. Mr. Castro has said new rules will include ''reasonable measures'' to prevent a brain drain in the face of ''the American government's interventionist and subversive plans.''
Mr. Alarcon, in the interview with Salim Lamrani, a French academic, which was first published in The Huffington Post, pointed, as justification, to the United States government's Cuban Medical Professional Parole Program, introduced in 2006, which offers a visa to any Cuban health worker who defects during a mission overseas.
Mr. Lopez-Levy said that the Cuban government used American policy as an excuse to restrict Cubans' travel, but that policies like the parole program for health professionals lend some restrictions legitimacy.
Rolando Anillo, an immigration lawyer based in Coral Gables, Fla., said that he had noticed cases in which the government had recently been more flexible in allowing doctors to leave, and that he believed that the new rules might let health care workers travel once they had completed a certain number of years of service. If such a policy shift were made, Niurka said, her two decades of service on a salary of about $25 a month should more than suffice.
''Working five days a week, long days, including a 24-hour shift?'' she said. ''I think I paid off my education in five years.''
She and her daughter would qualify for a United States visa under a program to reunite families, she said, complaining of the stress of waiting to see what her fate would be.
''I can't go anywhere. That hurts,'' she said, staring through her living room window at a torrent of rain outside. ''But life goes on. You have to live in the moment, otherwise you become so bitter you can't live at all.''

HEADLINE: Romney's Faith, Silent but Deep

BYLINE: By JODI KANTOR; Ashley Parker contributed reporting.

 BODY:
BELMONT, Mass. -- When Mitt Romney embarked on his first political race in 1994, he also slipped into a humble new role in the Mormon congregation he once led. On Sunday mornings, he stood in the sunlit chapel here teaching Bible classes for adults.
Leading students through stories about Jesus and the Nephite and Lamanite tribes, who Mormons believe once populated the Americas, and tossing out peanut butter cups as rewards, Mr. Romney always returned to the same question: how could students apply the lessons of Mormon scripture in their daily lives?
Now, as the presumptive Republican nominee for president, Mr. Romney speaks so sparingly about his faith -- he and his aides frequently stipulate that he does not impose his beliefs on others -- that its influence on him can be difficult to detect.
But dozens of the candidate's friends, fellow church members and relatives describe a man whose faith is his design for living. The church is by no means his only influence, and its impact cannot be fully untangled from that of his family, which is also steeped in Mormonism. 
But being a Latter-day Saint is ''at the center of who he really is, if you scrape everything else off,'' said Randy Sorensen, who worshiped with Mr. Romney in church.
As a young consultant who arrived at the office before anyone else, Mr. Romney was being ''deseret,'' a term from the Book of Mormon meaning industrious as a honeybee, and he recruited colleagues and clients with the zeal of the missionary he once was. Mitt and Ann Romney's marriage is strong because they believe they will live together in an eternal afterlife, relatives and friends say, which motivates them to iron out conflicts.
Mr. Romney's penchant for rules mirrors that of his church, where he once excommunicated adulterers and sometimes discouraged mothers from working outside the home. He may have many reasons for abhorring debt, wanting to limit federal power, promoting self-reliance and stressing the unique destiny of the United States, but those are all traditionally Mormon traits as well.
Outside the spotlight, Mr. Romney can be demonstrative about his faith: belting out hymns (''What a Friend We Have in Jesus'') while horseback riding, fasting on designated days and finding a Mormon congregation to slip into on Sundays, no matter where he is.
He prays for divine guidance on business decisions and political races, say those who have joined him. Sometimes on the campaign trail, Mr. and Mrs. Romney retreat to a quiet corner, bow their heads, clasp hands and share a brief prayer, said Representative Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican who has traveled with them.
Clayton M. Christensen, a business professor at Harvard and a friend from church, said the question that drove the Sunday school classes -- how to apply Mormon gospel in the wider world -- also drives Mr. Romney's life. ''He just needs to know what God wants him to do and how he can get it done,'' Mr. Christensen said.
Sacred Tenets, Secular Realm
When Mr. Romney's former Sunday school students listen to him campaign, they sometimes hear echoes of messages he delivered to them years before: beliefs that stem at least in part from his faith, in a way that casual observers may miss. He is not proselytizing but translating, they say -- taking powerful ideas and lessons from the church and applying them in another realm.
Just as Ronald Reagan deployed acting skills on the trail and Barack Obama relied on the language of community organizing, Mitt Romney bears the marks of the theology and culture of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. (Mr. Romney declined to be interviewed.)
Mormons have a long tradition of achieving success by sharing secular versions of their tenets, said Matthew Bowman, author of ''The Mormon People,'' citing Stephen R. Covey's ''The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People,'' which he called Latter-day Saint theology repackaged as career advice.
While Mr. Romney has expressed some views at odds with his church's teachings -- in Massachusetts, he supported measures related to alcohol and gambling, both frowned upon by the church -- other positions flow directly from his faith, including his objections to abortion and same-sex marriage and his notion of self-sufficiency tempered with generosity. The church, which often requests recipients of charity to perform some sort of labor in return, taught Mr. Romney to believe that ''there's a dignity in work and a dignity in helping those who are in need of help,'' his eldest son, Tagg, said in an interview.
Or take Mr. Romney's frequent tributes to American exceptionalism. ''I refuse to believe that America is just another place on the map with a flag,'' he said in announcing his bid for the presidency last June. Every presidential candidate highlights patriotism, but Mr. Romney's is backed by the Mormon belief that the United States was chosen by God to play a special role in history, its Constitution divinely inspired.
''He is an unabashed, unapologetic believer that America is the Promised Land,'' said Douglas D. Anderson, dean of the business school at Utah State University and a friend, and that leading it is ''an obligation and responsibility to God.''
In Mr. Romney's upbeat promises that he can rouse the economy from its long slump, fellow Mormons hear their faith's emphasis on resilience and can-do optimism. He believes that people ''can learn to be happy and prosperous,'' said Philip Barlow, a professor of Mormon history at Utah State who served with him in church. ''There is some depth and long tradition behind what can come across in sound bites as thin cheerleading.''
Similarly, he said, Mr. Romney's squeaky-clean persona -- only recently did he stop using words like ''golly'' in public -- can make him seem ''too plastic, the Ken side of a Ken and Barbie doll,'' Mr. Barlow said.
He and others say that wholesomeness is deeply authentic to Mr. Romney, whose spiritual life revolves around personal rectitude. In Mormonism, salvation depends in part on constantly making oneself purer and therefore more godlike.
In the temple Mr. Romney helped build in Belmont, as in every other, members change from street clothes into all-white garb when they arrive, to emphasize their elevated state. As a church leader, he enforced standards, evaluating members for a ''temple recommend,'' a gold-and-white pass permitting only the virtuous to enter.
A Man of Rules
Mr. Romney is quick to uphold rules great and small. During primary debates, when his rivals spoke out of turn or exceeded their allotted time, he would sometimes lecture them. When supporters ask Mr. Romney to sign dollar bills or American flags, he refuses and often gives them a little lesson about why doing so is against the law.
Doing things by the book has been a hallmark of his career in public life. When Mr. Romney took over the Salt Lake City Olympics, which were dogged by ethical problems, he cast himself as a heroic reformer. As governor of Massachusetts, he depicted himself as a voice of integrity amid what he called the back-scratchers and ethically dubious lifers of state government.
In church, Mr. Romney frequently spoke about obeying authority, the danger of rationalizing misbehavior and God's fixed standards. ''Most people, if they don't want to do what God wants them to do, they move what God wants them to do about four feet over,'' he once told his congregation, holding out his arms to indicate the distance, Mr. Christensen remembered.
He often urged adherence even to rules that could seem overly harsh. One fellow worshiper, Justin Brown, recalled in an interview that when he was a young man leaving for his mission abroad, Mr. Romney warned him that some parameters would make no sense, but to follow them anyway and trust that they had unseen value.
Church officials say Mr. Romney tried to be sensitive and merciful; when a college student faced serious penalties for having premarital sex, Mr. Romney put him on a kind of probation instead. But he carried out excommunications faithfully. ''Mitt was very much by the rules,'' said Tony Kimball, who later served as his executive secretary in the church.
Nearly two decades ago, Randy and Janna Sorensen approached Mr. Romney, then a church official, for help: unable to have a baby on their own, they wanted to adopt but could not do so through the church, which did not facilitate adoptions for mothers who worked outside the home.
Devastated, they told Mr. Romney that the rule was unjust and that they needed two incomes to live in Boston. Mr. Romney helped, but not by challenging church authorities. He took a calculator to the Sorensen household budget and showed how with a few sacrifices, Ms. Sorensen could quit her job. Their children are now grown, and Mr. Sorensen said they were so grateful that they had considered naming a child Mitt. (The church has since relaxed its prohibition on adoption for women who work outside the home.)
Among the Belmont Mormons, stories abound of Mr. Romney acting out the values he professed in church. The Romneys left their son Tagg's wedding reception early to take some of the food to a neighbor being treated for breast cancer.
But many also see a gap between his religious ideals -- in Sunday school, he urged his students to act with the highest standards of kindness and integrity -- and his political tactics. The chasm has been hard to reconcile, even though people close to him say he is serious about trying to do so.
Mormonism teaches respect for secular authorities as well as religious ones, but ''politics has required him to go against form,'' said Richard Bushman, a leading historian of the church who knows Mr. Romney from church.
For example, Mr. Romney had ruled out running personal attack ads against political rivals, those close to him said. When Senator Edward M. Kennedy attacked him as an uncaring capitalist in 1994, using ads that exaggerated Mr. Romney's role in Bain-related layoffs, Mr. Romney refused to punch back and exploit Mr. Kennedy's history of womanizing. ''Winning is not important enough to put aside my ideals and principles,'' Mr. Romney told aides.
But when he ran for governor in 2002, his campaign targeted the husband of his general election opponent, Shannon O'Brien (he had formerly worked as a lobbyist for Enron; the ads linked him to problems at the company that he had nothing to do with.)
Last week, Mr. Romney repudiated efforts to attack President Obama based on his past relationship with the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. But earlier this year, he suggested that Mr. Obama wanted to make the United States ''a less Christian nation.''
''I have absolutely no idea how he rationalizes it,'' Mr. Kimball said of Mr. Romney's harshest statements and attacks. ''It almost seems to be the ends justifying the means.''
Relying on Prayer
Though Mr. Romney almost never discusses it or performs it in public, prayer is a regular and important part of his life, say friends who have joined him. They describe him closing his eyes and addressing God with thees and thous, composing his message to suit the occasion, whether at a church meeting, at a hospital bedside or in a solemn moment with family and friends.
''Prayer is not a rote thing with him,'' said Ann N. Madsen, a Bible scholar and a friend. Rather than requesting a specific outcome, he more often asks for strength, wisdom and courage, according to several people who have prayed with him. ''Help us see how to navigate this particular problem,'' he often asks, according to Dr. Lewis Hassell, who served with Mr. Romney in church.
Former colleagues say they do not recall Mr. Romney praying in the workplace -- some say they barely heard the word ''God'' come from his lips -- but he did pray about work from his home.
''I remember literally kneeling down with Mitt at his home and praying about our firm,'' Bob Gay, a former Bain colleague and current church official, told Jeff Benedict, author of ''The Mormon Way of Doing Business.'' ''We did that in times of crisis, and we prayed that we'd do right by our people and our investors.''
Mr. Romney also prays before taking action on decisions he has already made, asking for divine reassurance, a feeling that he is ''united with the powers above,'' Dr. Hassell said. Sometimes Mr. Romney would report that even though he had made a decision on the merits, prayer had changed his mind. ''Even though rationally this looks like the thing to do, I just have a feeling we shouldn't do it,'' he would say, according to Grant Bennett, another friend and church leader.
Mr. Romney has also asked for divine sustenance during his political runs. The night before he declared his candidacy for governor, he and his family prayed at home with Gloria White-Hammond and Ray Hammond, friends and pastors of a Boston-area African Methodist Episcopal church.
His earlier failed run for United States Senate had all been part of God's plan, Mrs. Romney told Ms. White-Hammond around that time. Mr. Romney had lost, but ''just because God says for you to do something doesn't mean the outcome is going to be what you want it to be,'' Ms. White-Hammond remembered Mrs. Romney saying.
Having a higher purpose is part of what motivates Mr. Romney, many of those close to him say, and gives him the wherewithal to suffer the slings and arrows of political life. Mormons have a ''history of persistence and tenacity, a sense of living out a destiny that is connected to earlier generations,'' said Mr. Anderson, the business school dean. Mr. Romney is driven by ''responsibility to his father and his father's fathers to use his time and talent and energy and whatever gifts he's been given by the Lord to try to make a contribution.''
And while voters tend to see Mr. Romney as immensely fortunate, those close to him say that he never forgets he is a member of an oft-derided religious minority. The chapel where Mr. Romney taught Sunday school burned in a case of suspected arson in the 1980s, a still-unsolved crime that church members attribute to prejudice.
As a candidate for governor, Mr. Romney endured crude jokes, made to his face, including about having more than one wife. After his failed 2008 presidential bid, Mr. Romney told Richard Eyre, a friend, that he wished the church could rebrand itself, replacing the name ''Mormon'' with ''Latter-day Christian'' to emphasize its belief in Jesus and the New Testament.
His response to prejudice, friends say, has always been to soldier on and to present the best possible example, knowing that others will draw conclusions about the faith based on his behavior. ''In his generation, George Romney was the world's most famous Mormon, and now Mitt is more famous than his dad,'' Mr. Anderson said.
Mr. Romney told fellow Mormons at Bain & Company that they had to work harder and perform better because they had a reputation to defend. With a similar motive, Mr. Romney sent volunteer cleaning crews each week to the churches that lent space to the Belmont Mormons after the chapel fire. Confronted with the nasty joke about Mormons during the race for governor, Mr. Romney brushed it off even as his face tensed, recalled Jonathan Spampinato, his former political director.
''Romneys were made to swim upstream,'' he has told friends many times.
About a year ago, Mrs. Romney told Ms. White-Hammond that her husband was probably going to run for president again, and that they were both already praying about the race.
Mr. Romney was still a bit reluctant to re-enter the fray, according to Ms. White-Hammond. But she recalled the soon-to-be candidate's wife saying that the Romneys both ''felt it was what God wanted them to do.''

HEADLINE: Do You Want the Good News First?

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Seattle
I'VE spent the last week traveling to two of America's greatest innovation hubs -- Silicon Valley and Seattle -- and the trip left me feeling a combination of exhilaration and dread. The excitement comes from not only seeing the stunning amount of innovation emerging from the ground up, but from seeing the new tools coming on stream that are, as Amazon.com's founder, Jeff Bezos, put it to me, ''eliminating all the gatekeepers'' -- making it easier and cheaper than ever to publish your own book, start your own company and chase your own dream. Never have individuals been more empowered, and we're still just at the start of this trend.
''I see the elimination of gatekeepers everywhere,'' said Bezos. Thanks to cloud computing for the masses, anyone anywhere can for a tiny hourly fee now rent the most powerful computing and storage facilities on Amazon's ''cloud'' to test any algorithm or start any company or publish any book. Start-ups can even send all their inventory to Amazon, and it will do all the fulfillment and delivery -- and even gift wrap your invention before shipping it to your customers. 
This is leading to an explosion of new firms and voices. ''Sixteen of the top 100 best sellers on Kindle today were self-published,'' said Bezos. That means no agent, no publisher, no paper -- just an author, who gets most of the royalties, and Amazon and the reader. It is why, Bezos adds, the job of the company leader now is changing fast: ''You have to think of yourself not as a designer but as a gardener'' -- seeding, nurturing, inspiring, cultivating the ideas coming from below, and then making sure people execute them.
The leading companies driving this trend -- Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, Google, Apple, LinkedIn, Zynga and Twitter -- are all headquartered and listed in America. Facebook, which didn't exist nine years ago, just went public at a valuation of nearly $105 billion -- two weeks after buying a company for $1 billion, Instagram, which didn't exist 18 months ago. So why any dread?
It's because we're leaving an era of some 50 years' duration in which to be a president, a governor, a mayor or a college president was, on balance, to give things away to people; and we're entering an era -- no one knows for how long -- in which to be a president, a governor, a mayor or a college president will be, on balance, to take things away from people. And if we don't make this transition in a really smart way -- by saying, ''Here are the things that made us great, that spawned all these dynamic companies'' -- and make sure that we're preserving as much of that as we can, this trend will not spread as it should. Maybe we could grow as a country without a plan. But we dare not cut without a plan. We can really do damage. I can lose weight quickly if I cut off both arms, but it will surely reduce my job prospects.
What we must preserve is that magic combination of cutting-edge higher education, government-funded research and immigration of high-I.Q. risk-takers. They are, in combination, America's golden goose, laying all these eggs in Seattle and Silicon Valley. China has it easy right now. It just needs to do the jobs that we have already invented, just more cheaply. America has to invent the new jobs -- and that requires preserving the goose.
Microsoft still does more than 80 percent of its research work in America. But that is becoming harder and harder to sustain when deadlock on Capitol Hill prevents it from acquiring sufficient visas for the knowledge workers it needs that America's universities are not producing enough of. The number of filled jobs at Microsoft went up this year from 40,000 to 40,500 at its campus outside Seattle, yet its list of unfilled jobs went from 4,000 to almost 5,000. Eventually, it will have no choice but to shift more research to other countries.
It is terrifying to see how budget-cutting in California is slowly reducing what was once one of the crown jewels of American education -- the University of California system -- to a shadow of its old self. And I fear the cutting is just beginning. As one community leader in Seattle remarked to me, governments basically do three things: ''Medicate, educate and incarcerate.'' And various federal and state mandates outlaw cuts in medicating and incarcerating, so much of the money is coming out of educating. Unfortunately, even to self-publish, you still need to know how to write. The same is happening to research. A new report just found that federal investment in biomedical research through the National Institutes of Health has decreased almost every year since 2003.
When we shrink investments in higher education and research, ''we shoot ourselves in both feet,'' remarked K.R. Sridhar, founder of Bloom Energy, the Silicon Valley fuel-cell company. ''Our people become less skilled, so you are shooting yourself in one foot. And the smartest people from around the world have less reason to come here for the quality education, so you are shooting yourself in the other foot.''
The Labor Department reported two weeks ago that even with our high national unemployment rate, employers advertised 3.74 million job openings in March. That is, in part, about a skills mismatch. In an effort to overcome that, and help fill in the financing gap for higher education in Washington State, Boeing and Microsoft recently supported a plan whereby the state, which was cutting funding to state universities but also not letting them raise tuition, would allow the colleges to gradually raise rates and the two big companies would each kick in $25 million for scholarships for students wanting to study science and technology or health care to ensure that they have the workers they need.
This is not a call to ignore the hard budget choices we have to make. It's a call to make sure that we give education, immigration and research their proper place in the discussion.
''Empowering the individual and underinvesting in the collective is our great macro danger as a society,'' said the pollster Craig Charney. Indeed, it is. Investment in our collective institutions and opportunities is the only way to mitigate the staggering income inequalities that can arise from a world where Facebook employees can become billionaires overnight, while the universities that produce them are asked to slash billions overnight. As I've said, nations that don't invest in the future tend not to do well there.

HEADLINE: Obama's Not-So-Hot Date With Wall Street

 BODY:
It's not surprising that President Obama is having a hard time raising money from Wall Street donors, including some who enthusiastically supported him the last time. But what is surprising is the degree to which the shift in donor behavior seems driven not by cold calculations of political interest (which is how you expect interest groups to behave) but by a mixture of pique and paranoia. . . . A culture of aggrieved petulance pervades politics, and nowhere is it more intense than on Wall Street, where it is a kind of psychological buffer against the terrible responsibility the banks bear for their central role in the economic disaster that we're all still muddling through. So any slight must be taken literally. And politics is no longer mainly about defending interests (though, of course, it is still mostly about that). It's about payback and, ultimately, cheap emotional gratification. 
JOHN McQUAID,
posted on forbes.com
I don't understand the people who say that Obama should avoid Wall Street donors entirely. Raising all of your campaign money from small donors is a great idea in a world where 10 billionaires can't easily match the donations of 1,000,000 small donors. But we don't live in that world .
A,
Indiana, posted on nytimes.com
It's funny: bankers are ignoring Obama's fund-raising pleas because they say they didn't get what they want -- and I'm ignoring Obama's fund-raising pleas because I say the bankers got everything they wanted.

HEADLINE: Loving Liberals

BYLINE: By JEFF SHESOL. 
Jeff Shesol, the author of ''Supreme /Power: Franklin Roosevelt vs. the Supreme Court,'' was a speechwriter for President Bill Clinton.

 BODY:
THE CAUSE
The Fight for American Liberalism From Franklin Roosevelt to Barack Obama
By Eric Alterman and Kevin Mattson
561 pp. Viking. $32.95.
The trouble with liberals, Robert Kennedy complained in 1964, was that they were ''in love with death'' -- they romanticized failure, finding greater nobility in losing the whole loaf than in winning half of it. In the years since then, liberals have not only lost a lot of loaves but have acquired a mess of other troubles, among them the difficulty of getting anyone to admit to being a liberal. To wear the label today seems an act of defiance, much as members of the gay rights community have appropriated, from their antagonists, the epithet ''queer.'' Liberalism -- for decades (centuries, even) the prevailing philosophy in American political life -- has become the creed that dare not speak its name, except late at night on MSNBC. 
Enter Eric Alterman, defiant to the last. In 2008, this columnist and media critic published a handbook called ''Why We're Liberals,'' a crisply written and emphatically argued retort to the Coulters, Hannitys and others for whom liberalism is a strain of fascism, totalitarianism, socialism and overmothering (why choose?). Alterman's new book, ''The Cause,'' written with an assist from the historian Kevin Mattson, is something of a companion volume: a history of liberalism from Franklin Roosevelt to the present. (Mattson's role is a bit ambiguous; in the book's acknowledgments, Alterman credits him with providing ''raw material.'')
The story Alterman tells is in large part a familiar one, but worth restating given the strenuous -- and to a distressing degree successful -- campaign by conservatives to rewrite the entire history of liberalism, and indeed of America itself in the years before the Reagan ''revolution,'' as one long love affair with central planning and welfare dependency. Alterman works hard to correct the record. By concentrating on the men and women who have defined liberalism in the modern era, ''The Cause'' lends a human dimension to the dramatic expansion of the federal government, and of the public's expectations of government, during the New Deal; the postwar faith in economic growth as the engine of social progress; liberalism's landmark achievements during the early years of Lyndon Johnson's presidency; its embrace of civil rights and other new expressions of liberal ideals of freedom, equal opportunity and the dignity of the individual; and, from the 1970s onward, its failure to square its ambitions, at least in an enduring way, with the values and norms of middle-class America and the slow corrosion of the American dream.
Much of this unfolds, in ''The Cause,'' by inference, or as interstitial material between character sketches. This is less a book about liberalism than it is a book about liberals -- stretch limousines full of them, fleet after fleet. Liberalism, Alterman suggests, is a movement of ''many different faces,'' and his book, at times, appears intent on showing them all: faces of intellectuals, faces of politicians, faces of protesters and filmmakers, philosophers and diplomats.
There is an indiscriminate quality to Alterman's attentions, which too often seem to reflect his personal passions rather than a careful weighing of a figure's historical significance. Thus Oliver Stone gets just as much ink as Walter Reuther, a towering figure in the history of organized labor; Bruce Springsteen, about whom Alterman has written a previous book, receives more airtime than Hubert Humphrey and Thurgood Marshall combined. (Bob Dylan, meanwhile, merits only passing mentions.) Alterman's choices can be interesting and even brave; one has to admire his willingness to include intellectuals like Lionel Trilling and Richard Rorty in a work of popular history. But in such a crowded field, their relative influence -- and anyone else's -- becomes impossible to assess.
The net effect is that of a Pointillist painting, though when you step back from the canvas and squint a little, the dots fail to cohere into a discernible image. As ''The Cause'' smash-cuts from Henry Wallace to Richard Hofstadter and from Gloria Steinem to Gary Hart, Alterman pauses all too infrequently to reflect on the ''cause'' -- or causes, or ideals -- that connects them. This, to be fair, is a challenge, one compounded by liberal schisms and by the nebulousness of much liberal thought; Trilling, as Alterman notes, described liberalism as ''a large tendency rather than a concise body of doctrine.'' Liberals, quite unlike leftist radicals or conservative ideologues, tend to reject dogma and theory in favor of ''bold, persistent experimentation,'' as Roosevelt called it, or, put another way, pragmatism grounded in enduring, yet evolving, values. It is hard to dissect a gestalt.
Still, that is the historian's role, and other books -- most notably, in recent years, by Alan Brinkley and Paul Starr -- have brought sharpness to the picture that ''The Cause'' renders blurry. Despite its author's best intentions, ''The Cause'' makes it harder, not easier, to understand how liberals ever mustered the intellectual clarity or collective resolve not only to govern but to achieve what they manifestly did during their long reign at the vital center of our national life -- or even, in a more qualified way, during the two dec/ades since Bill Clinton promised to ''put people first.''
As ''The Cause'' proceeds toward the present day, Alterman reveals a revanchist streak. Urging liberals to ''recapture'' Roosevelt's ''militant and optimistic spirit,'' he casts a cold eye on virtually every effort, over the past 30 years, to do just that. The intimation of ''The Cause'' -- of both its title and its tone -- is that there really is a true faith against which subsequent vintages of liberalism must be judged (and found wanting). ''Neo/liberals'' like Gary Hart are dismissed as callow and cold; ''New Democrats'' of the late 1980s are overly in thrall to their corporate donors; and Michael Dukakis, poor Michael Dukakis, is not merely a loser but ''no liberal at all -- just a sign of the desperate times into which American liberalism had fallen in its apparently endless quest for solid political ground.'' As for Clinton, Jimmy Carter and Barack Obama, the Democrats who have been elected president since Johnson, ''The Cause'' flays all three for yielding to ''political pressures'' and becoming ''far more conservative'' as president than as presidential candidates.
Each of these points is arguable in its own right. But taken together, they reflect a contempt for compromise. Without proposing an alternative path, Alterman leaves liberals in a familiar dead end. This, regrettably, is the sort of peremptory judgment that holds liberalism back (just as the conservative equivalent, with its fixation on Reagan-era doctrines and its incantation of old pieties, binds the Republican Party in a kind of intellectual aspic).
''The work goes on, the cause endures,'' said Robert Kennedy's brother Edward -- one of the heroes of this book -- in his stirring speech at the 1980 Democratic National Convention. But if it really is to endure, then the means of advancing it will surely have to evolve, taking full account of unpleasant realities: the scale of the debt; the depth of public suspicion not just of government but of most institutions; courts that have grown hostile to claims of civil rights and assertions of governmental power; and the tenuousness of our commitment to the common good. The work, indeed, goes on.

HEADLINE: World Leaders Urge Growth, Not Austerity

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER; Annie Lowrey contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
CAMP DAVID, Md. -- Leaders of the world's richest countries banded together on Saturday to press Germany to back more pro-growth policies to halt the deepening debt crisis in Europe, as President Obama for the first time gained widespread support for his argument that Europe, and the United States by extension, cannot afford Chancellor Angela Merkel's one-size-fits-all approach emphasizing austerity.
Pointedly recognizing ''that the right measures are not the same for each of us,'' the leaders of the Group of 8 nations, at a meeting hosted by Mr. Obama at Camp David, committed to ''take all necessary steps'' to strengthen their economies. They said they wanted to keep Greece in the euro zone and vowed to work to promote growth in Europe, though behind the scenes distinct differences remained over what kinds of stimulus policies to pursue.
''Our imperative,'' the leaders said in their statement, ''is to promote growth and jobs.'' 
It is by no means the final word in the growth-versus-austerity fight that has been under way for two years. Even with the future of the European currency union in doubt, Germany has insisted that Europe's ailing economies tackle their financial problems through spending cuts, a policy that critics say has caused higher unemployment, brought Greece to the edge of bankruptcy and worsened the crises in Spain and Italy.
The leaders did concede somewhat to Ms. Merkel's position on austerity, acknowledging that national budget deficits had to be addressed. But they added that spending cuts must ''take into account countries' evolving economic conditions and underpin confidence and economy recovery,'' a recognition of how much the austerity packages have dampened consumer and political confidence in Europe.
Also, in a warning to Iran, the leaders pledged to take steps to guarantee continued oil supplies after an oil embargo against Iran begins on July 1.While Greece is not part of the Group of 8 -- the club is made up of the United States, France, Germany, Britain, Italy, Canada, Japan and Russia -- the political and economic crisis facing Athens hovered over the meeting. Greece has been unable to form a government after voters, angry over austerity measures, brought down the last government, and there is now talk of bringing back the drachma and abandoning the euro.
Ms. Merkel and Mr. Obama met privately after the meeting ended. In her public remarks, the German chancellor said that growth and deficit-cutting reinforced each other, and that ''we have to work on both paths, and the participants have made that clear, and I think that is great progress.''
With his own re-election bid tied to a fragile American economic recovery that could easily reverse if Europe's economy takes another turn for the worse, Mr. Obama was pushing hard on Saturday for a euro-zone growth package. American officials said they hoped that after the full-court press this weekend at Camp David, Ms. Merkel would be more amenable to the pro-growth argument when she meets with European leaders this week at a summit to come up with specific steps to fight rising debt while spurring the economy.
The last time world leaders met to discuss the European debt crisis, in Cannes last November, the French president at the time, Nicolas Sarkozy, joined with Ms. Merkel to push Italy to stick to an austerity package. But the tone was different this time. Mr. Sarkozy lost his re-election bid to Francois Hollande, who came into office last week promising to focus on growth. And even before they showed up at Camp David to gang up on Ms. Merkel, Mr. Hollande and Mr. Obama had forged a new alliance at a prearranged meeting at the White House to focus on growth.
In comments to reporters afterward, Mr. Obama said that the group needed to discuss ''a responsible approach to fiscal consolidation that is coupled with a strong growth agenda.''
''If a company is forced to cut back in Paris or Madrid, that might mean less business for workers in Pittsburgh or Milwaukee,'' Mr. Obama said to explain why the European crisis matters to the United States. He said that while Europe's predicament is ''more complicated'' since it requires coordination among multiple governments, steps his own government took to blunt the impact of the American financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, including the stimulus, can stand as an example for Europe.
In a tense meeting here at this storied presidential retreat, it seemed at times as if it was Ms. Merkel -- who faces stiff opposition at home to more bailouts of its neighbors by German taxpayers -- against the world. Things did not seem to get off to a good start either on Friday night, as Mr. Obama greeted his guests for dinner in a rustic wood cabin.
''How've you been?'' Mr. Obama asked Ms. Merkel.
She shrugged and pursed her lips.
''Well, you have a few things on your mind,'' Mr. Obama said consolingly.
Mike Froman, Mr. Obama's top adviser on international economic affairs, was careful not to publicly single out Ms. Merkel and Germany when talking to reporters after the meeting. The debate over austerity vs. growth, he said, ''has been going on for some time, and we welcome the evolution on that debate.''
But it remains unclear how far Ms. Merkel will go, despite the pressure from other leaders. Ms. Merkel on Saturday was fresh from a war of words with Greece over that country's continued membership in the euro, with Greek politicians complaining that Ms. Merkel had suggested a referendum asking Greece whether it wanted to stay in the euro, a claim that a spokesman for Ms. Merkel has denied.
Separately, the leaders also said they ''stand ready'' to call on the International Energy Agency to take appropriate action to guarantee oil supplies if prices spike. ''There have been increasing disruptions in the supply of oil to the global market over the past several months, which pose a substantial risk to global economic growth,'' the group said in a statement.
The oil statement was meant to reassure oil markets that nations will consider tapping into their oil reserves if there is a supply shortage. It is particularly meant to send a warning to Iran -- which is the target of an oil embargo to begin July 1 as part of the western effort to rein in Tehran's nuclear ambitions -- that the West will work to counteract high oil prices once the sanctions go into effect. Finally, it is meant to reassure countries like India and China that they will not be hurt by higher prices once the sanctions begin.
Still, American officials expressed optimism that negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program, which are set to reopen at the end of the month in Baghdad, might be productive.
The intimate setting of the meeting -- in secluded Camp David, where the leaders slept in cabins and their attendants shared rooms -- allowed for a more relaxed atmosphere, White House officials said.
Mr. Obama and Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain were on treadmills early Saturday morning discussing ways to help ease the debt crisis.
''Nobody felt defensive or put on the defense,'' Mr. Froman said, disputing reports that Ms. Merkel was isolated.

HEADLINE: Of Bile and Billionaires

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
NOW we know what, in today's warped political economy, $10 million buys you: a hit job spectacular not only in its cynicism but also in its idiocy.
As Jeff Zeleny and Jim Rutenberg reported last week in The Times, a politically agitated billionaire (these days, there don't seem to be any other kind) was considering forking over that much for an advertising campaign that would have dusted off the Rev. Jeremiah Wright and tried to fashion him anew into a noose for Barack Obama.
But while such a campaign would have been eaten up by many established Obama opponents already bloated with hostility toward him, it would have nauseated most swing voters, who are poised to decide the presidential contest of 2012. Beyond which, these voters have had three and a half years of Obama's actual presidency, as opposed to his bright promises and others' dark prophecies, to decide whether he's a closet black radical, as the advertising campaign would have insinuated, or a ''metrosexual, black Abe Lincoln,'' which is how it would have described his self-presentation in 2008. 
A moment's pause and a measure of sorely needed levity are in order, to contemplate what a metrosexual Abe Lincoln might look like. Tidier beard, for sure. Better manscaping all in all. Maybe some mole removal. Lose the top hat. Less Potomac, more Provincetown.
But back to business: these Wright ads, now shelved forevermore, would more likely have buoyed than torpedoed the president, because swing voters -- who swung for Obama once already -- don't want to be told that they were duped in 2008. They still have some emotional investment in his narrative, and in many cases maintain affection and respect for the man himself. That's why his re-election prospects and approval ratings aren't as bad as they might be, given our prolonged economic doldrums and the unpopularity of health care reform.
And he's a cooler, more charismatic cat than Mitt Romney, whose wisest supporters know that a contest stressing jobs is better for their candidate than a contest stressing personality and emotions.
Joe Ricketts, the billionaire who contemplated a wrongful use of Wright, apparently didn't get that memo. Perhaps he was distracted by the baseball team his family owns, the Chicago Cubs, or his bison, herds of which he keeps in Wyoming. Rich people collect the darnedest things.
In any case he went rogue, like a missile or a Palin, and in doing so illustrated two disturbing, corrosive dynamics in our political culture right now.
The first is the seemingly metastasizing ranks of magnates with itchy millions and the desire to single-handedly bankroll certain candidates or initiatives. They're exemplified by Sheldon Adelson, who saw no better use for his wealth than stringing out Newt & Callista's Execrable Adventure long past the point of box-office viability.
And they're emboldened, perhaps, by a freewheeling climate around campaign spending right now. In the wake of Citizens United, super PACs could turn out to be the new Gulfstream jets. No tycoon is complete without one.
It's fascinating how things have evolved and spun out of control. In the quaint old days of Lee Atwater and his disciples, a candidate's team nudged outside players to do dirty work that it didn't want its own fingerprints on. The Ricketts saga raises the specter of outside players actually volunteering for even dirtier work that a candidate's team has no desire for and can't wrestle control of. The Swift Boat has a motor and mind of its own.
And what nasty waves it makes. That's the second issue here. A memo prepared for Ricketts expressed frustration that voters ''still aren't ready to hate this president.'' Note the word choice in that thought and the goal telegraphed by it. Voters aren't to be persuaded that Obama lacks the proper skills and plan. They're to be pumped full of unalloyed disdain for him.
THAT'S how too many campaigns and legislative battles are waged these days: with bile instead of reason, catcalls in place of conversation, and the basest of instincts.
Your opponent isn't just ill informed. He or she is an idiot.
Your opponent isn't just wrongheaded. He or she is evil incarnate.
Under Mitt Romney's leadership, Bain Capital didn't just close a Kansas City steel mill. ''Like a vampire,'' it ''sucked the life'' from the enterprise and those involved in it, according to a former worker whom the Obama campaign chose to showcase in a TV ad it ran on Wednesday night.
There's a take-no-prisoners approach that does take prisoners: all of us, incarcerated in a system whose crippling partisanship is fueled in part by the hyperbolic language, bellicose tactics and Manichaean tone of candidates and their handlers.
And while there was slander aplenty in our politics past, it wasn't amplified quite as loudly or spread quite as ferociously as it is by the fight club of today's hyped-up news outlets, many of which run on the adrenaline of insults and recruit partisan voices to beckon partisan audiences. Turning to Fox News or the Daily Caller, unshakable conservatives can marinate in their contempt for liberals. Turning to MSNBC or the Daily Kos, unshakable liberals can repay the favor.
And the swing voters are turned off. Many of them recoil from meanness run amok and cynicism on steroids, which is why Ricketts's redeployment of Wright would have been such folly. They want someone to make them feel calmer and more confident, not anxious and gross.
Worth noting: Rob Portman, the Ohio senator mentioned frequently these days as a front-runner for the Republican vice-presidential nomination, won his 2010 race, in a state whose other senator is a Democrat, by 18 points. Yes, it was an excellent year for Republicans, but not quite that excellent for all of them.
He didn't do it with runaway charisma (though a financial advantage certainly helped). He did it in his steady, subdued manner. In fact the rap on him as a potential running mate for Romney is that he's too boring.
Maybe so. But there are clearly voters out there who are interested in turning down the heat on our political discourse. Flamethrowers like Ricketts are the last thing they want. And the last thing we need.

HEADLINE: Discord at Key JPMorgan Unit Is Blamed in Bank's Huge Loss

BYLINE: By JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG and NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Ever since JPMorgan Chase disclosed a multibillion-dollar trading loss this month, the central mystery has been how a bank known for its skill at risk management could err so badly.
As early as 2010, the senior banker who has been blamed for the debacle, Ina Drew, began to lose her grip on the bank's chief investment office, according to current and former traders. She had guided the bank through some of the most rugged moments of the 2008 financial crisis, earning the trust of Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's chief executive, in the process.
But after contracting Lyme disease in 2010, she was frequently out of the office for a critical period, when her unit was making riskier bets, and her absences allowed long-simmering internal divisions and clashing egos to come to the fore, the traders said.
The morning conference calls Ms. Drew had presided over devolved into shouting matches between her deputies in New York and London, the traders said. That discord in 2010 and 2011 contributed to the chief investment office's losing trades in 2012, the current and former bankers said. 
''The strife distracted everyone because no one could push back,'' said one current trader in the office who insisted on anonymity because of the nature of the issue. ''I think everything spiraled because of the personality issues.''
Mr. Dimon has described the trades as ''sloppy'' and ''stupid,'' but has not identified the specific mistakes. The trading loss, initially estimated at $2 billion but now said to equal at least $3 billion, is the most embarrassing misstep of Mr. Dimon's seven-year tenure, and it has also strengthened the hand of regulators in Washington who are in the final stages of writing rules that could reshape the banking industry. In his radio address on Saturday, President Obama urged tighter restrictions on banks' trading activity.
JPMorgan and Ms. Drew declined to comment. Mr. Dimon is due to make a presentation Monday at an investor conference in Manhattan sponsored by Deutsche Bank. While JPMorgan's stock has suffered since the disclosure of the loss, the bank's overall health remains strong, and the company is expected to post a significant profit in the second quarter.
Ms. Drew, 55, resigned as chief investment officer last week. In 2011, she earned roughly $14 million, making her the bank's fourth-highest-paid officer.
But when the losses were mounting in recent weeks, Ms. Drew's command of the chief investment office was far different from what it had been during her stellar performance of 2008, according to interviews with more than a dozen current and former traders, bankers and executives at JPMorgan Chase. All insisted on anonymity because the losses were being examined by a host of regulators, as well as the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
In the midst of the financial crisis, for example, Ms. Drew attended the regular morning huddle with traders and forced them to defend positions and outline the risks they would face during the approaching trading day.
''I always thought she was coolheaded and an excellent manager,'' said Petros Sabatacakis, a former senior executive at Citigroup who worked with Ms. Drew at Chemical Bank.
Senior executives at JPMorgan said that her success in 2008, even as other banks were sustaining crippling losses, helped forge a sense of implicit trust between Ms. Drew and Mr. Dimon, one reason that he believed her initial assurances last month that the trades were not seriously troubling.
Ms. Drew also enjoyed the confidence of her subordinates, according to former employees. Part of her skill, they said, was her steely resolve. One former trader recalled that Ms. Drew counseled a credit trader who had a large bet in bank-preferred securities, which began to lose money during 2009. Instead of folding, Ms. Drew supported the trader who wanted to hold on, ultimately generating $1 billion in profits.
Ms. Drew's success during the market crisis in 2008 also left the chief investment office feeling much more confident -- too confident, in the eyes of some former employees there.
''When Ina was there, things ran smoothly,'' one former trader there said.
But Ms. Drew's firm hand began to weaken after she contracted Lyme disease. Her absences opened the door for tensions among her deputies to flare into the open. ''Look,'' one current trader added, ''it is a tough place to work.''
Most significant, her deputy in New York was increasingly at loggerheads with her deputy in London who spearheaded the strategy behind the losing bet, Achilles Macris, the current and former traders said.
But there was only so much she could do when she was away, even though some current traders and senior executives at the bank emphasized that Ms. Drew remained vigilant about risky trades throughout her tenure.
''No one could really challenge Achilles's traders,'' a former risk officer said.
Beyond that, the chief investment office was performing well, earning sizable profits for JPMorgan even as other businesses at the bank, like home loans, began to hemorrhage money. Those gains came as the size of the unit's trades was increasing, but the office's success blunted questions that were raised about the added risk.
During this time, Mr. Macris gained more latitude to build and expand trades from his desk in London -- including the wagers that ultimately went so wrong for the bank.
For example, Althea Duersten, who was Mr. Macris's counterpart in New York and oversaw North American trading, raised objections to Mr. Macris's outsize bet but was routinely shouted down by Mr. Macris during conference calls between London and New York, former traders said.
What's more, the brewing tension between Mr. Macris and Ms. Duersten left traders feeling whipsawed, said one trader in New York who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicate nature of the trading loss within the bank.
At one point, Ms. Duersten called one trader into her office at the New York headquarters and told him that he would report to her, instead of to Mr. Macris, the trader said. ''Achilles hit the roof'' upon hearing of the meeting, the trader said, adding that he ''didn't know who to listen to.''
Mr. Macris was unavailable for comment, as was Ms. Duersten.
Ms. Drew eventually returned from sick leave and reasserted herself as head of the chief investment office. But instead of sitting one floor above the trading desk, as she had done previously, Ms. Drew, in a reflection of her rising profile, moved upstairs to an office among senior executives on the 48th floor of JPMorgan's headquarters at 270 Park Avenue.
Ms. Drew was now markedly less hands-on with the trading book than she had been in the past, former employees said.
''It felt like there was a land grab where no one was pushing back because Althea and Achilles both wanted more responsibility,'' one of the former traders said.
The situation worsened in early 2011 when Irene Tse, who came from the hedge fund Duquesne Capital Management, took over for Ms. Duersten as head of the North American trading desk.
The chief investment office continued to post healthy profits in 2011, as it had in 2010 and 2009. But the size of its bets continued to grow, and many of the trades assembled by Mr. Macris's traders were growing more complex, making them harder to exit when market conditions turned against the bank in 2012.
In addition, Ms. Tse was even less equipped to battle Mr. Macris because, unlike Ms. Duersten, she was a newcomer to the firm and first had to find her bearings, the current and former traders said. Before her retirement, Ms. Duersten had been at JPMorgan for over 16 years.
On the conference calls, the yelling continued, only now it was between Ms. Tse and Mr. Macris. Ms. Tse was unavailable for comment.
As the infighting continued, Mr. Macris was supervising Bruno Iksil, now known as the London Whale for the huge positions he amassed in the credit markets.
''No one could sufficiently push back against Achilles, so he and Bruno could do what they wanted,'' one former trader said.
Undergirding these trades was a bullish bet linked to an index of investment-grade bonds. Unfortunately for JPMorgan Chase, the market has grown much more anxious about corporate credit in recent months. Now, with losses rising as hedge funds and other investors profit from JPMorgan's distress, the company is trying to unwind the disastrous trade.
Its architects -- Mr. Macris and Mr. Iksil -- are both expected, like Ms. Drew, to leave the firm.

HEADLINE: Obama: Stop Condescending to Women

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL BROWN. 
A former news anchor for CNN and NBC.

 BODY:
WHEN I listen to President Obama speak to and about women, he sometimes sounds too paternalistic for my taste. In numerous appearances over the years -- most recently at the Barnard graduation -- he has made reference to how women are smarter than men. It's all so tired, the kind of fake praise showered upon those one views as easy to impress. As I listen, I am always bracing for the old go-to cliche: ''Behind every great man is a great woman.''
Some women are smarter than men and some aren't. But to suggest to women that they deserve dominance instead of equality is at best a cheap applause line. 
My bigger concern is that in courting women, Mr. Obama's campaign so far has seemed maddeningly off point. His message to the Barnard graduates was that they should fight for a ''seat at the table'' -- the head seat, he made sure to add. He conceded that it's a tough economy, but he told the grads, ''I am convinced you are tougher'' and ''things will get better -- they always do.''
Hardly reassuring words when you look at the reality. According to the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University, about 53.6 percent of men and women under the age of 25 who hold bachelor's degrees were jobless or underemployed last year, the most in at least 11 years. According to the Pew Research Center, if we broaden the age group to 18- to 29-year-olds, an estimated 37 percent are unemployed or out of the work force, the highest share in more than three decades.
The human faces shouldn't get lost amid the statistics. I spent last weekend with a friend who attended excellent private schools and graduated from Tufts University two years ago. She's intelligent, impressive and still looking for a full-time job.
The women I know who are struggling in this economy couldn't be further from the fictional character of Julia, presented in Mr. Obama's Web ad, ''The Life of Julia,'' a silly and embarrassing caricature based on the assumption that women look to government at every meaningful phase of their lives for help.
My cousin in Louisiana started a small company with a little savings, renovating houses. A single mom, she saved enough to buy a home and provide child care for her son. When the economy went belly up, so did her company. She was forced to sell her home and move in with her parents. She has found another job, but doesn't make enough to move out. Family, not government, has been everything to her at this time of crisis. She, and they, wouldn't have it any other way.
Another member of my family left her job at an adoption agency just before the economy crashed. Also a single mother, she has been looking for a way back to a full-time job ever since. She has been selling things on eBay to make ends meet. Friends and family, not government, have been there at the dire moments when she has asked them to be. Again, she, and they, wouldn't have it any other way.
This is not to say that government doesn't play a role in their lives. It does and it should. But it isn't a dominant one, and certainly not an overwhelming factor in their daily existence.
It's obvious why the president is doing a full-court press for the vote of college-educated women in particular. The Republican primaries probably did turn some women away. Rick Santorum did his party no favors when he spoke about women in combat (''I think that can be a very compromising situation, where people naturally may do things that may not be in the interest of the mission, because of other types of emotions that are involved''); when he described the birth of a child from rape as ''a gift in a very broken way''; and how, if he was president, he would make the case for the damage caused by contraception.
But Mitt Romney will never be confused with Rick Santorum on these issues, and many women understand that. (I should disclose here that my husband is an adviser to Mr. Romney; I have no involvement with any campaign, and have been an independent journalist throughout my career.) The struggling women in my life all laughed when I asked them if contraception or abortion rights would be a major factor in their decision about this election. For them, and for most other women, the economy overwhelms everything else.
Another recent Pew Research Center survey found that voters, when thinking about whom to vote for in the fall, are most concerned about the economy (86 percent) and jobs (84 percent). Near the bottom of the list were some of the hot-button social issues.
Tiffany Dufu, who heads the White House Project, a nonpartisan group aimed at training young women for careers in politics and business, got a similar response when she informally polled young women in her organization. ''The issues that have been defined as all women care about are way off -- young women feel it has put them further in a box they don't necessarily want to be in,'' she told me. ''Independence is what is so important to these women.''
I have always admired President Obama and I agree with him on some issues, like abortion rights. But the promise of his campaign four years ago has given way to something else -- a failure to connect with tens of millions of Americans, many of them women, who feel economic opportunity is gone and are losing hope. In an effort to win them back, Mr. Obama is trying too hard. He's employing a tone that can come across as grating and even condescending. He really ought to drop it. Most women don't want to be patted on the head or treated as wards of the state. They simply want to be given a chance to succeed based on their talent and skills. To borrow a phrase from our president's favorite president, Abraham Lincoln, they want ''an open field and a fair chance.''
In the second decade of the 21st century, that isn't asking too much.

HEADLINE: Thousand March Against Austerity In Frankfurt

BYLINE: By MELISSA EDDY

 BODY:
BERLIN -- Thousands of people on Saturday marched through the heart of Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital and the home of the European Central Bank, to protest against unchecked capitalism and Chancellor Angela Merkel's insistence on austerity measures for much of Europe. 
The peaceful event, called Blockupy, in a nod to the Occupy movement, was the culmination of four days of demonstrations and drew about 20,000 protesters to Frankfurt, the police and organizers said.
The protest, which drew supporters from across Europe, was meant to send a ''clear and visible signal of international solidarity against the authoritarian crisis management and the poverty inducing policies of the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund,'' organizers said.
Germany has pushed for deep spending cuts across Europe to control the debt crisis.
Ms. Merkel faces mounting criticism for championing what critics regard as a rigid agenda of fiscal discipline that has made unfair demands on countries like Greece, Portugal and Spain.
Speaking from the Group of 8 meeting in the United States on Saturday, Ms. Merkel sought to play down criticism that she was solely focused on austerity, or consolidation, saying Germany would be open to increasing loans and credits to struggling nations through the European Investment Bank.
''The important message is this: Consolidation and growth are the two sides of the same medallion,'' Ms. Merkel said, according to the German broadcaster ARD.

HEADLINE: Ordeal Ended, China Activist Lands in U.S.

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN, ANDREW JACOBS and STEVEN LEE MYERS; Thomas Kaplan reported from New York, Andrew Jacobs from Beijing, and Steven Lee Myers from Washington. Edy Yin contributed research from United Airlines Flight 88, and Matt Flegenheimer and Colin Moynihan contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
Chen Guangcheng, the blind legal advocate who recently sought refuge in the American Embassy in Beijing, arrived in the heart of Greenwich Village on Saturday, holding the kind of open-air news conference that he could have never imagined while under virtual house arrest in China.
After a daylong and hastily arranged flight from Beijing, Mr. Chen stood on crutches -- with a lawyer at his side and facing spectators cordoned off by the police -- and addressed a throng of reporters. He said he was grateful to the American Embassy and the Chinese government, which allowed him to leave China, and thanked Chinese officials for ''dealing with the situation with restraint and calm.''
''I hope to see that they continue to open discourse and earn the respect and trust of the people,'' said Mr. Chen, one of China's most prominent dissidents, who spoke through a translator near the New York University apartment tower that will become his home.
It was not clear weeks ago that China would permit Mr. Chen to leave, and the United States' role in his evading the authorities threatened to cause a diplomatic breach just as American officials were seeking China's cooperation on a range of economic and security issues it considers crucial. 
Mr. Chen's departure from Beijing on Saturday, and the arduous negotiations that led up to it, appeared to reflect careful calculations in both countries that the episode was not worth jeopardizing relations. The Chinese, who were initially infuriated and complained bitterly about what they considered interference in their internal affairs, in the end quietly engaged with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and a team of diplomats to defuse the situation.
The trip to New York ended an improbable journey that began in late April, when despite his lack of sight, Mr. Chen scaled the walls around his house, sneaked past the guards who held him captive and was whisked to Beijing by a human rights activist. American officials agreed to provide at least temporary shelter, but the pickup almost went awry: Chinese security cars trailed their vehicle, forcing them to sweep Mr. Chen into their car from another vehicle and race through the streets of the capital to the embassy.
But the drama did not end there. Mr. Chen decided more than a week later to stay in China, only to change his mind several hours later when American officials left him at a hospital and friends expressed fears for his safety. That led to renewed negotiations and eventually to Saturday's release.
Now, after years of isolation -- his every move at his home recorded by surveillance cameras -- and serving time in a Chinese jail, Mr. Chen found himself at the center of a media frenzy generated by his release.
But the sudden ability to speak out was bittersweet, which he acknowledged in an interview on the plane. China has a pattern of allowing some especially vocal dissidents to leave the country in order to minimize the impact of their activism at home, and it is unclear if he will be able to effect change as easily from so far away, while he studies at New York University.
''I don't really feel that happy, but rather sentimental,'' he said in the brief interview. ''After all the suffering for years, I don't have those tearful moments anymore, but I do feel something inside.''
He looked calm, but his hands shook as he talked about leaving a country he has tried to change from within for years.
''I'm very clear what kind of role I'm playing right now,'' he said. ''Opportunity and risk exist at the same time.''
In Washington, the State Department praised the Chinese government in a statement that reflected the United States' handling of the case from the start: understated and nonconfrontational, despite the emotions and high stakes involved for both countries. ''We also express our appreciation for the manner in which we were able to resolve this matter and to support Mr. Chen's desire to study in the U.S. and pursue his goals,'' the State Department's spokeswoman, Victoria Nuland, said.
Her statement referred to the complex understanding -- the Chinese were loath to call it a deal -- in which Mr. Chen will be allowed to attend law school on a fellowship rather than seek asylum, which the authorities in Beijing would have considered an affront. School officials said they had already stocked a faculty apartment with Chinese food and new furniture for him.
His departure from Beijing -- after two weeks of waiting -- avoided a major embarrassment for the Obama administration, which was criticized by Chinese activists and some Republicans in Congress who accused the administration of releasing Mr. Chen too quickly into Chinese custody and, they said, seeking an expedient solution to a nettlesome problem ahead of Mrs. Clinton's visit to China in early May. Since then, activists have been mainly supportive of the United States' efforts to help Mr. Chen.
On Saturday, Mr. Chen left Beijing with his wife and two children, and like most events surrounding his case, the departure was shrouded in secrecy. Mr. Chen and his family said they did not know they were leaving the country until several hours before the flight, and it was only on their way to the airport that they learned where they were heading. The passports they had been awaiting were delivered by Chinese officials shortly before the family got on the United Airlines plane.
Once on board, flight attendants promptly drew a curtain around their business class seats and barred other passengers in the cabin from using the bathroom while the plane was on the runway.
Speaking by cellphone before he boarded the flight, Mr. Chen told friends that he was excited to leave China but was worried about the fate of relatives left behind. Bob Fu, president of ChinaAid, a Christian advocacy group in Texas that championed Mr. Chen's case, said, ''He's happy to finally have a rest after seven years of suffering, but he's also worried they will suffer some retribution.''
Mr. Chen and his family were driven directly to Beijing International Airport by employees of Chaoyang Hospital, where Mr. Chen had been treated for intestinal problems and for the foot he broke during his escape. .
Mr. Chen, a self-taught lawyer blinded by childhood illness, was once toasted by the state news media for his advocacy of the disabled and the disenfranchised.
But in 2005, he ran into trouble with the authorities by organizing a class-action lawsuit on behalf of thousands of women in Shandong Province who had been subjected to forced abortions and sterilizations. A year later, a local court sent him to prison for more than four years on charges that were widely seen as spurious.
Although technically a free man after his release in September 2010, Mr. Chen ran up against local officials who, with the backing of provincial authorities, turned his home into a makeshift prison, with hired guards and cellphone jamming equipment.
In a homemade video that was smuggled last year out of the village where he lived and posted on the Internet, Mr. Chen and his wife detailed the indignities of their detention. Local officials responded with a vicious round of beatings.
The cordon of security also kept out visitors, including journalists, diplomats and freelance Chinese activists, who were violently repelled when they tried to enter the village.
Nicholas Bequelin, a researcher based in Hong Kong for Human Rights Watch, offered tempered praise on Saturday for the Chinese government's handling of the episode but said he would reserve further judgment until the day Mr. Chen sought to return to China.
Jerome A. Cohen, a New York University law professor who helped arrange Mr. Chen's fellowship, said he thought Beijing would be eager to blunt the domestic impact of Mr. Chen's departure. ''The last thing they want,'' he said, ''is for this deal to symbolize a way out of China for dissidents.''

HEADLINE: Westward, Ho!

BYLINE: RICK BEARD


HIGHLIGHT: In the midst of war, Lincoln approved the Homestead Act, opening vast tracts of the country to settlement. 

 BODY:
May 1862 found the Union fighting ferociously on two fronts, but it still had time for nonmilitary matters. Indeed, that month the Senate approved, and President Lincoln signed, a bill that would help define the course of American expansion after the war ended: the Homestead Act, which gave away vast tracts of western land for practically nothing, to anyone willing to settle and cultivate it. 
The act's impact was immediately obvious: after the Senate passed the bill on May 6, Horace Greeley's New York Tribune called it "one of the most beneficent and vital reforms ever attempted," one "calculated to diminish sensibly the number of paupers and idlers and increase the proportion of working, independent, self-subsisting farmers in the land evermore." 
The legislation's straightforward provisions belied its long, politically tangled gestation. Beginning on Jan. 1, 1863, the new law invited any male who had never taken up arms against the United States and was over 21 years of age or the head of a family - as well as freed slaves and widows - to engage in a three-step process to secure 160 acres of public land. The potential landowner first had to apply for a claim and pay a $12 fee. Next he had to live on the land for five years and demonstrate proof of improvements like farming, clearing timber or building a house. Union soldiers who had served two years had to occupy the land for only one year before filing their claims. Only then could the homesteader, with a $6 fee, file for a deed of title.
The Homestead Act was one of many attempts by the central government to control its vast acreage; its earliest efforts predated adoption of the Constitution. The Land Ordinance of 1785 had created six-mile-square townships divided into 36 sections, each measuring one square mile, or 640 acres. Purchasers could initially buy no less than a full section for $1 per acre, though in 1800 the minimum purchase was halved, to 320 acres, and the cost fixed at $1.25 per acre, a price that remained in force until 1854. The minimum cost of $400 for 320 acres proved prohibitive for all but the wealthiest Americans and encouraged speculation at the expense of settlement.
The first federal action intended to galvanize the settlement of public lands came at the urging of western politicians. In 1841, President Tyler signed the Preemption Act, permitting squatters living on federally owned land to purchase up to 160 acres at a price not less than $1.25 an acre. Claimants had to live on the land for 14 months. The legislation assured that the states then considered the "west" - including Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Alabama, Mississippi, Missouri, Louisiana, Arkansas and Michigan - and any other state later received a 10 percent chunk of the proceeds, as well as 500,000 acres to sell. All proceeds were to support internal improvements.
The passage of the Preemption Act prefaced the emergence of a vocal reform movement embracing "homesteading" - the free distribution of public land - as a safety valve for an American political and economic order threatened by a growing poor population in Eastern cities. In 1844, George Henry Evans, a British immigrant devoted to workingmen's causes, formed the National Reform Association, rallying supporters with cries of "Land for the Landless" and "Vote Yourself a Farm." 
Horace Greeley quickly adopted Evans' cause, using the Tribune's pages to make his case. "Every thousand hardy, efficient workers who float West on Free Lands," Greeley editorialized, "would leave places open for as many others; and these taking a step upward, would leave room for advancement of as many more and so on." At the same time, he issued a cautionary warning for those who chose not to move westward. "Secure all, so far as possible, a chance to earn a living," he wrote, "then if they will run away from the Soil and shiver and starve in cities, why there is no help for them but such as Charity will afford."
Evans, Greeley and other advocates of homesteading soon found themselves enmeshed in anti-slavery politics. Many Northern opponents of slavery, initially wary that free land might depopulate the North and hurt manufacturing, came to see homesteading as a useful tool in the escalating battle with the Southern slave power. Because slavery typically required large plantations to be economically feasible, free farmers settling small plots of the western territories would provide a bulwark against calls for the institution's expansion into those lands. Many Southerners no doubt felt as one Mississippian did, who argued, "Better for us that these territories should remain a waste, a howling wilderness, trod only by red hunters than be so settled."
Although the Free Soil Party as well as several Northern Whigs supported homesteading, the emergence of the Republican Party in the early 1850s gave the movement true political momentum. The party found the answer to urban poverty in the westward migration of the poor, and embraced Greeley's contention that "The public lands are the great regulator of the relations of Labor and Capital, the safety valve of our industrial and social engine." The Democratic Party, on the other hand, proved ambivalent on the issue. Missouri Senator Thomas Hart Benton endorsed the idea as early as the 1820s, and by the 1850s, such progressive Democratic leaders as Andrew Johnson of Tennessee, Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois and Sam Houston of Texas had become homesteading advocates. But most Democrats, especially in the South, opposed homesteading, often vehemently.
Throughout the 1850s, efforts to push homesteading legislation through Congress, led by Johnson and Pennsylvania Representative Galusha Grow, were unrelenting - and unrelentingly defeated. In 1852, 1854 and 1859 the House passed homestead acts, all of which the Senate subsequently vanquished. The Panic of 1857, which impoverished tens of thousands, provided further impetus to the movement. Orville Browning, a Lincoln confidant, worried that "In many of the free states, population is already pressing hard upon production and subsistence, and new homes must be provided, or the evils of an overcrowded country encountered."
Republicans were quick to counter any notion that homesteading would somehow redistribute wealth. George Julian, the Free Soil candidate for vice president in 1852 and a Republican congressman throughout the Civil War, assured the nation that his party advocated "no leveling policy, designed to strip the rich of their possessions." And Richard Yates, who would serve as Illinois's wartime governor, was equally soothing: the measure "does not take your property and give it to me. It does not bring down the high, but it raises the low." Yet another party member assured doubters that the measure "will greatly increase the number of those who belong to ... the middle class."
Yet Southern critics remained recalcitrant. In 1857 the Virginian George Fitzhugh wrote that the social tensions resulting from population increases as the West was settled would force the North to resort to slavery as a means of controlling an insubordinate and menacing laboring class. The following year a writer for The Southern Literary Messenger predicted that population growth would strain the available means of subsistence and incite urban violence, religious fanaticism, and political demagoguery.
In 1860 the proponents of homesteading finally succeeded in steering the bill through both houses, only to have President Buchanan veto it. The reaction was immediate and visceral: one editorial writer for The Dubuque Herald wrote, "This act ... is one of the most infamous of his infamous administration. The Slave propagandists demanded that the Bill should be vetoed, and their pliant tool was swift to obey them. Let the pimps and hirelings of the old sinner defend this last act of his, if they dare."
The election of Abraham Lincoln, who favored "cutting up the wild lands into parcels so that every poor man may have a home," and the departure of Southern senators and representatives after the South's secession, forestalled a repeat of Buchanan's action. On Feb. 28, 1862, the House passed the Homestead Act by a vote of 107 to 16; the Senate approved the bill by a vote of 33 to 7 on May 6. On Jan. 1, 1863, Daniel Freeman of Nebraska and 417 others filed the first claims; by the end of the Civil War, homesteaders had made 26,500 claims. Over the life of the program, the government granted 1.6 million homesteads encompassing 270 million acres in 30 states, or 10 percent of all lands in the United States.
Still, the legacy of the Homestead Act, which remained in force until 1976 (a decade later in Alaska), is mixed. Its value as a safety valve was limited: unemployed workmen in Eastern cities seldom had the money to transport their families to the free public lands and to feed and shelter them until a crop could be made. Even if such a settler managed to establish himself on a western farm, he was not likely to succeed without skills that could be obtained only through long apprenticeship. Homesteaders were usually experienced farmers from nearby states. Except for European immigrants who were taken to the West by railway companies and other agencies with lands to sell, few settlers on the agricultural frontier came directly from eastern industrial centers. Moreover, only about 40 percent of the four million who started the homesteading process were able to complete it. 
The Homestead Act did not replace other systems of distributing federal lands - railroads received up to 94 million acres between 1862 and 1871, and states granted them an additional 38 million acres. The federal government also set aside 140 million acres for schools, universities and other public buildings, and an equal amount of land for Indian reservations. Aside from the homesteaders themselves, the act probably had its greatest impact on Native Americans, who fought a series of bloody, futile wars against the constant encroachment of white settlers in the post-bellum years.

HEADLINE: Foer Returns to New Republic as Editor

BYLINE: JULIE BOSMAN and CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY


HIGHLIGHT: Two months after obtaining a majority stake in the magazine, Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook, is bringing back Franklin Foer as part of an ambitious plan to remake the magazine. 

 BODY:
Two months after buying a majority stake in The New Republic, the technology entrepreneur Chris Hughes has lured one of its former stars, Franklin Foer, back to the magazine as its editor.
Mr. Foer, 37, left The New Republic two years ago after a successful five-year run as editor. He was widely credited with bringing life and energy to the magazine even in the face of chronic budget cuts. 
Mr. Foer replaces Richard Just, the current editor of the magazine who took over in 2010. 
Hiring back Mr. Foer is the first move in what Mr. Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook who is now the publisher and editor in chief of The New Republic, described as an ambitious plan for the 98-year-old journal, which has a prestigious history but much rebuilding to do. The most recent circulation figures show that the magazine has a circulation of 39,314 and only had 20 issues each year. 
The editorial staff, which currently stands at 15 people, will be doubled to 30, Mr. Hughes said in an interview Thursday. 
He is courting youngish, rising stars who have been writing for publications like The New Yorker and The New York Times Magazine. The magazine also plans to open an office in New York.
The print magazine and Web site will be redesigned and the page count of the print edition will be expanded, Mr. Hughes said. He added that when he was researching whether to buy the New Republic, he had to read through old editions on microfilm in the archives at the New York Public Library.
Mr. Hughes's goal is to guide The New Republic out of the category he called "little magazines" in Washington like The National Review and into a category that includes magazines he sees as more natural competitors, like The New Yorker, the Economist and New York Magazine.
"I want everyone from Michael Bloomberg to Zadie Smith to Sheryl Sandberg to read The New Republic," Mr. Hughes said. 
Mr. Hughes said he is determined to address one of the issues that has always dogged The New Republic: retention. While the magazine is known for attracting young talent, particularly fresh out of the Ivy Leagues, it has also been something of a farm team for high-profile magazines and newspapers. (Former top editors include Michael Kinsley, Andrew Sullivan and Hendrik Hertzberg.) Many journalists who work at The New Republic often move on to other publications once they begin to make a name for themselves, motivated by offers of more generous salaries and bigger platforms. 
Mr. Hughes added that he is less concerned about finding stars with social media skills than about finding and keeping talent with strong reporting and storytelling skills.
"There are some phenomenal journalists who have come through The New Republic," Mr. Hughes said. "Our challenge now is to make sure The New Republic isn't a place where they work for 10 years and then move on."
"Our goal is to recruit a lineup of all-stars," Mr. Hughes added. "We want to hire great people, and quality costs money." 
Bringing Mr. Foer back to the magazine is expected to ease the challenge of recruitment. 
Gregarious and well-connected, Mr. Foer is a lifelong Washingtonian who knows both the city and its political culture. He first joined The New Republic in 2000. 
As editor, he steered the magazine out of what was seen as a period of backlash against its neoconservative phase. Under Mr. Foer, The New Republic published a string of high-impact articles, including a profile by Ryan Lizza of Senator George Allen of Virginia that was seen as playing a major role in Mr. Allen's political downfall. 
In an interview last week, Mr. Foer said that until Mr. Hughes approached him two months ago, he had no plans to return to the magazine. Since leaving it in 2010, he has spent much of his time working on book projects in his basement. One book he edited, "Jewish Jocks," a collection of 50 essays on notable Jewish athletes, is slated for publication in November.
After two years away from The New Republic, Mr. Foer said he did not even miss it. 
"I had no thought of returning to edit the magazine," he said. "But to me, it feels like a new project. It doesn't feel like I'm going back to my old job." 
At Mr. Hughes's invitation, the two met this spring at the bar at the Jefferson Hotel in downtown Washington, several blocks north of the White House, where they talked about how the magazine could be re-imagined. 
Mr. Hughes said he is prepared for the remaking of the magazine to take years, a sign that he views it as a "long-term investment." Making a profit, he said, is not an immediate concern. Mr. Hughes left Facebook in 2007 with a fortune estimated by Forbes at $700 million. 
Leon Wieseltier, the literary editor of 29 years, called the changes to the magazine "a reversal of fortune." 
"The wind is at our backs now," Mr. Wieseltier said. "We're thinking expansively and we've resolved to grow, to add, to enlarge. This is not just about survival anymore, this is about growth."

HEADLINE: Obama on the High Wire

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: As he moves to his left, will the president lose his balance? 

 BODY:
Is the Democratic party the tribune of the underdog or the slave of special interests?
For much of his first three years in office, President Obama has struggled to maintain the loyalty of the liberal wing of his party. Suddenly, in 2012, he has put on a full court press.
The president's policy shift in favor of same-sex marriage, for example, has allowed him to win back the hearts, minds and wallets of the gay rights community, a crucial source of Democratic support.
On another front, no week goes by without one or more events designed to secure and deepen Obama's advantage among women. On May 14, he pointedly gave the graduation address at Barnard, the women's college affiliated with Columbia (his alma mater), informing graduates:
After decades of slow, steady, extraordinary progress, you are now poised to make this the century where women shape not only their own destiny but the destiny of this nation and of this world.
From Barnard in upper Manhattan, Obama traveled downtown to ABC and an appearance on "The View," to tell Barbara Walters, Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Sherri Shepherd and Elisabeth Hasselbeck, "I like hanging out with women."
In an effort to revive the strong margin of support he received from young voters in 2008, Obama has stressed his support for legislation keeping the student loan interest rate at 3.4 percent, instead of allowing the scheduled increase to 6.8 percent. Loan burdens, especially on recent graduates struggling to find work, are a major issue for voters under the age of 30 - voters Obama must mobilize this year.
On Capitol Hill, Democrats are also taking up similar themes. The Senate passed what would normally be routine legislation reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, but with added provisions to protect those in same-sex relationships from abuse - a pro-gay rights amendment anathema to House Republicans.
Individually, these and other steps taken by the administration and Democratic legislators to build support among diverse constituencies have varying degrees of popular support. In and of themselves, they would not create political problems.
The difficulty for the Democratic Party and its candidates arises when voters perceive that elected officials are granting special, non-universal privileges or preferences for political gain. With some regularity over the past four and a half decades, many voters - moderates and conservatives in particular - have demonstrated an aversion to contemporary liberal public policy that provides benefits and protections to groups defined by race, ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation.
The volatility of this issue can be seen in the current controversy in Massachusetts over the Democratic Senate candidate Elizabeth Warren's past description of herself as of indigenous American descent, which prompted opponents to accuse her of using that status to gain special consideration in hiring and promotion decisions.
"For years, Harvard has claimed special minority status for Professor Elizabeth Warren as a member of a Native American tribe and their first minority hire," declared Jim Barnett, who is managing Senator Scott Brown's re-election campaign.
That Warren allowed Harvard to hold her up as an example of their commitment to diversity in the hiring of historically disadvantaged communities is an insult to all Americans who have suffered real discrimination and mistreatment, and Warren should apologize for participating in this hypocritical sham.
Some evidence that Obama must walk a fine line as he seeks majority backing can be found in the May 15 CBS News/New York Times poll, which showed that 67 percent of respondents said Obama came out for same-sex marriage "mostly for political reasons," while just 24 percent said he made the decision "mostly because he thinks it is right."
These numbers do not mean that two thirds of the public oppose same-sex marriage; in fact, the public is fairly evenly split. What the numbers do reveal is that a majority of the electorate believes that political calculation, rather than moral principle, drove the president's decision.
In an equally troublesome finding for Obama, the Times poll recorded a dramatic drop in the level of support for Obama among women, with Romney actually pulling ahead, 46-44. Obama's support among female voters has fallen from 49 to 44 percent over the past two months, while Romney's rose three points.
Stephanie Cutter, deputy manager of the Obama campaign, has challenged the accuracy of the Times poll, arguing that the methodology - calling people who have been previously surveyed, known as a "panel back" - resulted in "a biased sample."
But even if the poll findings can be reasonably disputed, they still suggest that Obama's aggressive bid to strengthen his support among women may be backfiring. Separate polling by Marquette Law School in Wisconsin shows Obama holding a strong, but declining advantage among women voters. In February, Obama had a 21 percentage point lead among women, 56-35; by mid-May, his margin among women had fallen to 9 points, 49-40.
The roots of Democratic Party vulnerability on affirmative action and other forms of group-based "preferences" lie in the social, cultural and moral revolutions of the 1960s and 70s - revolutions that have been the source of contemporary liberalism's strengths and liabilities.
This is perhaps best illustrated in the following chart, created by two political scientists, Christopher Ellis of Bucknell and James Stimson of the University of North Carolina.
The chart tracks the percentage of the electorate that identifies itself as liberal. There is an abrupt and steep drop in self-identified liberals in the mid-1960s, which coincided with the emergence of the rights revolution - including civil rights, women's rights, and the right to sexual privacy - as well as the anti-war movement. The Democratic Party and liberalism were increasingly identified with these movements.
Ellis and Stimson write that from 1963 to 1967, "the ranks of self-identified liberals fell by 10.5 points - about one fourth - and never recovered." They argue that the shift resulted from "the new clientele of liberalism":
The New Deal had for clients the working people of America. In one phrase it was "the common man." Thus liberalism was conjoined with pictures of workers, often unionized, hard-working people, playing by the rules, and trying to get ahead.... With the coming of the Great Society there was a new clientele of liberalism, the poor - and the nonwhite. The focus of Lyndon Johnson's war on poverty was the underclass of people whose usual defining characteristic was that they did not work. And although there were - and are - more poor white people than black people, the image of poverty from the very beginning was black.
Successful Democratic presidential candidates - especially Bill Clinton and Obama - have been acutely aware of these liabilities.
Many of the strategies undergirding the campaigns of 1992, 1996 and 2008 were explicitly designed to mute or eliminate perceived liberal vulnerabilities. Clinton famously promised to "end welfare as we know it," to reward those "who work hard and play by the rules." He also went out of his way to demonstrate his support for the death penalty as Arkansas Governor by rejecting clemency for convicted killer Ricky Ray Rector, who was executed in Arkansas during the 1992 campaign despite serious brain damage resulting from a self-inflicted wound.
In 2008, Obama confounded liberal supporters when he praised a Supreme Court ruling overturning a Washington, D.C. ban on handguns, endorsed a proposed wiretap law and spoke favorably about applying the death penalty to those convicted of raping a child.
One of the interesting phenomena demonstrated in the Ellis-Stimson chart above is the ebb and flow of liberal self-identification after the drop in the mid-1960s. While never rising to previous levels, liberal self-identification increases during Republican administrations (Nixon-Ford-Reagan-Bush) and decreases when Democrats take over the presidency (Carter-Clinton). The sole exception is the increase in liberal self-identification in the latter years of the Clinton administration, likely a negative response to the Republican take-over of the House and Senate in 1995, the ascendance of House Speaker Newt Gingrich and the Republican attempt to impeach Clinton in 1998.
A second interesting political development in recent decades is that Democrats have paid a higher price for policies favoring their constituencies, especially the poor and minorities, than Republicans have paid for doing the same thing on behalf of the rich.
Both Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush won approval, soon after winning election, of tax policies decisively favoring the affluent, and both went on to win re-election.
The relative invulnerability of the Republican Party in recent years to backlash after pushing through regressive tax policies is even more surprising because a plurality of the public, 46 percent, believes the rich are rich as a result of their connections, not their hard work, according to Pew surveys. In other words, while voters are hostile to policies benefiting those seen as the "undeserving" poor, they are more tolerant of policies benefiting the undeserving rich:
Part of this difference is rooted in the power of race in American politics. Some of the most controversial policies supported by Democrats, including civil rights generally, affirmative action and busing, have alienated a portion of white voters, especially those in the South and in northern working-class communities.
At the same time, part of the tolerance of policies that favor the rich comes from the fact that voters place a much higher value on increasing opportunity than they do on decreasing inequality.
Gallup reported in December that 70 percent of survey respondents said it was "extremely" (29 percent) or "very" important to increase the equality of opportunity for people to get ahead," while 46 percent said it was "extremely" (17 percent) or "very" (29 percent) important to "reduce the income and wealth gap between the rich and the poor."
In the same survey, Gallup found that 52 percent described "the fact that some people in the United States are rich and others are poor" as acceptable, while 45 percent said it is "a problem that needs to be fixed." The percentage answering "acceptable" actually grew seven points, up from 45 percent in 1998, despite the efforts of the Obama administration and the Occupy Wall Street movement to make inequality a more salient issue.
Perhaps most fascinatingly, a majority of Americans, 58 percent, identify themselves as "haves" while 34 percent say they are "have nots," according to Gallup. A person identifying him or herself as a have is more likely to see a threat to their own assets in redistributive government policies.
As the 2012 election progresses, there is every sign that Republicans will seek to strengthen the perception of the Obama administration as dependent on constituencies that are often disadvantaged or that have been previously marginalized. They will gleefully label their advocates "special interests."
The conservative columnist Jay Cost wrote last week:
You, me, and almost everybody else in this country wants to talk about jobs, the deficit, national security, but the Democratic party simply does not listen to us. It is not responsive to what we want, but rather only to the special interests that now dominate it. Organized labor, the environmentalist left, the feminists, big city machine politicos, and all the rest - they hum the tune to which the party dances. If you are lucky enough to be in one of those groups, then the Democrats will be happy to hear what you have to say. If you aren't, then you'll be lucky if they don't hang up on you!
The campaign will require Obama to reinvigorate support among core constituencies - minorities, single women, the young, "knowledge workers" and "creatives"- without antagonizing moderates. It will not be easy.
There is one factor helping Obama to negotiate this political minefield on the path to Nov. 6: the taint of racial or anti-gay prejudice that clings to some Republican initiatives. It can all happen very quickly. The disclosure by the Times of a plan under consideration by a conservative super PAC to run tough, racially-freighted ads using the comments of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright to attack Obama, forced the super PAC to back away from the proposal.
Republicans and Democrats are aware that attack ads can prove highly counterproductive if voters see them as divisive and intolerant. Both parties and their candidates run the risk of putting a foot wrong and slipping off the tightrope.

PERSON: Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi 

HEADLINE: Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi, Lockerbie Bomber, Dies at 60

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi, the only person convicted in the 1988 bombing of an American jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, has died in Libya, family members told news agencies on Sunday, nearly three years after Scotland released him on humanitarian grounds, citing evidence that he was near death with metastatic prostate cancer. He was 60.
The death of Mr. Megrahi, who insisted that he was not guilty, foreclosed a fuller accounting of his role, and perhaps that of the Libyan government under Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, in the midair explosion of Pan Am Flight 103, which killed 270 people, including 189 Americans.
A former Libyan intelligence officer who worked undercover at Libya's national airline, Mr. Megrahi was found guilty in 2001 of orchestrating the bombing and was sentenced to life in prison, with a 27-year minimum. But after doctors said he was likely to die within three months, he was freed in 2009 under a Scottish law providing for compassionate release of prisoners with terminal illnesses. 
Cheering crowds greeted his return to Libya, escorted by Colonel Qaddafi's son Saif al-Islam in a grim propaganda coup. His release infuriated many families of the bombing victims, touched off angry protests in Britain and the United States and was condemned by President Obama and other Western leaders, including Britain's Conservative opposition after Gordon Brown, who was then the prime minister, waffled.
Critics charged that Mr. Megrahi's release had been a part of Libyan oil and gas deals with Britain. A British cabinet official said that he and the prime minister had discussed Mr. Megrahi with Colonel Qaddafi's son at a European economic conference, but denied there had been any deal for his release.
After being treated at Tripoli's most advanced cancer center, Mr. Megrahi lived with his family at a villa in Tripoli at the government's expense. As civil war engulfed Libya in 2011, Western calls for his return to prison increased, especially after Colonel Qaddafi was overthrown and later killed by revolutionary forces.
Tripoli's new leaders refused to return him. But, under international pressure, they signaled a willingness to get to the bottom of the Lockerbie case, still unresolved after nearly a quarter of a century of struggle among nations and investigations that spanned the globe, touching on Iranians, Syrians, Palestinians and Libyans.
Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said the United States would continue ''toward a full accounting of Qaddafi's horrific acts.''
''Megrahi's death concludes an unfortunate chapter following his release from prison in 2009 on medical grounds -- a move we strongly opposed,'' Mr. Vietor said. ''As we have long said, we want to see justice for the victims of the Lockerbie bombing and their families.''
The enigmatic Mr. Megrahi had been the central figure of the case for decades, reviled as a terrorist but defended by many Libyans, and even some world leaders, as a victim of injustice whose trial, 12 years after the bombing, had been riddled with political overtones, memory gaps and flawed evidence.
Abdel Basset Ali Mohmed al-Megrahi was born in Tripoli, Libya, on April 1, 1952. Little is known in the West about his early life. He had a good command of English, and he studied in Cardiff, Wales, for nine months in 1971, then made four or five trips each to the United States and Britain in the late 1970s.
Mr. Megrahi and his wife, Aisha, were married in 1982 and had four sons and a daughter.
His first cousin was Sa'id Rashid, a senior officer of Jamahiriya el-Mukhabarat, the Libyan intelligence service, and a member of Colonel Qaddafi's inner circle. Mr. Megrahi was also a senior intelligence officer and director of the Center for Strategic Studies in Tripoli.
American intelligence officials said he became chief of security for Libyan Arab Airlines as a cover for his secret work as a military procurer, enabling him to travel widely, often using aliases and false passports. As tensions between the United States and Libya mounted in the 1980s, prosecutors said, Mr. Megrahi was enlisted for an act of terrorism.
It was to be the worst in British history, and a devastating strike against America. On Dec. 21, 1988, Pan Am Flight 103, a Boeing 747 jet carrying 243 passengers and 16 crew members, took off from Heathrow Airport in Britain, bound for New York. Little more than a half-hour later, cruising at 31,000 feet over southern Scotland, the plane exploded. All 259 people aboard and 11 on the ground were killed.
The terrorists apparently intended the aircraft to fall into the sea. But because it took off late, victims and debris fell on the town of Lockerbie. Evidence that was recovered showed that the plane had been blown up by Semtex plastic and a Swiss timing device of a kind sold to the Libyan military. The bomb had been hidden in a Toshiba cassette player and placed in a brown Samsonite suitcase, with clothing that was traced to a merchant in Malta.
Investigators, while they had no direct proof, believed that the suitcase with the bomb had been fitted with routing tags for baggage handlers, put on a plane at Malta and flown to Frankfurt, where it was loaded onto a Boeing 727 feeder flight that connected to Flight 103 at London, then transferred to the doomed jetliner.
After a three-year investigation, Mr. Megrahi and Al-Amin Khalifa Fhimah, the Libyan airline station manager in Malta, were indicted on mass murder charges in 1991. Libya refused to extradite them, and the United Nations imposed eight years of sanctions that cost Libya $30 billion.
Mr. Megrahi lived under armed guard and worked as a teacher. Negotiations led by former President Nelson Mandela of South Africa produced a compromise in 1999: the suspects' surrender, and a trial by Scottish judges in the Netherlands.
The trial lasted 85 days. None of the witnesses connected the suspects directly to the bomb. But one, Tony Gauci, the Maltese shopkeeper who sold the clothing that forensic experts had linked to the bomb, identified Mr. Megrahi as the buyer, although Mr. Gauci seemed doubtful and had picked others in photo displays.
The bomb's timer was traced to a Zurich manufacturer, Mebo, whose owner, Edwin Bollier, testified that such devices had been sold to Libya. A fragment from the crash site was identified by a Mebo employee, Ulrich Lumpert.
Neither defendant testified. But a turncoat Libyan agent testified that plastic explosives had been stored in Mr. Fhimah's desk in Malta, that Mr. Megrahi had brought a brown suitcase, and that both men were at the Malta airport on the day the bomb was sent on its way.
On Jan. 31, 2001, the three-judge court found Mr. Megrahi guilty but acquitted Mr. Fhimah. The court called the case circumstantial, the evidence incomplete and some witnesses unreliable, but concluded that ''there is nothing in the evidence which leaves us with any reasonable doubt as to the guilt'' of Mr. Megrahi.
Much of the evidence was later challenged. It emerged that Mr. Gauci had repeatedly failed to identify Mr. Megrahi before the trial and had selected him only after seeing his photograph in a magazine and being shown the same photo in court. The date of the clothing sale was also in doubt.
Investigators said Mr. Bollier, whom even the court called ''untruthful and unreliable,'' had changed his story repeatedly after taking money from Libya, and might have gone to Tripoli just before the attack to fit a timer and bomb into the cassette recorder. The implication that he was a conspirator was never pursued.
In 2007, Mr. Lumpert admitted that he had lied at the trial, stolen a timer and given it to a Lockerbie investigator. Moreover, the fragment he identified was never tested for residue of explosives, although it was the only evidence of possible Libyan involvement.
The court's inference that the bomb had been transferred from the Frankfurt feeder flight was also cast into doubt when a Heathrow security guard revealed that Pan Am's baggage area had been broken into 17 hours before the bombing, a circumstance never explored.
Hans Kochler, a United Nations observer, called the trial ''a spectacular miscarriage of justice,'' words echoed by Mr. Mandela. Many legal experts and investigative journalists challenged the evidence, calling Mr. Megrahi a scapegoat for a Libyan government long identified with terrorism. While denying involvement, Libya paid $2.7 billion to the victims' families in 2003 in a bid to end years of diplomatic isolation.
Mr. Megrahi began serving his sentence at Barlinnie Prison near Glasgow, where toilets were buckets in cells. He was moved in 2005 to the smaller, more humane Greenock Prison in Inverclyde, Scotland.
His first appeal was rejected in 2002. He dropped a second one to clear his repatriation to Libya. Doctors diagnosed his advanced cancer in 2008. Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill of Scotland released Mr. Megrahi on Aug. 20, 2009, and he flew home to a welcome that coincided with the 40th anniversary celebrations of the Qaddafi revolution.
He outlived the colonel by seven months.

HEADLINE: Trouble in Rhode Island For Boston Baseball Hero Trying Out a New Game

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH; Jess Bidgood and Jen McCaffery contributed reporting.

 BODY:
PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- Curt Schilling is a hero to Boston Red Sox fans who remember him pitching valiantly against the Yankees in the 2004 American League Championship Series with an injured ankle and a bloody sock. But a strange chain of events last week left some Rhode Islanders feeling differently.
Mr. Schilling, now retired from baseball, started a video game company that he moved here from Massachusetts after securing a controversial $75 million loan guarantee in 2010 from the economically stressed state. Early last week, Gov. Lincoln Chafee let it be known that Mr. Schilling's company, 38 Studios, had failed to make a required $1.1 million payment to the Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation. The state, he said, was scrambling to help 38 Studios stay solvent. 
From there, things got stranger. The economic development agency held an emergency meeting on Wednesday with Mr. Schilling and other representatives of the company who asked for more help. The head of the agency resigned later that day; he paraphrased William Faulkner in an interview with The Associated Press, saying that ''all of us fail to match our dreams of perfection.''
On Thursday, representatives from 38 Studios delivered a check for the overdue $1.1 million to the economic development agency, but acknowledged it would bounce. They also told state officials that the company had not been able to make its payroll that week.
''It's been disturbing and kind of discombobulating,'' said Scott Wolf, executive director of Grow Smart Rhode Island, a nonprofit group focused on the state's economy.
Former Gov. Donald L. Carcieri, a conservative Republican, orchestrated the deal between the state and Mr. Schilling's start-up company, which promised to bring 450 jobs to Providence in exchange for the $75 million loan guarantee. Mr. Carcieri and Mr. Schilling, a fellow conservative who has campaigned for Republican candidates, first met at a fund-raising event at the Schilling home in Medfield, Mass., in 2010.
The company released its first video game, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning, in February to good reviews, and it has received and spent about $50 million of the loan, state officials said last week. If 38 Studios defaults, Rhode Island and its taxpayers will most likely have to repay the entire amount to private bondholders.
Friday brought a ray of hope -- 38 Studios finally made the payment, Mr. Chafee said during an hourlong news conference at the State House. The governor, a former Republican who is now an independent, opposed the state's deal with Mr. Schilling when he was running for office in 2010. He said last week that the company had qualified for $2 million in tax credits and was seeking $6.5 million more.
''My goal is to protect the taxpayers right now,'' Mr. Chafee said, adding that he wanted to do ''everything possible to make sure'' the company did not fail.
''It's a balance of making sure 38 Studios is successful so we can recoup our huge investment,'' he said, ''and also not getting further exposed if the company is ultimately not going to make it.''
For many in Rhode Island, which has the nation's second-highest unemployment rate at 11.2 percent, one city -- Central Falls -- in bankruptcy, and others struggling to stay solvent, the news was as painful as it was galling.
''Both economically and psychologically, it's not what we need,'' Mr. Wolf said. ''In retrospect, we were probably putting too many eggs in one basket.''
Mr. Schilling did not comment publicly on the matter last week except for several posts on Facebook, including one in which he said, ''We will find a way, and the strength, to endure.''
He also wrote that it was not true that he had repaid himself for his own investment in the company -- $30 million, according to news media reports -- with state funds.
A spokesman for 38 Studios -- named for Mr. Schilling's jersey number -- did not respond to an e-mail request for comment.
While Massachusetts, which refused to match Rhode Island's offer to Mr. Schilling in 2010, had reason to feel smug last week, people here in Providence felt a familiar sense of gloom.
Some said it was the latest misstep for a state that has struggled to create high-paying jobs and keep spending in check. ''The saddest part of all this is what could have been done to help homegrown Rhode Island businesses with state-backed loans,'' Scott MacKay, a political analyst for Rhode Island Public Radio, wrote in a blog post on Friday.
Barry Gilbert, vice president of Strategy Analytics, a consulting firm in Newton, Mass., that advised Rhode Island on the deal with 38 Studios in 2010, said that start-ups in the video game industry were a big gamble.
''The execution has to be flawless, the timing has to be flawless,'' he said. ''There are so many moving parts to this, and it's not atypical to see a company burn through cash more quickly than they anticipate.''
The Rhode Island economic development agency is scheduled to discuss the matter again in a meeting on Monday.
Mr. Chafee said Friday that the company should court private investors instead of seeking more public financing. Asked if the state would ever offer such a deal to a company again, he said: ''Never, never. Not on my watch.''

HEADLINE: Conductor Says Goodbye With Hugs and Chopin

BYLINE: By ANTHONY TOMMASINI

 BODY:
The Philadelphia Orchestra is going all out to acknowledge the contribution of Charles Dutoit as he concludes his fourth and final season as chief conductor. The orchestra owes him, big time. The musicians played splendidly for Mr. Dutoit on Friday night at Carnegie Hall, his last appearance in New York as their artistic leader.
Mr. Dutoit stepped into a delicate situation four years ago in Philadelphia. For reasons that are hard to pin down, Christoph Eschenbach's tenure as music director, which began in 2003, did not work out. He and the orchestra parted ways after just five seasons. While the search began for another music director, Mr. Dutoit accepted the newly created position of chief conductor, also serving as artistic adviser. 
Though he has a well-known authoritarian streak, Mr. Dutoit has had a long and productive history with the Philadelphia Orchestra, including 20 summers as artistic director of its performances at a festival in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. As the chief conductor he provided crucial artistic stability during a financial crisis that led the storied Philadelphia Orchestra to file for Chapter 11 reorganization last year. The future is looking better now, and the dynamic young Canadian conductor Yannick Nezet-Seguin, who won many fans at the Metropolitan Opera last fall for his glowing, urgent conducting of Gounod's ''Faust,'' officially becomes the orchestra's music director this fall.
Meanwhile there have been Dutoit celebrations in Philadelphia and a video tribute on YouTube. For the Friday concert at Carnegie Hall Mr. Dutoit chose a program that, though traditional, played to his strengths: Glinka's Overture to ''Ruslan and Ludmila''; Chopin's Piano Concerto No. 2, with the Portuguese pianist Maria Joao Pires; and a Dutoit specialty, Ravel's complete ballet music for ''Daphnis et Chloe.''
Mr. Dutoit, who at 75 is still wiry, kinetic and commanding, began with a brisk, emphatic account of the exuberant Glinka overture. Maurizio Pollini had been scheduled to perform the Chopin but withdrew from this and other engagements because of illness. Mr. Dutoit turned to Ms. Pires, a longtime colleague and friend.
Ms. Pires, 67, an admired Chopin interpreter with a significant discography, is not a well-known name and has not performed extensively in the United States. Short and slender with delicate hands, she is the opposite of a flashy virtuoso. Her pianism is distinguished by acute musical sensitivity, lyrical grace and pearly sound.
In the first movement of the Chopin Ms. Pires played the melancholic main theme with tenderness and singing tone. As the ruminative melodic lines unfolded, she brought lovely shape and nuanced colorings to the bursts of passagework and ornamentation. If she was a little cautious during overtly virtuosic passages in which the piano erupted with cascading chords, she played with soft-spoken integrity and made inner voices wonderfully clear. She excelled in the dreamy slow movement and brought the lilt of a wistful mazurka to the finale. At the end Mr. Dutoit engulfed her in his arms as the audience stood and cheered.
Mr. Dutoit led a plush, shimmering performance of Ravel's 50-minute ''Daphnis et Chloe,'' scored for a large orchestra and a chorus that juices the erotic moments by singing collective ''ahs,'' here performed effectively by the Philadelphia Singers Chorale (David Hayes, music director). This pathbreaking score, introduced in Paris in 1912, vividly depicts the images in Fokine's narrative, about the love between Daphnis, a goatherd, and Chloe, a shepherdess, who join other young people in a sacred grotto to honor the nymphs and the god Pan. Later Pan actually appears and rescues Chloe when she is seized by a band of leering pirates.
Mr. Dutoit captured the awe, brutality and voluptuousness of the music in a cinematic yet cool and transparent performance. During the long ovation, there was a lovefest onstage, with Mr. Dutoit singling out players for bows and hugging everyone within reach.

HEADLINE: An Editor Is Returning To The New Republic

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN and CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
Two months after buying a majority stake in The New Republic, the technology entrepreneur Chris Hughes has lured one of its former stars, Franklin Foer, back to the magazine as its editor.
Mr. Foer, 37, left The New Republic two years ago after a successful five-year run as editor. He was widely credited with bringing life and energy to the magazine even in the face of chronic budget cuts.
Mr. Foer replaces Richard Just, the current editor of the magazine who took over in 2010. 
Hiring back Mr. Foer is the first move in what Mr. Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook who is now the publisher and editor in chief of The New Republic, described as an ambitious plan for the 98-year-old journal, which has a prestigious history but much rebuilding to do. The most recent circulation figures show that the magazine has a circulation of 39,314 and only had 20 issues each year.
The editorial staff, which currently stands at 15 people, will be doubled to 30, Mr. Hughes said in an interview Thursday.
He is courting youngish, rising stars who have been writing for publications like The New Yorker and The New York Times Magazine. The magazine also plans to open an office in New York.
The print magazine and Web site will be redesigned and the page count of the print edition will be expanded, Mr. Hughes said. He added that when he was researching whether to buy the New Republic, he had to read through old editions on microfilm in the archives at the New York Public Library.
Mr. Hughes's goal is to guide The New Republic out of the category he called ''little magazines'' in Washington like The National Review and into a category that includes magazines he sees as more natural competitors, like The New Yorker, the Economist and New York Magazine.
''I want everyone from Michael Bloomberg to Zadie Smith to Sheryl Sandberg to read The New Republic,'' Mr. Hughes said.
Mr. Hughes said he is determined to address one of the issues that has always dogged The New Republic: retention. While the magazine is known for attracting young talent, particularly fresh out of the Ivy Leagues, it has also been something of a farm team for high-profile magazines and newspapers. (Former top editors include Michael Kinsley, Andrew Sullivan and Hendrik Hertzberg.) Many journalists who work at The New Republic often move on to other publications once they begin to make a name for themselves, motivated by offers of more generous salaries and bigger platforms.
Mr. Hughes added that he is less concerned about finding stars with social media skills than about finding and keeping talent with strong reporting and storytelling skills.
''There are some phenomenal journalists who have come through The New Republic,'' Mr. Hughes said. ''Our challenge now is to make sure The New Republic isn't a place where they work for 10 years and then move on.''
''Our goal is to recruit a lineup of all-stars,'' Mr. Hughes added. ''We want to hire great people, and quality costs money.''
Bringing Mr. Foer back to the magazine is expected to ease the challenge of recruitment.
Gregarious and well-connected, Mr. Foer is a lifelong Washingtonian who knows both the city and its political culture. He first joined The New Republic in 2000.
As editor, he steered the magazine out of what was seen as a period of backlash against its neoconservative phase. Under Mr. Foer, The New Republic published a string of high-impact articles, including a profile by Ryan Lizza of Senator George Allen of Virginia that was seen as playing a major role in Mr. Allen's political downfall.
In an interview last week, Mr. Foer said that until Mr. Hughes approached him two months ago, he had no plans to return to the magazine. Since leaving it in 2010, he has spent much of his time working on book projects in his basement. One book he edited, ''Jewish Jocks,'' a collection of 50 essays on notable Jewish athletes, is slated for publication in November.
After two years away from The New Republic, Mr. Foer said he did not even miss it.
''I had no thought of returning to edit the magazine,'' he said. ''But to me, it feels like a new project. It doesn't feel like I'm going back to my old job.''
At Mr. Hughes's invitation, the two met this spring at the bar at the Jefferson Hotel in downtown Washington, several blocks north of the White House, where they talked about how the magazine could be re-imagined.
Mr. Hughes said he is prepared for the remaking of the magazine to take years, a sign that he views it as a ''long-term investment.'' Making a profit, he said, is not an immediate concern. Mr. Hughes left Facebook in 2007 with a fortune estimated by Forbes at $700 million.
Leon Wieseltier, the literary editor of 29 years, called the changes to the magazine ''a reversal of fortune.''
''The wind is at our backs now,'' Mr. Wieseltier said. ''We're thinking expansively and we've resolved to grow, to add, to enlarge. This is not just about survival anymore, this is about growth.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: When Pain From the Past Is a Script for the Present

BYLINE: By BRIAN SEIBERT

 BODY:
The ''Two Alike'' in the show of that title that opened at the Kitchen on Thursday are presumably the choreographer Jack Ferver and the visual artist Marc Swanson. Mr. Ferver has the stage to himself for all of this 40-minute production. Mr. Swanson designed the remarkable set, a construction of mirrors and thin wooden pillars that stands in for multiple places but most of all for a dance studio, a home for Mr. Ferver's imaginings. 
One way the two men are alike is that they both grew up gay in rural America. They are two of the ''boys and girls'' whom Mr. Ferver talks about, the ones who escape to New York or San Francisco. But ''Two Alike'' is less concerned with such physical escapes than with the internal kind, by way of fantasy.
The fantasies may come from the outside. When Mr. Ferver was a child, he says, his favorite movie was ''Return to Oz,'' the 1985 sequel in which Dorothy can't forget her journey over the rainbow. He narrates a scene from the film, an escape scene. Then he acts it out. This is great camp fun -- the first time. But each time he repeats the scene it gets fewer laughs.
Most everything in ''Two Alike'' gets repeated, and the effect is usually to expose compulsion. During one of the dancier sections, a sequence of misshapen ballet steps and clawed hands, Mr. Ferver's face scrunches up tighter with each iteration, the obsession showing through the exhaustion. ''Two Alike'' is also about what cannot be escaped.
The work is strongest, however, when the repetition reveals a new angle, a new significance. Near the beginning Mr. Ferver is on his hands and knees, taking heaving breaths. When the gesture is repeated at the end of the ''Return to Oz'' sequences, it means one thing, and when it returns as an image of the dangers involved in adult gay life, it means something else. As Mr. Ferver says, one action can trigger the memory of another.
The production is admirable in its economy. Just as the dance studio serves as a forest, a blanket serves as a cloak. The lighting (by Mr. Ferver, Mr. Swanson, and Joshua Lubin-Levy) aids the magic, as do details in Mr. Swanson's design like the hanging mirrored strips that Mr. Ferver sets swinging.
Considering the traumatic memories at its core -- Mr. Ferver is crawling underneath the cloak when he voices a revenge fantasy against those who hurl slurs at him and threaten to kill him -- the production is also admirable in its restraint. Yet at the climax Mr. Ferver's text spells out its intentions too obviously, and the confessional tone becomes importuning.
The ending recovers grace, and art. Mr. Ferver removes planks from a kind of dressing-room divider to reveal a sparkly surface like a starry sky or asphalt. He returns to a scene of himself getting injured while running away. He looks up at the sky and imagines it as -- of course -- a mirror, saying, ''Everywhere you turn, there you are.'' You can't run away from yourself.

HEADLINE: More Earn at Extremes In New York Than in U.S.

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
The wealthiest 1 percent of New York City residents took in nearly one-third of the personal income in the city in 2009 -- almost double the comparable proportion nationwide, a new study shows.
In a report scheduled to be released on Monday, the city comptroller's office found that large percentages of New Yorkers earned high incomes and low incomes, leaving a smaller middle class than in the nation as a whole.
''There is some evidence of the kind of common worry that New York has a weak middle,'' said Frank Braconi, chief economist in the comptroller's office. 
The report analyzed tax filings by city residents for income earned from 2000 through 2009, the most recent data available, and compared them with the national numbers. All of the numbers were adjusted for inflation.
The most striking difference between New York and the rest of the United States, the report showed, was the concentration of earning power at the high end.
In 2009, nearly 15,000 filers reported adjusted gross income of $1 million or more. They accounted for less than half of 1 percent of the total number of filers, but they took in 26.7 percent of the income in the city. Nationally, people who earned at least $1 million in 2009 collected less than 10 percent of all the income.
Income was much more volatile for the wealthy than for other New Yorkers, the study found.
The average income for the bottom 99 percent of city residents rose from about $42,000 in 2000 to a high of about $50,000 in 2007, then fell back to about $47,000 in 2009.
During the same period, the threshold to make it into the top 1 percent rose sharply, then fell precipitously after the financial crisis hit.
In 2000, to qualify as part of the city's top 1 percent, a filer needed adjusted gross income of slightly less than $460,000. By 2007, after the mid-decade boom, the cutoff had risen to $660,000. But by 2009, it had dropped back to about $492,000.
The top 1 percent in the city received about 32.5 percent of all income in 2009, compared with under 17 percent of all income for the top 1 percent of earners nationwide.
The threshold to reach the top 1 percent in the city may have risen back above $500,000 since 2009, but the tax data for 2010 will not be available until later this year. ''I'm curious to see what happened in 2010, when incomes apparently rebounded,'' Mr. Braconi said.
The comptroller's report also revealed that New York had a smaller bulge in its middle than the rest of the country. Nationally, about 31 percent of filers earned $50,000 to $200,000, and they took in 52 percent of all the personal income in the country. In New York, just 28 percent of filers fell into that income bracket, and they collected only 36 percent of all the personal income in the city.
''New York City's economy would be healthier and more dynamic if the benefits of growth were more fairly distributed,'' said the comptroller, John C. Liu. ''We need to promote a shared prosperity through policies that narrow the income gap, like strengthening investments in education and implementing a more progressive income-tax structure.''
Mr. Liu, a Democrat who hopes to run for mayor, has proposed cutting taxes for New Yorkers earning less than $500,000 a year and raising taxes for those earning more than that amount.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has repeatedly stated his opposition to raising taxes only for the wealthiest filers, and has advocated allowing the broad, temporary tax cuts enacted when George W. Bush was president to expire.
Republicans have also made use of city income-tax data to support their arguments. Late last year, Councilman James S. Oddo, a Republican from Staten Island, asked the city's Independent Budget Office to analyze the 2009 filing data. The budget office found that the top 1 percent of filers received over one-third of all personal income and had an average income of almost $2.25 million.
Mr. Oddo's reaction, though, was different from Mr. Liu's. He focused on the top 10 percent of earners, a group for which the income threshold was about $105,400, and said it could include veteran police officers, nurses and school principals.
''I don't think anybody would consider those folks rich,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Nationalist Wins Serbian Presidency, Clouding Ties to the West

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY

 BODY:
PARIS -- Tomislav Nikolic, a nationalist and former cemetery supervisor, was elected president of Serbia on Sunday, in a surprise victory that cast doubt on whether the country would remain on its path toward the European Union or look increasingly eastward toward Russia.
His opponent, Boris Tadic, an ardent champion of Serbia's effort to join the European Union, conceded defeat late Sunday. Mr. Tadic, who was president until he resigned last month to hasten an early election, had sought to portray a potential Nikolic presidency as a dangerous return to the past. 
With 40.67 percent of the vote counted, the official electoral commission said Mr. Nikolic, an outspoken admirer of Russia who was once a close ally of the former Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic, won 50.21 percent of the vote compared with 46.77 percent for Mr. Tadic of the Democratic Party. Mr. Tadic, a telegenic former psychology professor, ran on a campaign advocating for Serbia's European Union membership.
Declaring victory, Mr. Nikolic, 60, said he remained committed to Serbia's European Union aspirations. ''Serbia will not walk away from its path to the E.U.,'' he said, promising to restore Serbia's economic fortunes while fighting corruption. ''These elections were not whether about Serbia will go to E.U., they were about solving problems that the Democratic Party has created in Serbia,'' he added.
Analysts said Mr. Nikolic, a sometimes fiery populist, struck a chord with a growing underclass buffeted by the financial crisis at a time when the crisis-ridden European Union has lost its luster. As was the case with incumbents in Greece and France, they said Mr. Tadic had suffered a backlash from disillusioned voters hit by hard times.
Mr. Nikolic, a former ultranationalist, has in recent years professed a commitment to Serbia joining the European Union and has called for close relations with the United States. But analysts questioned whether a man who once said he would rather see Serbia become a province of Russia than a member of the European bloc would continue to push Serbia toward a pro-European path. Mr. Nikolic was in government with Mr. Milosevic when NATO bombed Serbia in 1999 during the war in Kosovo.
In 2008, Mr. Nikolic, nicknamed ''The Undertaker,'' left the far-right Radical Party, whose combative leader, Vojislav Seselj, is on trial for war crimes in The Hague. In the past, Mr. Nikolic has presided over rallies feting war criminals, including Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb general whose trial for war crimes in The Hague began last week. But in recent years he has rebranded himself as a populist pro-European champion of the downtrodden.
Mr. Nikolic is a political survivor who has overcome hardship in his life, including seeing his brother and mother electrocuted in an accident when his brother's kite got caught in an electric cable and his mother tried to save him.
Ivan Milosevic, a leading political consultant in Belgrade, said that pro-European liberals need not fear a Nikolic victory. ''He used to be a right-wing nationalist, but I don't expect him to return to his radical days,'' he said.
But others said that Mr. Nikolic's transformation was merely cosmetic.
His victory could also presage a more hardened stance toward regional reconciliation, in particular with Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008. While Mr. Tadic was adamantly against recognizing Kosovo's independence, he had offered some concessions over Kosovo to help further Serbia's European Union prospects, Mr. Nikolic has said that Serbia will not join if recognizing Kosovo is made a precondition.
The defining issue of the election was the country's flagging economy, which Mr. Nikolic promised to strengthen by imposing higher taxes on the rich to help pay for social benefits.
In a television debate last week, Mr. Nikolic indicated that he wanted Serbia to have one foot in the East and one foot in the West. ''I support a two-door policy,'' he said, implying that Mr. Tadic was only interested in cultivating closer ties with Washington and Brussels.
Tensions between the candidates intensified after the first-round of voting on May 6, when Mr. Nikolic accused Mr. Tadic of fraud and rigging the election, saying that his party had printed extra ballots. But election authorities and the state prosecutor dismissed the accusations. Mr. Tadic had narrowly beaten Mr. Nikolic in two previous presidential elections.
After parliamentary elections on May 6, Mr. Tadic's Democrats indicated that they would form a coalition government with the third-place Socialist Party, sidelining Mr. Nikolic's Progressive Party, which won the most votes. Some analysts warned that Mr. Nikolic's victory could lead to political paralysis with the Parliament and presidency led by two opposing blocs. But others said that such cohabitation could prove a healthy balance of power and an alternative to the authoritarianism of the Tadic years.
The election comes at a critical moment for Serbia, which gained European Union candidacy status in March. To help speed its entry to the bloc, Mr. Tadic overcame tough obstacles, including arresting Mr. Mladic and compromising over Kosovo.
But for all of his achievements on the international stage, Mr. Tadic presided over economic stagnation at home. Serbia, a country of 7.3 million people, is struggling with the effects of 24 percent unemployment, a weak currency and an average monthly wage of around $500. Mr. Nikolic, despite his promises to expand social protections, will need to introduce tough austerity measures to tame the country's soaring deficit and to persuade the International Monetary Fund to renew a $1.3 billion precautionary loan that it suspended in February, saying that the country was not meeting its fiscal targets.
Mr. Tadic was accused of corruption and authoritarianism, and Mr. Nikolic faces a struggle to restore faith in the government. And if he follows through on his pledge to move toward Europe, he will find a recalcitrant European Union, which is dealing with economic crisis and reluctant to take on new members.
Mr. Nikolic's friends say his favorite pastimes are listening to the Rolling Stones and making homemade Serbian brandy.

HEADLINE: More Men Enter Fields Dominated by Women

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN and ROBERT GEBELOFF

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- Wearing brick-red scrubs and chatting in Spanish, Miguel Alquicira settled a tiny girl into an adult-size dental chair and soothed her through a set of X-rays. Then he ushered the dentist, a woman, into the room and stayed on to serve as interpreter.
A male dental assistant, Mr. Alquicira is in the minority. But he is also part of a distinctive, if little noticed, shift in workplace gender patterns. Over the last decade, men have begun flocking to fields long the province of women.
Mr. Alquicira, 21, graduated from high school in a desolate job market, one in which the traditional opportunities, like construction and manufacturing, for young men without a college degree had dried up. After career counselors told him that medical fields were growing, he borrowed money for an eight-month training course. Since then, he has had no trouble finding jobs that pay $12 or $13 an hour. 
He gave little thought to the fact that more than 90 percent of dental assistants and hygienists are women. But then, young men like Mr. Alquicira have come of age in a world of inverted expectations, where women far outpace men in earning degrees and tend to hold jobs that have turned out to be, by and large, more stable, more difficult to outsource, and more likely to grow.
''The way I look at it,'' Mr. Alquicira explained, without a hint of awareness that he was turning the tables on a time-honored feminist creed, ''is that anything, basically, that a woman can do, a guy can do.''
After years of economic pain, Americans remain an optimistic lot, though they define the American dream not in terms of mansions and luxury cars but as something more basic -- a home, a college degree, financial security and enough left over for a few extras like dining out, according to a study by the Pew Center on the States' Economic Mobility Project. That financial security usually requires a steady full-time job with benefits, something that has become harder to find, particularly for men and for those without a college degree. While women continue to make inroads into prestigious, high-wage professions dominated by men, more men are reaching for the dream in female-dominated occupations that their fathers might never have considered.
The trend began well before the crash, and appears to be driven by a variety of factors, including financial concerns, quality-of-life issues and a gradual erosion of gender stereotypes. An analysis of census data by The New York Times shows that from 2000 to 2010, occupations that are more than 70 percent female accounted for almost a third of all job growth for men, double the share of the previous decade.
That does not mean that men are displacing women -- those same occupations accounted for almost two-thirds of women's job growth. But in Texas, for example, the number of men who are registered nurses nearly doubled in that time period, rising to 22,532 from 12,709, and increasing the percentage of male nurses to 10.5 percent, from 8.4 percent. Men make up 23 percent of Texas public schoolteachers, but almost 28 percent of first-year teachers.
The shift includes low-wage jobs as well. Nationally, two-thirds more men were bank tellers, almost twice as many were receptionists and two-thirds more were waiting tables in 2010 than a decade earlier.
Even more striking is the type of men who are making the shift. From 1970 to 1990, according to a study by Mary Gatta, the senior scholar at Wider Opportunities for Women, and Patricia A. Roos, a sociologist at Rutgers, men who took so-called pink-collar jobs tended to be foreign-born non-English speakers with low education levels -- men who, in other words, had few choices.
Now, though, the trend has spread among men of nearly all races and ages, more than a third of whom have a college degree. In fact, the shift is most pronounced among young, white, college-educated men like Charles Reed, a sixth-grade math teacher at Patrick Henry Middle School in Houston.
Mr. Reed, 25, intended to go to law school after a two-year stint with Teach for America, but he fell in love with the job. Though he says the recession had little to do with his career choice, he believes the tough times that have limited the prospects for new law school graduates have also helped make his father, a lawyer, more accepting.
Still, Mr. Reed said of his father, ''In his mind, I'm just biding time until I decide to jump into a better profession.''
To the extent that the shift to ''women's work'' has been accelerated by recession, the change may reverse when the economy recovers. ''Are boys today saying, 'I want to grow up and be a nurse?' '' asked Heather Boushey, senior economist at the Center for American Progress. ''Or are they saying, 'I want a job that's stable and recession proof?' ''
In interviews, however, about two dozen men played down the economic considerations, saying that the stigma associated with choosing such jobs had faded, and that the jobs were appealing not just because they offered stable employment, but because they were more satisfying.
''I.T. is just killing viruses and clearing paper jams all day,'' said Scott Kearney, 43, who tried information technology and other fields before becoming a nurse in the pediatric intensive care unit at Children's Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston.
Daniel Wilden, a 26-year-old Army veteran and nursing student at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, said he had gained respect for nursing when he saw a female medic use a Leatherman tool to save the life of his comrade. ''She was a beast,'' he said admiringly.
More than a few men said their new jobs had turned out to be far harder than they imagined.
But these men can expect success. Men earn more than women even in female-dominated jobs. And white men in particular who enter those fields easily move up to supervisory positions, a phenomenon known as the glass escalator -- as opposed to the glass ceiling that women encounter in male-dominated professions, said Adia Harvey Wingfield, a sociologist at Georgia State University. More men in an occupation can also raise wages for everyone, though as yet men's share of these jobs has not grown enough to have an overall effect on pay.
''Simply because higher-educated men are entering these jobs does not mean that it will result in equality in our workplaces,'' said Ms. Gatta of Wider Opportunities for Women.
Still, economists have long tried to figure out how to encourage more integration in the work force. Now, it seems to be happening of its own accord.
''I hated my job every single day of my life,'' said John Cook, 55, who got a modest inheritance that allowed him to leave the company where he earned $150,000 a year as a database consultant and enter nursing school.
His starting salary will be about a third what he once earned, but database consulting does not typically earn hugs like the one Mr. Cook recently received from a girl after he took care of her premature baby sister. ''It's like, people get paid for doing this kind of stuff?'' Mr. Cook said, choking up as he recounted the episode.
Several men cited the same reasons for seeking out pink-collar work that have drawn women to such careers: less stress and more time at home. At John G. Osborne Elementary, Adrian Ortiz, 42, joked that he was one of the few Mexicans who made more in his native country, where he was a hard-working lawyer, than he did in the United States as a kindergarten teacher in a bilingual classroom. ''Now,'' he said, ''my priorities are family, 100 percent.''
Betsey Stevenson, a labor economist at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, said she was not surprised that changing gender roles at home, where studies show men are shouldering more of the domestic burden and spending more time parenting, are now showing up in career choices.
''We tend to study these patterns of what's going on in the family and what's going on in the workplace as separate, but they're very much intertwined,'' she said. ''So as attitudes in the family change, attitudes toward the workplace have changed.''
In a classroom at Houston Community College, Dexter Rodriguez, 35, said his job in tech support had not been threatened by the tough economy. Nonetheless, he said, his family downsized the house, traded the new cars for used ones and began to live off savings, all so Mr. Rodriguez could train for a career he regarded as more exciting.
''I put myself into the recession,'' he said, ''because I wanted to go to nursing school.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Monday about men who enter job fields dominated by women misstated the increase in male registered nurses between 2000 and 2010. While the actual number of male nurses almost doubled, as the article noted, the percentage itself rose to 10.5 percent from 8.4 percent, not to ''almost 12 percent from just over 9 percent.''

HEADLINE: Agency Aims to Curb Rules by Lame-Duck Presidents

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- It is a political tradition that is almost as old as the White House: a president on the way out, unconstrained by electoral considerations, fast-tracks a flurry of contentious regulations in the waning hours of his term, sometimes even cutting short review from industry or the public.
As he was leaving, President George W. Bush expanded Justice Department surveillance powers, relaxed rules on certain types of coal mining and altered protections for endangered animals. President Bill Clinton pushed through new rules on chemicals in drinking water and on workplace injuries caused by repetitive movements.
Prompted by the fury touched off by such lame-duck orders, an independent federal agency that aims to streamline the administrative procedures of federal agencies is nearing the end of its review of recommendations aimed at curbing this practice known around Washington as midnight rule making. 
The recommendations from the agency, the Administrative Conference of the United States, are fairly tepid.
Even if they are finalized in June, as expected, they would allow President Obama to do more or less what his predecessors did, though with a greater ability for Congress and a new administration to delay the regulations from taking effect.
The agency's proposal is just part of the larger political gamesmanship, likely to intensify in coming months, over what presidents can and should do during the months between an election and inauguration.
If the president adopts the agency's recommendations this summer, they could prove politically useful for him at a time when Republicans are stepping up attacks on his administration for what they describe as overzealous regulation. The president could take some credit for having -- at least ostensibly -- tried to impose protections against last-minute regulations.
Mr. Obama issued an executive order this month mandating that existing regulations be periodically reviewed to see whether they provide the predicted benefits at a reasonable cost. Republicans remain worried about how Mr. Obama might handle last-minute regulations if he loses the election. And not without reason: studies have shown that midnight rules are more likely when a president serves only one term.
In April, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, and House Speaker John A. Boehner sent a letter to Mr. Obama saying he would be ''ill advised'' to issue last-minute regulations that they said could distract a new Congress and potentially a new administration.
''We believe that issuing a raft of midnight regulations would be inconsistent with your January 2009 commitment to transparency and accountability in the rule-making process,'' they wrote.
Congressional Republicans are trying to get in front of the problem. In hopes of imposing tougher rules than the Administrative Conference has proposed, they are pushing legislation that would prevent presidents from issuing most kinds of midnight regulations.
Senator Ron Johnson, the Wisconsin Republican who introduced the bill in the Senate, said his aim was simply to prevent lame-duck administrations from adding what he said were burdensome regulations that are ''chains on job creation'' and ''holding down our economy.''
''I don't think we need to increase regulation; we need to limit it,'' he said. ''If this administration is inclined to reform or reduce regulation, I'd like to work with them on that.''
Susan E. Dudley, a member of the Administrative Conference, said she believes the recommendations are a step in the right direction because they could help agency directors resist the temptation to rush through policy changes during their final days in office.
''It's like Cinderella leaving the ball,'' Ms. Dudley, who served in the Bush administration's Office of Management and Budget and is now a professor at George Washington University, said of agency officials who try to set rules ''before they turn back into ordinary citizens at noon on Jan. 20.''
Among the recommendations, the agency would call for administrations to refrain from proposing new rules during a president's final months in office, except in ''emergencies,'' and for Congress to authorize new administrations to delay their predecessor's midnight rules for 60 days.
The recommendations also call for departing administrations to share more information about new rules with incoming administrations, and for departing presidents to explain their timing publicly in cases where their last-minute regulations could have major economic or policy implications.
The conference, which was established in 1964, conducts research and makes recommendations to the president or agencies relating to various aspects of the administrative process. It has been reviewing midnight rule making since 2010. The conference's chairman is Paul R. Verkuil, a regulatory scholar and Obama appointee.
''Midnight regulations have presented challenges, both perceived and real, for incumbent and incoming administrations since the Carter years,'' Mr. Verkuil said.
Jason Schwartz, legal director for the Institute for Policy Integrity at the New York University School of Law, praised the agency's draft recommendations but warned that an overreaction to last-minute rule making can create problems of its own.
He said the legislation being considered in Congress, for example, goes too far because it prevents federal agencies from not only proposing regulations during the midnight period but also approving regulations that were proposed before the midnight period.
''If a rule was proposed a long time ago, and has gone through all the required analysis and public scrutiny and internal vetting, then finalizing it in the midnight period doesn't raise concerns for us,'' he said.
He added that he believes the Administrative Conference's proposal will do a better job than the legislation at addressing the real problem of midnight rule making, which is that administrations eager to get their regulations in place truncate the amount of time allotted for analysis and public comment.
Other regulatory experts have complained that the legislation is biased because it would allow presidents to repeal regulations during the midnight period but not add new ones.
''The bill would stop efforts to protect the public but would expedite those that would help big corporations,'' said Gary Bass, a professor at Georgetown University's Public Policy Institute. Representative Reid Ribble, a Wisconsin Republican and a sponsor of the bill in the House, rejected those criticisms.
The legislation, he said, simply protects the right of an incoming president to overturn regulations from a prior administration ''through the appropriate channels.''
''If a rule has been in the pipeline for months or years, there is obviously some sort of controversy surrounding it,'' he said.
Mr. Ribble's bill, which several Congressional staff members said has a good chance of being passed, has 11 co-sponsors.
Its companion bill in the Senate, sponsored by Mr. Johnson and 35 others, has less certain prospects, these staff members said.

HEADLINE: Dimon's Deja Vu Debacle

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Sometimes it's hard to explain why we need strong financial regulation -- especially in an era saturated with pro-business, pro-market propaganda. So we should always be grateful when someone makes the case for regulation more compelling and easier to understand. And this week, that means offering a special shout-out to two men: Jamie Dimon and Mitt Romney.
I'll come back shortly to the troubles at JPMorgan Chase, the bank Mr. Dimon runs. First, however, let me talk about Mr. Romney, whose remarks about those troubles were so off-point that they constitute a teachable moment. 
Here's what the presumptive Republican presidential nominee said about JPMorgan's $2 billion loss (which may actually have been $3 billion, or $5 billion, or more, but who's counting?): ''This was a loss to shareholders and owners of JPMorgan and that's the way America works. Some people experienced a loss in this case because of a bad decision. By the way, there was someone who made a gain.''
What's wrong with this statement? Well, suppose that someone -- say, Jimmy Stewart in the movie ''It's a Wonderful Life'' -- runs a bank that takes in deposits and invests the money in various ways. And suppose that one of those investments is a risky bet on some complex financial instrument, with Mr. Potter, the evil plutocrat, on the other side.
If Jimmy Stewart's bet pays off, we're in Romneyworld: he's made money, Mr. Potter has lost money, and that's that. But suppose Jimmy Stewart loses his bet. If the bet was big enough, he no longer has enough assets to pay off his depositors. His bank collapses, probably in a chaotic bank run that takes down the whole town's economy as collateral damage. Mr. Potter makes money on the deal, but so what?
The point is that it's not O.K. for banks to take the kinds of risks that are acceptable for individuals, because when banks take on too much risk they put the whole economy in jeopardy -- unless they can count on being bailed out. And the prospect of such bailouts, of course, only strengthens the case that banks shouldn't be allowed to run wild, since they are in effect gambling with taxpayers' money.
Incidentally, how is it possible that Mr. Romney doesn't understand all of this? His whole candidacy is based on the claim that his experience at extracting money from troubled businesses means that he'll know how to run the economy -- yet whenever he talks about economic policy, he comes across as completely clueless.
Anyway, it goes without saying that Jamie Dimon is no Jimmy Stewart. But he has, in a way, been playing Jimmy Stewart on TV, posing as a responsible banker who knows how to manage risk -- and therefore the point man in Wall Street's fight to block any tightening of regulations despite the immense damage deregulated banks have already inflicted on our economy. Trust us, Mr. Dimon has in effect been saying, we've got this covered and it won't happen again.
Now the truth is coming out. That multibillion-dollar loss wasn't an isolated event; it was an accident waiting to happen. For even as Mr. Dimon was giving speeches about responsible banking, his own institution was heaping on the risk. ''The unit at the center of JPMorgan's $2 billion trading loss,'' reports The Financial Times, ''has built up positions totaling more than $100 billion in asset-backed securities and structured products -- the complex, risky bonds at the center of the financial crisis in 2008. These holdings are in addition to those in credit derivatives which led to the losses.''
And what was going on as these positions were being accumulated? According to a fascinating report in Sunday's Times, the reality behind JPMorgan's facade of competence was a scene all too reminiscent of the behavior that brought down firms like A.I.G. in 2008: arrogant executives shouting down anyone who tried to question their activities, top management that didn't ask questions as long as the money kept rolling in. It really is deja vu all over again.
The point, again, is that an institution like JPMorgan -- a too-big-to-fail bank, not to mention a bank whose deposits are already guaranteed by U.S. taxpayers -- shouldn't be engaged in this kind of speculative investment at all. And that's why we need a return to much stronger financial regulation, stronger even than the Dodd-Frank regulations passed back in 2010.
Will we get that kind of regulation? Not if Mr. Romney wins, obviously; he wants to repeal Dodd-Frank, and in general has made it clear that he would do everything in his power to set us up for another financial crisis. Even if President Obama is re-elected, getting the kind of regulation we need will be an uphill struggle. But as Mr. Dimon's debacle has just demonstrated, that struggle remains as necessary as ever.

HEADLINE: Clash of the Theme Parks

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

 BODY:
ORLANDO, Fla. -- Pull down your lap bars: Universal Studios, the theme park chain now controlled by Comcast, is rolling out new weapons in its battle against Walt Disney Parks and Resorts -- and Disney is fortifying its defenses.
Universal's parks have always languished in the shadow of mouse ears, and that will not change anytime soon. Disney has eight parks in California and Florida that attract over 73 million visitors each year, with summer the busiest season. Universal operates three parks, with annual attendance totaling about 18 million.
But Universal is starting to look a lot less puny. A $265 million Harry Potter-themed addition to its resort here sent 2010 attendance soaring 30 percent over the year before, draining attention from Walt Disney World in the process. Universal is now racing to replicate the attraction at its parks in California and Japan while expanding the boy wizard's presence in Orlando. 
To maintain momentum, Universal -- with more Comcast money -- is introducing a swarm of offerings. A major 3-D ride themed to Michael Bay's ''Transformers'' movies opens this Friday at Universal Studios Hollywood, at an estimated cost of $100 million. New draws at Universal Orlando include a refurbished Spider-Man ride, a lavish parade, a high-tech fountain and pyrotechnics show and a ride based on ''Despicable Me.''
''There is an incredible sense of energy and forward motion around here, no doubt about it,'' said Thomas L. Williams, chief executive of Universal Parks & Resorts.
Disney is watching all of this with a clenched jaw. Although it has publicly dismissed a Potter-enhanced Universal as being even a remote threat, arguing (accurately, analysts say) that a rising tide in Orlando lifts all boats, Disney is privately concerned about preventing market share erosion on both coasts.
Competition with Universal, for instance, factored into Disney's decision to beef up a previously planned expansion to its Magic Kingdom park in Orlando and spend an estimated $500 million on an ''Avatar''-themed addition to its nearby Animal Kingdom park. The $425 million Magic Kingdom expansion opens in phases starting this year. ''Avatar'' construction is set to begin next year and open in 2015. Design details are secret, but James Cameron, who directed ''Avatar'' and is working on two sequels, has said part of the project will include a ride that simulates flight.
Disney declined to comment for this article.
Theme parks represent one of the few areas of stable growth outside of cable television for media and entertainment conglomerates like Comcast and Disney. Parks can be vulnerable to swings in the economy and require costly and continuous investments in new rides; escalating labor costs threaten margins. But for a media industry challenged by piracy, a fading DVD business and broadcast networks that continue to struggle, parks have emerged as a bright spot. For reasons that economists can't quite pin down, Americans have not cut back on expensive theme park vacations the same way they have pared retail spending and other discretionary purchases.
Comcast's movie division, for instance, recorded operating cash flow of only $6 million in the most recent quarter; the current quarter is also looking troubled, with the costly ''Battleship'' taking in a weak $25.4 million in theaters over the weekend. Comcast's broadcast network, NBC, recorded an operating cash flow loss of $10 million in the recent quarter.
In contrast, Universal's parks had operating cash flow of $157 million in the last quarter, a 17 percent increase from the same period a year ago. For 2011, the parks supplied 8 percent of NBCUniversal's total revenue but made up 20 percent of its total operating cash flow, the second-largest contributor behind cable television.
Disney reported similar results May 8. While the company's movie studio had a loss of $84 million -- mostly because of a huge write-down for ''John Carter'' -- operating income at its theme parks surged 53 percent, to $222 million.
The rivalry between the two parks operators, which dates to the late 1980s, when Disney scrambled to open its Hollywood Studios park here to beat Universal's planned arrival, next moves to California. Universal will soon open its ''Transformers'' ride; Disney will unveil a $450 million ''Cars''-themed addition to its California Adventure park in Anaheim on June 15.
(Disney bid for the Harry Potter rights but balked at the degree of creative control sought by the author J.K. Rowling; cost was also an issue.)
Comcast gained control of the Universal parks last year when it paid $13.75 billion to General Electric for 51 percent of NBCUniversal. Comcast quickly doubled down on the business, spending $1 billion to buy a stake in Universal Orlando owned by the Blackstone Group. G.E. and Blackstone were both more interested in wringing cash from the parks than expanding them; selling them entirely was regularly on the table.
But Comcast is different. ''We're really feeling the love,'' said Mr. Williams, Universal's chief.
Comcast has increased spending on the parks -- by how much it won't say -- and is betting on strong international growth. Universal announced a deal in April to open a park in Moscow by the end of the decade. The company, which opened a park in Singapore two years ago, also has resorts in the works in South Korea and Dubai; it is pursuing a deal in China.
Stephen B. Burke, a Comcast executive vice president and chief executive of the NBCUniversal unit, spent over a decade at Disney, working for part of that time as a senior parks manager. Mr. Burke, who was recently in Orlando to discuss plans to promote Universal across the Comcast empire, told analysts in a recent conference call that he was ''very bullish'' on the theme park business.
''Comcast is pretty excited about spending money there because they see a lot of potential growth,'' said Doug Mitchelson, a media analyst at Deutsche Bank. Mr. Mitchelson estimates that Comcast will spend $150 million a year on improvements for at least the next five years. Universal's previous owners in many recent years kept spending at the basic maintenance level, estimated at about $50 million annually.
At the moment, Universal is particularly hopeful that ''Transformers'' will continue an upswing at Universal Studios Hollywood, which is still best known for its tram tour of the Universal Pictures back lot, a feature that first opened in 1964. The Hollywood property in 2010 opened a new ''King Kong'' attraction and attendance jumped 26 percent over the year before.
The 3-D ''Transformers'' ride, which ThemeParkInsider.com called ''among the very top rides in the world'' in a review, could move the needle again. The attraction, which replaced an antiquated one built around the 1991 film ''Backdraft,'' was designed in conjunction with Mr. Bay and takes riders on a (perceived) high-speed adventure through the streets of Chicago, where good alien robots are engaged in a ferocious battle with evil ones.
Riders wearing 3-D glasses sit in motion simulators, which pivot, undulate and vibrate while moving through a 60,000-square-foot building on a track, stopping in front of 14 screens that tower up to 60 feet in the air. Transformers imagery is projected on the screens at four times the resolution of standard high-definition media, making it seem that the robots are real as they pull you into grinding gears, drag you through a skyscraper and blast weapons at your head.
On a tour last month, the ride's show producer (and a former Disney employee), Chick Russell, pointed out how ''tactile effects'' -- water, wind, heat, smoke -- are designed to occur in tandem with 3-D action sequences.
''We're the best, we think, at creating the world's greatest theme park attractions,'' Mr. Russell said as he hopped out of the ride vehicle.
Those sure sound like fighting words.

HEADLINE: Candidate, Philanderer and Juggler, Too: Edwards Trial Shows Deception's Strains

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

 BODY:
GREENSBORO, N.C. -- John Edwards ran for president in 2008 vowing to bridge the two Americas, the rich one and the poor one. There were two John Edwardses as well: a candidate and a lover so enthralled with his mistress that he could not stop the affair even when his top aides told him it would ruin his political career.
Whether the two Americas will ever become one remains to be seen. But the two lives of John Edwards have collided spectacularly in a federal courthouse here, where the government is trying him on six counts of campaign finance fraud and conspiracy.
Prosecutors say he got cash, private jets and other help with a value totaling more than $1 million from two wealthy political supporters to hide his mistress and their child from the public and his wife, Elizabeth. 
Mr. Edwards says it was nothing more than gifts from friends. A jury returns on Monday to resume deliberations in the case.
Meanwhile, those who spent nearly a month on the hard wooden benches in Judge Catherine C. Eagles's Art Deco courtroom have had room to reflect on a mountain of detail that illuminates what it was like to run for president while orchestrating a tryst that became a national scandal.
Over weeks of testimony, it became clear that, at least for a time, Mr. Edwards was perhaps the world's greatest multitasker.
He had to manage an increasingly suspicious and distraught wife who was determined to get him to the White House, as well as be a father to three (and eventually four) children and conduct an affair with an unemployed woman who had expensive needs, a spiritual adviser and a taste for Hollywood -- all while running for president.
He even managed to make a videotape said to show him having sex with his mistress, which was ordered destroyed in an earlier civil suit.
Andrew Young, the aide who once claimed paternity of the child, had taken the tape as a kind of insurance. Like many people on Mr. Edwards's campaign staff -- some of whom testified against him -- Mr. Young turned from true believer into one of the betrayed.
Mr. Edwards was in a crowded bar in the Regency hotel in New York in February 2006 when Ms. Hunter first approached him. He was having drinks with a donor, building a base for what he then thought would probably be a two-person race between him and Hillary Rodham Clinton for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination.
By that summer, Ms. Hunter had been hired to make a series of ''webisodes'' to show his personal side. Despite hundreds of hours of video and more than $100,000, the end result appeared amateurish. Only one appeared briefly during the campaign.
Jurors saw their shaky camera work and speakers who were out of focus or barely in the frame.
''I thought the webisodes were a disaster,'' Nick Baldick told the court. Like some senior advisers and lesser aides, Mr. Baldick, who ran Mr. Edwards's 2004 presidential campaign, eventually left during the 2008 bid in part, he told the jury, because of the affair.
Staff members became increasingly baffled by how much pull Ms. Hunter seemed to have with the candidate.
At first, it was the little things. She called him ''Johnny'' when every other staff member called him ''Senator.'' She traveled on his private jet, not the commercial flights most campaign workers took. The senator, so used to being cared for that aides knew to have three newspapers and his preferred brand of soda ready in the car, was carrying her luggage off the plane.
As the campaign heated up, so did suspicions and her demands.
''JRE just told me to make sure we get Rielle health insurance,'' an Edwards aide, Josh Brumberger, said in an e-mail to Mr. Baldick.
''Why?'' Mr. Baldick wrote back. ''She's not an employee. We don't provide health insurance to other consultants.''
''That's what I said,'' responded Mr. Brumberger, who would later be fired for confronting Mr. Edwards about the affair. ''He said, 'Figure it out.' ''
Earlier, a concerned Mr. Brumberger had Peter Scher, a banking executive and political adviser, try to control the situation.
In the fall of 2006, they met at the same hotel where Mr. Edwards had first met Ms. Hunter.
''I told him if it was true that he was having an affair with Ms. Hunter, he should not run for president,'' Mr. Scher testified. ''If it was true, eventually it would come out, and it would destroy his political career.''
Mr. Edwards said he understood. But after Ms. Hunter showed up on a trip yet one more time, the two men exchanged profanities in a telephone call. Mr. Edwards told him he did not need a baby sitter. Mr. Scher quit the campaign.
The two worlds of Mr. Edwards were perhaps never closer than when he announced his candidacy in December 2006. He arrived in Chapel Hill for an afternoon rally, Ms. Hunter filming his approach to the stage, where Mrs. Edwards and their children waited.
Mr. Young testified that Mr. Edwards asked him to keep his wife and his mistress from running into each other that day. He failed. The next day, Mrs. Edwards would say later, Mr. Edwards told her that he had slept with Ms. Hunter once. It was over.
With that, Ms. Hunter was off the campaign, and Mrs. Edwards began keeping a close eye on her husband.
But he could not stay away. He started using staff cellphones and even secured a special one Mr. Young would hand to him when they left North Carolina for the campaign trail. They called it the bat phone. All one of them had to do was start humming the theme to Batman when the phone needed to be put to use.
John Davis, who took care of Mr. Edwards's personal needs, saw Ms. Hunter in a Detroit hotel in February 2007. ''She said she and Senator Edwards were very much in love,'' he told the jury.
Later, in September, when Mr. Edwards was picking up an endorsement from the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, Mr. Davis went to Mr. Edwards's room to retrieve his phone. Mr. Edwards had the speaker on.
''I heard him ask Rielle if she was showing yet,'' Mr. Davis told the jury.
The couple conceived the baby around May 28, 2007, about the time Mr. Edwards announced new proposals for veterans as part of his campaign. The date, along with evidence about her menstrual cycle and gynecological appointments, were evidence in the trial.
Eventually, Ms. Hunter caused so much havoc on the road that a staff member called the campaign a ''traveling freak show.''
By the time the campaign was preparing for the Iowa caucuses, Mrs. Edwards was beside herself with rage when she discovered that two close friends and campaign contributors -- Fred Baron and Lisa Blue Baron, lawyers from Texas -- were secretly taking Ms. Hunter on shopping trips to Los Angeles.
What she did not know was that Mr. Baron was providing what would eventually total more than $800,000 in jets, cash and rent to help hide Ms. Hunter, the Youngs and their children.
His money, along with $725,000 from Rachel Mellon, an heiress, are at the heart of Mr. Edwards's indictment.
Jennifer Palmieri, a close friend of Mrs. Edwards and a former press secretary to her husband who is now in the White House communications office, recalled walking into the Iowa hotel room where Mrs. Edwards was screaming at him and the Barons. While Mr. Edwards stood by silently, the Barons explained they were simply trying to keep Ms. Hunter placated so she would not go public.
''I found it all a little unnerving,'' Ms. Palmieri testified.
Mr. Edwards finished second in Iowa, went on to lose badly in New Hampshire and South Carolina and dropped out of the race in January 2008.
Mrs. Edwards died in December 2010. Mr. Edwards was indicted in June 2011. His trial began in April, and lawyers offered their closing arguments on Thursday.
To close their case, the government dug up that old stump speech.
Mr. Edwards, said a prosecutor, Bobby Higdon, violated the very campaign restrictions designed to protect ''the two Americas'' so he could become president.
''Campaign finance laws are designed to bring the two Americas together at election time,'' Mr. Higdon said. ''John Edwards forgot his own rhetoric.''

CORRECTION-DATE: May 23, 2012

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A picture caption on Monday with an article about the trial of the former presidential candidate John Edwards referred incorrectly to a witness who testified that an angry encounter involving Mr. Edwards's wife, Elizabeth, was ''all a little unnerving.'' The witness was a female. (As the article noted, the testimony was by Jennifer Palmieri, a former press secretary for Mr. Edwards.)

He bolsters this question by explaining that with the economy struggling, a leftist ideology at play, President Obama's views on the size of government and rising inequality, it follows that President Obama should be being trounced.
I have a rather straightforward answer to Mr. Brooks's question: Mr. Obama is close because the recession, and its dramatic economic shock waves, were not a result of his policies; rather than ruling from the left, he has ruled from the pragmatic center.
Furthermore, government at all levels has shrunk, not grown, under his watch, and inequality is rising primarily as a result of Republican policies, many showcased and practiced by the last administration.
Add to these realities a weak Republican challenger who believes that the same policies that caused our economic problems will be the same ones to solve them, and this independent voter is asking a very different question: Why is Mitt Romney even close?

HEADLINE: Liberals Call For Cuomo To Champion Higher Wage

BYLINE: By JOHN ELIGON

 BODY:
ALBANY -- As legislation to raise New York State's minimum wage faces strong opposition in the Republican-controlled Senate, several liberal advocates and lawmakers are calling on Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to work more assertively for its passage, urging him to do more to help the poor and address income inequality.
Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has said he supports increasing the minimum wage, but some backers of the bill said that he had not lobbied for it as strongly as other measures he saw as priorities.
The governor became something of a national darling among liberals last year because of his firm support for same-sex marriage. But some say his moderate fiscal record has been overlooked. In his first year and a half in office, Mr. Cuomo has argued in favor of making the state more tax-friendly for businesses and for pouring resources into economic development projects that he hopes will create jobs. At the same time, he has cut back on social spending and direct aid to the poor in some areas. 
''I think that the governor has a mixed record, and, frankly, doesn't do anything for poor and working-class people that we don't make him do,'' said State Senator Kevin S. Parker, a Democrat from Brooklyn. ''His personal preferences have him for poor and working class people. I think his political reality makes him far more of a conservative on these issues.''
Indeed, there are several obstacles that make it difficult for Mr. Cuomo to support some of the measures sought by liberals. He inherited a state with severe fiscal problems, as well as a divided Legislature, with an Assembly held by Democrats, a Senate held by Republicans and a history of dysfunction and corruption.
Some say Mr. Cuomo's focus on job creation and business growth was actually the right way to help poor people.
''The more jobs, the more healthy and robust the economy is. That's not only good for individuals and employers, but it also creates the generation of that positive revenue to support much of the social programming we have that goes above and beyond most other states,'' said Senator Joseph E. Robach, a Republican from Rochester.
Mr. Cuomo's economic playbook, which calls for reining in social spending and courting business, follows a national trend in the Democratic Party that came to the fore under President Bill Clinton, who said ''the best social program is a good job,'' according to Basil Smikle Jr., a Democratic political consultant from Harlem. But that agenda can conflict with the party's social ideals, he added.
''I do think that is a legitimate concern, that there has not been enough attention placed on poverty, and housing in particular,'' Mr. Smikle said, referring to the party's platform.
In his first year in office, Mr. Cuomo delayed a 10 percent increase to the basic welfare grant. This year, he proposed instead to phase in that increase over two years. The Legislature balked and persuaded him to agree to the full 10 percent increase this year.
Advocates for the poor have criticized Mr. Cuomo for not supporting increases to school aid targeted toward the neediest districts, and for increasing tuition for state universities, capping property taxes and cutting money for various social programs, including ones to assist the homeless and provide job training and transportation.
Because of the way the Cuomo administration has distributed federal social welfare dollars, ''there's much less money left over for a range of support services,'' said Carolyn Boldiston, a senior analyst at the Fiscal Policy Institute.
While some credit the governor for passing a restructured tax code last year that maintained a higher tax rate on the top earners, others say that if he had agreed to renew an expiring surcharge on high-income earners, he could have raised even more revenue for the state, to help offset social spending.
Mr. Cuomo has, in fact, rolled out some policies that directly benefit the poor. On Thursday, for example, he took the first step toward ending a requirement that food-stamp applicants in New York City be fingerprinted.
He has also put in place a tax credit developed to encourage the hiring of young men who have long been unemployed; announced a nearly $20 million grant to build affordable housing units across the state and grants to provide low-income communities with access to fresh farm products; and created a health insurance exchange. A Cuomo spokesman, Josh Vlasto, said Sunday, ''Extremists on both sides will always complain; however, normally people wait for the end of the legislative session before they judge what it accomplished, so they know the facts.''
Still, liberal advocates say they want Mr. Cuomo to push for the minimum wage increase.
''The governor has a chance to do something that will endure after him,'' Dan Cantor, the executive director of the Working Families Party, said in a statement.
The Assembly passed a bill to raise the minimum wage to $8.50 an hour, from $7.25, and to allow annual increases for inflation. Senate Republicans have said they do not support that legislation, because they believe it would lead to job losses, and have instead lobbied for business tax credits that they say would create jobs.
The unwillingness of both the Assembly Democrats and the Senate Republicans to compromise has thwarted the governor's ability to broker a deal, an administration official said.
Some advocates of increasing the minimum wage have argued that Mr. Cuomo could unilaterally raise it through an executive order. But the administration believes that the governor is only supposed to use the wage board for ''episodic raises in areas, not across the board,'' an administration official said.
Russell Sykes, a senior fellow at the Empire Center for New York State Policy, said raising the minimum wage would not be as helpful to poor families as the earned income tax credit. For a single mother who earns the minimum wage and has two children, for instance, the state and federal credits would increase her annual income to more than $21,000 a year, or the equivalent of about $10.50 an hour, Mr. Sykes said.
The Senate majority leader, Dean G. Skelos, a Republican, pointed out that poor families receiving the earned income tax credit could stand to lose some benefits if the minimum wage was increased.

HEADLINE: Cannes Film Festival: Living (and Filming) in Hotels

BYLINE: DENNIS LIM


HIGHLIGHT: At the Cannes Film Festival, the Thai director Apichatpong Weerasethakul talks about "Mekong Hotel," his unusual film about creating a film. 

 BODY:
CANNES, FRANCE - The Palme d'Or can increase ticket sales and jump-start careers, but for the Thai filmmaker Apichatpong Weerasethakul, who took home the top prize at Cannes in 2010 for "Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives," it has mainly been a license to experiment. 
One of the most adventurous voices in world cinema - his love for avant-garde film dates to his student days at the Art Institute of Chicago - Mr. Apichatpong has spent much of the past two years working in the art world: presenting "Primitive," a suite of video pieces, at the New Museum in New York, among other institutions, and mounting installations everywhere from Beijing to the coming Documenta exhibition in Kassel, Germany. 
He returns to Cannes this year with one of the least conventional films in the official selection, the hourlong "Mekong Hotel," showing out of competition. Another new work, the impressionistic 20-minute diary film "Ashes," shot mostly on a compact 35-millimeter camera called the LomoKino, was screened in the Cannes market over the weekend and is being streamed for free online at Mubi.com, the Web site that produced it. He is also finishing a new piece commissioned by the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. 
A sketch for a film - or perhaps a dream of one - "Mekong Hotel" finds Mr. Apichatpong and some of his regular actors (including Sakda Kaewbuadee and Jenjira Pongpas) holed up in a hotel overlooking the Mekong River, which divides northeast Thailand from Laos. They gently banter, act out scenes that involve a flesh-eating ghost (drawn from an unrealized project of Mr. Apichatpong's called "Ecstasy Garden"), ruminate on the political history of the border waterway, look at the hypnotic wake patterns of speedboats in the river and listen to a guitarist, who improvises a wistful melody for the film's duration. 
"Mekong Hotel" only adds to the growing sense that in Mr. Apichatpong's work, everything belongs to a larger whole: actors and motifs are transmigrated from one film to another, and each story seems to have its own past and afterlife. As in much of his recent work, the spiritual is political: while Thailand endures a cycle of political turmoil and violence, the supernatural phenomena in his films have merged with historical phantoms, the manifestations of national traumas yet to be exorcised. 
Freshly arrived in Cannes on Friday afternoon Mr. Apichatpong made time for a brief interview before the official screening of "Mekong Hotel" at the Palais des Festivals. Edited excerpts from the conversation follow: 
Q.
 What was the context in which you made "Mekong Hotel" - I understand it was a commission from the European television network Arte? 
A.
 It's part of a program where they commission artists or filmmakers who have their own voices to make a documentary. That was the only guideline, but it troubled me a bit because I wasn't sure - what is documentary? 
Q.
 You've described your first film, "Mysterious Object at Noon," as a documentary about fiction. You could say the same thing about "Mekong Hotel."
A.
 Yes, it's kind of a documentary about creating fiction.
Q.
 Can you say a bit about the script for the unfilmed "Ecstasy Garden," parts of which are enacted in "Mekong Hotel"?
A.
 It's not really a script, more like a long treatment I wrote years ago, about the bond between a mother and a daughter. It's a mixture of animism and science fiction, but it was too expensive to make. There's a lot more than you hear in the film: the daughter and her obsession with the man that she loves, and when she dies, the camera turns into her point of view and the whole movie is framed through her eyes and through the centuries. 
Q.
 Are you still planning to make it?
A.
 I don't think so. The expression of it is enough for me. It's almost like I already made that movie.
Q.
 You've used music - notably Thai pop songs - in your work, but never anything like this, with the wall-to-wall guitar that functions as a musical score. 
A.
 It came very organically. I met a long lost high school friend who's a musician now, so I asked him to play the music for the film. I gave him the story of "Ecstasy Garden" and he interpreted it. The film is about friendship as well, about catching up, and the friendship with my actors. And the fact that the music is playing constantly - it's almost like a part of the river.
Q.
 Like many of your previous films, "Mekong Hotel" was shot in the northeastern region of Thailand where you grew up. What is the particular significance of this hotel and this river? 
A.
 When I was visiting my actress Jenjira while she was recovering from a leg injury, I was always staying at hotels around there. Growing up in that area, there was this issue of us and them, the Laotians, and the Communists would come in through the river. It's like a wall but the roles keep changing, the wall is not so concrete. After the war the border was very restricted but in the '90s it started to open up because of the economy. Lately there's the conflict and environmental concern over this hydroelectric dam that's been built in China and Laos, and actually the main buyer is from Thailand. 
Q.
 Do you think "Mekong" has more in common with your features, like "Uncle Boonmee" and "Tropical Malady," or your short video pieces, for instance the works in "Primitive"? 
A.
 I'm becoming very interested in the marriage of art and film. I think there's a freedom there, and I feel less restricted. With "Mekong Hotel" we shot on video, which is what I use for the artworks. It's really a hybrid between what I do in video art and narrative film.
 The film has a loose form that I hope to explore more in the future. I wanted to explore a shooting environment that's very relaxed and very casual. We just woke up and shot. It's really lazy but a really enjoyable way of working. When you make movies, you usually have a script and locations, and you have to leave where you're staying in the morning, and this blend of living and shooting was so nice. It was like we were documenting this hotel, this place that we were living. 
Q.
 Do you like hotels?
A.
 Very much. I think I became aware of that when I saw [the Taiwanese director] Tsai Ming-liang's "The River" [in which a hotel room is a pivotal location]. Suddenly it entered my mind when I saw that dark room - wow, I've been in this room, it's like many other hotel rooms in Asia, and since then I've started to pay more attention to places I stay.
Q.
 You launched a new festival in March called Film on the Rocks with Tilda Swinton on the Thai island of Yao Noi. How did that go?
A.
 We wanted to bring together interesting people from different creative fields. It's very challenging because it's so spectacular there and it almost overrides our aim. I think we learned a lot. Film on the Rocks is mainly a foundation for me - we have filmmaker residencies and Lucrecia Martel made a film there this time - and I would love to continue that, but I want to stay away from the glamor, which happens on the festival side of things.

HEADLINE: A River Runs Through It

BYLINE: DAN MORRISON


HIGHLIGHT: Cleaning up the Ganges isn't just choosing to save the river over watching it expire. It's choosing a progressive India over a mediocre one. 

 BODY:
KOLKATA, India - India is embarking on an expensive last-ditch attempt to restore the heavily polluted Ganges River basin, home to 400 million people. The cleanup will take decades and cost tens of billions of dollars. The World Bank, which has already ponied up $1 billion in loans and grants, classifies it as "high" risk.
Despite the risk - the dangers posed by corruption, incompetence and political parochialism - the National Ganges River Basin Project is a great idea, one that could improve the health of millions of people while also boosting India's economy.

The project is unprecedented in its complexity. Other dying rivers, including the Rhine and the Danube, have seen pricey turnarounds, but experts say they were child's play compared with the challenge of restoring the Ganges.
The Ganges River runs through five separate states, each of them poor, each governed by a different political party, each rife with corruption. Most of the money for the Ganges cleanup will go to the authorities of those states, and of dozens of grimy towns, for the construction of sewage treatment plants and other infrastructure. The biggest and most populous of the Ganges states, Uttar Pradesh, has in recent years become a giant crime scene, as politicians and bureaucrats have looted hundreds of millions of dollars - some say billions - in health funds and food subsidies.
Even if corruption weren't a factor, local administrators are the plan's weakest link: most don't have the skills to manage big projects. And there are far too few of them. India has only one-fifth of the civil servants per capita that the United States has.
Fixing the river will also require more efficient agricultural practices. One of the biggest factors in the Ganges' decline is the volume of water diverted to irrigation: a whopping 90 percent. Getting farmers to switch to water-efficient crops and methods will be a major challenge.
Then there's tradition. Millions of Hindu pilgrims will have to be persuaded to cease dumping idols, beads and corpses in the river. These practices account for five percent of the river's pollution.
India tried reviving the river once before, and failed. The 1985 Ganges Action Plan cost $250 million over 20 years and succeeded in treating only 35 percent of the raw sewage then pouring into the river. Population growth has reversed many of those gains, as has poor maintenance of the infrastructure created during that effort.
One difference today is that the public seems to be on board. In a damning 2007 report on the shortcomings of the first Ganges cleanup, the environmentalist Rakesh Jaiswal lamented that "environmental concerns in India continue to be the burden of a few green crusaders." But thanks to a recent spate of high-profile hunger strikes, the river is grabbing headlines and airtime.
The Indian government says it has learned from past mistakes in planning and execution. The World Bank claims transparency and audits can suppress corruption. The expertise of the country's seven Indian Institutes of Technology has also been harnessed to the task.
So, is a Ganges cleanup worth the trouble? Absolutely. The price tag and the risks may be high, but the cost of doing nothing would prove even greater.
Across the Ganges basin, water-borne diseases cost families $4 billion a year. Delivering clean water to hundreds of millions of households could have an explosive effect on public health and productivity. Here's one example: a single $43 million plan to connect the homes of 300,000 mostly poor residents of Kanpur to a treatment plant built during the first cleanup would save $13 million in health expenses every year, according to the World Bank.
Cleaning up the Ganges isn't just choosing to save the river over watching it expire. It's choosing hope over cynicism, and the progressive India everyone wants over the corrupt and mediocre one citizens so frequently get.
Against the evidence, I'm betting on the good.

HEADLINE: Average Household Feeling Less Distressed, Analysis Finds

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: A quarterly index finds improvement in average household finances. 

 BODY:
A more stable job market and fewer mortgage delinquencies helped reduce financial distress in the average American household in the first three months of the year, a quarterly analysisfinds.
United States households scored 69.9 on a 100-point scale designed by CredAbility, a large consumer credit-counseling agency, to measure consumer financial stability. A score above 70 on the "consumer distress index" indicates financial health. The overall index rose from 67.6 in the previous quarter and is at the highest level recorded since the third quarter of 2008.
"We're getting close to being healthy," said Mark Cole, chief operating officer of the agency and the index's author. The index, based on publicly available economic data as well as information collected by CredAbility, measures consumer health in the areas of employment, housing, credit, household budgets and net worth. "We've been in distress for so long, and we're right there on the brink of it."
Mr. Cole said consumers had weathered higher gas and food prices in the first quarter and were starting to see some improvements in their finances. "We're beginning to see households be a little more optimistic," he said.
The agency also added data for 25 metropolitan areas to its analysis. Five areas that still lag in employment and housing scored the lowest: Tampa-St. Petersburg, Fla.; Detroit; Miami-Ft. Lauderdale-West Palm Beach; Atlanta; and Los Angeles, all well below 70.
The healthiest areas included Washington, D.C., Boston, and Minneapolis-St. Paul, all with scores above 70.
"Jobs are really the engine of all of this," said Mr. Cole. "That's where we'll find stability in the long term."
Are you feeling less financially distressed than at the end of last year?

HEADLINE: '4000 Miles' and Its Lead Actors Win Obie Awards

BYLINE: PATRICK HEALY


HIGHLIGHT: Other Obies for top performances went to Steven Boyer in "Hand to God" and the acting ensemble in "Sweet and Sad." 

 BODY:
Amy Herzog's critically acclaimed play "4000 Miles," about a young man reconnecting with his grandmother as he is reeling from personal losses, won the Obie award for best new American play on Monday night at an awards ceremony honoring Off Broadway theater. The lead actors in "4000 Miles," Gabriel Ebert and Tony Award winner Mary Louise Wilson ("Grey Gardens"), also received Obies, which have been presented by The Village Voice for the last 57 years.
Other performance Obies went to Cherise Boothe ("Milk Like Sugar"), Steven Boyer("Hand to God"), the acting ensemble for "Sweet and Sad," Jim Fletcher (sustained excellence, including "Gatz"), Santino Fontana ("Sons of the Prophet"), Linda Lavin ("The Lyons"), and Susan Pourfar ("Tribes").
Kirsten Greenidge won an Obie for playwriting for "Milk Like Sugar," while directing Obies went to Richard Maxwell for "Early Plays" and Jay Scheib for "World of Wires."
Design awards went to Mark Barton for lighting and Mimi Lien for sets (both for sustained excellence), and to Matt Tierney and Ben Williams for the sound design for "The Select (The Sun Also Rises)." Among the recipients for special citations were Elevator Repair Service (which created both "Gatz" and "The Select") and the creators of the Off Broadway musical "Once," which has since moved to Broadway and was nominated this month for 11 Tony Awards, the most of any Broadway show.
A lifetime achievement Obie was given to Caridad Svich, a playwright, translator, and teacher.
In other theater awards news, the Drama League - a membership organization of theater-goers - presented its 78th annual awards on Friday. Among the recipients were "Once" for best musical; the Broadway family drama "Other Desert Cities" for best play; the Philip Seymour Hoffman-led "Death of a Salesman" for best play revival; the now-shuttered "Follies" for best musical revival; and Audra McDonald for best performance playing Bess in "The Gershwins' Porgy and Bess."

HEADLINE: The Case of the Missing Skills

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: About half of American employers reported having difficulty filling positions in 2010 because of a lack of suitable skills, one of the highest percentages for developed countries. 

 BODY:
More than half of American employers reported having difficulty filling positions because of a lack of suitable skills in 2010, one of the highest shares for developed countries.
That's according to a new report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
Take a look at the blue bars in the chart above, which show the share of employers who report having difficulty recruiting adequately skilled workers. As you can see, among the countries assessed here, only Australia, Brazil, India and Japan had a greater share of employers who said they faced skill shortages.
It's not clear what would be behind these employer frustrations. As shown in the green bars in that same chart, unemployment rates are high in many of these countries, including the United States. That should mean labor is abundantly available.
Perhaps well-matched workers and employers have trouble finding each other, although presumably in the digital age these search frictions should be relatively small. Maybe employers aren't offering high enough wages to entice the workers they seek.
Most likely the biggest obstacle, though, is that it takes significant time and resources for displaced workers to gain skills and training to become the ideal job candidates that businesses seek.
The organization's report covers some ways that public policy can accelerate this process, among them improving public investment in higher education. But American states -- whose public colleges enroll about three-quarters of all students -- has been increasingly shifting the cost burden of higher education away from the public and onto the students themselves.

HEADLINE: How Fast Will States Recover Peak Employment?

BYLINE: SHAILA DEWAN


HIGHLIGHT: A forecasting firm says that all but eight states will regain their prerecession job levels by 2015. 

 BODY:
A new analysis by the forecasting firm IHS Global Insight shows which states have returned to their peak prerecession employment levels (Alaska, Texas, Louisiana, North Dakota) and offers a forecast of how soon the rest will do so. 
The optimistic report says that 16 states will regain peak employment by the end of next year, and that all but eight will do so by the end of 2015. Nevada, Michigan and Rhode Island are expected to be the laggards, not achieving peak employment until after 2017.
What was the formula for success? "The states in the middle of the country have benefited from not being exposed to the housing boom and bust and also have gotten a kick from strong oil and gas demand," said Jim Diffley, the chief regional economist at IHS.

HEADLINE: A Richer Life by Seeing the Glass Half Full

BYLINE: JANE E. BRODY


HIGHLIGHT: How to define optimism, put it into practice and enjoy its benefits. 

 BODY:
The definition of an optimist:
Someone, like me, who plans to get more done than time permits.
Having failed to achieve the impossible, someone, like me, who is sure everything will somehow get done anyway.
A more classical definition from the Mayo Clinic: "Optimism is the belief that good things will happen to you and that negative events are temporary setbacks to be overcome."
In one study, adults shown to be pessimists based on psychological tests had higher death rates over a 30-year period than those who were shown optimistic. No doubt, the optimists were healthier because they were more inclined to take good care of themselves.
Unlike Voltaire's Candide, I've yet to be stripped of my optimism, though there are clearly forces in this country and the world that could subdue even the most ardent optimist.
I am a realist, after all, and I do fret over things I may be able to do little or nothing about directly: economic injustice; wars and the repeated failure to learn from history; our gun-crazy society; the overreliance on tests to spur academic achievement; and attempts to strip women of their reproductive rights.
But I've found that life is a lot more pleasant when one looks at the bright side, seeing the glass half full and assuming that reason will eventually prevail.
Not Just About Being Positive 
Murphy's Law - "Anything that can go wrong will go wrong" - is the antithesis of optimism. In a book called "Breaking Murphy's Law," Suzanne C. Segerstrom, a professor of psychology at the University of Kentucky, explained that optimism is not about being positive so much as it is about being motivated and persistent.
Dr. Segerstrom and other researchers have found that rather than giving up and walking away from difficult situations, optimists attack problems head-on. They plan a course of action, getting advice from others and staying focused on solutions. Whenever my husband, a dyed-in-the-wool pessimist, said, "It can't be done," I would seek a different approach and try harder - although I occasionally had to admit he was right.
Dr. Segerstrom wrote that when faced with uncontrollable stressors, optimists tend to react by building "existential resources" - for example, by looking for something good to come out of the situation or using the event to grow as a person in a positive way.
I was 16 when my mother died of cancer. Rather than dwell on the terrible void her death left in my life, I managed to gain value from the experience. I learned to apply her lifelong frugality more constructively, living each day as if it could be my last, but with a focus on the future in case it wasn't.
Yes, I saved, but I also chose not to postpone for some nebulous future the things I wanted to do and could, if I tried hard, find a way to do now. And I adopted a very forthright approach to life, believing that if I wanted something badly enough, I could probably overcome the odds against me.
When I applied at age 24 for a job as a science writer at The New York Times, an interviewer said I was foolhardy to think I could be hired after just two years of newspaper experience. "If I didn't think I could do the job, I wouldn't be here," I told him.
It turned out to be just what he wanted to hear, and I was hired. Since what I loved most was researching and writing articles that could help people better understand science and medicine, I stayed focused on my goals and declined opportunities to move up in the organization by becoming an editor.
Research has indicated that a propensity toward optimism is strongly influenced by genes, most likely ones that govern neurotransmitters in the brain. Still, the way someone is raised undoubtedly plays a role, too. Parents who bolster children's self-esteem by avoiding criticism and praising accomplishments, however meager, can encourage in them a lifelong can-do attitude.
With the right guidance, many of the attributes of optimism also can be learned by adults, Dr. Segerstrom and other researchers have found.
Noting that it is easier to change behavior than emotions, she eschews the popular saying "Don't worry, be happy." Instead, she endorses a form of cognitive behavioral therapy: Act first and the right feelings will follow. As she puts it in her book, "Fake it until you make it."
She wrote, "People can learn to be more optimistic by acting as if they were more optimistic," which means "being more engaged with and persistent in the pursuit of goals."
If you behave more optimistically, you will be likely to keep trying instead of giving up after an initial failure. "You might succeed more than you expected," she wrote. Even if the additional effort is not successful, it can serve as a positive learning experience, suggesting a different way to approach a similar problem the next time.
Framing Your Thoughts
It's important not to neglect the power of positive thinking. Both Dr. Segerstrom and the Mayo researchers recommend taking a few minutes at the end of each day to write down three positive things that happened that day, ending the day on an upbeat note.
The Mayo researchers offered these additional suggestions:
Avoid negative self-talk. Instead of focusing on prospects of failure, dwell on the positive aspects of a situation.
In college, I would approach every exam, even those I had barely studied for, with the thought that I was going to do well. Time after time, this turned out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Regardless of the nature of your work, identify some aspect of it that is personally fulfilling. If your job is scrubbing floors, stand back and admire how shiny and clean they look.
Surround yourself with positive, upbeat people. But be aware that if you are chronically negative and always see only the dark side of things, the optimists in your life may eventually give up on you.
Focus on situations that you can control, and forget those you can't. I would also suggest using voting power, money or communication skills to forward a goal that is beyond your personal control.

HEADLINE: This Week in Small Business: It's Small Business Week!

BYLINE: GENE MARKS


HIGHLIGHT: Plus: cheap gas, the worst phones, "Zuckerberg: The Musical" and your company's obituary. 

 BODY:
What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week.
The Big Story: Whose Week Is It?
National Small Business Week kicks off. President Obama holds a small-business round table and proposes new tax incentives. But the chairman of the House's Small Business Committee says the majority of the president's policies have "burdened" small business. A new report finds that running a small business is three times more stressful than raising children. Half of small-business owners say they're successful.
The Economy: Is the Debt Ceiling Moot?
Anxiety over "Taxmageddon" increases and John Snow is concerned. Goldman Sachs says the coming "fiscal cliff" could shrink our economy 4 percent. James Picerno wonders if we're heading toward recession or just more slow-growth turbulence. Paul Krugman makes the case for overreacting. President Obama's budget is defeated 99 to 0 in the Senate. Ezra Klein wonders if the 2013 debt ceiling will be moot. A stronger dollar drives oil prices lower but the International Monetary Fund predicts that oil prices will double in 10 years - and a newly discovered Mayan calendar confirms that we'll still be around to pay.
Data: Autos Are Driving the Economy 
Builder confidence rises again, starts of privately owned housing (pdf) are 29.9 percent ahead of a year ago, Mark Perry says it's a real estate "blowout" and a Time magazine report says the housing market recovery has "officially begun." But architects' billings go negative. A rise in sales of cars and trucks is driving the economy. Machine tool orders and conveyor sales are both up. Industrial production increased 1.1 percent in April. Manufacturing grows in New York but contracts in the Philadelphia region. The consumer price index remains unchanged. Business collections drop. Retail sales continue to be strong. Wal-Mart reports a 10 percent increase in profit. And Peter Orszag says the good news on jobs is coming from big businesses, not small. This is the 250th anniversary of the sandwich.
Start-Up: Created by Mistake
A new episode of "TechStars" explains why some start-ups must pivot. Here's how to start a health care business. Donna Rosato explains the real costs of starting a business. A start-up's $10 raffle promises to send a winner to the stars (where Darth Vader brainstorms). Mayor Michael Bloomberg unveils the "Made in NY Digital Map," which tracks jobs created by Silicon Alley start-ups. Meanwhile, a couple of guys give a Ghostbusters tour of New York, and a report explains why New York City is best for small businesses. Shayan Zadeh says that if you're trying to start a business, you should get ready to mess up and start over: "What do penicillin, the Post-It note and even chocolate chip cookies have in common? All of these inventions were created by mistake."
Management: Prison Business
When interviewing job candidates, remember that one more year of school and a cup of coffee may both increase their longevity, but keep an eye on how much sugar they take. Think it's O.K. to ask employees for Facebook log-ins? Think again. This chief executive will pay his employees $100,000 for a good idea. Jay Goltz shares three lessons he's learned about hiring. Here are nine steps for managing employee volunteer programs. Paul Shread explains how to keep business projects on track. Harvey Schachter reports on five major mistakes leaders make. Corazon PB. Claudio talks about the challenges of business continuity planning. In their new book, Leonard A. Schlesinger, Charles F. Kiefer and Paul B. Brown say there are some lessons small-business owners should take from serial entrepreneurs, such as: "Begin by taking a small (smart) step forward. It may not be the right direction, but as the owner of a small business, you will never know if you do not try." Hey, running a business from prison isn't as easy as you think, O.K.? Veronica Pamoukaghlian wonders if you need intelligence to be successful. Tali Sharot explains why we're born optimistic.
Around the Country: Needle Arts
Curt Schilling strikes out in Rhode Island. Illinois may be raising its minimum wage. Births of minorities surpass those of whites. North Dakota is the nation's second leading oil producer. This impoverished city is building an economy on co-ops. How did these three simple buttons increase tipping by $144 million in New York City cabs? A California airline offers unlimited short-haul flights by monthly subscription, and the cash-short state is offered a piece of the action from Internet poker. Amazon is hiring 1,000 workers in Seattle; Hewlett-Packard is cutting 30,000. A Narberth, Pa., mother creates a business in the needle arts. Some 53,000 dead voters are found in Florida. A packaging manufacturer is building a new facility in Ohio. A Columbia University janitor graduates with honors and another graduate proposes to his girlfriend during commencement. These are the most social media savvy cities in the country. Researchers at a California lab make electricity from viruses.
Around the World: The Cheapest Gas?
China grants new quotas for rare-earth exports while a report says economic growth there is sowing unhappiness. Brad Plumer answers frequently asked questions about Greece's economic troubles. This slide show reveals the cheapest gas prices by country. A traveler has an enormous revelation.
Marketing: Facebook Goes Public
With Facebook going public, you can celebrate by checking out Zuckerberg: The Musical! Half of Americans consider Facebook a fad. Dion Hinchcliffe considers the social business implications of the company's public offering. Here's what happened to a pizza shop that bought an ad on Facebook. John Jantsch lists 13 questions that will improve your marketing strategy. American Express enters the daily deal business. The Clios are awarded to the best ads of the year. Tim Maly says that instead of business cards, you should design a flip book and video. Erik Wolf suggests five ways to tell if you're hiring the wrong search engine marketer. Lee Odden says there are five ways to optimize the business value of attending conferences, including: "Think about how you can leverage your conference experience to create new content for your company blog, articles or process documentation." Pamela Slim believes that if you expand your comfort zone, you can expand your market.
Finance: Lose Your Pride

Red Tape: Another Burden
Available tax credits could help up to 3.2 million small businesses provide health coverage for their 19 million workers. The Senate approves funds for the Export-Import Bank. Jennifer Carey says the E-Verify requirement would place another burden on small businesses: "At a time when the nation is trying to encourage small businesses to expand their payrolls, the measure would potentially add thousands of dollars in expenses and give them another reason to have second thoughts about taking on additional workers." A study finds small businesses believe protection of public lands is good for business.
Technology: The Worst Phones
Pinterest is valued at $1.5 billion. From Gizmodo: the worst phones you can buy. This animated video explains how Gmail works. A customer-relationship management solution for e-mail users raises $500,000 in angel funding from a few well-known investors. Rob Pegoraro explains why it's not crazy to pay for an e-mail account.

Sage introduces new tools for small businesses. And please just smile.
The Week's Bests: Write Your Obituary
Aida J. Ingram says you need to finish what you start: "Before you start a new project, ask yourself these three questions: Why is this important to me? I know I love the idea, but do I need to be the one to do it, or am I the supporting cast for someone else's dream? Do I care enough about this project to make sure I see it through until it's completed, no matter how long it takes?"
Bill Taylor says your company's obituary can shape its future: "If your company went out of business tomorrow, who would miss you and why? That's an urgent question for companies in every industry, because every industry has customers with an unprecedented array of products, brands and options from which to choose. In a world defined by unlimited choice and unrelenting sensory overload, if you have customers who can live without you, eventually they will. In order to increase the odds of your company having a long and prosperous life, it pays to write an unblinking 'obituary' and wrestle with its messages and implications."
Jeff Haden says remarkable entrepreneurs have nine qualities: "They ignore the 40-hour workweek hype. Studies show that working more than 40 hours a week decreases productivity. Whatever. ... There will always be people who are smarter and more talented than you. Remarkable entrepreneurs want it more. They're ruthless - especially with themselves. Remarkable entrepreneurs simply work harder. That's the real secret of their success."

HEADLINE: Investing in Julia

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: Living in and taking part in society requires acceptance of some responsibilities for others, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
"The Life of Julia," a storybook advertisement recently released as part of President Obama's re-election campaign, aimed to highlight government programs of particular benefit to women over the life cycle. Many conservatives heaped scorn on it.
Their vehement reactions dramatize the extent of partisan disagreement over the appropriate place in our society of both women and public assistance. They also demonstrate why liberals need to make a stronger case for collective investments in the development of human capital. 
Consider the list of government benefits that Julia enjoys over her lifetime: She enters Head Start (a federally financed preschool program), attends a high school taking part in Race to the Top (a program to improve standards), garners a tax credit and a Pell Grant to help pay for college, remains covered by her parents' health insurance policy until age 26 (as a result of new federal rules), enters the work force confident of her legal right to equal pay (as a result of the Lilly Ledbetter Act), works as a Web designer and repays her student loans more easily because their interest rate has been capped. 
As a worker, she benefits from health insurance that covers the cost of birth control, other preventive care and the costs of maternity checkups and prenatal care when she decides to have a baby. Her son Zachary benefits from kindergarten and better public schools. Julia starts her own Web design company with the help of the Small Business Administration and, as she grows old, enrolls in Medicare and begins to receive Social Security benefits. 
Julia never receives any means-tested public assistance as an adult. She works hard, achieves economic success, becomes an entrepreneur and creates jobs. She is not dependent on the state; her story never mentions the father of her child, which implies that she is not dependent on a man, either.

Indeed, as William Bennett put it, she is "not your typical all-American girl but an obviously independent yuppie liberal woman." Jennifer Rubin of The Washington Post jumped to the conclusion that Julia must not have a husband. 
Helping explain the panicky reaction, Virginia Heffernan at Yahoo News observed that Julia might be gay. Compounding the gender threat is the powerful welfare mom stereotype. The conservative blogger David Harsanyi asked, "Who the hell is 'Julia,' and why am I paying for her whole life?"
The New York Times columnist David Brooks described Julia's story as the embodiment of "government as a national Sugar Daddy." 
But why should we assume that Julia - a model member of the business community - is a drain on anyone's pocketbook? As a successful employee and entrepreneur, she pays substantial taxes. 
All the government benefits she enjoys are likely to increase her productivity, her income and, as a result, the taxes she pays. Raising a child also represents a significant long-term contribution to future tax revenues. 
The Obama campaign should have made this clear. A more politically effective version of the Julia story would have highlighted the positive payoff to public investments in the development of productive capabilities. 
Public expenditures on education represent a collective loan to the younger generation, which they pay back as they become working adults and pay taxes to help support and care for the older generation. 
For much of our lives, taxes represent either a payback of what has been spent on us or a pay-forward of what we will receive upon retirement. 
The terms of this payback need to be renegotiated as economic and demographic factors shift. Slower economic growth, spiraling health care costs and the increasing average age of the population are contributing to stress on this intergenerational contract. 
But renegotiation does not require austerity-driven across-the-board cuts to social programs. 
Many affluent members of our society would prefer to opt out of any responsibility for those less fortunate. They consider the costs of early-childhood education and college for people like Julia an encumbrance and think they can do better on their own. 
But if we leave it up to families to invest in their own human capital, many of them won't have access to the resources they need to do so effectively, a point that the economists Gary Becker and Kevin Murphy made long ago.
Also, as the economist Robert Shiller emphasizes in his new book, "Finance and the Good Society," we all face enormous unknowns. No one knows for sure what is likely to happen to wages, profits or housing prices over the long-term. 
Sure, we could move toward an every-man-for-himself economy. But private insurers typically have a financial incentive to exclude those most at risk. And choosing to invest only in your own human capital is a lot like choosing to invest all your resources in one small company.
Most of us will do better with a diversified portfolio that includes both socially responsible commitments and protection against long-term uncertainty. 
Those who want to opt out of the risk-sharing commitment known as citizenship can hand in their passports and move to Singapore. Julia and I are staying here.

HEADLINE: Boehner's Latest Budget Gambit

BYLINE: CARL HULSE


HIGHLIGHT: Speaker John A. Boehner may ultimately cut a big budget deal and emerge a hero. But there are potentially serious repercussions for him and his party as well as President Obama and the Democrats. 

 BODY:
Speaker John A. Boehner has a risky habit he just can't kick - and it is not smoking. 
 It is his determination to use the federal debt limit as leverage to win the "grand bargain" he covets on taxes, spending and social programs. The famously chain-smoking Ohio Republican may ultimately cut his big deal and emerge a hero. But there are potentially serious repercussions for him and his party as well as President Obama and the Democrats.
 Mr. Boehner took fellow lawmakers and the White House by surprise last week when he indicated a willingness to plunge back into the fight that devoured much of 2011. It didn't end well for either side when the government bond rating was downgraded, the image of Washington took a beating and a subsequent special Congressional debt committee flopped. The result requires a $500 billion cut in Pentagon spending that Republicans are now trying to wriggle out of.
On Sunday, Mr. Boehner said he was "not going to apologize for leading" by restarting the debate on the debt limit.
 "Why do we want to wait and rush this through at the end of the year after the election?" he said during an interview on ABC's "This Week."
 So why would Mr. Boehner want to go down that road again? There are plenty of reasons, starting with the idea offered by his aides that Mr. Boehner genuinely sees the idea of simplifying the tax code, cutting spending and increasing the sustainability of Social Security and Medicare as the right and necessary thing to do. 
 "When the speaker says the debt is hurting our economy and threatening our future, it's not spin," said Kevin Smith, a spokesman for Mr. Boehner. "He believes it to his core, and feels a very personal sense of responsibility to press Washington to deal with the problem while he has the chance."
 There are other factors at work. Mr. Boehner needs to get members of his unruly rank and file thinking about the idea that they might have to compromise in the months ahead on taxes and spending. Given the history of this House Republican majority, that might take time.
 Republicans also believe they win when talking about debt and borrowing, reinforcing their narrative that Democrats have irresponsibly maxed out the nation's credit card. Then there is the fact that Mr. Boehner's biggest asset in the upcoming negotiations is the need to raise the debt limit. And he must get it on the table because the game has changed since 2011.
 Because of the failure of the special debt committee, the Pentagon is facing steep reductions over the next decade under what is known as a sequester. Even though many of them backed the budget agreement, Republicans and some Democrats argue that those cuts are too deep and could not only weaken the military but might lead to significant job losses around the county if contractors are forced to lay off workers.
 But the dirty little not-so secret on Capitol Hill is that many Democrats prefer those cuts -- tough though they might be to swallow -- compared with the alternative: offsetting another increase in the debt limit with even more cuts in domestic programs without some new tax dollars. 
 As a result, there is no way Democrats are going to sign off on any proposal that would raise the debt limit, extend Bush-era tax cuts and jettison the sequester without finding new revenue, preferably through higher taxes on the most affluent Americans. 
 "The bottom line is, to avoid the sequester they are going to have come up with a balanced approach," said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Senate Democrat.
 Finding that balance might be tough for Mr. Boehner and run him afoul of the many House Republicans who are dead set against any increase in revenue. It is similar to last year when the speaker was willing to entertain up to $800 billion in new revenue in exchange for lower tax rates and significant changes in Social Security and Medicare. But whether he could ever sell that idea to his fellow House Republicans was a very open question before the entire deal collapsed in a breakdown with the White House. Pushing again for new revenue could mean trouble for Mr. Boehner.
 In his remarks last week, Mr. Boehner sought to take the offensive, saying that Democrats lacked the nerve to do what is right. And he promised that the House would vote before the election to extend the Bush-era tax cuts in an effort to put the Democrats on the defensive.
 Democrats think they have changed the calculus on taxes and can defend their refusal to extend the lower tax rates across the board by arguing that millionaires should pay more. But they will face a barrage of Republican attacks that they are supporting a tax increase and that could make Democrats in tough races nervous. Representative Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader, on Sunday sought to neutralize the issue by challenging the speaker to bring up the middle-class tax cuts for a separate vote, a decision Mr. Boehner is highly unlikely to make since it would provide Democrats cover.
 As he tries to tie the debt limit, tax rates and sequester into the foundation of a new grand bargain, the speaker faces a problem with the calendar. The sequester and the tax cuts need to be dealt with by Jan. 1; the timetable for the debt ceiling increase is uncertain and the Treasury Department can be expected to stretch out the need for an increase as long as possible.
 Mr. Boehner's allies rate his record in negotiations with the White House to be pretty good, having struck agreements on spending cuts far deeper than what Democrats would have previously accepted, even though it came at a political cost. 
 Now he is again in pursuit of a grand bargain with the debt limit as his bludgeon. The test will be whether he can reach consensus with Democrats armed with the Pentagon cuts while not suffering political setbacks in November or losing the support of his own party.

HEADLINE: Dueling Portrayals of Former Goldman Director at Insider Trading Trial

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN and AZAM AHMED


HIGHLIGHT: The trial of Rajat K. Gupta, a former director of Goldman Sachs and Procter &#038; Gamble, began on Monday. Mr. Gutpa is accused of leaking boardroom secrets about those two companies to a friend and business associate. 

 BODY:
"He's not an insider trader. He never defrauded anybody. He never cheated anybody," said a lawyer for Rajat K. Gupta, once one of America's most prominent businessmen. "He doesn't belong in this courtroom."
Yet there was Mr. Gupta, sitting stoically before a jury, as his trial got under way on Monday in Federal District Court in Manhattan. Behind him in the spectators' gallery were his wife and four daughters, one of them wiping away tears as a prosecutor painted a very different picture.
"This is a straightforward case of insider trading," said Reed Brodsky, the prosecutor, speaking to a jury of eight men and four women, which includes a freelance beauty consultant, a fourth-grade teacher and a psychiatric nurse.
Mr. Gupta, a former director of Goldman Sachs and Procter & Gamble, stands accused of leaking boardroom secrets about those two companies to his friend and business associate Raj Rajaratnam, the convicted former money manager who ran the Galleon Group, once one of the world's largest hedge funds.
The government depicted Mr. Gupta, a resident of Westport, Conn., as the ultimate insider who, after running the elite consulting firm McKinsey & Company, joined the boards of Goldman and P.& G. As a director, he was privy to these companies' most closely guarded secrets.
"Gupta threw away his duties, threw away his responsibilities and broke the law," Mr. Brodsky said.
Mr. Brodsky emphasized the ties between Mr. Gupta and Mr. Rajaratnam, who began doing business together during the middle of the last decade. Mr. Gupta invested in Galleon's funds, and the two helped start a $1 billion private equity fund together.
"Together they offered each other far more than they could achieve individually," said Mr. Brodsky.
Mr. Brodsky appealed to the jury of mostly working-class New Yorkers by highlighting the unfair advantage that he said Mr. Rajaratnam had received from Mr. Gupta's reported tips. In his opening statement, the prosecutor referred to the average, ordinary investor numerous times.
"Getting tips from Gupta was like knowing the outcome of a game before it ends or getting tomorrow's business news today," he told the jury.
Specifically, he pointed to an emergency Goldman board meeting via phone that Mr. Gupta participated in during the financial crisis. On the call, Mr. Gupta and his fellow directors approved a $5 billion investment from Warren E. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway.
Mr. Brodsky said that immediately after the meeting ended, Mr. Gupta called Mr. Rajaratnam, who bought $43 million of Goldman shares in the company just before the market closed. The last-minute purchase earned the hedge fund manager $1 million, Mr. Brodksy said.
Gary P. Naftalis, the lead lawyer for Mr. Gupta, accused the government of giving the jury a "cropped photograph" instead of the entire picture. He emphasized that the government had no wiretapped recordings of Mr. Gupta providing secret information to Mr. Rajaratnam. And on the few tapes in which Mr. Rajaratnam suggests to colleagues that he received tips about Goldman, Mr. Gupta "isn't even mentioned by name," Mr. Naftalis said.
Mr. Naftalis also hinted at another defense strategy: portraying Goldman Sachs as a sieve of information. He noted that Galleon was a top customer of Goldman and hinted that Mr. Gupta was not the only Goldman insider with valuable information. Three executives from the company are under investigation by the federal authorities for possibly leaking illicit information.
Mr. Naftalis highlighted a special visit that Gary D. Cohn, Goldman's co-president, made to the offices of Galleon around the time of Mr. Gupta's supposed leaks. "The No. 2 guy at Goldman Sachs doesn't make house calls for every Tom, Dick and Harry," Mr. Naftalis said.
Mr. Gupta showed little emotion as he watched the lawyers make their case. But the back-and-forth between Mr. Naftalis and Judge Jed S. Rakoff, who are old friends, forced even him to crack a smile.
During one discussion outside the presence of the jury, Judge Rakoff warned Mr. Naftalis not to delve into too much detail about his client's record of philanthropy, which includes efforts to combat global health concerns. Mr. Naftalis argued that he needed to counter accusations that his actions had been motivated by greed, and he asked to be permitted to mention Mr. Gupta's work fighting "AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis."
"Or the bubonic plague," chided Judge Rakoff, as the courtroom burst into laughter, including Mr. Gupta. Judge Rakoff did not allow Mr. Naftalis to list the specific diseases.
Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, was not in the courtroom, but his top deputy, Richard B. Zabel, and Lorin L. Reisner, the head of the office's criminal division, were present for the opening arguments.
Witness testimony is expected to begin on Tuesday with Caryn Eisenberg, who was one of Mr. Rajaratnam's secretary, and Carolann Shields, an employee at McKinsey. Also scheduled to testify this week are Byron D. Trott, a former Goldman banker who helped orchestrate Mr. Buffett's investment, and William George, a Goldman director and former chief executive of Medtronic.

HEADLINE: Reinstating an Old Rule Is Not a Cure for Crisis

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSS SORKIN


HIGHLIGHT: If the Glass-Steagall Act had still been in effect in 2008, it probably would not have prevented the financial crisis. 

 BODY:
Call it the Glass-Steagall myth.
Since JPMorgan Chase announced its surprise $2 billion, and growing, trading loss there have been renewed calls from economists, pundits and politicians to reinstate the Glass-Steagall Act, a Depression-era law that prevented commercial banks from participating in investment banking activities.
Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic candidate for Senate in Massachusetts, sent an e-mail to thousands of her constituents, pressing to bring back the law, which she said, "stopped investment banks from gambling away people's life savings for decades - until Wall Street successfully lobbied to have it repealed in 1999."
 A meme around Glass-Steagall has been created, repeated so often that it has almost become conventional wisdom: the repeal of Glass-Steagall led to the financial crisis of 2008. And, the thinking goes, has become almost religious for some people, that if the law were reinstated, we would avoid the next crisis.
The facts - basic facts - just aren't that convenient. While the repeal of Glass-Steagall has seemingly become the sine qua non of the financial crisis, it is pure historical revisionism.
Before we go any further on this topic - which is likely to incite heated debate - let me stipulate at the outset that this column is not meant to argue against reinstating Glass-Steagall or adopting the Volcker Rule (sometimes known as Glass-Steagall lite.)
Bringing back something akin to Glass-Steagall would clearly help limit risk in the system. And that's a very good and worthy goal. Letting banks sell securities and insurance products and services allowed them to grow too big too fast, and fueled a culture that put profit and pay over prudence.
But here's the key: Glass-Steagall wouldn't have prevented the last financial crisis. And it probably wouldn't have prevented JPMorgan's $2 billion-plus trading loss. The loss occurred on the commercial side of the bank, not at the investment bank. But parts of the bet were made with synthetic credit derivatives - something that George Bailey in "It's a Wonderful Life" would never have touched.
When I called Ms. Warren and pressed her about whether she thought the financial crisis or JPMorgan's losses could have been avoided if Glass-Steagall were in place, she conceded: "The answer is probably 'No' to both."
Still, she said that the repeal of the law "had a powerful impact to let the big get bigger." She also contended that its repeal, brought about by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, "mattered enormously. It is like holding up a sign to regulators to back up."
Let's look at the facts of the financial crisis in the context of Glass-Steagall.
The first domino to nearly topple over in the financial crisis was Bear Stearns, an investment bank that had nothing to do with commercial banking. Glass-Steagall would have been irrelevant. Then came Lehman Brothers; it too was an investment bank with no commercial banking business and therefore wouldn't have been covered by Glass-Steagall either. After them, Merrill Lynch was next - and yep, it too was an investment bank that had nothing to do with Glass-Steagall.
Next in line was the American International Group, an insurance company that was also unrelated to Glass-Steagall. While we're at it, we should probably throw in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which similarly, had nothing to do with Glass-Steagall.
Now let's look at the major commercial banks that ran into trouble.
Let's first take Bank of America. Its biggest problems stemmed not from investment banking or trading - though there were some losses - but from its acquisition of Countrywide Financial, the subprime lender, which made a lot of bad loans - completely permissible under Glass-Steagall.
What about Wachovia? Its near-collapse was largely a function of its acquisition of Golden West, a mortgage lender that saddled it with billions of dollars in bad loans.
Citigroup's problems are probably the closest call when it comes to whether Glass-Steagall would have avoided its problems. It gorged both on underwriting bad loans and buying up collateralized debt obligations.
In that case, Glass-Steagall would have done two things: it would have prevented the trading losses and it also would have kept Citigroup from getting so big, which was one of the reasons it required a bailout.
But Citi's troubles didn't come until after Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, A.I.G., Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were fallen or teetering - when all hell was breaking loose.
Why do we have financial crises? Why do banks lose money?
If history is any guide, it hasn't often been the result of speculative bets. It has been the result of banks making loans to individuals and businesses who can't pay them back.
Yes, standards became so lax that buyers didn't have to put money down or prove their income, and financial firms developed dangerous instruments that packaged and sliced up loans, then magnified their bets with more borrowed money.
But it often starts with banks making basic loans. Making loans "is one of the riskiest businesses banks engage in and has been a major contributing factor to most financial crises in the world over the last 50 years," Richard Spillenkothen, former director of the division of banking supervision and regulation at the Federal Reserve, wrote in a letter to Politico's Morning Money on Monday. He said that if Glass-Steagall still existed, it "alone would not have prevented the financial crisis."
Still, Mr. Spillenkothen said: "If banks had been limited to 'plain vanilla' lending, notwithstanding its admitted riskiness, the financial crisis may well have been less severe or more easily managed and contained."
In my conversation with Ms. Warren she told me that one of the reasons she's been pushing reinstating Glass-Steagall - even if it wouldn't have prevented the financial crisis - is that it is an easy issue for the public to understand and "you can build public attention behind."
She added that she considers Glass-Steagall more of a symbol of what needs to happen to regulations than the specifics related to the act itself.
So would Glass-Steagall make things slightly better? Sure.
But the next time someone says that it is the ultimate solution, think again.

HEADLINE: With New Firepower, S.E.C. Tracks Bigger Game

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS and AZAM AHMED


HIGHLIGHT: After missing the warning signs of the financial crisis and the Ponzi scheme of Bernard L. Madoff, the S.E.C. has adopted several new strategies to restore its credibility. 

 BODY:
9:17 p.m. | Updated 
A corporate lawyer, a professional trader and an anonymous middleman carried out a lucrative insider trading scheme for nearly two decades, baffling federal authorities who were trying to unravel the mystery. Like characters in a crime novel, the three men evaded arrest by dumping cellphones, using code names and rendezvousing in Atlantic City to divide their bounty.
Then last year, authorities found the culprits. Relying on new tools, investigators at the Securities and Exchange Commission traced the conspiracy to Matthew H. Kluger, Garrett D. Bauer and Kenneth T. Robinson. In April, the three men, who have all pleaded guilty to criminal charges, agreed to pay the S.E.C. roughly $32 million.
Embarrassed after missing the warning signs of the financial crisis and the Ponzi scheme of Bernard L. Madoff, the agency's enforcement division has adopted several new - if somewhat unconventional - strategies to restore its credibility. The S.E.C. is taking its cue from criminal authorities, studying statistical formulas to trace connections, creating a powerful unit to cull tips and assign cases and even striking a deal with the Federal Bureau of Investigation to have agents embedded with the regulator.
"We were given a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to rethink what we do and how we do it," said Robert Khuzami, the agency's enforcement chief since 2009 and a former federal prosecutor who once was the general counsel of Deutsche Bank.
In one of the agency's first efforts, Mr. Khuzami and his boss, Mary L. Schapiro, the chairwoman, sought to tear down the agency's bureaucratic barriers. The S.E.C. had more than 70 tip lines, including e-mail and voice mail, but no central repository. To consolidate the tip system, Ms. Schapiro dispatched a top lieutenant, Stephen L. Cohen, to help create a database from scratch.
Now, all tips and referrals - regardless of the source - are put in a single database. S.E.C. employees must put a tip into the system within three days.
The agency also created an office to analyze and manage the tips, resembling the F.B.I.'s terrorist review center. Called the Office of Market Intelligence, the unit serves as a "point guard" for the agency - harvesting investigative tips, conducting preliminary investigation and passing on cases to enforcement lawyers.
To lead the effort, the S.E.C. selected one of its rising stars, Thomas A. Sporkin, whose father was the agency's enforcement director in the 1970s. Mr. Sporkin has built a team of more than 40 former traders, exchange experts, accountants and securities lawyers to sift through roughly 200 pieces of intelligence a day, distilling the hottest tips into a daily "intelligence report."
"It's the central intelligence office for the whole agency," Mr. Sporkin said.
The overhaul came with an upgrade in technology. The hub of Mr. Sporkin's outfit is a "market watch room," replete with Bloomberg terminals and real-time stock pricing monitors that keep an eye on the markets.
In a less conventional move, the group is working closely with the Justice Department to share data and connect investigative dots. An F.B.I. agent is assigned to assist Mr. Sporkin's team, sorting through potential cases to weed out bogus tips. The current agent, Bryan Smith, a former business consultant who specializes in white-collar fraud, can also tap into the F.B.I. database to see whether a subject has drawn past scrutiny.
As part of the shake-up, the S.E.C. has adopted several other Justice Department techniques. Following the lead of criminal authorities, the S.E.C. now offers leniency for cooperating witnesses who agree to give evidence against their co-conspirators, a strategy Mr. Khuzami has called a potential "game changer."
The F.B.I. has reaped benefits, too. Mr. Smith has access to all S.E.C. databases, offering a wealth of information about potential violators. Using tips from Mr. Sporkin's office, the bureau recently located a fugitive and has identified cooperating witnesses.
The two organizations walk a fine legal line. Federal law prohibits the F.B.I. from sharing certain information with civil regulators, including evidence from a grand jury. On occasion, embedded agents will use the S.E.C. database for their own classified investigations, without telling Mr. Sporkin the identity of the person being examined.
Mr. Sporkin said the agency had to be careful navigating the relationship, mindful that it was sharing proprietary data with another federal agency. "Given that the other agency is the F.B.I., we're willing to take that risk - we're more concerned with getting the bad guys," he said.
The new tactics appear to be bearing fruit. The S.E.C. filed a record 735 enforcement actions last fiscal year. One of the biggest wins was a $93 million insider trading sanction against the former hedge fund titan Raj Rajaratnam, the founder of the Galleon Group who was also convicted of related criminal charges.
But the new firepower does not always yield big game. One recent action involved a paralegal and her father who were accused of earning about $67,000 by trading on inside information.
Some critics also question whether the agency's intense focus on insider trading distracts from cases of greater significance to the economy and the financial system. Since the crisis, the agency has filed actions against several big banks but almost none against top executives running the firms. The agency points out, however, that it has sued 102 firms and individuals in cases tied to the crisis, including top executives at major mortgage firms.
"There are a lot of things that cause more harm to investors than insider trading," said James D. Cox, a professor at Duke Law School. "On the scale of abuses to investors, I put it at a 3."
The S.E.C. said that it created five units to track market abuse like insider trading and complex corners of Wall Street like hedge funds and derivatives. The agency also defends its emphasis on insider trading, saying that the crime destroys confidence in public markets, giving an upper hand to Wall Street's well-connected elite and putting average investors at a disadvantage.
As with much of the enforcement division, the market abuse unit, headed by Daniel M. Hawke, has taken a novel approach to insider trading cases. Rather than examining questionable trades in specific stocks, Mr. Hawke and his team now analyze suspicious traders and their network of connections on Wall Street. The investigators have turned to statistics, using tools like "cluster analysis" and "fuzzy matching," to identify relationships and trading patterns that sometimes went undetected.
"We are taking a more intelligent and proactive approach," said Mr. Hawke, a senior enforcement official who led the investigation into the $32 million insider trading scheme, one of the first significant actions to stem from the overhaul.
The new efforts paid off last year for the investigation, which started in the late 1990s, when Garrett Bauer popped up on the S.E.C.'s radar. But the agency, unable to find the source of the tips, hit a wall. In 2010, when the S.E.C. switched gears to use the trader-centered approach, the cold case began to heat up. The agency found that many of Mr. Bauer's trades had come ahead of mergers that were advised by Wilson Sonsini, the law firm of Matthew Kluger.
Investigators also noticed that Kenneth Robinson, who had been the go-between for decades, was trading in some of the same stocks as Mr. Bauer. And then the S.E.C. caught a crucial break: Mr. Robinson traded in two stocks linked to Wilson Sonsini.
Armed with the S.E.C.'s intelligence and other evidence, the F.B.I. raided Mr. Robinson's home. After that, Mr. Robinson began wearing a wire to ensnare his partners. The men spoke freely on tape, recorded by the F.B.I., under the impression that they had outsmarted federal authorities.
"It's going to kill them that they don't have enough," Mr. Kluger said on the recordings, referencing federal authorities. "They don't like to go to court without phone calls."
With the tapes, the three men confessed - and the government never had to go to trial. They are scheduled to be sentenced in the coming weeks.
