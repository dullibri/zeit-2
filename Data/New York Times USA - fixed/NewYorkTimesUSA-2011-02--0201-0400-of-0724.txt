HEADLINE: At Citi Field, Stains Are Not From the Grass

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN. 
E-mail: haberman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Citi Field, home of the New York Mets, is a pleasant stadium -- handsome, easily reached by public transportation, child-friendly and packed with diverting food choices in those all-too-frequent moments when the team itself loses its entertainment value. In fact, one of the few things that feel wrong with Citi Field is its name.
Make that: one of the few things that continue to feel wrong. Frowns have been abundant ever since the Mets, in 2006, accepted Citigroup's reported offer of $20 million a year for 20 years for the privilege of slapping its name on the stadium's facade. 
But a financial stain that now threatens the team reinforces why many noses have wrinkled in distaste over the choice.
The Mets' owners, Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz, stand accused in a lawsuit of having enriched themselves through their long and close connection to the execrable Bernard L. Madoff, whose Ponzi scheme, the lawsuit says, should have been evident to them. The trustee for Madoff victims, who is suing Messrs. Wilpon and Katz, seeks so much money from them, $1 billion, that their ability to hold onto the team has been thrown into doubt.
Both men call the trustee's tactics ''outrageous'' and his allegations unfounded. Mr. Wilpon has said that he was as much a victim of Mr. Madoff as anyone. But he and Mr. Katz are in trouble. They need money, and have already begun looking for someone to buy a minor share of their ball club.
No matter how the lawsuit plays out, the rancid air of impropriety now permeates the Wilpon-Katz Mets, unlikely to be cleansed soon, if ever. The situation is hardly improved by that name above the ballpark entrance.
Thanks to a bailout by American taxpayers, Citigroup has rebounded from its near-death experience in 2008. But it remains a symbol of all that went haywire on Wall Street and propelled the United States economy toward disaster.
Bad enough that the Mets' owners are enduringly scarred by their Madoff connection. By clinging to the Citi name, they are also saying they have no qualms about identifying themselves with a central player in one of the biggest financial debacles in this country's history.
Is this, some might wonder, truly good for New York?
Its taxpayers, remember, are on the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars that went into building this stadium and a companion ballpark for the Yankees, in the form of infrastructure improvements and tax-exempt financing. New Yorkers thus have a stake in what one of the city's most prominent structures is called.
Plenty of alternatives to the sullied Citi name have been suggested. (A favorite here remains Debits Field, but that sort of change is not about to happen.)
The name Shea Stadium served just fine for many years. There is no reason why it couldn't do so once again. The ballpark that went by that name may not have been the finest, but it had the advantage of honoring someone who did something that was actually useful. William A. Shea, a power broker of the first order five decades ago, helped bring National League baseball back to New York after the Giants and the Dodgers had fled to California.
The city cannot compel the team and Citigroup to agree to a divorce, amicable or otherwise. But as the Mets' landlord, the city could lean awfully hard. Our billionaire mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, would seem uniquely positioned to deal persuasively with others who dwell in the income stratosphere.
City Hall is disinclined to act, though. Its consistent policy has been that ''we're going to honor the lease agreement, which gives them the authority to designate a sponsor,'' said Frank Barry, a Bloomberg spokesman. ''Them'' referred to the team's owners.
Indeed, the city's lease with the Mets bestows on them ''the exclusive right to designate the name of the stadium,'' with a couple of exceptions. The sponsor's name or logo may not be obscene. ''Nor,'' the lease says, ''shall it be antithetical to the character of the stadium as a prominent symbol of the city.'' Purveyors of tobacco products -- don't forget who the mayor is -- are the only ones singled out as being antithetical.
It will have to be left to others, then, to decide if the behavior of Citigroup, which helped bring about the worst financial crisis in eight decades, meets the dictionary's definition of obscene as ''offensive to one's feelings, or to prevailing notions, of modesty or decency.''

HEADLINE: As Hoboken's Riverfront Crumbles, the Cost for Repairs Soars

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
In Hoboken's evolution from blue-collar port to upscale pocket of bistros and condominiums, the waterfront underwent the most profound transformation. Factories and docks gave way to promenades and parks with drop-dead views of Manhattan, drawing crowds that fed the nearby hotels and shops along the much-promoted Gold Coast.
So it is of real concern that much of that lovely, popular waterfront is falling apart. 
Several pieces of walkway, park and road along the Hudson River have collapsed, and engineers have discovered that a heavily used park needs major renovations to avoid the same fate. In the last few weeks, the cost estimate for repairs rose by millions of dollars that the city does not have. Yet these are not ancient structures: most were built in the 1990s, and in some cases neglected maintenance and unheeded warnings may have made matters worse.
''Our waterfront is the treasure of Hoboken, one of the basic pieces of our economy,'' said Dawn Zimmer, who has been mayor of the New Jersey city since 2009. ''Having to make major repairs to things that are barely 10 years old was not at all what I expected.''
Hoboken's tale is a variation on themes heard around the country -- politicians who preferred cutting ribbons on new projects to taking care of old ones, governments that spent their way into debt even when times were relatively good, and new executives taking office and finding that things were much worse than they realized.
There have been similar problems in other towns along the Hudson River Waterfront Walkway, conceived as an unbroken strip from the Bayonne Bridge to the George Washington Bridge, but they have been most pronounced in Hoboken.
''It seems almost criminal that it's come to this,'' said Helen S. Manogue, president of the Hudson River Waterfront Conservancy, which promotes the walkway project. ''It seems like nobody allowed for what a brutal environment the river is to build in -- not the towns, not the developers, not the engineers.''
A small piece of Hoboken's promenade caved in four years ago, at Castle Point Park. For a while, that seemed to be the extent of the damage, and in any case, the city had other crises looming.
Hoboken far outspent its revenue, City Council members accused the mayor of concealing a fiscal crisis, and some of its spending turned out to violate state law. In 2008, the state appointed a fiscal monitor to oversee the city's books, an indignity usually reserved for poor municipalities and school districts. Layoffs and a big property tax increase followed.
Ms. Zimmer became Council president in 2009, and rose to the city's highest office through what is, in New Jersey, a time-honored route: her predecessor was indicted. Peter J. Cammarano III, mayor for just a month, went to prison for taking illegal campaign contributions.
His was hardly an isolated case of corruption. The Hoboken mayor and the Hudson County executive who commissioned much of the waterfront improvement in the 1990s also served time. So did the developer who did some of that work, for paying bribes to the county executive.
Weeks after Ms. Zimmer took office -- she was elected in her own right in fall 2009 -- a chunk of Sinatra Field slumped into the river. The park, with a heavily used soccer field and riverfront walk, sits on century-old timbers that were riddled with shipworms, or teredos, tiny mollusks that bore into wood. Engineers had warned of this problem when the field was being developed in the 1990s and had recommended replacing the pilings, but that advice was disregarded.
''I think the attitude was, 'Well, we'll fix it later,' '' Ms. Manogue said.
Last February, another small piece of the promenade collapsed, near Weehawken Cove.
The city hired engineers to examine the damage, develop a repair plan and, while they were at it, take a look at Pier A, where another park was built in the '90s. That pier, just north of the train station and ferry terminal, sits on more than 1,000 steel beams that were encased in concrete down to the mud.
''We didn't have an inkling there would be a problem'' with the pier, Ms. Zimmer said, but the city decided an inspection would be prudent. ''Honestly, we expected it to be fine.''
It was not. The mud had receded below the concrete jackets, exposing the steel to corrosive salt water. There is no structural danger yet, but inspectors say that without repairs, there will be.
In October, a 50-foot stretch of Frank Sinatra Drive, the road alongside the river, caved in. There had already been two smaller collapses on that road, which had been built 13 years before.
Groups that have promoted walkway development hesitate to lay blame, in part because there are so many places it could go. Sinatra Field was built by the City of Hoboken, Pier A was restored by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the drive was built by the county, other towns handled their own waterfront projects and the State Department of Environmental Protection reviewed and approved them all.
Last year, Hoboken approved a $12 million bond sale to pay for its share of waterfront rehabilitation. But in January, a firm hired by the city, Boswell Engineering, said the price would be closer to $20 million -- this in a city with a total budget of about $100 million.
Now Hoboken has to figure out what to do. Officials want to repair Sinatra Field, but moving it inland might be cheaper. There seems to be no way around the expensive business of shoring up Pier A and the walkway, but Ms. Zimmer said she held out hope for state and federal aid.
The mayor also wants to create a schedule and a budget for the kind of routine inspection and maintenance that would prevent more unpleasant surprises. But she refused to express any anger or frustration about how the city reached this point.
''I can't go back in time and change the decisions that people made,'' she said. ''I just hope we've learned that it's more cost-effective to act for the long term.''

HEADLINE: Copper Prices and Incidences of Copper Theft Rise

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

 BODY:
Thieves broke into a muffler shop in Chillicothe, Ohio, and stole cash -- and 130 catalytic converters. Pervasive thefts of copper wire from under the streets of Fresno, Calif., have prompted the city to seal thousands of its manhole covers with concrete. And in Picher, Okla., someone felled the town's utility poles with chain saws, allowing thieves to abscond with 3,000 feet of wire while causing a blackout.
Near-record prices for copper, platinum, aluminum and other metals have spurred a resurgence in the past several months in the theft of common items that in better economic times might be overlooked -- among them, catalytic converters from automobiles and copper wiring that is being stripped out of overhead power lines, tornado warning sirens, coal mines and foreclosed homes, where thieves sometimes tear down walls to get to copper pipes and wiring. The thieves then make quick money by selling the items to scrap yards. 
The thefts have proved difficult to stop for overmatched law enforcement agencies and have been a costly nuisance to public utilities, which have been forced to spend millions of dollars on repairs and security.
From Hawaii to Florida, thieves have electrocuted themselves and caused electrical and telephone failures and street light blackouts. Many municipalities, which have been hard hit by budget deficits, have been unable to afford repairs.
Highways in some states have remained darkened for months. In California, where copper wire theft appears to be most rampant, according to law enforcement officials, Little League baseball fields have gone dark because the wiring was stolen from the lights.
''We believe this is a national security issue,'' said Bryan Jacobs, executive director of the Coalition Against Copper Theft, an advocacy group in Washington that includes telecommunications firms, power companies and railroads. ''The only thing keeping it from being an epidemic is that scrap yards are now scrutinizing the material. But theft is still rampant.''
The ebb and flow in the thefts over the past several years appear to be tied to the movement in international commodity markets. Copper, for instance, is near an all-time high, which has translated into $4-a-pound prices for scrap copper at salvage yards. The price in 2009 was about $1.25 a pound.
''If you watch the price of copper, you notice a correlation between the price and the rate of theft,'' said Lynne Monaco, security director for Frontier Communications, which has seen an increase in thefts of its power and broadband lines in the 27 states it serves.
Platinum is now trading at about $1,800 an ounce; rhodium at about $2,400 an ounce; and palladium, at more than $800 an ounce. Catalytic converters, a component of an automobile's exhaust system, contain trace amounts of one of the three precious metals. The metals help cleanse emissions by turning toxic gases into less harmful exhaust at high temperatures.
In December, the Ohio Department of Insurance warned about a rash of catalytic converter thefts in the state. ''It's a $200 or $300 payday for a minute's worth of work,'' said Jarrett Dunbar, a spokesman for the state's insurance commission.
The F.B.I. has said it considers theft of copper wire to be a threat to the nation's baseline ability to function. Last month, the agency said it was planning to update a 2008 report that called the crime a threat to the nation's ''critical infrastructure.''
Several states have enacted laws in the past few years to combat the theft of copper and catalytic converters. Some cities have taken particularly strong measures.
Fresno had been losing nearly $1 million a year to copper wire thefts before it began shuttering its utility covers with concrete.
''At one point, for every street light we would repair, five more would go out because of wire theft -- that's the pace of the battle we were losing,'' said Patrick N. Wiemiller, director of public works in Fresno. ''We can't sneeze away $75,000 a month, especially as a self-insured city.''
California enacted a law in 2009 requiring people selling copper wire or catalytic converters at scrap yards to be photographed, have their driver's license copied and wait at least three days for payment. Georgia and Oregon have approved similar laws.
Other states, including Florida, Hawaii, Michigan and Oklahoma, have elevated the illegal possession of a large amount of copper wire to a felony. In Arizona, the purchase or sale of individual catalytic converters by most people is now illegal.
But whether the flurry of new legislation has reduced thefts is unclear.
''Our goal was to completely stop copper theft,'' said State Representative Guy Liebmann, who wrote Oklahoma's law. ''It pretty much has done that, but this is like trying to pass a law to stop people texting from their cars. It's not easy to stop. I think we've done all we can.''
Salvage yard owners say the primary flaw in the laws is that local police forces lack the time to monitor every scrap business, which larger business owners insist gives smaller firms a competitive edge.
''The problem is that everybody has to go by the law or it gives an unfair advantage to the smaller guys, who are going ahead and buying it,'' said Matt White, general manager of Yaffe Iron & Metal in Muskogee, Okla. ''It has hurt our business.''
Utility companies have taken their own preventive measures, including offering rewards of as much as $10,000 and painting copper wire to make it less valuable as scrap.
The American Electrical Power Company in Ohio said it had begun to replace its copper wire with wire that contains less copper and is also more difficult to cut through. The company has also put up signs letting prospective thieves know that the new brand of wire is not worth stealing.
''The new wire has no scrap value, and nobody has been able to cut through it,'' said Pat Hemlepp, a company spokesman. ''But we don't know whether it has been successful in reducing thefts because traditional copper thefts are continuing.''

HEADLINE: Borrowing by Consumers Rose 3% in December

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Americans are beginning to charge more on credit cards after two years of cutting back, a sign of more confidence in the economy. 
The first increase in credit card use in 27 months helped raise overall consumer borrowing 3 percent in December, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $2.41 trillion, the latest report from the Federal Reserve said. It was the third consecutive monthly gain.
Borrowing in the category that includes credit cards rose 3.5 percent. Borrowing for auto loans increased 2.8 percent.
Analysts had expected an increase in total borrowing in December, reflecting strength in auto loans. But they did not predict a rise in credit card debt. Auto sales and overall retail sales increased in December. Retailers had their best holiday shopping season in four years.
Even with the December gains, consumer borrowing was only 0.7 percent higher than the more than three-year low hit in September. It is 6.6 percent below the high reached in July 2008.
Households began borrowing less and saving more after the country fell into a recession in December 2007. The decline in borrowing has damped growth because consumer spending accounts for 70 percent of economic activity.
Economists predict that consumers will gradually increase borrowing this year. However, they do not expect Americans will borrow at the pace reached in the middle of the last decade. At that time, soaring home prices made homeowners feel wealthier than they were, and that encouraged more borrowing and spending.

HEADLINE: Reuters Names Ex-BusinessWeek Editor to Lead News Service

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stephen J. Adler, who left the top editing job at BusinessWeek when Bloomberg L.P. took over the magazine in 2009, was named editor in chief on Monday of the Reuters News service. 
Thomson Reuters Corporation, the news and information provider that owns Reuters, said that Mr. Adler had been named to the position effective immediately.
He is taking over from David A. Schlesinger, who after four years at the helm is becoming chairman of Thomson Reuters China.
Mr. Adler spent 16 years at The Wall Street Journal before serving as editor in chief of BusinessWeek for more than four years. He stepped down in December 2009 after Bloomberg bought the weekly and handed the reins to Josh Tyrangiel, then deputy managing editor of Time magazine.
Thomson Reuters hired Mr. Adler last year to recruit and lead a team of reporters in developing news services for the company's legal, tax and accounting, and health care and science divisions.
The company, which is based in New York, said Mr. Adler would now integrate that team with the rest of Reuters News. In addition, as executive vice president of news for the company, he will oversee Thomson Reuters's entire news strategy and operation.
Thomson Reuters has been slowly recovering from the economic downturn, which put a squeeze on the financial companies and law firms that subscribe to its services. The company's markets division, which suffered the worst of the recession as the hard-hit financial sector shed jobs, had a modest uptick during the third quarter. That division includes products like trading terminals and the Reuters news service.
The company will report its fourth-quarter and fiscal 2010 results on Thursday. Shares fell 50 cents to close at $41.45.

HEADLINE: Ex-Dow Scientist Is Convicted Of Selling Secrets in China

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW

 BODY:
A jury in Baton Rouge, La., on Monday found a former Dow Chemical scientist guilty of conspiring to steal company secrets and sell them to firms in China, the Justice Department said. 
Evidence at the three-week trial showed that the scientist, Liu Wen, 74, also paid a $50,000 bribe to a Dow employee to supply materials about how the company made a polymer used in automotive hoses, jackets for electrical cables and vinyl siding.
The conviction illustrates what federal authorities have described as a growing threat in the competition with China for an economic edge. As nations like China broaden efforts to obtain technology, they have increasingly been able to buy secrets from current and former insiders at big American companies.
Another former Dow Chemical scientist, Huang Kexue, is awaiting trial in Indiana on more serious charges that he engaged in economic espionage in sharing some of Dow's insecticide secrets with Chinese researchers.
Over the last year and a half, charges involving the theft of trade secrets have been filed against former engineers from General Motors and Ford Motor. Scientists at DuPont and Valspar, a Minnesota paint company, recently pleaded guilty to stealing their employers' secrets after taking jobs in China.
Justice Department officials said the conspiracy led by Mr. Liu, of Houston, unfolded over at least eight years.
Trial testimony indicated that Mr. Liu, also known as David W. Liou, began the conspiracy in 1995 and that it ran through 2003. Justice Department officials said he sold the secrets for more than $500,000 and was negotiating to sell them for $4 million before authorities uncovered the scheme.
Justice Department officials said Mr. Liu was a research scientist at Dow from 1965 until he retired in 1992. He worked with the polymer, Tyrin CPE, at a company plant in Plaquemine, La.
Mr. Liu's lawyer, C. Frank Holthaus, said his client had not stolen anything and witnesses had lied about his activities.
The government presented evidence that after Mr. Liu left the company, he paid the $50,000 bribe to a Dow worker to obtain a manual describing Dow's process for making the polymer. He also made payments to two other co-conspirators that prosecutors did not describe as bribes.
Prosecutors said Mr. Liu traveled extensively in China to sell the information. Dow executives testified that the company had spent substantial money to develop the technology and had taken steps to protect it.

HEADLINE: Time to Tighten Loose Money

BYLINE: By IAN CAMPBELL and LISA LEE

 BODY:
The stagflationists are losing the argument. The world is inflating and that's a worry. But inflation is coming from growth that seems increasingly strong and from money that's looking far too loose for a reviving world. The risk is that oil and other commodities will soar much higher now, as they did in 2008, only this time the spike may not recede quickly.
The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, cannot be held responsible for social unrest in developing countries. But there's a link between ultra-loose money and global asset prices. The Fed has successfully pursued an ultra-loose monetary policy to help avert a second depression. But the $600 billion printing looks like a precautionary overdose whose inflationary influence is widespread. 
Oil at close to $100 a barrel is injecting inflation into the world economy. Political unrest is a secondary factor. Food and other commodity prices -- less sensitive to Middle East unrest -- are also surging. Global price increases are now a big risk.
The cause? Most Western economies are out of their hole and joining in emerging economies' growth fest. January's report from the Institute for Supply Management on the huge services sector of the United States economy showed the strongest figure in six years.
There are problems here for both developed and developing economies. As Charles Bean, deputy governor of the Bank of England, said last week, if external inflation is very strong, then the central bank will have little choice but to clamp down harder on domestic sources of inflation, even in a still weakly recovering economy like Britain. The president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, talked down expectations of a rate increase, suggesting that energy-driven inflation would be transitory. If the world is indeed gathering steam, he may be wrong.
Australia's central bank has just raised its growth forecast for the coming years. Rates are rising around the globe. China, India and Brazil have tightened. So, too, has Indonesia. The West will have to follow. For inflated asset markets there will be risks. But the shift from ultra-loose to tighter monetary policy is going to have to happen soon.
Danaher Dealing
Danaher has snatched the medical group Beckman Coulter for $5.8 billion, outbidding buyout firms in the process. The deal shows that despite relatively easy credit, private equity isn't the only acquirer that can pay up.
With private equity for competition, Danaher wasn't going to nab Beckman on the cheap. Big-name buyout consortiums were involved, including a Blackstone and TPG combo and another team of Apollo and the Carlyle Group. Those people these days can borrow as much as seven times a target company's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
That's why Danaher is paying a 45 percent premium to Beckman's value back in December. Despite that, though, the deal works -- a lesson in how a different kind of buyer can sometimes win auctions. Danaher isn't quite the traditional strategic player. Over the years, it has collected a big portfolio of companies in all kinds of industries, including network analyzers and makers of microscopes and hand tools. Though all those deals were far smaller than the Beckman deal, it has made more than 50 acquisitions since 2007. That suggests financial engineering skills alongside a strategic interest in Beckman.
Here's how the numbers stack up. With relatively little debt on its balance sheet, Danaher can afford to borrow 60 percent of the enterprise value of the deal. It will pay for the rest with cash and by selling new equity, helping to maintain its credit rating and flexibility.
So far, so good. But it's hard to see how Danaher could have beaten more highly leveraged buyout barons. Cost cuts with the company's existing businesses make the difference. After tax at Danaher's recent rate of around 20 percent, these have a present value of around $2 billion. That more than covers the deal premium of about $1.8 billion.
Together with a purchase of a company at a lower valuation multiple than its own -- roughly eight times forecast Ebitda for Beckman this year, against 11 times for Danaher -- that means the buyer will see increased earnings without giving away the farm on price. No wonder investors took the unusual step of giving the acquirer's shares a boost as well as the target's.

HEADLINE: Checkpoint Intelligence

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
One reason airport security measures frustrate travelers is that screening procedures tend to treat all passengers the same: as potential terrorists.
But in the wake of the furor last fall over pat-downs and body scanners, several industry organizations are working on proposals to overhaul security checkpoints to provide more or less scrutiny based on the risk profile of each traveler.
While the proposals are in the early stages, they represent a growing consensus around a concept that has the support of John S. Pistole, the head of the Transportation Security Administration: divide travelers into three groups -- trusted, regular or risky -- and apply different screening techniques based on what is known about the passengers. 
''Today we have T.S.A. agents looking at TV screens, but they don't know anything about the person going through the system,'' said Steve Lott, a spokesman for the International Air Transport Association. ''The idea is to take data that the government and the airlines are already collecting about passengers and bring it to the checkpoint.''
A crucial part of the group's ''checkpoint of the future'' proposal, and similar plans under discussion by other industry organizations, is creating a trusted traveler program that would allow passengers to undergo a background check to gain access to an expedited security lane at the airport.
These trusted travelers would probably pay a fee for the vetting, much like the $100 application fee for the Global Entry program operated by United States Customs and Border Protection. After submitting to an interview, a background check and a fingerprint scan to join Global Entry, members can clear customs using a kiosk instead of waiting to speak with an agent.
''Our security apparatus has already acknowledged that we can create trusted traveler programs,'' said Geoff Freeman, executive vice president of the U.S. Travel Association. ''Let's expand on that.''
The association, a trade group, plans to release its own proposal for ways to improve security checkpoints next month, but many of its core concepts overlap with ideas presented by the International Air Transport Association at an industry conference last year.
Both groups envision three screening lanes with different security procedures based on varying levels of risk. Trusted travelers would undergo lighter screening, perhaps passing through a metal detector with their shoes on and laptops in their bags, whereas anyone flagged as potentially risky would receive more intensive scrutiny, using technology like the body scanners and interviews with officers trained in behavioral analysis.
Although many of the procedural details are still just proposals, the idea is to determine who may present a risk based on better use of government intelligence and watch lists as well as suspicious behaviors like checking in for a one-way international flight with no luggage.
Travelers in the middle group -- neither vetted nor risky -- would receive an intermediate level of screening, but ideally the process would be quicker than current procedures because suspicious passengers would be diverted to a separate lane.
Making the screening process more efficient is the major goal of both trade associations, based on concerns that as the economy improves and passenger traffic increases, security lines will slow down, deterring people from traveling. Whether more invasive procedures like pat-downs and body scanners are discouraging air travel is open to debate, but there is a growing consensus that 10 years after the Transportation Security Administration was created, it is time to re-evaluate the agency's strategy.
In remarks to the American Bar Association in January, Mr. Pistole expressed a need to formulate a vision for transportation security, mentioning a trusted traveler program as an option under consideration and expressing an openness to other suggestions.
''If people have ideas, he wants to hear them because he's looking at ways to make changes,'' a T.S.A. spokesman, Nicholas Kimball, said.
In response to concerns about the body scanners, the agency last week demonstrated software it was testing at Las Vegas McCarran International Airport that allowed the machines to display a generic outline of a human figure rather than the graphic images some passengers view as a privacy invasion.
The agency has also responded to pilots' concerns about escalating security measures by expediting the screening process for crew members, based on their trusted status and the background checks they undergo as a condition of their employment. The Air Line Pilots Association is also calling for a more risk-based approach to screening, not just for the crew but also for passengers.
There is growing support for this type of approach, even on a global level. The International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations body that helps establish aviation policies for 190 member countries, has convened a working group to make recommendations about security screening procedures. A trusted traveler program is one idea on the table, said Jim Marriott, head of the organization's aviation security branch.
While there is support for more standardized practices around the world -- rather than a hodgepodge of rules about liquids and laptops -- Mr. Marriott cautioned that countries had different security needs, capabilities and resources.
''There are also some hard realities that we have to recognize in the security world about the protection of personal information and sensitivities to individual rights,'' he said.
Another issue is the cost of escalating security measures, and how much taxpayers and travelers are willing to spend to feel safe in the air.
''We need strong high-level leadership that levels with the public and says, 'Look, you cannot expect perfection out of any security system,' '' said Robert Poole, director of transportation policy at the Reason Foundation.
For years, Mr. Poole has advocated for a more risk-based approach to aviation security, including some type of trusted traveler program. Now there finally seems to be more support to make it happen, he said.
''For the first time since 9/11, I think we have the conditions where it might be politically possible to have a serious debate about it,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Distinct Mix Holds On In a Corner Of China

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS; Hilda Wang contributed research.

 BODY:
MACAO -- Long before words like ''multiculturalism'' and ''fusion cuisine'' entered the modern lexicon, Aida de Jesus and her forebears were mashing up food, language and DNA from far-flung corners of the globe.
A 95-year-old chef whose ancestry is drawn from Goa, Malacca and other former outposts of the Portuguese empire, Senhora de Jesus, as she prefers to be called, grew up celebrating Christmas and Chinese New Year with meals that relied on Portuguese sausage, bok choy and galinha cafreal, a chicken dish with an African pedigree. She spoke Portuguese at school, Cantonese on the street and a lively creole known as Patua with ''the girls.''
''We Macanese are always mixing it up,'' Senhora de Jesus said with a giggle, speaking in English, as she sat in the restaurant her family has run for decades. ''We are very adaptable.'' 
But these days the Macanese -- as this former Portuguese colony's mixed-race residents are called -- are swimming against a demographic tide that threatens to subsume their rich cultural cocktail. Always outnumbered by the Chinese migrants and Portuguese traders who crammed into this densely settled speck in the Pearl River Delta, the Macanese who stayed after Beijing took back the territory in 1999 are decidedly in the minority. Fewer than 10,000 Macanese reside here; by contrast, Macao's population of 500,000 is about 95 percent Chinese and rising.
''There are probably more Macanese living in California and Canada than Macao,'' said Miguel de Senna Fernandes, a lawyer and playwright whose father, something of a local cultural institution, chronicled the lives of ordinary Macanese in a series of novels. ''Now that we are part of China, we are facing a very absorbing, overpowering force.''
Not that Mr. Fernandes is giving up. In addition to organizing social events through his group, the Macaenses Association, he has also emerged as the Don Quixote of Patua, which is listed by Unesco as an endangered language. He helped publish a dictionary of Patua expressions, and for the past 18 years he has staged an annual play that revives what local people call ''doci papiacam,'' or sweet speech, a stew of archaic Portuguese, Malay and Singhalese spiced with English, Dutch and Japanese, and more recently, a large helping of Cantonese.
Mr. Fernandes, 50, traces his fascination with Patua to his grandmother, who would slip into it when gossiping with friends during ''cha gordo,'' or fat tea, a typically Macanese interpretation of English high tea whose overabundance of Malaysian noodles, codfish fritters and custard tarts explains the fat.
''Drawn by their laughter, I would hide in the corner and later ask my grandmother about expressions I'd never heard before,'' he said. More often than not they were unsuitable for an 8-year-old's ears but his grandmother would oblige with sanitized translations, followed by an admonishment to stick to studying proper Portuguese.
''The old-timers considered Patua broken or bad Portuguese,'' he said, ''but since then I've been hooked.''
The language is among the last of the creoles that once flourished in the constellation of ports that made up Portugal's Asian and African holdings. Unlike British colonizers who maintained some distance from their subjects in Hong Kong, just an hour's ferry trip from Macao, the Portuguese frequently married local women who then converted to Catholicism.
Alan Baxter, a linguist at the University of Macao and an expert on Portuguese-based creoles, said the roots of Patua extend back to the 16th century, when Portuguese traders and their camp followers did business with Africans, Indians and Malays, then sailed onward to other colonies in the empire.
''Imagine if you went somewhere new and were deprived of knowledge of a local language and merely picked up the useful bits you heard to get yourself fed,'' he said, explaining its evolution.
The Cantonese contributions to Patua came much later, starting in the late 19th century, after the walls dividing Macao's Portuguese and Chinese quarters were torn down and the two groups began to mingle.
These days Macanese give their laundry to a ''mainato'' -- from the southern Indian language Malayalam -- and they address their beloveds as ''amo chai,'' a mix of the Portuguese ''amor'' and the Cantonese expression for ''little one.'' Verbs are unconjugated, nouns are repeated to suggest the plural and words are sometimes assembled in a way that mimics the structure of classic Chinese idioms.
Early on this language served the mixed-blood Macanese well, fostering their role as a bridge between Macao's Portuguese rulers and its predominantly Chinese inhabitants. More recently, after they began sending their children to Portuguese schools, the Macanese became indispensable as managers and bureaucrats. By the time China took over administration of the enclave after more than 400 years of Portuguese rule, the Macanese dominated the territory's civil service.
Although most visitors these days are quickly sucked into Macao's casinos -- among them The Venetian, one of the world's largest -- those who wander the city's narrow cobblestone streets are struck by the effortless coexistence of Orient and Occident. Incense-suffused Buddhist temples, pastel Baroque churches, Portuguese bakeries and dried shark fin dispensaries are crammed together without complaint.
That same intermingling plays out in the lives of the Macanese, many of whom are devoted Catholics but give their children small red envelopes of cash on the Lunar New Year. Come Mid-Autumn Festival, another Chinese holiday, they take to the streets with rabbit-shaped lanterns.
''Many of us have been educated in Europe, but no Macanese would dare move to a new house without consulting a feng shui expert,'' said Carlos Marreiros, an architect who designed the Macao pavilion at the 2010 Shanghai World Expo. ''I'm a Christian but I also believe God is a big ocean and all the rivers of religion are running to meet him.''
In the years leading up to the transfer to China, thousands of apprehensive Macanese left, with many settling in Portugal. But over the past decade, as Beijing stayed true to its promise to give Macao 50 years of relative autonomy, the emigration has slowed and a small but steady number have returned.
One irresistible draw has been breakneck economic growth, mostly spurred by gambling and construction, which last year helped drive 20 percent growth in the economy. Fueled by players from the mainland, Macao's gambling revenue is now quadruple that of the Las Vegas Strip.
The impact on local people has been mixed. A law that bars nonresidents from working as croupiers and dealers has helped deliver well-paid jobs but it has unexpectedly drained schools of teachers. The lure has also been irresistible to young people, a growing number of whom are dropping out of high school or skipping college to head straight to the casino floor.
All that prosperity has brought other downsides as well: frenzied real estate speculation is pricing local people out of the housing market. The sleepy Macao that many once held dear is increasingly subsumed by the horn-honking and manic rhythms commonly associated with Hong Kong.
''Everything is happening very fast: construction is fast, business is fast and everyone is more stressed,'' said Jose Sales Marques, 55, the enclave's last Portuguese mayor, who now works to promote better ties between Macao and Europe. ''Prosperity is wonderful, but at the end of the day all that money can't buy you a culture and an identity.''
Filomeno Jorge is determined to keep alive one strand of that identity. Every Wednesday he rustles up the seven other members of his band, Tuna Macaense, to run through a startlingly diverse repertory that includes Portuguese fados, Cantonese ballads and Filipino pop songs. The mainstays, however, are vintage Patua, some dating from 1935, when the band was first established by Jose dos Santos Ferreira, a poet and lyricist widely credited with bringing cultural legitimacy to the Macanese dialect.
At one time, Tuna Macaense had three dozen members and the band was known for making unannounced visits at weddings and birthday parties. ''They would travel on foot through the streets because Macao so small,'' said Mr. Jorge, a security manager at the MGM Macau who joined the band 25 years ago. ''We can't do that now because there is too much traffic.''
Although Tuna Macaense is blessed with frequent gigs, Mr. Jorge, 54, is increasingly preoccupied with finding new blood for the band, a quest that has so far been unsuccessful.
''All of us in the band are over 50,'' he said. ''After we die, our music will die, and I can't let that happen.''

HEADLINE: Obama Presses Business Leaders to Hire and Invest

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama urged American businesses on Monday to ''get in the game'' by letting loose trillions of dollars that they are holding in reserve, saying that they can help create a ''virtuous cycle'' of more sales, higher demand and greater profits that will put people back to work.
''If there is a reason you don't believe that this is the time to get off the sidelines -- to hire and invest -- I want to know about it. I want to fix it,'' Mr. Obama said in a speech to business leaders at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
In the speech, Mr. Obama pledged to eliminate unneeded regulations and simplify the tax code, but said companies had responsibilities to help the economy recover.
''Ultimately, winning the future is not just about what the government can do to help you succeed,'' he said. ''It's about what you can do to help America succeed.''
The president's comments came as he sought to reassure members of the business community that he was not their adversary and to mend fences with their forceful lobbying advocate in Washington.
''I'm here in the interest of being more neighborly,'' Mr. Obama said, alluding to the contentious relationship he has had with the Chamber of Commerce over the past two years. ''I strolled over from across the street, and, look, maybe if we had brought over a fruitcake when I first moved in, we would have gotten off to a better start. But I'm going to make up for it.''
The chamber has fiercely opposed most of Mr. Obama's health care and banking agenda and spent more than $50 million during last year's midterm elections to cast the president and his party as anti-business and a threat to capitalism.
But the chamber, too, is eager to tone down the rhetoric, according to senior officials there. At the height of the high-profile fight with the White House, several big-name companies left its board, citing concern about the chamber's opposition to the administration's efforts.
Thomas J. Donohue, the Chamber of Commerce's president, has in the past warned of a ''regulatory tsunami'' that will result from Mr. Obama's policies. In particular, he told reporters after the November elections last year that the health care law would produce hundreds of new burdens on American businesses.
But in introducing Mr. Obama, Mr. Donohue emphasized his group's desire to work with the administration in areas where they might agree. Those include increasing free trade and exports, investing in technology and infrastructure and reducing the nation's debt.
''I reaffirm the American business community's absolute commitment to working with you and your administration to advancing our shared priorities,'' Mr. Donohue said.
Mr. Obama's remarks reflected the careful effort of a White House eager to seem more pro-business but anxious about the accusations of betrayal by some of the Democratic president's most liberal allies.
The president's basic message to the business community -- ''I get it,'' he said of the profit-making imperative -- was joined with an admonition that corporate America must feel some sense of duty as well. That effort to walk a political line appeared to please neither side completely on Monday.
Mr. Obama's suggestion that businesses can help the economy recover by spending their reserves was met with skepticism by some in the audience. Harold Jackson, a executive at Buffalo Supply Inc., a medical supply company, called it naive.
''Any business person has to look at the demand to their company for their product and services, and make hiring decisions,'' Mr. Jackson said. ''I think it's a little outside the bounds to suggest that if we hire people we don't need, there will be more demand.''
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader in the Senate, said in remarks Monday that ''we'll just have to wait and see whether the administration's actions support its rhetoric.'' Mr. McConnell urged Mr. Obama to prove his intentions to help the business community by doing more to push free trade agreements with Colombia and Panama.
At the same time, Mr. Obama's decision to address the chamber in the first place has upset liberal groups, who say the president is consorting with the very forces they believe have worked to undercut his policies.
Public Citizen, a liberal group in Washington, issued a statement condemning the president's comment that he would ''go anywhere'' in the world to promote trade, a line that prompted one of the few moments of applause from the crowd of business leaders.
''It's unclear what is more mortifying: President Barack Obama choosing the club of America's notorious job-offshorers to talk about the importance of creating American jobs, or his rallying of his fiercest political opponents to help him overcome the majority of Americans who oppose more-of-the-same job-killing trade agreements,'' said Lori Wallach, the director of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch.
Erica Payne, the founder of the Agenda Project, a liberal organization in New York, said: ''Two weeks ago, the president promised that he would work to rebuild people's faith in government. Meeting with the biggest lobbyists in the country is hardly a step in the right direction.''
In an interview after Mr. Obama's speech, Ms. Payne said the president's speech had ''many words, little content.''

HEADLINE: Sudan Leader to Accept Secession of South

BYLINE: By JOSH KRON

 BODY:
KAMPALA, Uganda -- With the announcement of final voting results, President Omar Hassan al-Bashir of Sudan said Monday that his government would accept the choice of the long-embattled region of southern Sudan to separate from the north, setting the stage for the creation of the world's newest country this summer.
According to the final count, announced in Sudan's capital, Khartoum, 98.83 percent of the more than 3.8 million registered voters in southern Sudan chose to separate from the north. In many parts of the country the vote was over 99 percent. 
Sudan has endured two long and brutal civil wars between the Arab north and the mostly animist and Christian south, in a period from the early years of independence from Britain to 2005, when a peace agreement was signed, setting the stage for the referendum.
Both President Bashir and the southern region's president, Salva Kiir, were in attendance for the announcement as street celebrations spread through the southern capital, Juba.
''Today we received these results and we accept and welcome these results because they represent the will of the southern people,'' Mr. Bashir said in a statement on state television, according to Reuters.
He also said that along with southern independence would come an Islamist renaissance in the north.
In Washington, the White House released a statement by President Obama congratulating the people of southern Sudan and announcing ''the intention of the United States to formally recognize southern Sudan as a sovereign, independent state in July 2011.''
Mr. Obama also offered to the government of Sudan the prospect of improved ties with the United States, saying, ''For those who meet all of their obligations, there is a path to greater prosperity and normal relations with the United States, including examining Sudan's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism.''
With the referendum vote now official, actual independence is expected to be declared July 9, when the peace agreement that set the stage for the vote expires.
Across the vast, African, oil-producing south, voters overwhelming chose to secede from the Arab north, which through conflict and marginalization helped keep the south one of the poorest and least-developed regions in the world.
In the frontier Unity State, nearly 500,000 people voted -- but only 90 voted for unity with the north.
In Juba the day was met with jubilation. ''This is what people have been expecting, and longed for, and have achieved it,'' said Aleu Garang Aleu, a spokesman for the southern referendum bureau. ''People will party. There will be disco. There will be dances. People are warming up for the celebration now.''
Thousands of Sudanese from around the world, particularly the United States, who fled during the years of war, have returned home to rebuild the south, and Juba is considered one of the fastest-growing cities in the world.
Now the south will have to focus on the intricate process of formally disentangling itself from the north.
On Monday the government said that it had plans to build a brand-new capital for the soon-to-be-country, and that designs had already been submitted. The southern information minister, Benjamin Marial, said: ''The present capitals of Africa were established by colonial administrations. It was not established by the citizens themselves.''
Last month the government announced that an official name for the country -- South Sudan -- had been proposed.
But issues regarding citizenship, oil-revenue rights and the contested and volatile region of Abyei remain unresolved. Furthermore, both the southern and northern armies have failed to demobilize tens of thousands of soldiers.
According to the 2005 agreement that ended the civil war, integrated units of soldiers from both the north and south patrol particular points in the region.
But last week, clashes exploded between soldiers within some of the integrated units stationed in the frontier state of Upper Nile, killing at least 50. Mr. Bashir, who has been in power nearly 18 years, faces many of the same economic pressures as does President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, where protests threaten his government.
Protests broke out in Khartoum on Jan. 30, and plans for more have appeared on Facebook.
Mr. Bashir is also wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of atrocities committed in the Darfur region of Sudan.

HEADLINE: Berkshire Hathaway Agrees to Pay $548 Million for the Rest of Wesco Financial

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
Berkshire Hathaway, the holding company led by Warren E. Buffett, has agreed to buy the remaining shares of Wesco Financial Corporation, one of its largest subsidiaries, for $547.6 million in stock and cash, the companies announced Monday. 
The ties between the companies run deep. The relationship started in the early 1970s when Berkshire indirectly invested roughly $30 million in Wesco; Berkshire has owned an 80.1 percent share since 1983. Wesco, which is based Pasadena, Calif., is run by Charles T. Munger, Berkshire's vice chairman and Mr. Buffett's longtime business partner.
In many ways, Wesco is a small version of Berkshire. While it focuses mainly on insurance, Wesco operates other businesses, including a furniture rental company and a steel service center.
Mr. Munger, like Mr. Buffett, is known for his folksy investment wisdom, which he doles out at the annual meetings of Berkshire and Wesco and has collected in a book, ''Poor Charlie's Almanack.''
''This book is something of a publishing miracle - never advertised, yet year after year selling many thousands of copies from its Internet site,'' Mr. Buffett wrote of Mr. Munger's book in his letter to Berkshire shareholders last year.
The deal would mean an end to Wesco's highly anticipated yearly meeting. But Mr. Munger, 87, promises to hold an ''Afternoon With Charlie'' if the deal is consummated by early June, according to the deal announcement. The event would give investors in both companies a chance to ask him ''about business, economics and life,'' albeit not about Wesco, the announcement said.
The deal has been expected for months. Berkshire announced its plans to buy the remaining 19.9 percent of Wesco's common stock in September. At the time, Wesco's board formed a committee of independent directors, which concluded that the purchase was fair and in the best interests of shareholders. The acquisition is expected to close by the end of the second quarter.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Conversation With Tobias Moskowitz

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: A University of Chicago professor, the co-author of a new book, brings an economist's eye to the world of sports.

 BODY:
Tobias Moskowitz and L. Jon Wertheim became friends at a summer camp in Michigan 27 years ago. Mr. Moskowitz became an economist at the University of Chicago. Mr. Wertheim became a Sports Illustrated writer. They remained friends and ultimately decided to collaborate on a book that combined their two fields. It's called "Scorecasting" (Random House) and it tries to bring the empirical approach of economics to the world of sports.
You can read an excerpt of the book here. I sat down with Mr. Moskowitz at the recent academic economists' conference in Denver, and we continued our discussion by e-mail. If you've already read the book, you may want to jump to my final question, in which I ask him to respond to a couple of criticisms that reviewers made.
Mr. Moskowitz: You're right that most teams -- in all professional sports -- have attendance that is very sensitive to won-loss records. Not the Cubs. The Cubs have the lowest attendance sensitivity in all of Major League Baseball and perhaps in all professional sports. When the Cubs lose more games, attendance at Wrigley hardly budges. Contrast this with their South Side counterparts the White Sox, who have a very high attendance sensitivity to wins. A great example is what happened after the White Sox won the World Series in 2005. Their attendance rose to 90 percent of seating capacity the following year, which was unprecedented for them. The Cubs that same year would finish dead last in their division, yet posted attendance equal to 94 percent of their capacity. Why are the Cubs so insensitive to wins and losses? The answer is incentives.If you've been to Wrigley, you know it is probably the best party in M.L.B. For decades, in fact, the Cubs have always marketed the Wrigley experience as a fun outing (this even dates back to Bill Veeck, who first planted the ivy as a way to make the experience fun). You can even find in the data that there were times when the Cubs lost more and they gained attendance -- the lovable losers actually drew more fans. Despite this history of losing and futility, the Cubs remain one of the top five most valuable franchises. The fans keep coming no matter what the win-loss record looks like. As you said, fan attendance is actually far more sensitive to beer prices at Wrigley than it is to wins and losses (the opposite is true of the White Sox by the way). 
As a result of fans' feast-or-famine interest in the Cubs, the team has little incentive to win. When the owners are not threatened by fan boycott or weak ticket sales, what reason do they have to go that extra mile to gain the sought-after free agent, to hire the top manager, to design state-of-the-art facilities and training, all of which may be required to win a championship? If you are offered a 10 percent bonus if you put in 10 percent more hours, would you do it? Maybe. Would you put in 10 percent more hours for a 1 percent bonus? Less likely. The "stickiness" of attendance does not provide ownership with much incentive to produce a winner. And winning a championship is no easy feat in professional sports, where competition is fierce. This attitude certainly trickles down through the organization. The players and coaches feel it. When you take all of this into account, it suddenly isn't so surprising that the Cubs haven't won in over a century.
In business and life, incentives are hugely powerful. Think about the money management industry. Many money managers or brokers are effectively compensated on how much they trade, and not on the value of those trades. This creates poor incentives where they will maximize trading activity, but not your wealth. In the same vein, if Cubs fans aren't willing to incentivize management with gate revenue when they win and lose, then it shouldn't be a surprise that the organization might be optimizing something other than wins. We call this a principal-agent conflict in economics. Stated simply it means if you want the agent to have the same objective as the principal, you better align their incentives. It's the same reason we give stock options to executives, have higher water marks for hedge funds and threaten to take away the car keys from our teenagers.
Mr. Moskowitz: First, let's start with the conventional thinking on home-field advantage. It's true that home teams are better rested, know their home field better, and are inspired by fans. But these things don't have have much impact on teams' performance. 
Let's go in reverse order and begin with fans' influence on players. It's hard to measure the effect of the crowd on players, abstracting from everything else going on in the game. So, what we do is look at isolated incidents like free throw shooting, penalty shots in hockey, etc. where it really is just the player and the crowd (though in hockey the goalie plays a role, of course, too). In those isolated situations, we find no difference in the way home and visiting players perform. We also looked at pitchers in baseball and found their placement, velocity, spin, etc. are no different at home and on the road. Same with batters: they do not swing at worse pitches or, when they do swing, have any less success at putting the ball in play on the road vs. at home. Keep in mind that a pitcher's and batter's stats are indeed better at home than on the road, but I'll get to that in a minute.
In terms of environment, sure, a home player knows his stadium and its idiosyncrasies better. But, right away you know this can't matter much in the N.B.A. or N.H.L., where there is very little variation in the court or ice rink across venues; they are standardized. And yet the N.B.A. and N.H.L. have two of the larger home field advantages. In the N.F.L. and M.L.B., the venues could matter, but we don't find much evidence of it in the data. For example, we looked at cold and tropical weather teams and what happens when they play in the opposite climate. Despite the fact that announcers and analysts always attribute the troubles of warm weather teams in late December to the cold, the truth is weather does not play a big factor. If you think about this, it makes sense. If it's brutally cold (or hot), it's brutally cold for players on both teams. Not to mention most teams are populated by players who at some point in their careers (previous teams, college, etc.) played a significant number of games in awful weather. In baseball, we don't dispute that the uniqueness of baseball ballparks might confer some advantage to the home team. But baseball has the smallest home field advantage among all sports despite having the most variation in ballparks across its cities. 
It is also true that road teams are more tired than home teams. But, it's not because of travel and it's not true in every sport. First, one simple way to look at the effects of travel is to see what the home-field advantage looks like when two teams from the same city play (e.g., L.A. Lakers vs. L.A. Clippers, who play in the same stadium, or Nets vs. Knicks, or Ravens vs. Redskins, etc.). In these games, the home field advantage is no bigger than when teams travel long distances. The only significant effect from road fatigue we find comes from leagues' scheduling bias toward the home team. Specifically, in the N.B.A. and N.H.L., two-thirds of back-to-back games (on consecutive days) befall road teams, and road teams typically have played more games in a shorter time span than their home opponent. This does takes its toll, and we show it has a measurable impact on the home field advantage in the N.B.A. and N.H.L. But it's only part of the story in basketball and hockey -- and none of the story in baseball and football. 
So what is the biggest contributor to the home-field advantage in all sports? 
We claim it's referee bias toward the home team and try to show a bunch of evidence for this explanation. Obviously, you can't just look at ref calls alone. While it's true that referee calls (balls, strikes, penalties, fouls, etc.) go the home team's way, that in and of itself doesn't mean the refs are biased. For instance, if the visitors are indeed more tired, then they may commit more fouls, penalties, etc. What we do instead is look deeper into the calls the refs make. In baseball, for example, because of the wonderful data M.L.B.com provides -- a system called pitch f/x records the location of every pitch and the strike zone of every batter -- we are able to assess whether a called strike or ball really was a strike or ball. What we found is that the errors umpires make (calling a ball when it's a strike and vice versa) seem to go disproportionately the home team's way. 
Perhaps more interesting was the experiment M.L.B. ran when they installed umpire monitoring technology in some, but not all, of their stadiums. In stadiums where umpires knew their pitch calls were being monitored, the strike-ball call advantage toward the home team disappeared, but the bias remained steady in the stadiums where the umpires knew they weren't being watched. For other sports, it's more difficult, but we found consistently that close or ambiguous calls go the home team's way more often in basketball, hockey, football and even international soccer.
Why do refs favor the home team? We think psychology and behavioral science give the best explanation. Psychology finds that social influence is a powerful force than can have great impact on people's decision-making, even if they are unaware of it. People tend to converge their opinion toward a group's opinion both because of social pressure (the desire to fit in) and for informational reasons (the group may be better informed than the individual). Basically, we think officials are seeing the game the home team's way both because they may have a subconscious desire to relieve pressure from the yelling crowd and because they may be taking subtle cues from the crowd about what the correct call should be. 
If this explanation has merit, then we should see greater influence on referee calls when the crowd is larger and greater influence when calls are uncertain. And we do. My favorite example of the effect of the crowd on referees is when the Italian government in 2007 banned fans from 21 soccer matches in their premier league following a major soccer riot. For those 21 games, all played before empty bleachers, the referees' usual bias toward the home team essentially disappeared. Interestingly, however, the performance of the players on the field was virtually the same as it was during games with tens of thousands of screaming fans, based on the data we studied. The refs were affected, but the players did not seem to be.
Social influence has impact in many other contexts where human decision-making is involved. Mutual fund managers' herding behavior -- buying and selling the same stocks at the same time -- may be partly explained by this. Wall Street analysts' behavior seems to be affected similarly. It's also one of the reasons why good advice for the design of corporate boards is to make them diverse. And, it is a reason why secret ballots can be important in some meetings where votes are held.
Bottom line: if you're a fan and want to help your team, save your breath on the players for the refs.
The first, in The Wall Street Journal, said that you were wrong to suggest the N.F.L.'s playoffs were more random than baseball's: "With expanded playoffs (three rounds versus one round in days of old), baseball's best teams are usually knocked off before the main event - despite having proved their merit across 162 games."
The second, in The Times, suggested that football kickers were indeed often unnerved when the opposing coach called a timeout shortly before a field-goal attempt (which is known as "icing" the kicker). 
Mr. Moskowitz: Sure. We don't want to "respond" - in that aggrieved New York Review of Books kind of way - as much as we want to reiterate what we say in the book: we hope to generate debate and discussion of these issues. We love that the reviewers in The Journal and The Times have provided some alternative viewpoints on a couple of the conclusions we reached. And we are happy to discuss those here.
We still maintain that the 162-game regular season and best-of-seven playoff format for M.L.B. allows the most talented teams to come out on top most often. The N.F.L., with its 16-game season and win-or-home playoff format, generates more randomness and gives less talented teams more of a shot. The N.B.A. and N.H.L. are somewhere in between. The Journal's reviewer suggested that the playoff series in M.L.B. is more conducive to upsets than in the N.F.L. This is an interesting conjecture and has some plausibility. But it turns out not to be true in the existing data. 
We found that indeed the N.F.L. has more parity. That is, it's simply harder to predict who will win the Super Bowl based purely on regular season record. In M.L.B., it's easier. That doesn't mean, of course, that you'll be right every time. In any single season, this pattern may not hold, but we found over time that it is easier to predict team success in baseball, compared to the N.F.L. Especially with no salary cap, M.L.B. allows teams to accumulate talent; and with a full 162-game schedule that talent is going to make a bigger difference. If the Pittsburgh Pirates play the Philadelphia Phillies once, anything could happen. If they play 10 games, almost assuredly the Phillies will win most of them. 
The N.F.L. with its salary cap (before this season) and meager 16-game schedule militates parity across teams and allows for more luck or randomness. Couple that with the single-elimination playoff format and you have a hard time predicting who will win each year. Surely there are other forces at play too, as our reviewer suggested. But in terms of the data they don't seem to matter that much.
The review in The Times also mentioned a study that found that N.F.L. kickers were adversely affected when iced. We conducted our own study and found this not to be true. We also uncovered several other studies done by other statisticians and academics on this subject. They, too, found that icing didn't matter. 
So why the differences in results? A lot of it comes down to what you control for. For example, if you just look at iced kicks versus all other kicks but fail to control for field position or time left on the clock or score in the game, that might affect the results. Iced kicks typically occur with clock winding down, when the score is close (e.g., the kick will win or tie the game), and generally from less favorable field position because the team has marched as close as it can within the time left, and often this means the field goal attempt is from further away than normal. Failing to control for these factors will make it look like iced kicks are less successful. Forget about whether a timeout is called or not, if we just look at longer kicks, with less time, and when the score is close we will find those kicks are less successful. 
The analysis we performed - mirroring the analysis the other studies that also failed to find an effect from icing - was to compare otherwise identical kicks (same yardage, same score, same time left). But in one situation, the opposing team called a timeout (icing) and in the other situation it didn't. When you compare those two scenarios, there is no effect from icing. We also looked at the same idea in the N.B.A. -- icing the free throw shooter -- and similarly found it had no effect.
Intuitively, we think this makes sense. These guys are professionals and have kicked under pressure innumerable times. The study that did find an icing effect suggested that icing reduced the kicker's chance of making a field goal by more than 10 percentage points. That seems implausibly large. To give you some perspective on that number, that's the equivalent of moving the ball back 20 yards. It doesn't seem possible that a timeout could have that much of an effect. 
One final thought: since almost every coach now reflexively calls timeout before the play, kickers expect it. So the right strategy to shake them up might be to not call the timeout. 
Again, we hope to get people to think about sports from a different and new perspective, much as economists often do in other walks of life. We welcome diverse opinion and invite debate. We certainly don't claim to have all the answers. We love discussion and we love challenging current thinking -- even our own.

HEADLINE: Too Much Testing

 BODY:
To the Editor:
One article in The Times described the profound problems children are facing in school because of the economy (''Teacher, My Dad Lost His Job. Do We Have to Move?,'' On Education column, Jan. 31). Another described the conflict over whether beginning teachers will be fired when New York cuts the education budget (''Bloomberg Presses Cuomo on Teacher Seniority Rule,'' news article, Jan. 31). Articles also appear regularly about cutbacks in public and school libraries. 
Meanwhile, the United States Department of Education is spending huge sums for increasing testing far beyond the already unacceptable amount done under No Child Left Behind. According to the department's Blueprint, as well as speeches by Arne Duncan, the education secretary, it is planning interim tests during the year and is encouraging testing all subjects, not just reading and math. It also intends to measure growth, which could mean pre- and post-tests each year.
The Department of Education clearly thinks that weighing the animal more frequently is more important than feeding it.

HEADLINE: Inspiring Growth, and Doubts

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

 BODY:
GANDHINAGAR, India -- In a soaring, unfinished conference hall in western India, thousands of businessmen and diplomats from around the world gathered recently for an investment meeting. They were there to pay homage to a politician for accomplishing something once thought almost impossible in India: making it easy to do business.
The politician, Narendra Modi, the chief minister of the state of Gujarat, sat onstage, stroking his close-cropped white beard, as executives from the United States, Canada, Japan and elsewhere showered him with praise.
Ron Somers, head of an American trade group, called him a progressive leader. Michael Kadoorie, a Hong Kong billionaire, enveloped him in a hug. 
''I would encourage you all to invest here,'' Mr. Kadoorie, chairman of the Asian power company CLP Group, told the audience, ''because it has been an even playing field for me.''
The coastal state of Gujarat, famous as the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, has become an investment magnet. The state's gross domestic product is growing at an 11 percent annual rate -- even faster than the overall growth rate for India, which despite its problems is zipping along at 9 percent clip.
And Mr. Modi receives -- some would say claims -- much of the credit. The year before he took office in 2001, Gujarat's economy shrank by 5 percent.
But critics of Mr. Modi, a Hindu nationalist, point to another legacy of his early days in office -- something that has made him one of the most polarizing figures in Indian politics. Months after he became chief minister, Gujarat erupted in brutal Hindu-Muslim riots that killed more than 1,000 people, most of them Muslims.
Despite Mr. Modi's subsequent denials, he has not fully escaped a cloud of accusations by rival political groups, victims and their families, and human rights groups that he and his aides condoned the attacks against Muslims and -- as one case now before the Supreme Court charges -- may even have encouraged them.
A special investigation team formed by the Supreme Court has filed a 600-page investigative report on the riots, which has not been officially released. Numerous other lawsuits related to the riots are also winding through India's courts. In 2005 the United States refused to grant Mr. Modi a visa, on grounds of religious intolerance. Meanwhile, environmental activists and local tribesman who have been protesting the construction of seven dams in Gujarat that will displace 25,000 people say they the protesters have been regularly jailed by the state police, charged with being Naxalites, a militant rebel group.
Mr. Modi, who has declined interview requests from The New York Times for several years, did not comment for this article.
Of the lingering controversies, a spokesman for Mr. Modi, Steven King, with the Washington public relations firm APCO Worldwide, wrote in an e-mail responding to questions: ''The government has very highly developed grievance proceedings.''
Corporate executives, though, tend to concentrate on Mr. Modi's pro-business attributes, which they see as something of an anomaly in an India where government bureaucracy, bumbling or corruption too often impedes commerce.
''In India there is a sense that efficiency is at such a premium because there is so little to go around,'' said Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell who has served as an adviser to the Indian government. ''When people find an effective politician who can make things happen on the ground, they are willing to ignore the character flaws.''
Under Mr. Modi's watch, the energy companies Royal Dutch Shell and Total have opened a major liquid natural gas terminal in Gujarat, and Torrent Power, an Indian company, has built a huge power plant. Meanwhile, Tata Motors, DuPont, General Motors, Hitachi and dozens of other foreign and Indian companies have built factories, expanded operations or invested in projects in the state.
When the Canadian heavy machinery company Bombardier won a contract to supply subway cars to the Delhi Metro in 2007, it needed a factory site, quickly. It found one in Savli, an industrial estate in Gujarat. Just 18 months later-- when in many parts of India, the permit process might still be grinding away -- the factory was built and operating.
''It was incredible,'' said Rajeev Jyoti, the managing director of Bombardier in India, ''and it was a world record within Bombardier.''
Compared with most other states, Gujarat has smoother roads and less garbage next to the streets. More than 99 percent of Gujarat's villages have electricity, compared with less than 85 percent nationally.
In 2009, Gujarat attracted more planned investment than any other state in the country, about $54 billion by value of announced plans, according to Assocham, a trade association of Indian chambers of commerce.
Mr. Modi, who has no business or economics background, deserves praise for this, corporate leaders say. Before entering politics in his late 30s, he was a religious volunteer for the Hindu nationalist group Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, which sponsors schools and provides aid during natural disasters, but has also been widely criticized as being intolerant of other religions and of secular Hindus.
In India, where corrupt politicians often seem to be raiding the public coffers to benefit their offspring, Mr. Modi's success is sometimes attributed to his apparent lack of a family life. Acquaintances and local news reports say he was married at a young age but separated soon after from his wife. Mr. Modi has never commented on reports about his personal life.
Mr. Modi's administration has brought novel solutions to some of India's most tenacious problems. Corruption became less widespread after the state government put a large amount of its activities online, from permits that companies need to build or expand, to bids for contracts. To plow through a multiyear backlog of court cases, and prevent day laborers from losing income, Mr. Modi asked judges to work extra hours in night courts.
Mr. Modi uses a chief executive style of managing the bureaucrats who work under him, according to associates and business executives in Gujarat. He gives promising people positions of responsibility, sets goals and expects people to meet them. Nonperformers are pushed aside.
It may seem an obvious way to administer a state with more than 50 million people and a budget in the billions of dollars.
But this approach runs counter to India's tradition of cronyism. In a recent reshuffle of India's national cabinet ministers, for example, the minister of highways who substantially missed targets for road-building was made minister for urban development, a crucial position for a rapidly urbanizing nation struggling to build livable cities.
Even in another state considered pro-business, Tamil Nadu in the south, the ruling party, D.M.K., has been dogged by accusations of corruption.
In Mr. Modi's case, the accolades once would have been unthinkable. After the Hindu-Muslim riots a decade ago, he was considered a liability for his political party, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party. But these days, with Gujarat's soaring economy, Mr. Modi is sometimes mentioned as his party's most likely candidate for prime minister in 2014, when the next general election is expected.
Despite his lack of executive experience, Mr. Modi's supporters credit him with a politician's innate sense of marketing. Images of Mr. Modi were plastered on billboards throughout Gujarat during the investment summit meeting, proclaiming the state's support not only for investment but for social programs like support of girls' education -- a particularly important subject in India where there is a large literacy gap between men and women.
Within Gujarat, which has a centuries-old reputation for business acumen, even Mr. Modi's fans sometimes grumble that he and his image makers may be taking outsize credit for its economic growth. And they say that the headline numbers that Mr. Modi's government trumpets can be misleading.
For example, the $450 billion in ''memorandums of understanding'' -- essentially, pledges to do business in the state -- that the government says were signed during the January investment summit meeting double-count some deals, according to businessmen in attendance, because they include loans and investments for the same projects. Mr. Modi's spokesman confirmed there might be some redundancy in the $450 billion figure, but said it was impossible to break out the loans from the investments.
Yet, no one disputes Gujarat's rapid growth. And Mr. Modi's supporters say India's economic success will depend on each state's adopting many of the same measures he has employed. India's central government may apportion budgets and write overall laws, they say, but it is the states that are responsible for overseeing everything from land allocation to electricity distribution.
''If you are an investor in India,'' said Mr. Somers, of the United States trade group, ''Gujarat must be at the top of your list.''

HEADLINE: Schools Facing Cuts if Lunches Aren't Paid For

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
Of the 2,200 students at Intermediate School 61 in Corona, Queens, 86 percent receive free cafeteria lunches. Some others pay a reduced price, and some are supposed to pay full price.
But not all of their parents pay what they are supposed to, and recently, the school's principal, Joseph Lisa, has been spending a lot of time trying to collect money from them.
He has cornered them in the hallways. He has offered them gentle reminders after school meetings. He has called them and sent them letters suggesting payment plans for debts that might amount to $20 or $30.
''We give them little pieces of paper saying, 'This week you owe $5, $3, 50 cents,' '' Mr. Lisa said, ''but as soon as we collect it from one parent, there's another who's falling behind.'' 
Since 2004, the city has absorbed at least $42 million in unpaid lunch fees. But that is a luxury it can no longer afford, according to the Education Department, which has weathered several rounds of budget cuts, with more to come. The department has been telling principals to collect overdue lunch money or risk having it docked from their school budgets.
Of the city's 1,600 schools, 1,043 owe a collective $2.5 million to the department for meals served in the first three months of this school year. That puts them on track to be $8 million behind by the end of the school year.
New York City's lunch money problem is costly and complicated, but not unique. The economy has school administrators all over the country scratching for savings even as more parents are falling behind in lunch fees. A September survey by the School Nutrition Association, a professional organization, showed that in 2009-10, 34 percent of school districts saw an increase from the previous school year in the number of meals not paid for.
The school district in Albuquerque was among several last year to start serving cold sandwiches and milk, instead of full hot meals, to students whose parents had not paid what they owed. In Wake County, N.C., those students may eat as many fruits and vegetables as they want, but not the rest of the lunch offerings.
In Louisiana, some districts did not feed the children whose parents were in arrears at all, until, in November, the State Legislature passed a law ordering that they be given at least a snack, while directing districts to notify child welfare authorities if a student got just a snack on more than three consecutive days. Framingham, Mass., hired a constable to hand-deliver notices to parents whose bills were still unpaid after the schools had sent them several letters alerting them to their debt.
''We're in the business of feeding kids, so it's heart-wrenching to all of us to have to get parents to pay this way,'' said Brendan Ryan, director of food services at Framingham Public Schools.
In New York City, the Education Department warned principals in the spring that they would have to collect the money, but after principals protested, they were given a grace period. In January, the new schools chancellor, Cathleen P. Black, told principals that they had until Feb. 16.
On Monday, after vociferous complaints from principals, the department once again put off the deadline, though it was unclear for how long. In a statement, Natalie Ravitz, a department spokeswoman, said, ''We really need families to cooperate with us in this effort so that we aren't taking money out of the classroom.''
But some principals said that that was exactly what would happen unless the city came up with an alternative, which seems unlikely.
''The school has become the collection agency, and that's not their business,'' said Randi Herman, the first vice president of the city's principals' union.
The issue came up during a City Council committee hearing on Tuesday, where Councilman Robert Jackson, chairman of the education committee, said that deducting unpaid lunch fees would deal ''a serious blow to already overstretched school budgets.''
New York City charges $1.50 for a school lunch. Three quarters of the city's students qualify for free lunch, or lunch at a reduced price of 25 cents; even some of the students charged the reduced price have fallen behind.
Students are eligible for free or reduced-price lunches if their family incomes fall below the levels set by the federal government. For free lunches, the cutoff is $28,665 for a family of four; for reduced-price lunches, it is $40,793.
School lunches are subsidized by the federal government, which spent $9.8 billion nationwide on the program in the 2009 fiscal year.
Under city rules, elementary and middle school students who are behind on payments but come to school without their own lunches must be fed the same meal as everyone else. High schools are not required to feed such students.
Principals say economic troubles have forced parents into delinquency, but some also say that there are many children, often in families of recent immigrants, who would qualify for free lunch but have not turned in eligibility forms. The Education Department has strongly encouraged parents to complete the forms, even offering prizes, including a trip for two to the Pro Bowl in Hawaii, paid for by the Jets.
On the Web site of the Robert H. Goddard Junior High School in Ozone Park, Queens, above the announcements on exams coming up, attendance requirements for graduation and uniform policies, there is this message: ''If you owe a lunch balance, you are required to pay for it.''
At Public School 312 in Bergen Beach, Brooklyn, the principal, Linda Beal-Benigno, said she had tried to persuade parents who were in arrears to pack lunches for their children, but the strategy had not always worked.
''Numerous children throw out the lunches they bring from home on the days we serve pizza and end up eating in the school anyway,'' Ms. Beal-Benigno said.
Nearly half of schools that owed money from September until November owed from $1,000 to $10,000. The schools with the highest balances were I.S. 145 in Jackson Heights, Queens ($25,598); P.S. 276 in Canarsie, Brooklyn ($21,907); and P.S. 24 in the Riverdale section of the Bronx ($20,222).
Mr. Lisa, the principal at the intermediate school in Corona, where the overdue balance is about $3,000 for the three months, said he and his colleagues had been forced into an awkward role. ''It's the same as if I were the manager at Target and told the customers, 'Please, don't take our merchandise without paying for it; however, if you do it, we won't stop you,' '' he said.

HEADLINE: Banks Could Have Key Role in Mets Suit

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN and RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
Bernard L. Madoff's arrest on Dec. 11, 2008, shook the pillars of Fred Wilpon's world.
Gone was $500 million that he and his family thought was in their Madoff investment accounts.
On top of that, Wilpon's remaining empire had at least a half-billion dollars in debt with no easy way to deal with it, according to court papers filed last week. There was, the records say, ''very little actual cash on hand.''
Sterling Equities, the family company that owns the Mets, was scrambling to survive.
In the end, eight banks, including Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase, came to Wilpon's rescue. Together, they engineered what the court papers say was a ''complete and comprehensive'' restructuring of 40 loans totaling $500 million owed by Sterling's partners and other parts of the empire. In the refinancing, the family trusts of Wilpon and his brother-in-law, Saul Katz, added $100 million in debt. 
The overhaul worked, keeping Sterling afloat when global finances were in doubt and easy credit was nonexistent.
And there is little doubt Wilpon's public record as a careful businessman and respected team owner explained some of the willingness of the banks.
''Here you have the Wilpons with a reputation for being smart, good businesspeople,'' said Shai Waisman, a bankruptcy lawyer at Weil, Gotshal & Manges in Manhattan, ''and if you're a bank, you probably think they'll be able to weather this storm and turn things around.''
A lawsuit brought against Wilpon and his associates at Sterling by the trustee for Madoff's victims -- one that accuses them of having willfully ignored warnings that Madoff might have been a fraud -- has offered Wilpon's banks an unflattering portrait of the man they helped rescue.
The trustee, Irving H. Picard, has charged that Wilpon and others at Sterling, despite having reason to be suspicious of Madoff, nonetheless used their Madoff accounts as collateral for bank loans, and that they used loans from banks to open up additional accounts with Madoff, confident that the steady money earned with Madoff would outperform the interest rates on their loans.
A lawyer for Picard, David Sheehan, has said that when Wilpon needed cash but wanted to avoid formally going to the banks for more loans, he simply had Madoff lend him millions, all under the guise of ostensible investments in Wilpon's real estate holdings and venture capital deals.
Picard is seeking $1 billion from Wilpon and his partners to compensate those who he argues were true victims of Madoff.
Wilpon's banks have chosen not to answer questions about the lawsuit or its portrayal of Wilpon and his partners. And Wilpon's lawyers contend that Picard ''did not uncover one shred of evidence'' to disprove Wilpon and his partners were anything more than victims who trusted Madoff.
But those banks, which over the last two years have saved and supported Wilpon, could be critical players as Wilpon contends with Picard's lawsuit and the prospect of needed hundreds of millions in cash to settle the case, according to lawyers and other banking experts.
Those lawyers and experts suggested Wilpon's banks could contemplate a number of options: they could call in their loans, perhaps forcing Wilpon to sell all or parts of his empire; or they could choose to assist him, helping him find a way to survive even a giant settlement.
''Generally speaking, banks don't act rashly in these sorts of situations,'' said Anthony W. Clark, a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom who specializes in corporate restructurings. ''They're usually cautious and will watch to see what happens. They don't want to precipitate the thing they are most concerned about, which is diminishing the value of the assets that serve as their collateral.''
Wilpon's empire is heavy with debt. With his real estate dealings, that is hardly uncommon. He and his partners routinely put up a small percentage of equity in their real estate funds and borrowed two to three times that when making acquisitions.
There is also serious debt on his team and the new stadium he helped build in Queens. Indeed, with the Madoff case looming, Wilpon's company's need for cash was such that in taking out a $450 million loan on the SNY network last year, he and his partners, Time Warner Cable and Comcast, got about $240 million in cash, two-thirds of which went to Sterling. And in a $375 million financing of the Mets last year, Wilpon reportedly received $75 million in cash. It is not clear whether that cash was spent or salted away. And Wilpon has, within the last two weeks, put up for sale 25 percent of the team -- a previously unthinkable option -- to raise more money.
As the banks look at the loans Wilpon and his partners have, their options depend on the specific language in the agreements, said Sandra E. Mayerson, a lawyer at Squire Sanders who specializes in restructuring and insolvency. The banks may well have forced Wilpon, in these most recent refinancings, to add more collateral or restricted the investments he could make.
''I'm sure the Wilpon side will fight tooth and nail to keep their businesses viable,'' Mayerson said. ''It doesn't help anyone, including Picard, to have those businesses fail.''
Picard's lawsuit described a web of dubious banking that fueled growth at Sterling. When Wilpon needed a loan to buy out his cable television deal to start SNY, he pledged at least one Madoff account as collateral. The Sterling partners opened 65 accounts solely to invest with Madoff and then often to use as collateral to borrow still more to invest in the accounts.
Bank of America ''was influenced by both the large purported balances'' and ''consistent returns'' generated by the Sterling's Madoff accounts when Sterling sought a $75 million loan. According to Picard, the loan supplied Sterling with half of what it needed to secure its stake in its latest real estate fund, which entitled it to 90 percent of the fund's management fees.
According to Picard, Wilpon and his partners used the Madoff accounts to prove their net worth and creditworthiness to raise capital ''that might not have been otherwise available.''
Some experts say that Picard's accusations have not been proved in court. ''Don't forget that it's only a legal claim that the trustee has against them,'' said Deirdre Martini, a managing director at Wells Fargo Capital Finance.
Still, Bradley Simon, a former federal prosecutor who is a defense lawyer at Simon & Partners, said that banks should be ''nervous, if not terrified'' if Picard successfully forces Wilpon and Katz to sell the Mets, SNY and real estate to come up with $1 billion.
He added that banks should be combing their loan refinancing documents for misleading statements related to Madoff. ''I don't think they understood what Picard knows,'' Simon said.

PERSON: Johannes Somary 

HEADLINE: Johannes Somary, 75, Founder Of Amor Artis Choral Group

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
Johannes Somary, the founder and music director of Amor Artis, a chorus and orchestra that for the last half-century has presented neglected choral masterpieces, primarily from the Baroque and Classical periods, died on Feb. 1 in the Bronx. He was 75 and lived in Riverdale. 
The cause was complications of a stroke, his son Stephen said.
Mr. Somary, an organist, composer and conductor, formed Amor Artis in response to the disbanding of the American Concert Choir, a chorus and orchestra created by the conductor Margaret Hillis. As an experiment, he and the group's manager, Milton Goldin, staged the first complete performance in the United States of the Handel oratorio ''Esther'' at Town Hall in April 1961.
A rousing reception encouraged Mr. Somary (pronounced so-MAHR-ee) to form Amor Artis, whose first concert, in January 1962, presented works by Schutz, Schubert, Hindemith and Bruckner -- choral works from the 17th to the 20th centuries.
Under Mr. Somary's leadership the ensemble, which added a chamber choir in 1980, made a specialty of neglected Baroque and Classical works. It was known in particular for its performances and recordings of Handel's oratorios, and for imaginative programming that allowed audiences to hear rarities like Dvorak's ''Te Deum'' and Gounod's ''Messe Solennelle.''
In the 1970's, the Amor Artis Chorale made the first recordings of the Handel oratorios ''Theodora'' and ''Jeptha'' with the English Chamber Orchestra. More recently, the group began recording on its own label, Amor Artis Edition. Its first CD, released in 2010, was ''Sacred Jewels,'' a selection of motets and a mass by Tomas Luis de Victoria.
Johannes Felix Somary was born on April 7, 1935, in Zurich. His father, an economist and banker, brought the family to the United States in 1940, and Johannes grew up in Washington, D.C.
He attended Yale, where he earned a bachelor's degree in 1957 and a master's in music in 1959. In addition to his work with Amor Artis, he was for many years the chairman of the arts and music department of the Horace Mann School in New York, where he taught from 1959 until his retirement in 2002.
He was the choirmaster and organist at the Church of Our Saviour in Manhattan in the 1960s and '70s; the music director of St. Patrick's Cathedral from 2001 to 2003; and the conductor of the Fairfield County Chorale in Connecticut, the Great Neck Choral Society on Long Island, and the Taghkanic Chorale in Westchester County, N.Y.
In addition to his son Stephen, of Manhattan, the founder and artistic director of the Mendelssohn Project, Mr. Somary is survived by his wife, Anne; another son, Geoffrey, of Arlington Heights, Ill.; a daughter, Karen Somary Healy of Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.; a brother, Wolfgang, of Zurich; a sister, Maria Twaalfhoven of Hilversum, the Netherlands; and seven grandchildren.

HEADLINE: For Federal Programs, A Taste of Market Discipline

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com; twitter.com/DLeonhardt

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
Wouldn't it be nice if taxpayers could somehow get a refund for government programs that didn't work?
Instead, the opposite tends to happen. Programs that fail to make a difference -- like many of those that train workers for new jobs -- endure indefinitely. Often, policy makers don't even know which work and which don't, because rigorous evaluation is rare in government. And competition, which punishes laggards in the private sector, is typically absent in the public sector.
But there is some good news on this front. Lately, both American and British policy makers have been thinking about how to bring some of the competitive discipline of the market to government programs, and they have hit on an intriguing idea. 
David Cameron's Conservative government in Britain is already testing it, at a prison 75 miles north of London. The Bloomberg administration in New York is also considering the idea, as is the State of Massachusetts. Perhaps most notably, President Obama next week will propose setting aside $100 million for seven such pilot programs, according to an administration official.
The idea goes by one of two names: pay for success bonds or social impact bonds. Either way, nonprofit groups like foundations pay the initial money for a new program and also oversee it, with government approval. The government will reimburse them several years later, possibly with a bonus -- but only if agreed-upon benchmarks show that the program is working.
If it falls short, taxpayers owe nothing.
The first British test is happening at Her Majesty's Prison Peterborough, where 60 percent of the prisoners are convicted of another crime within one year of release. Depressingly enough, that recidivism rate is typical for a British prison.
To reduce the rate, a nonprofit group named Social Finance is playing a role akin to venture capitalist. It has raised about $8 million from investors, including the Rockefeller Foundation. Social Finance also oversees three social service groups helping former prisoners find work, stay healthy and the like. If any of those groups starts to miss its performance goals, it can be replaced.
For the investors to get their money back starting in 2014 -- with interest -- the recidivism rate must fall at least 7.5 percent, relative to a control group. If the rate falls 10 percent, the investors will receive the sort of return that the stock market historically delivers. ''It's been only a few months,'' says Tracy Palandjian, who recently opened a new Social Finance office in Boston, ''but the numbers are coming in O.K.''
Antony Bugg-Levine of the Rockefeller Foundation told me it had invested in the project for two main reasons. One, it expected to get its money back and then be able to reuse it. Two, if social impact bonds work, they have the potential to attract for-profit investors -- and vastly expand the pool of capital that's available for social programs.
Clearly, social impact bonds have limitations. For starters, it's hard to see how private money could ever pay for multibillion-dollar programs like Medicaid or education.
Just as important, the execution of any bond program will be complicated. It will depend on coming up with the right performance measures, which is no small matter. Done wrong, the measures will end up rewarding programs lucky (or clever) enough to enroll participants who are more likely to succeed no matter what.
But whatever the caveats about the bonds, the potential for improving the government's performance is obviously huge. That's true in education, health care, criminal justice and many other areas.
A recent review found that 10 major social programs had been rigorously evaluated over the past two decades, using the scientific gold standard of random assignment. Only one of the 10 -- Early Head Start, for infants, toddlers pregnant women -- was a clear success. Yet all 10 still exist, and largely in their original form.
Jon Baron, the president of the Coalition for Evidence-Based Policy in Washington, points out that the social problems addressed by antipoverty programs have not gotten much better in years. School test scores have barely changed. College graduation rates for low-income students have stagnated. The poverty rate is as high as it was in 1981. Median household income is lower than it was in 1998.
''If we just keep funding social programs the way we have been,'' Mr. Baron says, ''there's not a lot of reason to think we'll have much success.''
The Obama administration's seven pilot programs would create bonds for, among other areas, job training, education, juvenile justice and care of children's disabilities. Nonprofit groups like Social Finance could apply. So could for-profit companies, said the White House official, who asked not to be named because the president had not yet released next year's budget. The $100 million for the bonds would come out of the budgets of other programs, to stay consistent with Mr. Obama's announced freeze on non-security spending.
Officials in Massachusetts and New York are looking at similar ideas but have not yet decided whether they will issue bonds.
Beyond the impact of any single program, the bonds have the potential to nudge all government agencies to pay more attention to results. Mr. Obama, after all, campaigned as a reformer who wanted to create a sleek, efficient ''iPod government.'' He has had some success, like the expansion of a program -- backed by years of solid evidence -- in which nurses go to the homes of new at-risk parents to counsel them.
Over all, though, the administration has not done enough to improve government efficiency. Put it this way: If someone asked you how Mr. Obama had made government work better, would you have an answer?
Making government work better will be all the more important in the years ahead. The free market is not going to solve many of our biggest problems, be it stagnant pay or spotty medical care. And government -- in Washington and locally -- is going to be financially squeezed for a long time.
There never was a good excuse for wasting billions of taxpayer dollars on programs that didn't work. But now, especially, there's no excuse.

HEADLINE: The Other Side of Nachos

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
THE shiny 10-inch-wide tin of nachos enticing Carolyn Thalin at the mahogany bar of the Stadium Grill in Manhattan was not your normal gloop-coated pile of tortilla chips. Inspired by the chef David Burke's can o' cake at his high-end restaurant Fishtail, it was constructed with layers of chips, cheese, black beans, more chips, cheese and beans, and -- once baked, topped with salsa, sour cream, jalapeno, guacamole, scallions and more cheese -- it was devised to be suffused with flavor right to the very bottom of the tin.
''I'm a foodie,'' Ms. Thalin said as she nibbled eagerly with two girlfriends, glancing at the resurgent Knicks on a 50-foot-wide wall of high-definition TV screens. ''And one reason I'm here is that I appreciate the quality of the food.''
And now -- as the high season of the sports bar segues from wild-card frenzy past the Super Bowl and romps through March Madness to baseball's March 31 opening day -- a whole new universe awaits the nation's worshipers of sports and electromagnetic radiation. 
The food is from-scratch, fresh and even locavore. Behold, then, the Springer Mountain free-range chicken from north Georgia proudly referenced on the menu of Dantanna's Surf and Turf in the Buckhead neighborhood of Atlanta -- along with Creekstone and Allen Brothers beef and Niman Ranch pork. Note the butternut squash bisque at the Hype Lounge, and that roasted brussels sprouts side at the Ainsworth, both in Manhattan. Then meditate on Emeril Lagasse's steak BAM'Wich at his Lagasse's Stadium in Las Vegas: grilled sirloin on herb focaccia dressed with blue-cheese slaw and balsamic-braised onions, served with truffle-Parmesan steak fries.
But, hey, it's just a steak sandwich. And wasn't Ms. Thalin noshing nachos? She shrugged, then said, ''They have to have them.''
Unquestionably. As Basho hewed to 17 sound units of three phrases when composing haiku, even the most haute of these venues must accept certain imperishable constraints that, in less attentive hands, have made ''sports bar'' the two words most capable of inducing terror in serious diners. (''Early bird'' aside, that is.) Think eau de beer, invisible waitresses, the mysterious crunch on the floor and, worst, the subpar pub grub slapped down on scarred tables before screen-numbed diners.
''The staple of the sports bar was a host of processed-food items,'' said Mr. Burke, culinary director of the Stadium Grill, a 250-seat restaurant in Bowlmor Lanes at 222 West 44th Street with 29 high-definition screens. ''Buying it all frozen, deep-frying it, putting it under a heat lamp and serving it.''
But as in airports, ballparks and country clubs, sophistication is transforming yet another preserve of culinary ineptitude. And for an edge in a tepid economy, operators are going for every niche.
Attracting women as well as the guys. Recruiting the big groups, the double-daters and even the sports-haters. Cosseting the V.I.P.'s. Diversifying offerings on slow nights with D.J.'s and even putting up the Oscars and the Golden Globes on their glowing screens.
''We want to keep alive as many revenue streams as possible,'' said Brian Mazza, an owner of the Ainsworth, at 122 West 26th Street.
His bustling 350-seat restaurant has 40 42-inch high-definition screens, a lunch-and-brunch space, a dinner area, a V.I.P. section and a wall-wrapping bar-cum-gastropub. Mr. Mazza also attracts a sprinkling of celebrity faces, from Jeremy Piven and Heather Graham to Tinsley Mortimer and Missy Elliott.
Highbrow sports bars appeal to an entirely different market than their troglodyte relatives like the Blind Pig Bar, a buzzy game-night beehive -- at 233 East 14th Street, five doors to the west of the sleek Hype Lounge -- with its brick-backed bar, scuffed floors, tin ceilings and walls festooned with sporty bric-a-brac.
To reach the next level, operators are focusing fanatically on their audience. ''You want a little bit of everything under one roof, guys with steins, girls with apple martinis -- and the food needs to make a lasting impression,'' said Michael O'Neil, the president of Traffic Bar and Restaurant at 986 Second Avenue (East 52nd Street) in Manhattan, which has 120 seats and 24 screens on two floors.
To Mr. Mazza of the Ainsworth, ''our patrons don't want to be uptight, they don't want to dress up -- and they don't want to sacrifice the quality of the food or the service, since a lot of them are used to Daniel.''
On its amenities, they click the ''Like'' button. ''When you come in here, it doesn't smell like beer and peanuts, and the food is really good for a quote-unquote sports bar,'' said Amber Fogler, a television market researcher.
''It can't just be, 'We got wings and you're at Hooters,' '' said Jason Bunin, the Ainsworth's executive chef, formerly of Patria, Aureole and Aquavit.
But upscale isn't always easy. When the much-imitated Dantanna's opened seven years ago, ''it was a cold couple of years,'' said Jay Kazlow, an owner of the 200-seat restaurant. ''We had to educate people to understand what we were. If the first thing you see in a restaurant is a 120-inch screen, you start thinking chicken wings. We had to get past that.''
Customers now seem to embrace the menu at Dantanna's, where the tuna and hearts of palm are flown in from Hawaii, and where a hot menu item is ''the best cioppino this side of San Francisco,'' Mr. Kazlow said of the North Beach bouillabaisse.
In the sports realm, though, trusty perennials may be upgraded, but not eliminated. ''I am not above Tater Tots,'' said Mr. Burke of Stadium Grill, ''but the challenge is to take something common and make it unique.''
And so, as Mr. Bunin does at the Ainsworth, Mr. Burke offers tuna-tartare tacos. The Burke crab cakes are corn bread-crusted. And there are Gruyere croutons in his oxtail onion soup.
At Hype Lounge -- where the menu was designed by Jason Hicks, former executive chef at La Goulue and Orsay -- there are wings, yes, but in six different incarnations, from mild to nuclear, including ginger honey and Old Bay. The burgers are infusible with six different flavors, including anchovy and smoked paprika.
Alert customers certainly appreciate the effort. ''This chicken is better than I've had at any other sports bar,'' said Vlora Cana, an advertising saleswoman from Brooklyn who was tucking into Mr. Burke's kung pao chicken at the Stadium Grill. ''It has great texture, and there's plenty of flavor inside.''
Chefs have their own fascination with the genre. Mr. Lagasse, for two decades a New Orleans Saints ticket holder, said the Las Vegas bar is his take on ''tailgating, one of those great American pastimes that I love,'' -- featuring andouille-sausage-hash tortillas. Let the Creole Reubens roll.
Daniel Lydia, general manager of the year-old Lagasse's Stadium, in the Palazzo on the Strip, thinks of the bar as ''a 25,000-square-foot man cave'' with 375 seats, 109 screens and a sports book. Luxury ''boxes'' with custom plasma screens and billiard tables go for $1,500 to $3,500 a day.
The success of Dantanna's has warranted the opening of a 447-seat mega-outpost in the CNN Center in downtown Atlanta. And Traffic has enough of a following to have inspired a $2 million sibling at West 48th Street and Ninth Avenue that will be twice as big.
Meanwhile, some classic sports bars have faltered. The ESPN Zone in Times Square closed last year. ''Customers don't want frozen food and frozen TV channels,'' said Mr. O'Neil of Traffic. ''Here, we'll change the channels to the game that you want.''
This requires sports smarts. ''Every day we log onto every league and print out their schedules,'' said Christophe Jadot, an owner of Hype Lounge, at 243 East 14th Street.
Even so, they are hostages to the fortunes of the teams: when the Atlanta Falcons lost in the playoffs last month, ''it cost me $100,000 in future sales,'' said Mr. Kazlow of Dantanna's, adding that the Super Bowl, surprisingly, can be a slow night. ''People do Super Bowl parties at home.''
More lucrative is March Madness, Mr. Kazlow said. ''I get guys who come in at noon for the start of the games and don't leave until midnight,'' he said of the basketball tourney.
Sports commitment isn't easily faked. Mr. Jadot of Hype said he spends $1,500 a season for the National Football League satellite package and $1,000 for the N.C.A.A. And Dantanna's pays $25,000 to $30,000 each year in television fees, Mr. Kazlow said.
But maintaining equipment and buying all those packages can pay off. Unexpectedly, last summer, ''there were 300 people in here to watch the World Cup games early in the morning,'' Mr. Mazza of the Ainsworth said. ''Great for brunch business.''
And multipurposing is essential. ''When the game is over, you want to say, 'Now where do we go?' '' said Gerard Ronan, a salesman sipping Magners Irish Cider. ''But at Hype they just push a button, it covers the screens, and we say -- why not stay here?''
He referred to the button that makes a wall cover 10 screens in the Hype Lounge dining room to vanish sports itself, for the nonaddicted who come for the food on nongame nights.
Women are an increasingly important part of the menu mix, and at the Ainsworth, many order the truffled chicken chopped salad. ''Guys with money in suits are here,'' Mr. Mazza said, ''so girls will come here to meet them.'' But for more than a year, he said, the Ainsworth has seen ''a great increase in reservations for groups of women,'' who are even more abundant during March Madness, because alumnae root for their college teams.
It is the groups that ''create interesting opportunities, because they will order a lot of food, and we can do beer or wine pairings, and they get to sample our menu -- and we hope to get them back,'' said Mr. Jadot of Hype, as the Rangers played silently on the screens, Nelly sang ''Just a Dream'' on the sound system and Mr. Ronan's group shared plate after plate.
And suddenly, even the dead can provide revenue opportunities. The miraculous, though tentative, reanimation of the New York Knicks is starting to generate excitement -- and money.
Finally, about Chef Burke's nachos? Ms. Thalin and others may be enthusiastic, but he hasn't quite signed off on them yet.
''I don't like sardines, but I know how to make sardines really well,'' Mr. Burke said. ''But nachos? I bang my head on the wall, trying to make that great.''
Recipe: Millionaire's Meatloaf
Adapted from David Burke
Time: 1 hour 30 minutes
FOR THE MEATLOAF:
1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
2 medium onions, finely chopped
6 cloves garlic, minced
2 pounds lean ground beef
2 large eggs
1/2 cup milk
1 cup fresh bread crumbs
1/4 cup Dijon mustard
1/4 cup barbecue sauce
1 tablespoon well-drained horseradish
1/4 cup finely chopped flat-leaf parsley
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme
2 to 3 cups croutons, bought or homemade (see note)
FOR THE CHILI SHRIMP:
1 1/2 teaspoons mild or hot chili powder
1 1/2 teaspoons cayenne pepper
1 1/2 teaspoons paprika
1 1/2 tablespoons Wondra flour
4 jumbo shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 teaspoon chili oil
Mashed potatoes, for serving.
1. For the meatloaf: Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Place a large skillet over medium heat, and add the olive oil, onions and garlic. Saute until translucent and tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside to cool.
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine ground beef, eggs and milk. Mix well by hand, and add bread crumbs, mustard, barbecue sauce, horseradish, and cooked onions and garlic. Mix again, and add the parsley, salt, pepper and thyme. Mix well until thoroughly combined.
3. Spread the croutons across a shallow 8-inch-square baking dish. Top with the meatloaf mix, patting the surface so it is level. Bake until the internal temperature reads 165 degrees on an instant-read thermometer and the top is nicely browned, about 1 hour. Toward the end of baking, prepare the chili shrimp.
4. For the chili shrimp: In a small mixing bowl, combine the chili powder, cayenne pepper, paprika and flour. Dredge the shrimp in the mixture until well coated. Place a small skillet over medium heat, and add the chili oil. When it is hot, add the shrimp and cook for 2 minutes a side.
5. To finish, cut the meatloaf into 4 slices. Place a slice on each of 4 plates, and top with a chili shrimp. If desired, serve with mashed potatoes.
Yield: 4 servings.
Note: To make croutons, toss cubes of white bread with a bit of olive oil, salt and pepper, and roast on a baking sheet at 400 degrees, stirring once or twice, until lightly browned, about 15 minutes.
Correction: February 16, 2011, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Wednesday about sports bars that are paying more attention to their food referred incorrectly to television screens at the Stadium Grill in Manhattan. The bar has a 50-foot-wide wall of high-definition TV screens, not a 50-foot screen.

HEADLINE: U.S. Delegation Is Seeking Deals in India

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ and HEATHER TIMMONS; Heather Timmons reported from New Delhi and Vikas Bajaj from Bangalore, India.

 BODY:
BANGALORE, India -- Nearly two years ago, President Obama rankled many people here when he said that American tax law unfairly benefited companies that created jobs in Bangalore and punished companies that hired in Buffalo.
On Tuesday, however, the president's commerce secretary offered a friendlier message: Let's do business. In his second stop during a weeklong tour of India, the secretary, Gary Locke, said he wanted to help American companies sell planes, tractors and power equipment to create jobs in the United States while also helping to develop India.
''What we seek is really two-way, mutually beneficial trade,'' Mr. Locke said in an interview. He added that the trade should create jobs in both the United States and in India. 
Mr. Locke's visit is part of a year-old initiative by the Obama administration to double exports by 2015 to bolster a still-struggling American economy. In the case of India, the administration has also cast the effort as a way to improve economic relations with an important ally and one of the fastest-growing countries in the world.
The United States is not alone in pursuing such a strategy. Other countries, like China, Russia, France and Britain, have been sending trade missions to India.
Acknowledging that many American companies have not looked outward to bolster their businesses, Mr. Locke said in an interview that he hoped to use his ''trade mission'' to India, and three other countries later this year, to help businesses exploit opportunities abroad.
''Only 1 percent of U.S. companies export, and of that 1 percent, 58 percent export to only one country, typically Canada or Mexico,'' he said. ''And yet 95 percent of the world's consumers live outside the borders of the United States. So, if U.S. companies want to grow and expand, not only do they have to focus on the domestic market, but they have to look at the 95 percent of customers outside.''
As part of its charm offensive, the Obama administration recently removed nine Indian aerospace and defense companies from a list of restricted entities that cannot be sold certain technologies that have military uses. Mr. Locke is accompanied by representatives from 24 businesses, including Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Westinghouse, some of whom are hoping to win business as a result of the change in policy.
Trade between the United States and India was growing even before the administration's recent efforts to focus on this economic relationship.
Total trade in goods and services jumped nearly 20 percent, to $54 billion in the first nine months of 2010. Later this week, India will host a biennial air show in Bangalore where American companies will try to win multibillion-dollar contracts from the Indian Air Force and civilian airlines. They will, however, face stiff competition from European and Russian companies.
Boeing had hoped to sell in India 10 cargo planes for $5 billion during Mr. Obama's visit in November, but the deal is still not finished. Last month, however, Boeing's European rival, Airbus, won a large order from IndiGo, a fast-growing Indian low-cost airline that plans to start flying international routes in August. IndiGo ordered 180 planes that have a list price of $15.6 billion. Deliveries are to start in 2015.
Mr. Locke is not the only American official trying to solicit business in India. Individual American states have also sent representatives to coincide with Mr. Locke's visit. As state governments weigh painful budget cuts and grapple with lingering unemployment, some officials say that increasing exports to India and encouraging investment from its expanding companies is crucial.
''We're not doing it to get ahead, we're doing it to not be left behind,'' said North Carolina's secretary of commerce, J. Keith Crisco, who was in New Delhi this week with dozens of executives from his state.
This is the first trade delegation North Carolina has sent to India, Mr. Crisco said, though the state sent people to China and Brazil last year.
''Yes, we are catching up in India,'' he said, adding that he expected some announcements of deals related to the trip in coming weeks.
New York State has gone even further. It set up an office in New Delhi last year and is organizing a series of investment conferences in New Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore this spring, aimed at Indian companies who want to expand to the United States or work as partners with a New York company.
The office is led by Kaviraj Singh, a Delhi lawyer who has lived and worked in New York. He said he planned to use the office to tie New York businesses ''into a network that will make you feel as though you've always been here.''

HEADLINE: Plans Near For Freddie And Fannie

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration and House Republicans are settling into a game of chicken over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with each side daring the other to advance a plan for replacing the two housing finance companies.
The White House missed a deadline at the end of January for telling Congress what it wants to do. That report will be released as early as Friday, people with knowledge of its contents said, but it will present a range of options without stating a preference.
One possibility favored by some of President Obama's economic advisers, and by many Republicans, would not create any federal replacement for Fannie and Freddie, leaving the private markets to provide mortgages for most Americans. The alternative approaches instead would continue some form of federal mortgage backstop. 
The report will describe a plan for winding down the two companies, which were taken over by the government in 2008. Initial steps will include preventing the companies from buying loans larger than $625,500, and increasing the fees they charge for loan guarantees, according to officials who spoke on condition of anonymity so as not to pre-empt the official release.
The report will describe reforms in other areas of the mortgage business, including enhanced borrower protections, changes in mortgage servicing to address the industry's failure to work with borrowers who fall behind on payments, and new steps to clean up loan securitization, the bundling of loans for sale to investors.
House Republicans, meanwhile, outlined a plan last year to end government ownership of the two companies, and campaigned on the issue in the fall. But they have since adopted a more cautious posture. Instead of pushing forward with legislation, they have scheduled a hearing for Wednesday to weigh alternatives.
The diminished urgency on both sides reflects the political realities of power-sharing, the fear of doing further damage to housing prices, and a great deal of uncertainty about the best approach to rebuilding the mortgage business.
''Industry-defining legislation often takes more than one Congress to pass,'' said Peter Swire, who served until August as a special assistant to President Obama on housing finance issues. ''I think everyone wants a bigger role for private-sector housing finance going forward, and how to do that transition is just a big job.''
Representative Scott Garrett, the New Jersey Republican who is chairman of the House subcommittee that deals with housing finance, on Monday told a mortgage conference in Florida that the government should leave the mortgage business.
''I believe that, if there is to be any government assistance to homeownership, it should be limited to first-time homebuyers or rental housing,'' Mr. Garrett said.
But he added that he was not yet ready to move forward with legislation, telling the audience that he intended to explore the issues and develop a consensus.
There remains a general agreement among members of both parties that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should eventually disappear. The question is what should take their place.
The administration's decision to present a menu of options rather than a single plan reflects internal divisions. Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, and Shaun Donovan, Housing secretary, are among the advisers who believe that the government must provide a backstop for the industry, in part to ensure the loan availability. Some of the president's economic advisers, however, believe that such a guarantee amounts to an unnecessary subsidy, transferring taxpayer money to private lenders.
But Michael S. Barr, who served until December as the assistant Treasury secretary for financial institutions, said the decision was made to improve the White House's bargain position with House Republicans.
''The administration sees a lot of advantage in not stepping out strongly in one particular path because House Republicans will view that as an easy target,'' said Mr. Barr, who has returned to his position as a professor of law at the University of Michigan. ''If you lay out a bunch of options, you preserve the ability to have a conversation where after a long period of time you achieve a consensus outcome.''
Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill share the administration's view that it makes sense to press Republicans to move forward with their plan.
''They told me they knew the answer,'' said Representative Barney Frank, the ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, referring to Republican insistence that housing should be addressed in last year's legislation on financial regulation. ''They campaigned on that. They had the solution. How come they don't know now what they knew then?''
One compromise described in drafts of the administration's proposal would reduce the government's role to a last line of defense for the mortgage market. A version of this idea has been advocated by David S. Scharfstein, a finance professor at Harvard who previously worked as an adviser to Mr. Geithner.
The core of Mr. Scharfstein's proposal is to create a new government-owned corporation for the sole purpose of providing guarantees to mortgage investors. During normal times, the insurer would guarantee no more than 10 percent of mortgages, but in times of crisis, the government could raise that cap, offering guarantees to a broader range of investors so that money continues to flow into the mortgage market and credit remains available.
''We think private markets can do a good job providing mortgage credit during normal times, but the value of a government guarantee is really most pronounced during times of crisis,'' Mr. Scharfstein said in an interview Tuesday.
The administration's plans for winding down Fannie and Freddie are likely to command support on both sides of the political aisle. Roughly 90 percent of the money invested in mortgages currently flows through Fannie, Freddie and the Federal Housing Administration, which guarantees loans of lesser value.
The government already has told Fannie and Freddie to raise the fees that lenders are charged, reducing the incentive to sell loans to the government, encouraging private alternatives.
The White House also plans to express support for allowing limits on the size of loans the companies can buy to drop back to a maximum of $625,500. Congress voted in 2008 to raise that limit as high as $729,750, which will expire in September.
The companies also will be required to gradually reduce their huge portfolios of mortgage-backed securities, which they purchased as investments. Losses in those portfolios led the government to seize the companies in 2008.
''We're going to lay out a set of reforms to crowd private capital back in the business, to dial back the role of the government over time,'' Mr. Geithner said in a recent interview on the ''Charlie Rose'' show. That would create a window of several years to work out what happens next.

HEADLINE: OBAMA OFFERING RESCUE TO STATES

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER and SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
President Obama is proposing to ride to the rescue of states that have borrowed billions of dollars from the federal government to continue paying unemployment benefits during the economic downturn. His plan would give the states a two-year breather before automatic tax increases would hit employers, and before states would have to start paying interest on the loans.
The proposal, which administration officials said would be included in the 2012 budget that the president is scheduled to unveil next week, was greeted coolly by Republicans on Capitol Hill, who warned that the plan would ultimately force many states to raise their unemployment taxes in the years to come. 
But the White House is calculating that the proposal will ultimately appeal to Republicans because it involves a tax moratorium right now for hard-hit states during a still-fragile economic recovery.
Administration officials will make the case that the plan helps the economy and states in the short run, while bringing overdue changes to the unemployment insurance system in the long run. And Republican lawmakers could find themselves under pressure from Republican governors, whose states owe the federal government billions of dollars.
The administration is also betting that employers will back the proposal, especially in states where their taxes would otherwise go up. Michigan, for instance, owes the federal government $3.7 billion it borrowed to pay unemployment benefits. Under current law the state would be forced to pay $117 million in interest to the federal government this fall, and the federal tax on employers would automatically step up each year to repay the debt.
The state's newly elected Republican governor, Rick Snyder, has been lobbying for relief; his press secretary, Sara Wurfel, said that while they would need to see the details of the plan, they would ''very likely welcome the much-needed relief.''
Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, said, ''We are giving help to some states who have had to borrow and not been able yet to pay back.''
The states are in a tough spot. Many entered the recession with too little money in their unemployment trust funds, and they quickly ran through what little they had as unemployment rose and remained stubbornly high month after month.
With their own trust funds depleted, 30 states borrowed $42 billion from the federal government to continue paying unemployment benefits.
The federal stimulus act gave states a break on the interest for those loans for nearly two years, but that grace period ended Dec. 31. That has left hard-hit states, which have already laid off employees, cut services and raised taxes, facing an estimated $1.3 billion in interest payments to Washington due this fall.
Even more worrisome, to some states, is that current law would effectively raise taxes on employers by about $21 per worker in nearly half the states so they could start paying down their debt, which states worry would put pressure on businesses that have already been reluctant to hire in the downturn.
In his budget, officials said, Mr. Obama will call for deferring interest payments on the debt and postponing the automatic tax increases. Then, in 2014, to bring that money back into federal coffers, the administration proposes to raise the minimum level on which employers pay taxes.
Current law requires states to collect unemployment taxes on at least the first $7,000 of income; that minimum has not been raised in decades.
The president's proposal would raise that minimum taxable wage base to $15,000. The rate of the federal portion of the unemployment taxes would then be lowered, so the proposal would not raise federal taxes on states that do not owe the federal government money. But it would speed the rate at which states that do owe money repay the federal government, and allow states to collect more unemployment taxes to rebuild their trust funds if they do not lower their tax rates.
It was that prospect -- that the higher wage base would lead to higher taxes for states after 2014 -- that drew rebukes from Republicans in Congress.
Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan, who is the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, dismissed the plan. ''We need to reform our unemployment programs, but any plan that relies on more than doubling the tax base and then continuing to raise payroll taxes in perpetuity isn't going anywhere in the House,'' he said in a statement.
But if nothing is done, taxes will go up much sooner: employers in three states are already paying higher federal unemployment taxes because they have been in debt to the federal government longer, and soon nearly half the states could be in their position.
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the National Employment Law Project, two research organizations that are releasing a report on Wednesday calling for something very similar to the administration's proposal, calculated that delaying the automatic tax increases until 2014 would save employers $5 billion to $7 billion in taxes.
The Obama administration plans to hammer that point. ''Our view in response to anyone who wants to do nothing,'' said a senior administration official, ''is that their plan is about increasing taxes in some of the hardest-hit states involuntarily in 2011 and 2012, as opposed to giving states a choice on how to repay the federal government starting in 2014.''
Republicans in Congress might feel pressure from their counterparts in statehouses around the country: states with Republican governors, including Florida, Indiana, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, owe the federal government billions of dollars.
And 18 states have already raised their minimum taxable wage base to $15,000 or more, according to the National Association of State Workforce Agencies.
Iris J. Lav, a senior adviser at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and a co-author of the report, said that the unemployment system has ''a constellation of problems that need to be solved.''
''The near-term problem is the economy is not yet O.K.,'' she said. ''And both the interest payments and the principal repayments are cutting into employers, and it makes great sense to postpone them. The larger question is how you get states to solvency.''

HEADLINE: The Arts Of Cuba, Set to Wow New York

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

 BODY:
The Cuban rumba and dance troupe Los Munequitos de Matanzas hasn't performed in New York in nearly a decade. Danza Contemporanea de Cuba, which mixes Afro-Caribbean dance and classical European ballet and was founded in 1959, has never been to the United States. Neither have the socially conscious photographers Adonis Flores and Cirenaica Moreira.
All those and more than two dozen other artists will take part in a wide-ranging festival of Cuban arts that will last more than two months in locations around New York this spring. The festival, called ''Si Cuba!,'' is one of the most significant indications that cultural relations between the United States and Cuba are thawing after nearly a decade in a deep freeze.
The festival, which is to be announced formally on Wednesday, is scheduled to run from March 31 to June 16, with nearly every form and style of Cuban arts and culture represented, in settings as diverse as Carnegie Hall and the outdoor Big Screen Project; 14 city arts organizations will be taking part. Music, film, dance, painting, theater, photography and literature are all included, and dozens of performers and artists are expected to come from Cuba for the events. 
''We felt that this was the right time to do this, and New York the right place,'' said Karen Brooks Hopkins, president of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, which is the driving force behind the festival and will host many of the events. ''There's an optimism in the air about freeing up more interactions, which makes things feel very different than they did during the Bush administration and offers an opportunity for all of us to present work of a really high level in concentrated form.''
Ms. Hopkins and other festival organizers said their only objectives were to showcase the richness of Cuban culture and build bridges between American and Cuban creative artists. But with both the Obama administration and the dictatorship of Fidel and Raul Castro showing interest in reducing longstanding tensions between the two countries, the event obviously has political connotations too.
''Both governments have clearly identified the cultural space as a safe space for them to pursue connections between the two countries, so this fits very well into that context,'' said Julia E. Sweig, author of ''Cuba: What Everyone Needs to Know'' and a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. ''This could be like Ping-Pong diplomacy, except that it's happening in the cultural sphere.''
The Obama administration began loosening restrictions on travel to and from Cuba nearly two years ago, which led to a trickle of Cuban artists traveling to the United States and enabled American arts presenters to visit Havana and investigate the scene there. Last month the White House announced new measures that permit Americans to send money to Cuban citizens; expand opportunities for travel to Cuba by academic, religious and cultural groups; and allow charter flights from more American airports.
''When we were closed, and it was hard for Cuban artists to travel to the U.S., they were still producing and having their shows,'' said Ben Rodriguez-Cubenas, a Cuban-American who is chairman of the Cuban Artists Fund, which is devoted to promoting cultural exchanges. Mr. Rodriguez-Cubenas returned on Sunday from Havana, where he was coordinating arrangements for the festival. ''Cuba has always had a vibrant arts scene, and Americans are now rediscovering that.''
For its part, the Cuban government has recently eased some restrictions on private economic activity, which, Mr. Rodriguez-Cubenas noted, allows artists more creative and financial leeway. In addition, some of those scheduled to participate in the festival, among them a group of more than a dozen young visual artists exhibiting under the name Queloides (''Scar Tissue''), tackle subjects that until recently might have created political difficulties for them, like the racism present in a country whose black majority is led by a white gerontocracy.
Two painters, Alberto Casado and Rocio Garcia, will have a joint show called ''Concealed Faces'' because they ''deal with issues that aren't that much in evidence in our media,'' Corina Matamoros, curator of contemporary Cuban art at the Museum of Fine Arts in Havana, said in a telephone interview from that city. ''That doesn't mean they are directly political, but they address some of the less visible spheres of society, like crime, poverty and sexual identity.''
The Cuban artists participating in the festival include a handful of very familiar names, like the National Ballet of Cuba, led by the 90-year-old Alicia Alonso. But there are also lesser-known groups like El Ballet Folklorico Cutumba and Danza Contemporanea de Cuba; that troupe will perform at the Joyce Theater in May.
''We've been trying to invite this company for quite a long time, because they are very well trained, and their repertory is really quite fantastic,'' said Linda Shelton, executive director of the Joyce. ''They've had some training in Martha Graham technique, but their choreography really has developed without much influence of American choreographers, so we think New Yorkers will want to see what the dance scene there is like.''
Los Munequitos de Matanzas, founded 60 years ago, last played in New York in 2002. At the other end of the musical spectrum, the rapper Telmary Diaz will be performing on April 23 at BAMCafe.
''Among aficionados of drumming and Santeria, this really is the premier group, and people have been asking me for years when they were going to be coming back,'' said Robert H. Browning, artistic director of the World Music Institute, which is sponsoring Los Munequitos de Matanzas' May performances at Symphony Space. ''We tried to bring them again two or three times, but Cuba was always on the bad list.''
Several Cuban-American artists have also been invited to participate in festival events, literary readings and concerts among them. Cristina Garcia, the author of ''Dreaming in Cuban'' and other novels, said that will create opportunities for creative artists on both sides of the Straits of Florida to get to know one another -- and each country's works -- better.
''I plan to stay in New York for three or four weeks to partake of these riches, which are not the kind of thing you normally have any real access to,'' she said. ''And I think it's wonderfully advantageous for them too. Not only are they desperate for connections and influences and eager to see what is happening in all the different realms of the art world here, I also think they want to strut their stuff. I'm sure they are thinking this will lead to other invitations and travel, if things go well.''
Events in which Cuban artists are involved are contingent on their getting approval to leave their country and visas to travel to the United States. That was often a problem during the Bush administration, but organizers say they are less worried now, even though restrictions on the ability to pay Cubans for their work in the United States remain in place.
''It's obviously not done until it's done,'' said Susan L. Segal, president of the Americas Society, which will be sponsoring readings and panels on novels and plays and a multimedia exhibition focused on posters and film. ''But this is a very prestigious festival, so I can't imagine they will have problems getting visas.''

HEADLINE: A Friendship of Values, Not Convenience

BYLINE: By DANIEL GORDIS. 
Daniel Gordis is the senior vice president of the Shalem Center and the author, most recently, of ''Saving Israel: How the Jewish People Can Win a War That May Never End.''

 BODY:
Jerusalem
FOR decades Shimon Peres, now Israel's president, has spoken of his country's yearning for a ''new Middle East,'' one in which Israel is at peace with its neighbors, regional economies cooperate and the conflict with the Palestinians is finally set aside. Now, with Egypt's government on the edge of collapse, Israel is suddenly faced with a ''new Middle East'' -- and Israelis are terrified.
Many Westerners believe that the events in Egypt are a disaster for the Jewish state. Its most important regional ally faces possible chaos and an Islamist takeover. Add to this King Abdullah II's recent dismissal of his cabinet in Jordan (the only other Arab country that has signed a peace treaty with Israel), Hezbollah's quiet coup in Lebanon last month, a resurgent Syria and an increasingly Islamist Turkey, and you can understand why many Israelis feel surrounded, as they did decades ago. 
In the short run America faces an uncomfortable choice. It can support Egypt's president, Hosni Mubarak, who is at least marginally pro-Western and has maintained the cold peace with Israel initiated by his predecessor, Anwar el-Sadat. But Mr. Mubarak is also a ruthless despot. Alternately, Washington can support the democracy movement, but with the knowledge that democracy could bring anti-Western, anti-Israel and possibly Islamist leaders to power.
In short, none of the parties vying for control of Egypt share America's fundamental values of genuine democracy, a free press, women's rights and minority protections.
But the threat of chaos, and even Islamist rule, might have a silver lining. It is all the more obvious that there is only one country in the region that has the same values as America: Israel. If America reacts to recent events by increasing its support for those who share its values, it could reassure a suddenly surrounded Israel and perhaps even move the peace process with the Palestinians forward.
Until now the central pillar of President Obama's strategy for restarting peace talks has been to pressure Israel to cease building settlements. Settlements may or may not be wise, but where has the equivalent pressure on the Palestinians been?
The administration has failed to insist that the Palestinian Authority recognize Israel as a Jewish state, even though Israel has recognized the national aspirations of the Palestinian people. And Mr. Obama has allowed the Palestinian flag to fly in Washington, a symbolic signal of support for Palestinian statehood. All without the Palestinians making any concessions.
As a result, the United States has unwittingly created disincentives for the Palestinians to negotiate with Israel. Without pressure from Washington, the political position of Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, is growing stronger each month, abetted by the growing number of countries that have recently recognized Palestinian statehood.
But the chaos throughout the Arab world could force Washington to realize that all its coddling of oppressive regimes in Egypt, Jordan and Yemen has done nothing to spread its values in a region that desperately needs them.
In that event America might, at long last, come to understand that its best hope for peace in the region is to throw its weight behind Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, even if he isn't its Israeli politician of choice.
In doing so, Mr. Obama should make it clear to the Palestinians that what the United States respects is democracy, a free press, equal rights for women and a commitment to the free exchange of ideas. If he wishes to pressure Israel on settlements, he should publicly pressure the Palestinians on something equally politically fraught for Mr. Abbas. Washington should bring Israel in from the cold, and let Mr. Abbas know that time is not on his side.

HEADLINE: Mexico Hesitates to Intervene as Rising Peso Pressures Its Exports

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN

 BODY:
MEXICO CITY -- Six years ago, Benjamin Hernandez turned his family's small metal-stamping company into an exporter. Although the firm barely survived the global economic crisis, it bounced back last year. But now he has a new worry.
Mexico's peso is rapidly rising against the United States dollar, which means that the cost of producing in Mexico for the American market is climbing in dollar terms. But because Mr. Hernandez faces global competition for his plant's fire extinguisher brackets, ''increasing our price isn't an option,'' he said. 
So Mr. Hernandez keeps reinvesting in the company, called Bicar, and praying for the United States economic recovery to continue, to stimulate his sales. ''We just have to make a better effort to be more efficient,'' he said.
That seems to be the business attitude of Mexico right now, as the rising peso puts pressure on its exports even as Mexican policy makers are reluctant to intervene.
''We decided many years ago to bet on a free-floating peso,'' the Mexican finance minister, Ernesto Cordero, said in a radio interview last week. ''It has given us good results, and we are convinced of this.''
The peso's value began climbing last year and has increased more than 9 percent since the beginning of 2010. And now the trend is speeding up, with the peso having risen a full 3 percent so far this year alone.
As the exchange rate has dipped below 12 pesos to the dollar, the local press is full of speculation over what it calls ''the superpeso.''
The reasons behind the increase are the same as those pushing up currencies in other emerging markets. Facing low yields in developed countries, investors have bought securities in Latin America and Asia where returns are higher.
In a number of countries, this ''hot money'' has set off alarms, raising fears that climbing currencies will make exports uncompetitive and create asset bubbles. Authorities in several counties, including Brazil, Chile, Thailand and Korea, have imposed varying controls to try to brake the flow of this speculative money.
But Mexican authorities have ruled out intervention.
Despite the peso's increase, Mr. Cordero, the finance minister, said last week that it had not risen as fast as other Latin American currencies.
Still, the superpeso talk is rooted in concern that fickle investors could leave the country as fast as they entered, if they sense that the currency's value cannot hold. In response, the government has been building up reserves and recently increased a credit line from the International Monetary Fund.
''To any foreign investor in securities, this government is signaling that it is going to hang on to a very strong currency,'' said Rogelio Ramirez de la O, an economist, who argues that the government prefers a strong peso because it brings stability. ''It is a no-brainer to buy the peso.''
But the risk, he said, is that ''you are inviting speculators to give you a capital outflow whenever something changes in the United States, particularly if U.S. interest rates rise.''
Export figures suggest that the strong peso has not caused any harm yet. Although the currency is now at its strongest level since October 2008, Mexico registered blistering growth in exports, which drove an economic expansion above 5 percent last year.
Mexican exports rose almost 30 percent in 2010. The standout was the auto industry, where exports grew 52 percent to a record.
In part the export boom is a rebound from a disastrous 2009, when the economy shrank by 6 percent as the recession caused demand in the United States for Mexican products to dry up.
And yet, while it is still too early to tell if the rising peso will damp exports this year, it is already forcing executives to revise the spreadsheets they drew up several months ago as they planned for 2011.
Nicolas M. Guillet, the president of Salzgitter Mannesmann Precision, the Mexican subsidiary of a German supplier, said the steel tubes his plants produced for the auto industry were priced in dollars. But the stronger peso means that his costs for labor, gas and electricity are all rising in dollar terms.
Since he cannot pass the increases on to his customers, the impact is on the bottom line. ''It has eaten a significant chunk of my margin,'' he said.
The company, which set up production in 2007 outside Guadalajara, has been studying how to hedge against the stronger peso. ''This creates an extra layer of complexity,'' Mr. Guillet said. ''Our strength and skills are in producing good parts at a competitive cost, not in managing currencies.''
Still, even with the pressure from the rising peso, he expects sales to increase 60 percent this year, on top of a 100 percent increase in 2010.
Mexican manufacturers have several advantages that could help them stay competitive even if the peso continues to strengthen, said Luis Arcentales, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York.
One of those is the transformation of Mexican manufacturing under the North American Free Trade Agreement. Plants here are now locked into a complex logistical network of suppliers and producers that is unlikely to unravel overnight simply because costs fall in other countries.
Another advantage is that Mexico's main competitor, China, is not as much of a threat as it once was, as Chinese wages rise. A decade ago, Mexican hourly wages were more than 200 percent higher than Chinese wages. Now, Mexican workers make only about 14 percent more than their Chinese competitors, according to figures from the International Labor Organization.
For small producers like Mr. Hernandez, the metal stamper, who has begun to rehire the employees he let go during the recession, his company's hard-won competitiveness means he can withstand a stronger peso for some time. But at some point, he said, ''everything has its limit.''

HEADLINE: When a Shock Is Good Policy

BYLINE: By JOHN FOLEY and CHRISTOPHER SWANN

 BODY:
When China raises interest rates, speculators quake. The after-hours move on Tuesday had a nearly instantaneous effect on global markets, initially sending copper back below $10,000 a metric ton and crude oil below $100 a barrel. If only the Chinese economy were so responsive.
China has good reason to tighten monetary policy. The economy is overheating, with its gross domestic product growing at an alarmingly high annualized rate of 9.8 percent in the fourth quarter. Domestic demand remains prodigious and economic activity remains very strong. 
As well as a reason, there is an opportunity. Yields on 10-year United States Treasuries have risen to nearly a nine-month high, reducing the theoretical profits from borrowing in dollars and investing in China. That means a rate rise is less likely to attract the dreaded ''hot money'' -- though China's tough capital controls anyway make that something of a paper tiger.
But Tuesday's quarter-point rise in the benchmark one-year deposit rate to 3 percent won't push real deposit rates, now at negative 2 percent, into positive territory. Savers still have little incentive to put money in the bank. Nor will it curb the inflationary lending habits of banks. They lent $76 billion in the first week of January alone, and their behavior is more sensitive to balance sheet capacity than changes in the marginal price of debt.
Higher rates also won't do much to tame rapidly rebounding exports. The recent purchasing managers index survey showed export orders, adjusted for seasonal oddities, expanding at their fastest rate in a year, according to Goldman Sachs. No wonder: China has so far passed up the opportunity to constrain exports, and rebalance its economy, through a decisive revaluation of its currency.
Bank lending, roaring demand and real deposit rates will no doubt get their turn for focused policy action. Expect further rate increases, property curbs and much fatherly advice -- all choreographed, like the latest increase, to avoid shocks. The trouble is that sometimes, when inflationary thinking takes root, only a shock will do.
An Export Trap
Foreign natural gas prices can be at least twice as high as they are in the United States. So gas producers are raring to export a good chunk of America's natural gas bounty. But it's a risky bet for builders of costly shipping terminals. And unrest in the Middle East should ram home to policy makers the wisdom of using natural resources at home to reduce dependence on imports.
A glut of gas in the United States, fed by vast new shale fields, has kept prices at around $4.50 per million British thermal units. Across the Atlantic, producers can expect to get $8.50 or more, while long-term contracts in Asia can reach as high as $15.
At first blush, that makes the commercial logic for exporting look unassailable. Several pioneers, like Cheniere Energy and Freeport LNG Development, plan to set up the infrastructure to make this possible. Dominion Resources said last week it might build a liquefied natural gas, or L.N.G., export plant on the site of its existing import terminal in Maryland.
But erecting the facilities to cool natural gas to minus 260 degrees Fahrenheit requires multibillion-dollar investments. By the time construction is completed it's possible that Europe and Asia will have joined the shale revolution, driving down prices in those markets too.
It would not be the first time that Cheniere and its type have been wrong-footed. Hugely expensive L.N.G. import facilities -- built in expectation that the United States would become more dependent on foreign sources -- now operate at below 10 percent capacity, according to the consultancy Wood Mackenzie.
Building export capacity would get natural gas explorers out of their immediate bind. But trouble in Egypt and elsewhere is a broader reminder of the hazard of relying on energy imported from unstable places. And using policy measures to increase the use of natural gas in the transport sector -- as the state of California is doing -- offers a relatively low-cost way of cutting back on imported crude.
In fact, the huge spare supplies of domestically produced gas suggest the country has not done enough to exploit its shale windfall. Until America has done more to kick its addiction to foreign oil, any big push to export hydrocarbons looks plain loopy.

HEADLINE: VW Workers Agree to Pact Bolstering Share of Profit

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- Volkswagen employees agreed to a wage deal Tuesday that ensured them a larger share of soaring profit in the German auto industry and might signal an end to a decade in which pay barely kept pace with inflation. 
''The time for ultralow wage increases in Germany is over,'' said Jorg Kramer, the chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
But he and other analysts said that the agreement at Volkswagen, the largest European carmaker, would not have much immediate effect on its rivals or other manufacturers, because their labor contracts do not expire until next year.
That means that, for now, the deal is unlikely to increase the already worrisome inflation rate, or the pressure on the European Central Bank to raise official interest rates.
''I don't think it will have any effect on European monetary policy,'' Rolf Schneider, who is in charge of macroeconomic research at the German insurer Allianz, said of the VW agreement.
The German economic boom has been driven partly by demand in China and other emerging markets for Volkswagen, Mercedes and BMW cars. Bayerische Motoren Werke said Tuesday that sales of BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce brand vehicles rose 28 percent in January from a year earlier, as sales in the United States and Europe also recovered.
Audi, a unit of Volkswagen that competes with BMW in the market for premium cars, said that its unit sales rose 23 percent last month, delivering the best January for the brand.
One reason for Germany's export boom and competitiveness in world markets is that, for a decade, workers have accepted modest wage increases in return for more job security. Now, with German unemployment declining and oil prices putting pressure on consumers, economists have been alert for signs that the period of wage restraint is ending.
After a long bargaining session in Hanover that ended early Tuesday, the IG Metall union and Volkswagen agreed to give employees a 3.2 percent increase in base pay, plus a bonus equal to 1 percent of pay and no less than 500 euros, or $680.
Unlike Daimler and BMW, Volkswagen negotiates directly with IG Metall. In Germany, wage negotiations typically take place at a regional level between industry groups and unions.
A general increase in wages in Germany, which has the largest economy in the euro area, would press the European Central Bank to raise interest rates, even though countries like Spain and Ireland are still struggling with slow growth. Economists say that monetary policy is already too loose for Germany, as the bank focuses on helping the weaker members of the euro area.
Yet, the pressure from German wages has not been alarming. Mr. Kramer said that only a quarter of the unionized workers in Germany could negotiate a pay raise this year, so the overall increase in pay for workers covered by collective bargaining would be only an estimated 1.8 percent.
''The end of ultralow wage increases will be fully reflected only next year,'' Mr. Kramer said.
Ralph Wiechers, chief economist of the German Engineering Federation, an industry group, said that many companies still had workers on short shifts and had not fully recovered from the recession of 2009.
The need to preserve jobs at these companies will help restrain wage demands next year. ''Lots of companies are still a long way from their all-time highs,'' Mr. Wiechers said.

HEADLINE: Tribe's Plan for Catskill Casino, Backed by Paterson, Faces Rejection in Washington

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
A proposed Native American casino on 333 acres in the Catskills is likely to be rejected by federal authorities next week, only three months after Gov. David A. Patersonapproved the $560 million project in the waning days of his administration.
The former governor signed agreements with the Stockbridge-Munsees, a tribe based in Wisconsin with roots in New York, in November to permit a Las Vegas-style casino near Monticello, about 90 miles from New York City, and to settle the tribe's land claim to 23,000 acres in upstate Madison County. 
The casino seemed to be on a fast track. Having negotiated with the Interior and Justice Departments for more than a year before signing the deals, the tribe expected to get the necessary federal approvals this month.
But in January, according to the tribe, federal officials suddenly expressed misgivings about the viability of the tribe's land claim and the ability of the Interior Department to approve it without Congressional action, as the tribe wanted. In a Jan. 31 letter to the department, a lawyer for the tribe acknowledged that department officials had told him it was ''highly unlikely'' the officials would change their views.
The Interior Department has done ''an about-face,'' said Kimberly Vele, president of the Stockbridge-Munsee Community Band of Mohicans. If the agreements are rejected, Ms. Vele said, the tribe will resume its fight for the land in Madison County.
''We'll go back to fighting it out in the court system, which is an unfortunate consequence,'' she said. ''I'm confident that the tribe has a very good case.''
Nedra Darling, a spokeswoman for the department's Bureau of Indian Affairs, said only, ''The Department of the Interior is in the process of reviewing the compact.''
The department must approve or disapprove the agreements by Feb. 18. Under federal law, the agreements would effectively be approved if the department took no action by then. But recently, the department has been reluctant to approve casinos far from a tribe's home base.
Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, and local officials have supported the casino project, which they say would create jobs and bring visitors to an economically depressed area.
But the project has come under fierce criticism from some legislators and rival gambling operators, who have thousands of electronic slot machines at nine racetracks in the state. The Oneida tribe, which operates the Turning Stone casino near Syracuse, also objected to allowing what it called an out-of-state tribe to set up a casino in New York.
Last week, some owners of the slot parlors at the tracks, known as racinos, filed a lawsuit in State Supreme Court in Albany aimed at blocking the Stockbridge-Munsees from building the casino. At the moment when the state is facing a $10 billion deficit and thousands of layoffs, the racinos assert that a Stockbridge-Munsee casino would result in the loss of 1,000 jobs at racinos and of $400 million a year in slot revenue that now flows to the state.
They say the Catskill casino, with slot machines as well as roulette, blackjack and poker tables, would almost certainly wipe out the nearby racino at Monticello Raceway and lure customers from the Yonkers, Saratoga and soon-to-open Aqueduct racinos.
Officials at the racinos, particularly Yonkers and Aqueduct, are also worried about the possibility that a full casino could be built on Long Island by the Shinnecock Indians, who won federal recognition last year.
James D. Featherstonhaugh, an owner of the track and slot parlor in Saratoga, said racinos paid a tax of 42 percent on net gambling revenues, collectively generating about $1 billion a year for education. But, he said, Indian casinos pay a maximum of 25 percent of slot revenues to the state. ''The Stockbridge-Munsee casino has an unfair competitive advantage that seriously jeopardizes the future of New York's racinos and the horse racing industry as a whole,'' he said.
Not long ago, Mr. Featherstonhaugh, who is also a prominent Albany lobbyist, represented the St. Regis Mohawks who tried to build a casino in Monticello.
The Stockbridge-Munsees say the casino, which would provide the equivalent of 4,900 full-time jobs, would be the single largest construction project in Sullivan County. The tribe has agreed to pay the state up to 25 percent of the slot revenue and provide the county with $15 million a year.
''Interior said this is the path you could pursue,'' said Ms. Vele of the Stockbridge-Munsee. ''I don't know what happened.''

HEADLINE: China Raises Interest Rates To Counter Inflation Risk

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- China on Tuesday raised interest rates for the third time since October, in the latest sign that the authorities were trying to temper economic growth and prevent inflation from escalating further. 
The central bank in Beijing raised its benchmark one-year deposit rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 3 percent, and its one-year lending rate by a similar amount, to 6.06 percent.
The timing of the announcement, at the very end of the Lunar New Year holiday, which has kept mainland Chinese markets closed for the last week, was in line with what many analysts had expected.
In fact, many economists forecast still more increases and other measures this year as the battle to combat price increases intensifies. ''There are plenty of reasons to expect inflation to pick up further in the next few months,'' Brian Jackson, an analyst at the Royal Bank of Canada in Hong Kong, wrote in a note after the rate increase announcement Tuesday.
''Gradual policy rate increases in the months ahead should help to slow down investment in parts of the economy at risk of overheating, while also reducing the risk that more aggressive and disruptive action may be required at a later stage,'' he wrote.
Buoyed by ample lending and extensive state investment projects, the Chinese economy powered ahead last year, overtaking that of Japan to become the world's second-largest economy after the United States.
Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Jan. 20 put the pace of growth at 10.3 percent for 2010, up from 9.2 percent in 2009 and significantly above what analysts had expected. Inflation came in at 4.6 percent for December, well above what the authorities are comfortable with, and could rise further, economists believe.
As in many other emerging economies, rapid growth has combined with easy credit and inflows of cash from overseas to push up asset and consumer prices this year.
Beijing has reacted with a range of tools aimed at containing price increases. These have included measures aimed specifically at the hot real estate sector -- like property taxes recently announced for some cities -- and instructions to the country's state-controlled banks to lend less.
The reserve requirement ratio for state-controlled banks -- which effectively dictates the amount that lenders have to set aside against loans, and thus affects how much they can lend -- has been raised seven times since early 2010.
Currency appreciation will also most likely be part of Beijing's efforts to curb inflation over 2011, said Mr. Jackson, the R.B.C. economist.
The pace of any such increases, however, is likely to remain muted, analysts and bankers with knowledge of policy makers' views have said. The renminbi has already been rising at an annualized rate of 5.7 percent against the dollar since China broke the currency's peg to the dollar last June.

HEADLINE: Data Centers Offer Hope for St. Louis Office Market

BYLINE: By ROBERT SHAROFF

 BODY:
ST. LOUIS -- Several recent transactions are raising the possibility that this city's downtown, a depressed office market with an overall vacancy rate of over 22 percent, may become a regional hub for computer software and data-center companies.
The deals include a decision by Unisys to locate a new software center in a century-old building a block from the riverfront and the expansion of several large data-center operations by other companies. The Unisys project in particular is seen by city officials and developers as a coup because St. Louis edged out the Minneapolis-St. Paul area and Salt Lake City to win the project.
Ted Davies, the president of Unisys's federal systems business, said two factors were important in the choice of St. Louis. The first is proximity to the Rural Development agency at the Agriculture Department, which has a sizable office in the city and is expected by Unisys to be one of the new center's main customers.
The second concern was the cost comparison between St. Louis and Reston, Va., where Unisys's federal systems division has its headquarters. ''We looked at labor and real estate and found the arbitrage to be about 25 percent,'' Mr. Davies said. 
The new center opened in November and occupies about 10,000 square feet at 555 Washington Avenue, a five-story former department store building with an elaborate ornamented facade. The center will eventually have about 300 employees.
''We wanted a 'cool' building,'' Mr. Davies said. ''We are hiring a lot of younger folks, and they like the look and feel of being downtown.''
The building, in many ways, symbolizes the promise and the problems of the St. Louis office market.
Downtown St. Louis, a district of roughly one-and-a-half square miles that begins at the riverfront, has about 13 million square feet of office space, down almost a third from 20 years ago. (These figures omit single-user buildings.) Much of the remaining space is in buildings from the 1920s and earlier. The last major new multitenant office building went up over 20 years ago.
Which is not to deny the district its charm. There are blocks and even entire streets -- like Washington Avenue -- that are unchanged from the days of the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition. The district has numerous landmarks, including Louis Sullivan's 1892 Wainwright Building and Alfred Mullet's 1884 Old Post Office building.
Over the last decade, many of these older buildings -- more than three million square feet -- have been converted to apartments or cultural uses. Indeed, for the first time in a century, St. Louis has a substantial downtown residential population -- 12,500 according to the Partnership for Downtown St. Louis, an advocacy group.
Still, there has been a steady outflow of office tenants, many of which moved to Clayton, a suburb six miles west of downtown where office towers have sprouted over the last decade.
Peter Krombach, a senior managing director of CB Richard Ellis here, said it was a challenge to attract tenants to the city's many older properties. ''There hasn't been a new office building built downtown in a long time, and when tenants are looking for space they're normally looking for new space,'' he said.
New construction remains a distant dream. ''You can count on one hand the sites for new office facilities downtown,'' said Richard Ward, a development consultant and urban planner with Zimmer Real Estate Services here, but it turns out that the older buildings with their high ceilings and heavy construction function well as modern data centers.
The data-center business has a number of models. Some companies own their own data centers, while others use third-party providers to house and maintain their operations. And to ensure redundancy, most companies have more than one data center, with the additional centers usually some distance from the primary center.
The providers include companies that own buildings but not the equipment inside of them, and vice versa. There are also companies that own buildings and the equipment.
Brian Corde, a corporate site consultant with Atlas Insight in Fair Haven, N.J., said data centers were expensive to develop and operate. ''It's not unusual for a data center to have a monthly utility bill of well north of $1 million,'' he said. ''It's a huge investment for a company.''
The reduced commercial presence in St. Louis is a major reason for its popularity with data-center companies. The city's power grid remains from the time downtown was dominated by large warehouse and industrial companies, and has excess capacity.
''The base level grid that serves the buildings was put in years ago,'' said Robert Guller, who has developed several data-center buildings downtown. ''The big industrial users back then all required a lot of power, and now it's not being used.''
Commercial electricity rates in St. Louis are 41 percent below the national average, according to Ameren Missouri, a utility company. It attributed that to strong regulation of utilities in Missouri, the use of inexpensive coal to generate power and lower costs in general in the Midwest.
Digital Realty Trust, a real estate investment trust based in San Francisco that specializes in data-center buildings and has operations in 21 American cities, has two centers in downtown St. Louis, at 210 North Tucker Street and 900 Walnut Street.
The company is expanding the larger of the two, on North Tucker, by adding 30,000 to 60,000 square feet of space and bringing in an additional 16 megawatts of electricity.
David J. Caron, the senior vice president of portfolio management at Digital Realty, declined to reveal the cost of the upgrade, but did say, ''We're spending millions to bring in the power.''
''We see the potential for growth here,'' Mr. Caron said. ''Aside from the local business community, St. Louis is an attractive market for a company that has a data center in its own city, but then needs a second location. St. Louis can provide a good operating environment because of the cost of power.''
When the expansion is complete, Digital will have about 400,000 square feet of data-center space downtown with a total of 30 megawatts of power.
Two other local data-center companies, Xiolink and Contegix, are also expanding.
Xiolink, a 12-year-old company that has owned equipment, but not buildings housing it, recently acquired a 100,000-square-foot building at 1111 Olive Street and is converting it to data-center space.
The building, which once housed printing presses for The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, has been vacant for almost a decade. Xiolink paid $2.25 million for the building and is spending $14.5 million to update it with the raised floors, enhanced power and cooling capabilities that are mandatory for data centers. The building will have six megawatts of power.
''The infrastructure is a prime draw downtown,'' said Brad Pittenger, the chief executive of Xiolink. ''We have access to more power than you do in most locations in the country and also to advanced fiber optic networks for carrier lines.''
Contegix recently added 4,000 square feet of space to the 20,000 square feet it occupies at Digital's 900 Walnut Street, a century-old building that, like 1111 Olive, was built to house printing presses.
The new space is being used as additional room for the company's 41 employees. ''We're projecting that we will grow by 65 percent in 2011,'' said Matthew Porter, the chief executive.
''I always find this building very poetic,'' he said. ''One hundred years ago, it housed heavy machinery designed to distribute knowledge and information. Today, in a totally different form, it's doing the same thing.''

HEADLINE: Shares Post Gains After China Raises Interest Rates

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average closed higher for the seventh consecutive day on Tuesday in the longest series of gains for the index since July.
McDonald's was the biggest gainer of the stocks in the Dow, rising 2.6 percent after reporting January sales that were higher than analysts had expected. 
Investors took in stride a move by China's central bank to control inflation by raising short-term interest rates.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 71.52 points, or 0.59 percent, to close at 12,233.15. The index has had only one down day in the last 10, on Jan. 28, when the protests in Egypt escalated.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 5.52 points, or 0.42 percent, to 1,324.57. The Nasdaq composite index rose 13.06 points, or 0.47 percent, to 2,797.05.
China raised interest rates for the third time since October in an effort to keep prices from rising too rapidly. The country's economic boom has resulted in higher prices, forcing some poor families to spend up to half of their incomes on food.
Many large companies in the United States have counted on spending in China for growth. Previously, interest rate increases in China have led to stock losses in the United States because of fears that spending there would fall.
Brian Gendreau, a market strategist at the Financial Network Investment Corporation, said investors were becoming less concerned about slower spending in China because they were more confident that the United States economy would grow on its own.
''Raising interest rates is what the Chinese need to do when they have such an overheated economy,'' he said.
Bond prices fell, extending a week of losses and sending their yields higher. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 25/32, to 90 31/32, and the yield rose to 3.74 percent from 3.63 percent late Monday.
The government auctioned $32 billion of three-year notes at a yield of 1.34 percent, the highest borrowing rate the government has had to pay on those notes since last May. Interest from foreign buyers was relatively weak.
Better economic news, including a drop in the unemployment rate, has led investors to sell low-yielding government bonds over the last two weeks. Some of that money is going into stocks, especially those of large corporations that pay big dividends.
Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial, said the Dow average had been benefiting from a flight of money out of bonds as conservative investors sought large, relatively stable companies like the 30 that make up the Dow industrials.
''If you were in bonds, chances are you'll buy the large companies with strong balance sheets,'' Mr. Krosby said.
Walt Disney rose 3.7 percent in after-hours trading. The company reported earnings after the market closed that beat expectations, helped in part by higher advertising revenue at its ESPN and ABC television networks.
Avon Products fell 3 percent to close at $28.47 after its fourth-quarter earnings fell and missed expectations.

HEADLINE: Riches Flow Into Nigeria, But Are Lost After Arrival

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

 BODY:
YENAGOA, Nigeria -- The oil money has coursed through this swampy, sprawling settlement in the Niger Delta, a paper gusher that has yielded ambitious unfinished skeletons: a ghostly high-rise hotel; a luxury shopping center-in-waiting; a giant hospital that is mostly empty; housing and other projects, some completed but many not.
Closer to the people, schools are crumbling, commerce spills from squalid shacks, soldiers operate checkpoints and militants hide in the creeks.
Billions of dollars of Nigeria's immense oil riches have been funneled to places like this in the last year alone, yet they have not brought the country peace. The region is still plagued by huge disparities of wealth, kidnappings, sabotage and threats of more to come. 
In recent months this conundrum -- a flood of oil wealth yet continued unrest -- has emerged again amid signs that the rebellion is not over. A deadly bombing attack claimed by southern insurgents struck at the heart of Nigerian power in Abuja, the capital, killing at least 12 people last October. Since then, gunmen have attacked an offshore oil rig and seized hostages, including two Americans. The Nigerian military has conducted raids on militants, with civilian casualties. Two weeks ago, the leading militant group threatened a new wave of attacks on the oil industry.
Making sure oil profits return to this impoverished region has long been a rallying cry of the militants, but the recent increase in money here -- a great deal more money -- has brought more questions than calm to the Niger Delta.
In particular, foreign diplomats, analysts and rating agencies, not to mention the residents themselves, wonder what the government has done with nearly $30 billion in supplementary oil revenues. More of this money has gone to the Niger Delta than anywhere else, under a federal formula that favors the oil-producing region, but evidence of how it has been spent is elusive.
Toward the end of 2008, about $30 billion sat in Nigeria's Excess Crude Account, a government fund of extra revenue that exceeds what the government has budgeted from the projected price of oil. When oil prices are high, money flows into the account, and it becomes an irresistible, unaccounted-for jackpot, especially for the largely autonomous governors of Nigeria's 36 states, according to financial analysts and good-government groups.
From $30 billion, the fund had trickled down to about $450 million by mid-2010, according to Veronica Kalema of Fitch Ratings, which late last year downgraded Nigeria's outlook from ''stable'' to ''negative'' partly because of the vast and largely unaccounted outflow from the Excess Crude Account.
By the beginning of this year, the fund had trickled down to about $300 million, according to reports in the Nigerian media. Officials with the Finance Ministry did not respond to calls for comment this month, but about $15 billion was spent in 2010 alone, Ms. Kalema said.
Some of the vast pile of cash, perhaps $5 billion to $8 billion, has been spent on so-far unfruitful efforts to upgrade Nigeria's feeble power output, which remains no better than that of a mid-size American city for a nation of over 150 million people, Africa's most populous. But the rest, some $22 billion or more, remains largely unaccounted for.
''Where the hell did the remaining $22 billion-plus go?'' asked a foreign-based adviser to the Nigerian government who asked to remain anonymous because of his continuing relationship with it. ''Most of the remaining $22 billion was drawn down by the state governments without any particular projects to spend it on, just on the basis of, there's money sitting in the accounts, lets draw it down.''
It is entirely possible that nobody has a clear picture of what has become of this vast sum after it was parceled out at meetings of the state governors.
''It's basically free money,'' said another financial consultant who has advised the Nigerian government. ''Once you get it, there are no checks and balances on what happens to it.''
The results, or lack of them, are visible in places like this steamy state capital at Nigeria's southern edge. Empty grandiose shells -- the unfinished hotel looks like a giant waffle cone -- tower over swamps, near brand-new poured-concrete government buildings alongside ramshackle corrugated-metal-roofed shacks.
Along Isaac Boro Road are sprawling mansions and hotels, some finished and some not, and ''all or nearly all belong to members of the state house of assembly, which is quite disconcerting to me,'' said Antoine Heuty of the Revenue Watch Institute, financed by George Soros, which runs a budget-watching project here in Bayelsa State.
Some $200 million from the Excess Crude Account alone was pouring into Bayelsa State each month during parts of 2008. But local watchdogs contend that after money was approved for projects, it was never spent and remains unaccounted for. They cite about $2 million planned for the renovation of a hospital at Igbogene (except that there was no hospital there in need of renovation, they said), $2.6 million approved for an AIDS facility that state Health Ministry officials were unaware of, and $3.3 million for hospital construction in Bayelsa that the Health Ministry also knew nothing about.
''We have these situations occurring over and over, and we find it is just very difficult to have a clear picture of how money is spent,'' said Philip Slaboh of the Bayelsa NGO Forum, a good-government group.
Yet Bayelsa State has become, in theory, one of the more transparent in Nigeria, putting its annual budget on the Internet and moving toward paying salaries electronically, not in the cash that is otherwise omnipresent in Nigeria, aiding corruption. Earlier in the decade, a former Bayelsa governor, Diepreye Alamieyeseigha, siphoned millions in oil money into private accounts before fleeing Britain disguised as a woman in an attempt to escape prosecution. He was convicted of fraud in 2007 and sentenced to two years' imprisonment.
But the new transparency is limited. ''I agree that nobody knows how much money coming into the state is allocated to agriculture, education'' and other areas, said Dimieari von Kemedi, a top official in Bayelsa's state government.
An audit of three state ministries under way late last year ''is not going to make those ministries look good, so we don't want to do it for the whole government,'' Mr. Kemedi said. ''You don't want to collapse government.''
He defended the unfinished hotel tower and mall: ''Those who think government should not be building hotels have limited ambitions,'' Mr. Kemedi said.
Nearby, a light bulb hung in a classroom at the Okaka Community Primary School, and giant chunks of plaster were missing from a covered walkway to protect the students during frequent rains. Not a single school in Yenagoa has been renovated, said Wisdom Wilson of the Relief Initiative for Good Governance and Sustainable Development.
''Since the return of democracy, people have not seen any physical dividend,'' said Alagoa Morris, of the Environmental Rights Action group, in Yenagoa. Mr. Morris travels the region, and though skeptical about the continued existence of militant camps, notes: ''It would be wrong for us to say all the arms have been dropped.''
He added, ''It's so sad that the federal government has not addressed the underlying problems of the militancy.''

HEADLINE: City Weighs Extending a Tax-Break Deadline

BYLINE: By CARA BUCKLEY

 BODY:
Hundreds of vacant building sites are strewn about New York City, the scars of the housing crash and credit crunch.
Now the city's housing department is hoping to kick-start construction at the lots by extending a deadline by which developers must finish their projects to qualify for tax breaks. But critics said it would cost the city too much in property taxes and would be a missed opportunity to build more affordable housing.
The tax benefit in question, called 421-a, bestows property tax breaks for up to 25 years on new multifamily buildings. It was put in place in the 1970s to spur development, but it drew criticism as an unnecessary giveaway as the local real estate market heated up. 
The benefit, which has been used primarily for luxury development, cost the city $408 million in foregone tax revenue in 2006, according to the city's finance department, and a projected $930 million in 2011, the Independent Budget Office said. So the City Council, in 2006, and State Legislature, in 2007, tightened the program's rules to require that developers build more affordably priced units in order to be eligible for the exemption.
To qualify under the older, more relaxed rules, developers had to file building permits and start laying foundations by June 2008, and complete their projects within three years. This deadline caused a wild flurry of activity as developers rushed to file permits under the old rules: 17,000 building permits were issued in June 2008, according to the Real Estate Board of New York, an increase of more than 300 percent from the same time a year before.
And then the real estate market went from bad to much, much worse, as demand and lending dried up. Many sites that were to be developed under the old 421-a tax benefit remain fallow as the June deadline draws closer. Now the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, which determines eligibility for the abatement, wants to extend the completion deadline by three years, in the hopes of jump-starting construction.
Rafael E. Cestero, the city's housing commissioner, said that his agency was granting many individual developers extensions anyway, and that this change merely extended benefits that the developers would have taken advantage of had the market never crashed. He also expected the proposed adjustment, scheduled to be the subject of a public hearing on Wednesday, would help the ailing local construction industry, for which unemployment is hovering at 20 percent, according to the New York City Central Labor Council. The Real Estate Board of New York estimates that the number of stalled sites filed under 421-a account for 7,000 to 10,000 units.
''What we ought to do is get sites in construction, create jobs, fuel the economy,'' Mr. Cestero said, ''I don't think there is any other route to take.''
But critics of the proposed change, among them Councilman Brad Lander, said that many of the stalled sites were owned by speculators and that the three-year completion deadline should remain in place. This would mean that many of the fallow sites would have to be developed under the newer, stricter guidelines, as well as include housing for low- and middle-income earners, to receive 421-a benefits.
Mr. Lander, a Democrat from Park Slope, estimated that the extension could cost the city $420 million in tax revenue, presuming that the extension would lead to the construction of 7,000 units.
''What we need is affordable housing,'' Mr. Lander said. ''We don't need to be giving a huge bailout tax break to assist vacant sites to become the next luxury projects.''
Yet representatives of the Real Estate Board of New York and several developers said the extension, which does not need Council approval, was needed to help projects get off the ground.
''A lot of proposed construction projects, especially in the outer boroughs, do not make any economic sense even with a tax abatement in place,'' one developer, Isaac Katan, wrote in an e-mail. ''In the majority of cases, removing the tax abatement is just the straw breaking the camel's back.''

HEADLINE: UBS Reports Its First Annual Profit Since the Financial Crisis Began

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
PARIS -- UBS, the Swiss banking giant, said Tuesday that its business had turned around in 2010 as it posted its first annual profit since before the financial crisis.
The bank reported a profit of 7.2 billion Swiss francs ($7.5 billion) for the year in contrast to a 2009 loss of 2.7 billion francs. UBS last posted an annual profit in 2006. Over the ensuing three years, failed bets on the United States real estate market led it to combined net losses of more than 29 billion francs and a government rescue.
UBS, based in Zurich and Basel, also announced a fourth-quarter profit of 1.3 billion francs compared with a year-earlier profit of 1.2 billion francs. That was slightly below the 1.35 billion francs analysts forecast in a Bloomberg News survey. 
The bank said the results were held back by a rise in the Swiss franc, which gained about 5 percent against the dollar and 7 percent against the euro in the last three months of the year, along with a 509 million franc charge against its own debt.
UBS also said it was reducing its 2010 bonus pool by 10 percent from the 2009 level, to 4.3 billion francs. Of that amount, it said it would defer payment on about 1.6 billion francs.
Oswald J. Grubel, the UBS chief executive, said during an online news conference that he was ''optimistic'' about the outlook for the bank's wealth management business, as net new inflows of funds stabilized in the second half of 2010, particularly because of clients in the Asia Pacific region.
There were still outflows in Europe, but those client relationships showed encouraging signs of being restored, he said.
The wealth management division, one of the world's largest, suffered after worried customers fled during the financial crisis. The company has been aggressively investing in the business to restore confidence and growth, after rivals including Credit Suisse gained market share at its expense. Credit Suisse, also based in Zurich, reports its results Thursday.
Mr. Grubel said results at the investment banking division were ''clearly not satisfactory, and we are aware that we must improve significantly in 2011.'' Bank officials said the emphasis would be on holding down costs in the business after a year of rebuilding in 2009.
UBS also reported a Tier-1 capital ratio, a measure of financial strength, of 17.7 percent as of Dec. 31, up from 16.7 percent at the end of September. The Swiss authorities have tightened capital requirements for UBS and Credit Suisse to ensure that the institutions do not endanger the national economy.
UBS is continuing to overhaul its management team. It said in December that Tom Naratil, an official in its Americas division, would take over as group chief financial officer on June 1, replacing John Cryan, who was stepping down ''for personal reasons and to pursue other interests outside of UBS.''
UBS in November finally cemented a deal with the American authorities under which the Swiss government will turn over the names of about 4,500 American clients suspected of evading taxes. The deal allowed the bank to avoid further action by the Justice Department in a case that had already cost it $780 million in fines to avoid criminal prosecution.
Online Correction: February 8, 2011, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the conversion into dollars of UBS's net profit. It is $7.5 billion, not $6.9 billion.

HEADLINE: North and South Korea Hold Talks

BYLINE: By MARK McDONALD

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- North and South Korea held low-level, preliminary discussions on Tuesday, their first talks since an artillery exchange in November that killed four South Koreans and brought the countries to the brink of war.
The meetings, held at the border village of Panmunjom, were intended to prepare the way for more substantive discussions about the artillery attack, the sinking of a South Korean warship and the North's nuclear programs. 
But according to a defense official in Seoul, the North did not bend on two crucial demands from the South, refusing to admit involvement in the sinking of the South Korean ship last March and failing to apologize for the shelling in November of Yeonpyeong Island.
Still, an hourlong morning session was followed by an afternoon session that stretched well into the evening, and at the request of the North another meeting was set for Wednesday.
Military tensions after the Yeonpyeong shelling have eased, but diplomatic tensions have not. North Korea has called repeatedly for a variety of talks and exchanges and has requested food aid and fertilizer. Except for the recent restoration of a cross-border hot line, however, the South has not softened.
''Our stance has not changed,'' said Kim Min-seok, a South Korean Defense Ministry spokesman, speaking to reporters on Tuesday morning as the meetings began. ''A higher-level military meeting will be possible only if North Korea takes responsible measures for the attacks on Yeonpyeong Island and the Cheonan warship and promises not to carry out any more provocations.''
The conservative administration of President Lee Myung-bak has vowed not to return to the pattern of giving aid to the North in exchange for periods of relative harmony. When the aid runs out or the North's economic situation worsens, the North typically begins a new round of appeals and confrontations as a way to elicit further aid.
In a television interview last week, Mr. Lee said that this North Korean strategy was a ''typical tactic, overused in the past,'' and that it would no longer result in aid or other concessions.
Many political analysts speak admiringly of the North's ability to manipulate regional and Western governments, mixing desperate appeals for food, military threats and periodic outbursts.
''North Korea documents when other countries flinch,'' said John S. Park, director of the Korea Working Group at the United States Institute of Peace, a nonpartisan group created and financed by Congress. ''They study these moments forensically.''
But with the shelling of Yeonpyeong, the usual North Korean push seems to have finally resulted in a South Korean shove. The South cut off all aid, toughened its military rules of engagement and bolstered its military installations on Yeonpyeong and other islands off the North Korean coast.
''If North Korea 'provokes' again, that tactic won't work any more,'' Mr. Park said. ''The South Korean mind-set has changed: 'We're not messing around.' ''
The Lee government has insisted that the North demonstrate ''sincere behavior'' marked by ''concrete actions'' before it will agree to new shipments of aid, engage in substantive talks or consider a resumption of the six-nation talks on North Korean denuclearization.
Senior officials in Seoul who deal with the North have resisted describing in detail what those actions might include, although Mr. Lee said recently that a reduction of up to 30 percent in the North's military budget would be a welcome signal.
Also on Tuesday, Robert R. King, the United States envoy on North Korean human rights issues, met with senior South Korean diplomats in Seoul, including the South's chief nuclear envoy, Wi Sung-lac.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Asbury Park's Boardwalk Revival Moves Inland

BYLINE: By BETH GREENFIELD

 BODY:
ASBURY PARK, N.J. -- For about a decade this Jersey Shore town, immortalized on a Bruce Springsteen album cover, has been on a slow upward trajectory -- most visibly along its boardwalk, where dozens of new businesses have opened since 2007, when Madison Marquette of Washington stepped in as developer.
Now that prosperity has started to spread a few blocks inland. Commercial activity is picking up in the less-glamorous heart of downtown, a walkable stretch of small and midsize storefront buildings. 
''Tons of people have looked at property here over the years and then gone home,'' said Tom Gilmour, Asbury Park's director of commerce and economic development. ''They're back.''
Business owners point to a confluence of low rents and property prices, an urban enterprise zone designation that offers various perks, landlords who have been willing to negotiate on leases, and, perhaps most powerfully, a shared desire to revive Asbury Park once and for all.
''A lot of people have a very sentimental feeling about this city and are rooting for it to come back,'' Mr. Gilmour said. ''That's a big factor.''
He said recent development projects and a growing restaurant scene have helped potential investors see the town as one that was ''moving forward,'' and that its creative history had attracted a passionate crew. ''They see it as a hip, artistic community that's going to pop,'' he said.
Howie Bixen, who opened a live music club called Asbury Blues two weeks ago on Bangs Avenue, said that choosing to locate it in Asbury Park -- ''the only town around that's doing anything artsy and progressive'' -- was ''a no-brainer.''
Around the corner from Asbury Blues, Charles Rouse used those same words in explaining his decision to open Chico's House of Jazz eight months ago. ''Even before Bruce, Asbury Park had a great music history, and that was jazz,'' Mr. Rouse said.
He added that he was attracted by the continuing revitalization efforts, and by being able to strike what he said was a good price on rent from the Sitar Company, which has developed several properties in Asbury Park over the years, including the Shoppes at the Arcade, which houses Chico's. The arcade, a former Woolworth's, is a collection of about 20 small businesses.
While two new clubs here would be noteworthy in themselves, they are just a part of the rapidly changing face of Asbury's 12-block-long downtown. A dozen other businesses have opened within the past year, including the Yoga Basin studio, the Rebearth art supply store, Beckman's newsstand and deli, the Russo Music store, the Asbury Ocean Beach Inn bed-and-breakfast, and a cavernous seafood restaurant called Fish.
Several other new ventures --a skateboard shop; a branch of Toast, a popular restaurant in Montclair, N.J.; the relocation of the Shore Institute of the Contemporary Arts gallery from nearby Long Branch; and the redevelopment of three historic buildings in the center of town -- are in the works.
Market-rate rents for street-level retail spaces range from $12 to $15 a square foot, said Marianne Schell, a broker at the local John C. Conover Agency.
But there are still some barriers for Asbury Park businesses. Marilyn Schlossbach, who lives in Asbury Park and is a co-owner of four restaurants there -- including two that opened last summer, the Dauphin Grille, and Trinity and the Pope -- said a soft economy and a lack of parking and pedestrian traffic had kept business from truly booming.
''Growth is scary,'' Ms. Schlossbach said. ''But it's good that a lot of creative people are coming in, because that's what's going to turn Asbury around.''
Scott Engel, manager of Russo Music, said incentives offered through the urban enterprise zone like a 3.5 percent sales tax -- it is 7 percent statewide -- through 2012 influenced the decision to add an Asbury outpost of the shop, which is based in Hamilton, N.J., here in September. ''And the rent is really fair,'' Mr. Engel added.
Russo Music's landlord is Pat Fasano, an Asbury Park real estate pioneer who said he owned 15 properties with a total of about 80 commercial and residential units. Many local proprietors give him credit for working with tenants to ensure that they can afford to stay.
''I have no vacancies,'' Mr. Fasano said. ''I'd rather get a smaller rent than no rent.'' He said he was at peace with this approach of not demanding higher rents, because he began buying properties here more than a decade ago, sometimes paying well under $100,000 for large, mixed-use structures. Over the summer, he added his own business venture to the mix, opening the Bond Street Bar after buying the tax liens on the building.
Other buildings have recently changed hands, too. In a July foreclosure sale, investors paid $2.2 million for a former gas company building on Bangs Avenue -- an 11-story, 1929 structure with 55,000 square feet of commercial space.
In November, a New York developer, Carter Sackman of Sackman Enterprises, who has several major holdings in town, bought three adjacent properties in another foreclosure sale along the last undeveloped stretch of Cookman Avenue. Mr. Sackman is planning a $6.5 million gut renovation that will include 31 residential rental units and possibly an arts cinema in part of the properties' 22,000 square feet of retail space.
In December, Amy Russo Harrigan of Bloomfield, N.J., bought a 3,200-square-foot commercial condominium on Cookman Avenue, in which she plans to open a branch of Toast, her popular Montclair breakfast-brunch-lunch restaurant.
Ms. Russo Harrigan said she paid less than $600,000 for a space twice the size of her place in Montclair. ''And I paid $1.1 million for that five years ago,'' she said. ''Because of the economy, and after watching Cookman develop through the years, I thought the time is now.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Under Banner of Fiscal Restraint, Republicans Plan New Abortion Bills

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- All but invisible during the midterm elections, the abortion debate has returned to Congress.
Invoking the mantra of fiscal restraint that has dominated House action since lawmakers reconvened last month, Republicans began committee work this week on two bills that would greatly expand restrictions on financing for and access to abortions. Another bill, one that would cut off federal dollars to women's health care clinics that offer abortions, is expected to surface later this year.
''This House is more pro-life than it's ever been,'' said Representative Joe Pitts, Republican of Pennsylvania and the author of one of the bills to limit money for abortions. 
Democrats in both the House and Senate immediately fought back Tuesday, working closely with reproductive rights advocates. They have appropriated the Republican charge from last year that Democrats were working on a liberal policy agenda instead of on job creation and the economy, and turned it on its head.
''This election was about the economy,'' said Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who joined with other Democratic senators Tuesday to decry the House bills Tuesday as needless and intrusive.
Over and over, Democrats said that by bringing up the abortion issue now, Republicans were going back on their word to focus on the budget.
Yet the bills that have surfaced on the House floor this year have been fiscal in nature, including the repeal of the health care law, which was later rejected by the Senate, and some measures designed to cut spending.
''Republicans are focused on creating a better environment for economic growth and job creation,'' said Kevin Smith, a spokesman for Speaker John A. Boehner, ''and that is reflected in the legislation the House is passing,''
Still, Republicans in the House are clearly energized about using their new majority to reopen debate on an important issue for conservatives, especially in the context of the health care overhaul.
On Tuesday, Representative Eric Cantor, the Republican majority leader, described the new measures as ''obviously very important in terms of the priorities we set out initially in our pledge to America.''
He indicated that he expected the first version of a House bill to finance the government through the rest of the year to bar spending to carry out the health care law. That provision is likely to also be attacked by the Senate and the Obama administration.
One bill, the ''No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act,'' would eliminate tax breaks for private employers who provide health coverage if their plans offer abortion services, and would forbid women who use a flexible spending plan to use pre-tax dollars for abortions. Those restrictions would go well beyond current law prohibiting the use of federal money for abortion services.
The bill, sponsored by Representative Christopher H. Smith, Republican of New Jersey, has drawn fire over language that undercuts a longstanding exemption on the ban on using federal money for abortions in the case of rape or incest; the measure narrows the definition of rape to ''forcible rape,'' a term that his office has never defined. Democratic lawmakers and others repeatedly hammered on the term, saying it suggested that victims of statutory rape and other crimes could not get abortions paid for with federal money.
While Mr. Smith's staff said last week that the term ''forcible rape'' would be removed from the bill, the staff of RepresentativeJerrold Nadler of New York, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, said that language remained intact as of Tuesday.
Another bill, sponsored by Mr. Pitts, addresses the health care overhaul head-on by prohibiting Americans who receive insurance through state exchanges from purchasing abortion coverage, even with their own money. The bill is essentially a resurrection of a provision in the House version of the health care law but was not in the Senate version.
The bill would also permit hospitals to refuse abortions to women, even in emergency situations, if such care would offend the conscience of the health care providers.
''Both bills are designed to drive coverage for abortion out of health insurance plans, period,'' said Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights.
The bills drew immediate fire from House and Senate Democrats. ''We are sending a clear message to House Republicans that their agenda on women's health is extreme,'' Senator Barbara Boxer of California said at a news conference. ''It breaks faith with a decades-long bipartisan compromise, and it risks the health and lives of women. It also punishes women and businesses with a tax hike if they wish to keep or buy insurance that covers a full range of reproductive health care.''
Senator Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey, another Democrat who joined the news conference, compared the proposals to ''a Third World country that's requiring women to wear head shawls to cover their faces even if they don't want to do it.''
As Mr. Smith's bill provoked a spirited back and forth at a hearing of a subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee, it also drew praise from some outside supporters.
''The federal government should not use tax dollars to support or promote elective abortion,'' Richard Doerflinger, associate director of the Secretariat of Pro-Life Activities of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, said in a news release.

HEADLINE: Gap Aside, Texas Governor Offers Optimism on Budget

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
AUSTIN, Tex. -- Gov. Rick Perry of Texas cannot be faulted for lack of optimism. Facing a two-year budget gap of at least $15 billion, Mr. Perry struck a defiant stance in his annual address to the Legislature, calling the state economy ''the envy of the nation'' and promising the budget would be balanced through spending cuts alone.
''Now the mainstream media and big-government interest groups are doing their best to convince us that we're facing a budget Armageddon,'' he said. ''Texans don't believe it, and they shouldn't, because it's not true. Are we facing tough choices? Of course, but we can overcome them by setting priorities.'' 
To be sure, Texas fared better than many other states during the recent recession, but sales tax revenues were badly hurt as people curbed spending. The depth of the state's revenue shortfall was also hidden because it employs a two-year budget cycle and had used billions in federal stimulus money to avoid cutbacks in 2010. Now the state finds itself in a budget crunch not unlike those in New York, California, New Jersey and Illinois.
Even if one does not account for the natural growth in school enrollment and Medicaid rolls, the state would need at least $15 billion of new revenues over the next two years just to keep spending flat.
To continue services at current levels and accommodate growth in the population, however, lawmakers in Austin would have to come up with $27 billion in new revenues.
Republicans, who control every statewide office as well as both houses of the Legislature, are beginning to confront what it means to close the budget gap solely with cutbacks. About 10,000 state employees are in danger of getting pink slips. House and Senate leaders have said they plan to cut aid to schools by $10 billion, a move that would force the layoffs of thousands of teachers and increase class sizes. Lawmakers are also contemplating slicing Medicaid payments to doctors and other providers by 10 percent.
At Statehouse hearings in recent days, advocates for schools, the poor, the disabled and the elderly laid out in detail how Texans would be hurt by cutbacks. They forecast a near future in which nursing homes and rural health clinics would have to close, schools would be consolidated and nursery schools shuttered.
But Mr. Perry, who has worked to raise his national profile as a fiscal conservative, vowed again in his speech not to raise taxes. He also said he would not tap into the state's reserve fund of about $9.4 billion, fed with oil excise taxes, saying it would be irresponsible to use emergency funds on salaries and other recurring expenses.
Instead, the governor proposed consolidating several state agencies, like the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Rural Affairs. He also proposed temporarily doing away with others, among them the Historical Commission and the Commission on the Arts. It was time, he said, to reinvent the government.
''If ever there was a time to truly reform our approach to governance and streamline our organization, it is now,'' he said.
Democrats said Mr. Perry and Republican legislative leaders, who have big majorities in both houses, are ignoring reality to curry favor with Tea Party conservatives. They point out that the governor regularly boasts about people moving to Texas but has not budgeted for the costs of rising school enrollment.
''It's totally unrealistic,'' said Representative Garnet F. Coleman, Democrat of Houston. ''He runs around during the election saying we don't have any problems, and he's still saying we have no problems here. It's clear he can't add or subtract.''
Even members of the governor's own party are saying privately that they would support dipping into the rainy-day funds to cushion the blow to schools and nursing homes.
Many lawmakers think Mr. Perry is more concerned about laying the groundwork for a run for national office than averting painful budget cuts. Though Mr. Perry has said repeatedly he is not interested in running for president, others see his themes of low taxes, limited services and tight regulation as a platform for a possible run in Republican primaries.

HEADLINE: Antitrust Concerns Are Raised on New Law's Doctor-Hospital Collaborations

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The new health care law encourages collaboration by doctors and hospitals for cost savings, but a split has developed here as to just how far they can go without running afoul of antitrust laws.
An influential Republican member of the Federal Trade Commission, J. Thomas Rosch, said that without ''vigorous antitrust enforcement,'' the new alliances of health care providers could reduce competition and increase costs to consumers.
Mr. Rosch set forth his concerns in private letters to the White House and the federal Medicare agency. The letters, obtained by The New York Times, reveal a struggle between the Justice Department and the commission over who should police the market. 
The internal debate creates uncertainty about antitrust enforcement policy at a moment when scores of hospitals, clinics and doctor groups are eager to band together and test innovative ways of delivering care. That uncertainty threatens to slow collaboration by health care providers. President Obama and other proponents say such cooperation could cut costs and improve care for millions of people.
When competitors collaborate, economists say, they can produce enormous efficiencies, but they may also be tempted to engage in monopolistic practices. The risk tends to be greatest in small- and medium-size communities dominated by one or two hospitals or health care systems, experts say.
David A. Balto, a private antitrust lawyer with close ties to the Obama administration, said the disagreement between the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission was ''extremely unfortunate.''
''The commission has demonstrated unreasonable skepticism toward collaboration by health care providers,'' Mr. Balto said.
The antitrust division of the department, under Christine A. Varney, an assistant attorney general, is widely seen by hospitals as more sympathetic to their efforts to band together with doctors and negotiate jointly with health insurance plans.
Officials of the two agencies, which normally share responsibility for enforcing antitrust laws, are trying to devise a joint statement explaining how they will evaluate proposed collaborations by doctors and hospitals. The agencies said, in response to questions, that their goal was to have one consistent policy, but they refused to give details of their talks.
The new health care law encourages joint ventures, known as accountable care organizations, in which doctors and hospitals take collective responsibility for the care of Medicare beneficiaries.
''The creation and operation of accountable care organizations potentially conflict with the antitrust laws,'' Mr. Rosch wrote. ''The Supreme Court long ago prohibited competing providers from jointly contracting to provide their services, except in specified circumstances.''
Mr. Rosch, an antitrust lawyer for more than 35 years, said he was speaking only for himself. But his views on antitrust policy in the health care industry generally reflect the views of the commission's nonpartisan professional staff, based on numerous advisory opinions issued to health care providers over the last 15 years.
Unless doctors and hospitals share some degree of financial risk, Mr. Rosch said, the new entities are unlikely to achieve the promised cost savings. In recent years, independent doctors and hospitals have often come together to coordinate care but have been reluctant to pool resources and share the risks of financial losses.
The fragmentation of the health care system, in which patients often shuttle from doctor to doctor, is widely seen as a major problem. Under the new health care law, doctors and hospitals can earn financial rewards if they improve the care of Medicare patients while holding costs below benchmarks set by the federal government.
Dr. Donald M. Berwick, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said he would soon issue rules for these groups of health care providers. If a group becomes so powerful in a market that it can raise prices without fear of losing business to rivals, it could be required to seek review from one of the antitrust agencies, administration officials said. The health care law does not displace the antitrust laws or provide any exemption for the new entities.
Mr. Rosch said the government must set clear goals for Medicare savings and measure the performance of accountable care organizations with respect to both Medicare and the private insurance market.
''Otherwise,'' Mr. Rosch said, ''there will be a real risk that the savings accruing to Medicare will just come at the expense of private insurers.'' In other words, he suggested, a network of doctors and hospitals could offset a loss of Medicare revenue by charging more to privately insured patients.
In recent years, the Federal Trade Commission has taken the lead in analyzing joint ventures by health care providers. Citing this experience, Mr. Rosch said his agency should also be responsible for policing compliance with the antitrust laws by accountable care organizations. This approach, he said, would ''avoid time-consuming turf battles'' with the Justice Department.
Health care providers said Mr. Rosch and the Federal Trade Commission were making a power grab that could jeopardize the success of accountable care organizations. As part of the Obama administration, they said, Ms. Varney and the Justice Department have a bigger stake in the success of the new entities.
As a member of the commission in 1996, Ms. Varney said the government should be receptive to new types of collaboration among health care providers, a view she has voiced lately as assistant attorney general. In 2003, as a lawyer in private practice, she testified ''on behalf of the American Hospital Association,'' one of her clients, at a hearing held by the Justice Department and the commission.
In discussions between the two agencies, Mr. Rosch said, the department has taken the position that health care providers should be free to choose which agency would review their plans. Such an arrangement, he said, could lead to ''a lack of regulatory consistency,'' with the two agencies applying different standards. Justice Department officials declined to comment.
Mr. Balto, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a liberal research and advocacy group, said: ''The standards applied by the F.T.C. are out of date. For health care providers to get approval from the commission for a joint venture or other form of collaboration is an exhaustive, expensive process that typically takes more than a year.''
But another antitrust lawyer in Washington, Katherine I. Funk, said, ''The commission has more experience and expertise analyzing the clinical integration of health care providers -- a key goal of accountable organizations.''

HEADLINE: Sputnik Redux: Creating Science Fair Projects

BYLINE: JENNIFER CUTRARO and HOLLY EPSTEIN OJALVO


HIGHLIGHT: Lesson Plan | Stimulating innovative thinking in the sciences by developing ideas for experiments and inventions. 

 BODY:
Overview | What is the "Sputnik moment" to which President Obama referred in his State of the Union address, and how do educators place this comment in the context of science education? What questions and ideas do students have that can generate innovative science projects? In this lesson, students consider the current state of science fairs, explore the role of creativity and ingenuity in science, and develop science fair project proposals. 
Materials | Computers with Internet access, projection equipment
Warm-up | Write the following terms on the board:
Dishwasher
Automobile
Airplane
Smart phone
The Internet
Vaccines
Light bulbs
Post-it Notes
Ask: What do these items have in common? Invite ideas, and then reveal that each of these common consumer products is an invention created to solve a specific problem. You might share the background behind one of these products, like Post-it Notes. Lead a short discussion on the role of creative problem solving in innovation. 
For more - and current - examples, you might share ideas from Fixes blog posts or The Times Magazine's annual feature The Year in Ideas, which highlighted EverTune, a bridge that keeps a guitar from going out of tune.
Ask: Do you think ours is an innovative culture that lends itself to the development of inventions and creations like these? What do you think can be done in education so that today's students can become tomorrow's innovators and problem solvers? Invite ideas.
If you like, show the segment of President Obama's 2011 State of the Union address that refers to American ingenuity and innovation. (Note: Start the video clip at 11:24, and end it at 13:39.)
Ask: What does the president say about the role of innovation and creativity in job creation and the development of new industries? What are some innovations he cites? What does he mean when he says, "This is our generation's Sputnik moment"? Briefly explain the significance of the Russian launch of Sputnik. To do this, you might show the short video "Sputnik's Legacy."
Wrap up by telling students they will now read an article about the decline in science fairs, which some view as being at odds with the president's call to spur innovation and creativity.
Related | In the article "It May Be a Sputnik Moment, but Science Fairs Are Lagging," Amy Harmon documents a nationwide decline in student participation in science fairs:
Rarely have school science fairs, a source of pride and panic for generations of American students, achieved such prominence on the national stage. President Obama held one at the White House last fall. And last week he said that America should celebrate its science fair winners like Sunday's Super Bowl champions, or risk losing the nation's competitive edge.
Yet as science fair season kicks into high gear, participation among high school students appears to be declining. And many science teachers say the problem is not a lack of celebration, but the Obama administration's own education policy, which holds schools accountable for math and reading scores at the expense of the kind of creative, independent exploration that science fair projects require.
Read the entire article with your class, using the questions below.
Questions | For discussion and reading comprehension: 

        
How has high school students' participation in science fairs changed in recent years?
        
According to science teachers, how do education standards fail to foster the kind of innovation the president spoke of in his second State of the Union address?
        
When did local science fairs become popular?
        
 What are some of the challenges teachers face in encouraging students to enter science fairs?
        
How is participating in a science fair different from taking a science class? 
Activity | Explain to students that they will now design projects meant either to explore a question they have about science or to tackle a problem. 
If your school participates in a science fair, your students may complete their projects with an eye to entering them in the fair. Or you might hold a mini-fair to showcase these student projects. Alternatively, this could be a purely hypothetical activity in which students develop ideas for projects but do not actually execute them.
Have students work in pairs to brainstorm a question they would like to answer - perhaps related to course curriculum or generated by reading science news coverage - or a problem they or others encounter to which they can propose a solution. 
Here are some resources to help students generate ideas:
Everyday Problems

        
M.I.T.'s Inventor of the Week archive, which highlights innovations like a cavity-fighting lollipop, a self-cleaning house and the squeezable ketchup bottle.
        
This PBS Design Squad video of a high school team challenge to build a human-powered rotisserie for a barbecue restaurant owner.
        
The "how to invent" tips on the InventiveKids blog.
        
Recent winning projects in the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair, like software to improve spacecraft travel and an investigation into reversing drug resistance in cancer cells. 
Science Topics

        
The United States Geological Survey's science fair project ideas.
        
The topic-by-topic list of science project topics featured in the Discovery Channel's Young Scientist Challenge.
        
Science Buddies' collection of project ideas, like using a guitar to explore physical science concepts and investigating how plants respond to gravity. 
        
New York Times resources, including Science Times (online, the section includes a topic drop-down menu for easy browsing), the Health Research section, the Scientist at Work, Green and Well blogs and the columns Q&A, the Really? and Vital Signs, along with Fixes and The Year in Ideas.
Encourage students to think broadly, and not to limit themselves only to materials available to them at home or in class. 
After brainstorming, they should choose two or three ideas to focus on more closely. To do so, they should respond to the following prompts in their journals:

        
What do you already know about the topic? What would you like to know?
        
What problem or question would you like to answer?
        
What is your personal experience with this issue?
        
What academic and/or practical expertise do you have that might help you to respond to this problem?
        
What is your proposed innovation or experiment, and how does it address the problem or question?
        
What materials and resources might you need to execute an experiment or create a prototype?
        
Provide a sketch or diagram summarizing your innovation or your experimental setup.
When students have finished, have them share their proposals, designs and illustrations with the rest of class, providing time for students to give constructive feedback on their peers' ideas. Peers might help students identify their single best idea.
Going further | If feasible, students execute their project plans, or at least find out about related research. They might also do I-Search projects on their topics.
The class might also host a panel discussion on the issues raised in the article about whether today's education policy fosters or hinders the kinds of thinking needed for innovation and creativity in science. Invite speakers to weigh in on the question, like other science teachers and professors and local scientists, inventors and entrepreneurs in the sciences and engineering. The panelists might also touch on the value of science fairs today. 
Standards | This lesson is correlated to McREL's national standards (it can also be aligned to the new Common Core State Standards):

HEADLINE: Playing Catch-Up, Nokia and H.P. Try to Innovate

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR; Damon Darlin contributed reporting from San Francisco.

 BODY:
In technology markets, playing catch-up is a bruising, costly and often futile game, even for corporate giants.
Nokia and Hewlett-Packard, in different ways, both provided vivid evidence of that challenge on Wednesday.
In a memo to Nokia employees, Stephen Elop, the new chief executive, compared its predicament in trying to catch up to Apple and Google in smartphones to that of a man, in a story, who was standing on a burning oil rig at sea.
''The man was standing upon a 'burning platform,' and he needed to make a choice,'' Mr. Elop wrote in the memo, which was widely circulated on the Internet. ''He decided to jump.''
In the memo, Mr. Elop went on to say that Nokia, too, had to jump, metaphorically -- take bold action to make up for lost ground. 
Meanwhile, in San Francisco, H.P., the largest personal computer maker, took its own leap on Wednesday. The company announced that it would introduce a new tablet, the Touchpad, in an effort to chase Apple and its iPad. H.P. also introduced two new smartphones, entering another market in which it has lagged.
But Nokia and H.P. -- tech giants though they are -- face long odds in catching up with competitors that have a head start in a rapidly changing landscape. It's hard to do that in any business, but especially so in technology markets.
''It's possible to catch up, but it's very difficult,'' observed Mark R. Anderson, chief executive of the Strategic News Service, a technology newsletter. ''It almost never works.''
History offers a handful of successful catch-up stories. For example, I.B.M., the mainframe behemoth, trailed the leaders in the new markets for minicomputers and then personal computers, but later caught up. And Microsoft was a latecomer to Internet browsing software, yet eventually became the market leader.
Still, slip behind in the innovation race, and fleet-footed rivals can gain momentum that is hard to slow down. Industry partners, software developers and customers flock to the front runner, and its gains snowball. As more people use the new technology, the more valuable it becomes, unleashing the power of ''network effects,'' in economic terms.
In Mr. Elop's memo to employees, which first surfaced Tuesday on the blog Engadget, he noted such effects. He wrote that Nokia found itself losing in ''a war of ecosystems,'' including developers, software applications and games, advertising, e-commerce, search and other services.
Nokia, Mr. Elop wrote, must ''build, catalyze or join an ecosystem.''
Mr. Elop is scheduled to address an analysts' meeting Friday in London, and is expected to begin to outline Nokia's new strategy. But what might that strategy include? For Nokia, which is based in Finland, joining a major technology partner, analysts say, is the most likely option in the long run.
''Nokia doesn't have the weapons to fight this fight on its own,'' said George F. Colony, chairman of Forrester Research.
The most attractive partners would be Google and Microsoft, analysts say. Both companies have been courting Nokia recently. Although Nokia may be losing ground in the smartphone market -- with its worldwide share falling to 28 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010, down more than 10 percent from a year earlier -- it still sells more smartphones than any other company. It could be a valuable partner and marketer for Google's Android smartphone software or Microsoft's Windows Mobile 7.
Most Nokia smartphones run on the much-criticized Symbian operating system. To get Nokia to switch, Google and Microsoft are offering hundreds of millions of dollars worth of engineering assistance and marketing support, according to a person who has done consulting for the company and was told of the talks.
Mr. Elop joined Nokia last September, and was recruited from Microsoft, where he was a senior executive. ''But the obvious choice for Nokia is Android,'' Mr. Colony said. ''Microsoft would be the higher risk path.''
While Apple's iPhone redefined the smartphone, handsets using Google's Android software are fast attracting users and developers. In 2009, some 25 million iPhones were shipped, compared with about eight million phones running Android. Last year, Android shipments reached 61 million, compared with 48 million iPhones, estimates Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.
H.P. started its drive into the tablet market on Wednesday, as well as introducing two new smartphones. No pricing was announced, nor have wireless carriers yet been signed up as partners.
The products are the first based on technology from Palm, which H.P. acquired last July for $1.2 billion. ''We lost a product cycle -- no doubt about that,'' said Jon Rubinstein, an H.P. senior vice president and Palm's former chief executive.
Making progress in the tablet market is a priority for H.P., especially if tablets eat into the P.C. market, H.P.'s stronghold. Tablet sales are projected to jump more than fourfold over the next two years, to 71 million worldwide in 2012, according to International Data Corporation.
At an event in San Francisco, H.P. executives showed off the TouchPad, which looks similar to Apple's iPad. H.P. is betting that customers and developers will welcome a large entrant in the tablet market, especially one with a tradition of working with business customers, unlike Apple.
And H.P. emphasized that it has the resources and patience for the long term. ''This is the beginning of the marathon,'' said Todd Bradley, an H.P. executive vice president.
Analysts say that to catch an innovative leader, big technology companies need to strip away bureaucracy. The analysts added that such companies needed to focus the full resources of the enterprise and innovate. For example, to jump-start its PC business in the early 1980s, I.B.M. created an independent team of so-called ''wild ducks'' and put them in Florida, far from corporate headquarters.
In his spirited internal memo, Mr. Elop echoes a famous call to arms from his former boss at Microsoft. In 1995, Bill Gates wrote an internal memo, ''The Internet Tidal Wave.'' In it, Mr. Gates wrote of a ''new competitor 'born' on the Internet,'' Netscape, which then held 70 percent of the market for Web browsing software. The new rival's intent, Mr. Gates warned, was to ''commoditize the underlying operating system,'' Windows.
Microsoft's single-minded focus on dealing with the Netscape challenge, analysts say, galvanized the company and spurred its engineers to innovate, though its tactics also led to a federal antitrust ruling against Microsoft.
Still, Mr. Gates wrote his warning call before Netscape went public, while it was still a relatively small company. By contrast, Mr. Elop's impassioned memo comes at the time when Nokia's most direct smartphone rival, Apple, is a corporate powerhouse.
Nokia and H.P. bring some formidable assets to their catch-up campaigns. Nokia has the largest market share in mobile phones, deep relationships with telecommunications carriers around the world, and a stellar brand. H.P. brings to the tablet competition its resources as the largest PC company -- manufacturing expertise, brand recognition and global distribution.
''In their respective fields, Nokia and H.P. hold the biggest installed base of customers and the largest market share,'' said David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School. ''But the fundamental challenge for both Nokia and H.P. is can they move fast enough, given how fast the rest of the world is moving.''

CORRECTION-DATE: February 12, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about differing business strategies at Nokia and Hewlett-Packard misstated the weight of the H.P. TouchPad in relation to a rival device, the Apple iPad. Both devices weigh 1.6 pounds; the TouchPad is not ''half the weight'' of the iPad.

HEADLINE: Innovation Far Removed From the Lab

BYLINE: By PATRICIA COHEN

 BODY:
Daniel Reetz loves trash bins. A big one in Fargo, N.D., was where he found most of the materials he used to build a scanner that was fast enough to scan a 400-page book in about 20 minutes without cracking the binding. The two Canon PowerShot A590 cameras and two lights that he lashed together with a few pieces of acrylic and wood cost him about $300 in all, considerably less than the $10,000 commercial book scanners that were on the market.
When he was finished, Mr. Reetz, now 29 and working at Disney Research's laboratories, put his 79-step how-to guide on a Web site. Since the post went up nearly two years ago, about 1,000 people have joined Mr. Reetz's forum, and about 50 have built their own scanners from castoff furniture, aircraft aluminum, whiskey boxes and plastic foam. 
Do-it-yourselfers like Mr. Reetz may not know it, but their tinkering is challenging a deeply entrenched tenet of economic theory: that producers, not consumers, are the ones who innovate.
Since the Austrian economist Joseph A. Schumpeter published ''The Theory of Economic Development'' in 1934, economists and governments have assumed that the industrial and business sectors are where ideas for products originate. A complex net of laws and policies, from intellectual property rights to producer subsidies and tax benefits, have flowed from this basic assumption.
However, pathbreaking research by a group of scholars including Eric A. von Hippel, a professor of technological innovation at M.I.T.'s Sloan School of Management, suggests that the traditional division of labor between innovators and customers is breaking down.
Financed by the British government, Mr. von Hippel and his colleagues last year completed the first representative large-scale survey of consumer innovation ever conducted.
What the team discovered, described in a paper that is under review for publication, was that the amount of money individual consumers spent making and improving products was more than twice as large as the amount spent by all British firms combined on product research and development over a three-year period.
''We've been missing the dark matter of innovation,'' Mr. von Hippel said from his office in Cambridge, Mass. ''This is a new pattern for how innovations come about.''
Carliss Y. Baldwin, a business administration professor at the Harvard Business School, called the research remarkable, adding: ''What makes Eric's work so significant is that it is unprecedented to try to measure the extent of user innovation. He shows that we've had on a set of mental blinders.''
To Ms. Baldwin and others who study innovation, the results point to the necessity of rethinking patent law as well as government incentives for research and open sourcing. As Stian Westlake, executive director of policy and research at the British National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts, put it in a report: ''This democratization of innovation has potentially critical implications for innovation policy.''
The types of product modifications and innovations that Mr. von Hippel's group found among the nearly 1,200 people surveyed ranged from the most elementary to the complex. One woman colored two halves of a clock dial different shades to teach her children how to tell time; a man concocted a device made from a fishing rod and a large hook to trim his treetops; another reprogrammed his GPS unit to make it easier to use and tailored to his needs.
The Internet is an obvious engine of consumer innovation in the digital realm. Twitter's List and Retweet features, for example, were inspired by users. While consumers have always fiddled with products, the Web makes it so much easier for people with similar interests to come together and form online communities like DIYbookscanner.
The very study of collaborative user innovation is a relatively new phenomenon that began only in the mid-1990s when advocates for open-source software began to argue that computer code should be freely available for thousands of independent minds to play with and improve. ''They overturned the widely held model,'' Ms. Baldwin said.
The Western tradition of the isolated heroic genius toiling away in a lab or study is based on myth as much as fact, she added. That model has had a powerful impact, helping to discount the more collaborative aspects of innovation, but it is ''completely dated,'' Ms. Baldwin said.
Mr. von Hippel, who has been researching innovation for 30 years, estimates that when it comes to scientific instruments 77 percent of the innovations come from users. Fields like medicine can be particularly fertile for creative tinkering. A classic example of user innovation is the heart-lung machine. In the late 1930s Dr. John Heysham Gibbon approached manufacturers about building one, but they did not know how to do it or whether there was a market for it. So Dr. Gibbon spent years developing one himself before this essential device was manufactured commercially.
Sport enthusiasts, like windsurfers, cyclists and fly fishermen, commonly modify equipment. William W. Fisher III, a Harvard law professor and an active ice climber, was one of the enthusiasts who in the 1970s had the idea of adding a leash to ice hammers and axes so they could hang on them while climbing frozen waterfalls. Other climbers followed suit. In time, manufacturers incorporated the leashes into their products.
As consumer innovators proliferate, the tensions with producers have escalated, and the courts are increasingly going to be called in to adjudicate, Mr. Fisher predicted. He is skeptical that easing intellectual property law would significantly spur economic efficiency, but he does say it would foster creativity and community. In a recent article in the Minnesota Law Review, Mr. Fisher argues that altering equipment -- like music, novels and other cultural artifacts -- is a way of expressing creativity, and that the law should take that into account. ''User innovation,'' he writes, ''offers opportunities for self-fulfillment.''
Mr. von Hippel said that the Finnish and Portuguese governments were financing him to conduct research similar to the British survey. As for the United States, he said, ''there doesn't seem to be as much interest here.''

HEADLINE: All Eyes on 4 Not-So-New Designers

BYLINE: By DAVID COLMAN

 BODY:
IT'S fitting that the movie that fashion people are mad for is ''Black Swan.'' It's about a bulimic girl obsessed with perfection, poise and control who is really -- really! -- dying for her breakout moment at Lincoln Center so the world can see how talented she is. Of course, the film is set next door at a fictional ballet company, and the girl is trying to break out of the corps, not the fashion pack. But every year, as the fashion flock gets larger, it's harder to spot the cob or pen -- boy swan or girl swan, of course -- that could rise above the rest, on track to a spotlight in Vogue, a C.F.D.A. nomination and an order from Bergdorf Goodman.
What makes this season special, though, is that, unlike past years when fashion's searchlights were focused on a crop of 23-year-olds just out Parsons (and 12-year-olds were declaring themselves designers), four of the most anticipated collections are by designers who each have more than a decade of experience and come to their new lines with a track record of making great, desirable clothes. 
N. HOOLYWOOD
With Ralph Lauren having defined American style for a generation, it takes an outsider to find new inspiration in the vaults. Enter Daisuke Obana, 37, a Japanese designer whose passable fluency in English belies his mastery of the American clothing idiom. Much like his countryman Daiki Suzuki, who sold his American-style line Engineered Garments in Japan long before American stores got hip to it, Mr. Obana started his career in the late '90s, traveling the United States buying vintage clothes and furnishings to sell back home. He started his N. Hoolywood line in 2001 and opened a vintage store, Mr. Hoolywood, in Tokyo in 2004. An early adopter of the uber-trendy Maine hunter look, Mr. Obana had a hit in New York last season with a collection based on the tragically overlooked style of 1920s mugs, thugs and chicken thieves (inspired by vintage mug shots). This season he is aiming a little higher -- toward the high Himalayas and the good English tweeds that Sir Edmund Hillary et al. wore to scale them. If there's one thing the line does not suggest, it's Hollywood, but that (and the weird spelling) are sure to make him easy to Google. The show is Feb. 11.
THEYSKENS' THEORY
In the six months since Olivier Theyskens showed a capsule collection for Theory (and then took over the creative direction of the whole line a month later), Theyskens' Theory has shot up the fashion ranks as a line to love, and a show to see. If Mr. Theyskens, 34, didn't send out the kind of extravagant creations he was known for at Nina Ricci and Rochas, his Theory line was rich in Theyskens signatures like flowing pants, sharp shoulders and nods to lingerie. Over all, the clothes were sexy and wearable with a chic European edge -- an easy-to-mix combination that has been missing from the New York runways since Helmut Lang closed up shop. In stores (and online) barely a week, the stuff is flying out the door. It makes you wonder what's next: Rei Kawakubo for Dress Barn? Well, it works in Theory. The line will be shown Feb. 14.
BIBHU MOHAPATRA
It sounds charmingly anachronistic in 2011 to hear why Bibhu Mohapatra, 37, already has a following among actresses and socialites -- that is, because of his flair for cocktail dresses and evening gowns. It seems that today's updates of '30s gals like Claudette Colbert, Carole Lombard and the screwball heiresses they played are happy to stimulate the economy if there's a flattering frock in it for them. Then again, after winning an evening-wear prize while at the Fashion Institute of Technology, then spending a decade designing for Halston and J. Mendel, Mr. Mohapatra does know what he's doing. His clothes, fun and feminine without being fussy or retro, walk a line between youthful spirit and ladylike poise. Moreover, his long-practiced flair with embroidery, beading and lace, a skill that eludes most young designers, gives his clothes a specialness that endears them to customers. The question going forward: Can he make up for a perceived weakness in day clothes, or should he even bother? His presentation is on Feb. 15.
MARCIA PATMOS
One half of the colorful cashmere knitwear line Lutz & Patmos (much fetishized throughout its 10-year run, which ended last year), Marcia Patmos has a lot of people rooting for her new M.Patmos label. Building on her deft and inventive hand with sweaters and scarves, Ms. Patmos, 41, has fleshed out the line she showed for spring to a full collection, including long, clingy knit-cashmere dresses; pleated, drop-crotch pants; leather shorts and jackets; and some catchy outerwear, including terrific knitted-fur jackets. And, of course, the duvet-comfy, zillion-ply cashmere cardigans that were the backbone of the Lutz & Patmos line are well-represented in M. Patmos as well, like the Chanel version of a Snuggie. Who wouldn't want a closet full of those? Her presentation will take place on Feb. 9.

HEADLINE: Psyched To Buy, In Groups

BYLINE: By DAVID POGUE. 
E-mail: pogue@nytimes.com

 BODY:
You might think that this column is about Groupon.com, the white-hot Web site whose coupons save you 50 to 90 percent at local businesses. But it's not. It's about psychology.
Each day, Groupon offers for sale a deep-discount coupon from a business in your town. It might be a $25 coupon that buys you a $50 bike tune-up, or a $40 coupon for a $90 massage, or $25 for $100 worth of fitness classes. The coupons aren't actually distributed until a critical mass of people (50, for example) have clicked ''Buy.'' After all, shopkeepers can't afford discounts that steep unless there's something in it for them.
If not enough people express interest, the deal dies. No coupons are issued, and nobody's out a cent.
Groupon is, therefore, a huge win-win-win. You save eyebrow-raising amounts of money. Local businesses pick up a landslide of new customers overnight without doing a lick of marketing on their own (a Phoenix aquarium, for example, sold 10,000 tickets in 24 hours). And Groupon collects half the money from those coupons. No wonder it became profitable after only seven months. 
Now, this concept -- Internet-organized group buying -- has been tried many times before. Remember MobShop? Mercata? LetsBuyIt? They all worked, in principle, the same way.
But Groupon is suddenly everywhere you look -- in the headlines, on Facebook, in dinnertime conversations. The company says that it operates in 175 North American cities and 500 overseas, has 54 million members and has saved them $1.6 billion so far. In fact, Groupon is the fastest-growing Web company in history, having attained a $1.5 billion value in only 18 months.
(On the other hand, not all of the dinnertime conversation about Groupon is positive. The company's SuperBowl TV ads last weekend backfired. One seemed to belittle the oppression of Tibetans under Chinese rule -- ''The people of Tibet are in trouble. Their very culture is in jeopardy. But they still whip up an amazing fish curry!''-- and struck many viewers as juvenile and insensitive.)
Frankly, I couldn't understand the big deal about Groupon. Why is it such a superstar when so many competitors labor in obscurity?
The answer: clever psychology.
First of all, Groupon's sales staff tries to cultivate deals that suit the audience in each city. If you're in San Francisco, you get offers for Segway tours of vineyards, flying lessons and skateboarding gear. In New York City, you're more likely to see huge discounts on music lessons, theater tickets and interesting restaurants. In most cities, you're likely to spot lots of deals for spas and cosmetic surgery, which hints at the upscale female customers who constitute Groupon's biggest buyers.
In suburban Connecticut, where I live, I saw offers like ''$10 for $20 worth'' of Italian food at a restaurant nearby, ''$15 for $30 worth of dry cleaning,'' and ''$10 for $20 worth'' of goods at Barnes & Noble. Since that's all stuff I'd buy anyway, I took the plunge. I bought the Barnes & Noble coupon and the restaurant coupon.
A few hours later, I received my coupons by e-mail. They pointed out that I could avoid printing the coupons if I used the free Groupon app for iPhone or Android phones.
At the bookstore, I picked out a couple of books totaling $23. I showed my phone to the cashier, who had been trained to enter the Groupon codes. I was the ninth person that day to cash in.
I paid the $3 overage, and that was it. I loved it. I'd just gotten $10 worth of books free. It almost felt as if I'd shoplifted.
More psychology, of course. It's absurd that I should have felt so giddy. I mean, is saving $10 such a landmark event? The last time you bought a house, a car or even a night at a hotel, did you haggle for another $10 off? You probably could have gotten it. But you didn't.
Somehow, though, in the Groupon context, it feels like a steal. There's something about the simple phrase, ''$10 for $20 worth of stuff'' that gets you.
Furthermore, your coupon is good for anything in the store. It's not the same as a Half-Off Sale, where the store chooses what goods to discount.
That ''tipping point'' business -- the minimum number of takers an offer has to have before it becomes valid -- is part of the psychology, too. Sure, this element was created to protect the merchant's interests. But let's face it, the tipping-point requirement adds a certain thrill to the proceedings. You're invested in the outcome.
Even the scarcity of deals -- one each day -- plays on your feelings. It adds to that sense of exclusivity and of serendipity.
So does the Groupon editors' whimsical description of each deal. (''A beloved book is like an old friend: full of familiar stories, rich in endearing details and just as enjoyable when covered in highlighter,'' began the Barnes & Noble coupon. ''Make a new literary acquaintance with today's Groupon.'')
Finally, Groupon also seems to be extraordinarily free of red tape and clutter. The fine print is labeled ''The Fine Print'' in a big bold font, and there's not much to it: usually just an expiration date and ''Limit one per person.''
In truth, there is more fine print. But it describes the whole concept, not any one particular deal. A few things can go wrong.
The biggest gotcha is that expiration date. Oh, it's plenty generous -- usually six months to a year. But you know how people are with coupons; we forget them. We lose them. Once again, Groupon has built psychology into its business model. Every time someone forgets to use the coupon, that's free money for Groupon and the merchant.
Some Twitterites complained that Groupon's overwhelming something-for-nothing appeal persuades them to buy things they're not actually interested in. (Kind of hard to blame Groupon for that one.)
Then there's the Groupon Effect. Groupon lore is rife with stories of small businesses swamped by the response -- a yoga studio, family photographer or helicopter-ride outfit getting 1,000 calls a day, for example. That kind of overload isn't a win-win-win; it's a mess. (Groupon now encourages susceptible small businesses to set a maximum number of coupons for each deal.)
Finally, the occasional deal goes wrong. When I asked my Twitter followers (I'm @pogue) about their Groupon experiences, most -- both customers and merchants -- were ebullient. But a few reported flawed transactions, shelves picked clean by Groupon hordes and businesses that had gone under since the coupon was offered. (Groupon issues prompt refunds in that case.)
But never mind all that; this Internet trend is on fire. Groupon imitators are everywhere.
For example, LivingSocial, Groupon's closest competitor, is in 175 cities and says it has 20 million members who have saved $300 million. Its also offers sub-services dedicated to deals for family activities and fixed-price travel getaways.
Then there's BuyWithMe (12 cities; you have a week to buy rather than a day); BloomSpot (eight cities, several offers a week); CrowdSavings.com (six cities, no tipping point); GiltCity (six cities; luxury stuff like restaurants, spas, museums, galleries; no tipping point); Jasmere (price goes down the more people buy in). That doesn't even count Weforia, Coupme, Groop Swoop, Groupalia, TownHog, TeamGrab, Agenzy, DailyQ, Tippr, Woot, Ideeli and eWinWin. Like Groupon, most give you financial kickbacks for roping your friends into getting involved.
These group-buying sites represent an effective, no-strings blessing in tough economic times. You really should try them. There's very little risk, and an enormous upside: the triumphant feeling of having gotten something for nothing.
And now, if you don't mind, I have to wrap this up. I'm off to order $50 worth of Italian food that I bought for $25.

HEADLINE: Medical Treatment, Out of Reach

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
Late last year, Biosensors International, a medical device company, shut down its operation in Southern California, which had once housed 90 people, including the company's top executives and researchers.
The reason, executives say, was that it would take too long to get its new cardiac stent approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
''It's available all over the world, including Mexico and Canada, but not in the United States,'' said the chief executive, Jeffrey B. Jump, an American who runs the company from Switzerland. ''We decided, let's spend our money in China, Brazil, India, Europe.''
Medical device industry executives and investors are complaining vociferously these days that the industry's competitive edge in the United States and overseas is being jeopardized by a heightened regulatory scrutiny. 
The F.D.A., they and others say, appears to be reacting to criticism that its approvals for some products had been lax, leading to a spate of recalls of some unsafe medical devices, like implanted defibrillators and hip replacements.
Now, executives of device companies say the F.D.A. has gone too far in flexing its regulatory muscle, and they worry that a slower, tougher approval process in a weakened economy could chill investments and cripple innovation.
In addition, they say that American patients are being deprived of the latest technology because companies routinely seek approval for new devices in Europe first. For instance, heart valves that can be installed through a catheter instead of open-heart surgery have been available in Europe since 2007 but will not be available in the United States until late this year at the earliest.
''Ten years from now, we'll all get on planes and fly somewhere to get treated,'' said Jonathan MacQuitty, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist with Abingworth Management.
Marti Conger, a business consultant in Benicia, Calif., already has. She went to England in October 2009 to get an implant of a new artificial disk for her spine developed by Spinal Kinetics of Sunnyvale, Calif.
''Sunnyvale is 40 miles south of my house,'' said Ms. Conger, who has become an advocate for faster device approvals in the United States. ''I had to go to England to get my surgery.''
Stenum Spine Hospital in Germany has performed disk surgery on 1,000 Americans over the last eight years, said Jim Rider, the hospital's American marketing agent.
Acknowledging industry concerns, the F.D.A. on Tuesday proposed creating an ''innovation pathway'' aimed at speeding regulatory reviews of a small number of groundbreaking devices. And last month the agency announced measures it said would make the regulatory process more predictable for the vast majority of devices.
''A consistent and predictable review process will stimulate investment here at home and keep jobs from going overseas,'' Dr. Jeffery Shuren, the director of the agency's medical device division, told reporters.
But Dr. Shuren said the F.D.A. would not relax its standards, arguing that Europe's system might be too lax. He said that a breast implant, a lung sealant and an implant for elbow fractures were approved in Europe but not in the United States, and then had to be taken off the market in Europe for safety reasons.
''We don't use our people as guinea pigs in the U.S.,'' he said
Medical device executives said they welcomed the steps, but continued to express concerns. Consumer advocates, like Dr. Sidney Wolfe of Public Citizen, however, said that device regulation was already much less stringent than for drugs and that the F.D.A. was caving in to industry demands rather than ensuring consumer safety.
Dr. Charles Rosen, a spine surgeon who is also president of the Association for Medical Ethics, said that the newest devices were not always best. He said he had at least 50 patients who had suffered serious problems from an older artificial disk. Many of those patients, he said, had gone to Europe to get them before they were available in the United States.
Just since November, three reports -- two sponsored by device industry trade groups and one conducted by the consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers -- have raised concerns about the F.D.A. approval process. One report found that the rate of recalls in Europe was similar to that in the United States, suggesting faster approvals overseas were not hurting patients.
The complaints are driven in part by financial pressures. Venture capitalists, because of the financial crisis and their own poor returns, have less money and need quicker returns on their investments from the companies they back.
Bigger device companies also complain about the F.D.A., but not as much as struggling start-ups. ''The F.D.A. is asking for larger trials, more thoughtful trials, all in the interest of the American public,'' said Dr. Stephen N. Oesterle, senior vice president for medicine and technology at Medtronic.
To be sure, the United States remains the clear world leader in medical device innovation, according to the report by PricewaterhouseCoopers. Some 32 of the 46 medical technology companies with annual sales exceeding $1 billion are based in the United States, the report said.
Still, the report said the United States' lead was slipping.
Device companies have been seeking early approval in Europe for years because it is easier. In Europe, a device must be shown to be safe, while in the United States it must also be shown to be effective in treating a disease or condition. And European approvals are handled by third parties, not a powerful central agency like the F.D.A.
But numerous device executives and venture capitalists said the F.D.A. has tightened regulatory oversight in the last couple of years. Not only does it take longer to get approval but it can take months or years to even begin a clinical trial necessary to gain approval.
Disc Dynamics made seven proposals over three years but could not get clearance from the F.D.A. to conduct a trial of its gel for spine repair, said David Stassen, managing partner of Split Rock Partners, a venture firm that backed the company. ''It got to the point where the company just ran out of cash,'' Mr. Stassen said. Disc Dynamics was shut down last year after an investment of about $65 million.
Dr. Shuren of the F.D.A. said the agency had concerns from preliminary studies that the material in the gel could cause cancer and that the gel would come out of the disk, requiring a new operation.
Some companies and investors are even contemplating forgoing the American market completely.
''We never intend to spend a nickel in the United States for clinical trials,'' said William Starling, a venture capitalist who also runs Synecor, a device company incubator in North Carolina.
Mr. Starling is an investor in Spinal Kinetics, whose artificial disk was implanted in Ms. Conger in England.
The company began working with both the F.D.A. and European regulators in early 2005. It won approval in Europe in 2007 after testing its device in 30 patients and spending $4 million. Since then, thousands of the disks have been implanted.
Only last May did it receive approval for a final trial for F.D.A. approval that would involve about 250 patients. But hard-pressed investors are not willing for now to put up the $50 million or so the trial would cost, Mr. Starling said.
In the meantime, Spinal Kinetics is moving its manufacturing to Germany and has already laid off 20 people in Silicon Valley. One reason for the move, Mr. Starling said, was that some countries in Asia and Latin America allowed use of devices that have been approved in the country in which they are made. So moving manufacturing out of the United States opens up those markets.
Totally forsaking the lucrative American market could be difficult. While approval in Europe is easier, health care systems there tend to spend less on medical devices. Even if a device were approved, doctors in Europe might not use it if there was not enough data proving it really works.
Some companies, however, are trying to generate some sales in Europe in an effort to be acquired by a bigger company, which could then afford to deal with the F.D.A.
Dr. Shuren of the F.D.A. said in an interview that there had been ''no conscious effort'' to make device approvals tougher. ''We are dealing with increasingly more complex devices coming to market,'' he said.
But numerous executives say agency reviewers seem to be more cautious as Congress and others criticize the agency for being too lenient. Critics cited two recent examples: the DePuy hip implant recalled last year and an instance in which top agency officials approved a knee repair implant, made by ReGen Biologics, over the strenuous objections of their scientific reviewers.
Pharmaceutical executives are also complaining about how tough the F.D.A. has become. But they are not forsaking the American market, in part because there is not a big disparity in the regulatory system for drugs between the United States and Europe.
Some figures bear out a toughening in devices. The F.D.A. last year granted 19 premarket approvals -- the type of clearance required for the most highly regulated devices -- down from 48 in 2000.
The average time to win an approval through the less stringent 510(k) pathway, which is used for most devices, rose to 116 days in fiscal year 2008 from 97 days in fiscal year 2002. Agency figures show there have been increases in the proportion of applications sent back for questioning.
Investment by American venture capitalists in the medical device sector has fallen 37 percent since 2007 to $2.3 billion last year, according to the MoneyTree survey from PwC, the National Venture Capital Association and Thomson Reuters. That is steeper than the 27 percent drop for all venture capital investing.
Last year, total venture capital investing increased 19 percent while investment in medical devices fell 9 percent.

HEADLINE: Proposed Police Fee Is Concern for Race Directors

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON and LIZ ROBBINS

 BODY:
In an effort to generate revenue to cope with the city's budget deficit, the New York Police Department wants to charge the organizers of the New York City Marathon and dozens of other races the full cost of controlling traffic and other services.
By charging a new, separate fee, the police are trying to offset the rising costs and increasingly burdensome job of shutting down traffic for popular athletic events. But the proposed rule change -- which does not need City Council approval -- could let the police bill race organizers for their expenses after the events have been held, making it harder for event directors to plan.
The extra fees could significantly drive up the costs of putting on some races, potentially crippling smaller, less profitable events.
Mary Wittenberg, the president of New York Road Runners, a nonprofit group that directs the marathon and 57 other races in the city, and several other race directors say the police department's proposal singles out their events. 
The Road Runners, which last year paid more than $850,000 to city agencies, including $107,000 to the police, is willing to reimburse the police for more of its costs, Wittenberg said. But because many race fees are set months ahead of time, they want the police to put off changing the rule until at least 2012.
Wittenberg and other directors also say they fear that the proposal could prompt other city departments, like Sanitation and Transportation, to follow suit, which would force them to significantly raise the entry fees that make up the vast amount of the revenue that races generate.
The police have not defined their costs, and without a clear accounting of them, Wittenberg and other race promoters say they could end up becoming a victim of featherbedding.
''The proposed rules create an unpredictable fee,'' Wittenberg told the police at a public hearing in December. ''This lack of any clear definition makes the rules especially ripe for abuse based upon the department's views of a particular event, its sponsors or the message it conveys.''
The proposal does not specifically name the Road Runners, but instead is directed toward ''noncharitable athletic parades'' that earn revenue from registration fees. That description includes not only the marathon, but also another dozen of the Road Runners' events run on city streets, including the Harlem 5K and half-marathons in each borough. It would also cover the New York City Triathlon, the Five Boro Bike Tour and many smaller events.
There is no mention of billing the Mets, the Yankees, the Knicks or other professional teams for police details around their stadiums and arenas.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the police, referred all questions to the mayor's office. Andrew Brent, a spokesman there, said that given the city's financial condition, every agency, including the police, has had to evaluate its costs and make ''difficult decisions'' on how to cut them. This is especially true for the police department, which has about 6,000 fewer officers than it did 10 years ago.
''The marathon is a world-class event and a New York City institution, but there are major costs associated with it and other noncharitable events,'' Brent said in a statement. ''Like other big cities already do, we're working to shift a reasonable amount of those costs from city taxpayers to event organizers.''
The marathon, the largest in the country, has ballooned in recent years. A record 45,350 runners started last year's race. In the last three years, the Road Runners has pressed the city to let it expand to 50,000 runners and discussed moving the finish line out of Central Park, part of the reason the police have sought to change their rules.
Road races are not the only public events the police are concentrating on for new revenue. Last February the department announced that all city parades had to be cut by one-quarter in length and limited to five hours. Shorter parades would mean less police overtime, saving an estimated $3.1 million, the department said.
But road races may be different because Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has been an enthusiastic supporter of the marathon, not just because he is an avid runner but also because he recognizes that the event generates about $250 million in economic activity for the city each year. The mayor has also waged a high-profile campaign to combat health issues like obesity, a cause that the Road Runners supports through fitness programs in schools.
Wittenberg met with officials in the mayor's office a month before the police announced their proposal in late December. As required, the department held a hearing to accept public comment, but scheduled it three days after Christmas, while the city was digging out from a blizzard. Only two race directors testified: Wittenberg and John Korff of the triathlon.
At the hearing, Wittenberg said that if the police department's proposal were adopted, New York would be the only city hosting a major marathon to ask race directors to pay for the full cost of police coverage. Indeed, the Boston and Chicago Marathons do not pay their police separate fees. Wittenberg said she hoped the police would establish a predictable formula.
The Boston Marathon is run through six towns and two cities, including 2.6 miles in Boston. The Boston Athletic Association, the race organizer, negotiated a three-year deal with each of the towns and cities, including local police departments. In 2010, the association paid $713,000 to the local governments, and it will pay $818,000 in 2012.
In Chicago, the city issues a permit each year and the marathon organizers (with support from Bank of America, a major sponsor) pay a single fee based on the involvement of several departments, including the Chicago police.
As tough as any increase may be, the Road Runners is perhaps the organization best equipped to withstand any jump in fees. The club had revenues of $39 million in 2008, with the bulk generated by the marathon, an event that attracts runners from around the world and a host of big-name sponsors.
The Five Boro Bike Tour has 32,000 participants, while 3,800 athletes participated in the triathlon, which also uses the Hudson River.
Many smaller events lack the Road Runners' resources. Korff, the triathlon director, said that he planned his race 18 months in advance and that the race's spots sell out immediately, which leaves no room to raise fees later. Registration fees, he said, make up about 80 percent of the revenue of his organization, which paid about $100,000 to the police and other departments last year, its largest expense.
Korff said he understood the city's need to raise money, but he has asked the police to delay instituting the rule change and to consult with him and other directors so they could alter their race courses to potentially save money.
''You'd have to live under a rock not to know what's going on with city budget cuts,'' said Korff, who met with lawyers for the police on Wednesday. ''On the positive side, they were kind and considerate and respectful, but it doesn't change what could be a very expensive outcome.''
Smaller races would be affected, too. The $20 or $25 registration fees to participate in Jeff's Run, which honors Jeff Giordano, a New York firefighter who died on Sept. 11, 2001, would have to be raised if the police proposal was adopted, said Liz Morano, a co-director of the race.
All of the proceeds of the race, which drew 800 runners on Father's Day on Staten Island last year, go to the Firefighter Jeff Giordano Children's Playroom at the Cornell Burn Center, so volunteers are needed to put on the event.
''It could have a whole domino effect, with the cost going up and participation going down,'' Morano said.

HEADLINE: Don't Worry. Be Happy.

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
In troubled times it's important to pace yourself. There's only so much you can worry about at once, and we've already got Egypt, the weird weather, rising food prices and unemployment. Plus, the secretary of homeland security says the terror threat is really high. It would be at least reddish-orange if we hadn't gotten rid of the color code.
Good grief, maybe we shouldn't have gotten rid of the color code. 
At moments like this, I find it soothing to make lists of things that we don't have to worry about at all. Such as:
Outrageous bills proposed by state legislators
In South Dakota, we recently learned that Representative Hal Wick, a Republican of Sioux Falls, dropped a bill into the hopper that would require every adult in the state to own a gun. In Georgia, Representative Bobby Franklin, a Republican of Marietta, introduced legislation that would eliminate the requirement that Georgia drivers have licenses, arguing that he was tired of ''agents of the state demanding your papers.''
And, people, you do not need to worry about it! These bills are not going to pass. Besides, if we worried about every nutsy idea tossed around in state legislatures, we would never have adequate time to devote to work, family and the fate of the Broadway musical ''Spider-Man.''
About 10 percent of a state legislature is composed of people who are totally loony. This is in a good state. It's possible that in yours, the proportion is much, much higher. That is probably something to worry about, but not today.
The point is, they only introduce these bills to get your attention. Resist. Although Representative Franklin is not making it easy, having also proposed that suburbanites be permitted to keep cows and other farm animals in their yards and that the state be required to pay all of its debts in gold or silver.
Glenn Beck's declining ratings
Honest. They're down.
Who will win the Conservative Political Action Conference straw poll
The conservative activists are meeting in Washington at a gathering that will culminate in a much-anticipated straw poll. It is, in theory, our civic duty to follow their activities and determine if they will provide a boost for one of the Republican presidential candidates. Even though the poll has, in the past, proved to be about as good at predicting the future as Punxsutawney Phil.
Former Senator Rick Santorum made news this week when he said Sarah Palin was ducking the conference because she prefers events where somebody is paying her. One of the few joys of following presidential politics two years in advance of the election is that it gives you a chance to ponder hopefuls like Santorum, who prepared for this quest by losing his U.S. Senate seat by 18 percentage points.
But don't worry about Sarah Palin running for president. Even Sarah Palin doesn't know if she's running for president. Mull instead the news that Bristol is now said to be writing a memoir.
The fact that Congress isn't doing anything
Ever since the Senate reached a bipartisan agreement to speed up the legislative process, there has been not a single filibuster in the upper chamber. This may be partly because there have generally been no senators in the upper chamber.
Really, every once in a while they drop by to talk about a bill on the Federal Aviation Administration. And then they go home again.
Meanwhile, in the House, the powerful new Republican majority has continued its laserlike focus on jobs by arguing about abortion and failing to pass the bills it votes on.
''We're not going to be perfect every day,'' said Speaker John Boehner.
On Wednesday, the House argued about whether it should make the government repossess $179 million from our account at the United Nations despite the State Department's plan to have the United Nations use it to improve security in New York City.
This is supposed to be part of the G.O.P. budget-balancing initiative, and on that count it is somewhat like planning to lose 50 pounds by reducing your intake of kale. Mainly, it was an opportunity for Republicans to spend an enjoyable day complaining about international organizations dedicated to world peace.
''It's a disgrace that we continue to fund an organization like the U.N.,'' said Representative Connie Mack of Florida. Did you know his real name is Cornelius Harvey McGillicuddy IV? Also, he is married to Representative Mary Bono of California, who has now been the wife of two members of Congress, only one of whom once had a singing act with Cher.
But I digress. Despite the Republicans' rancor about international organizations, the leaders failed to muster the necessary two-thirds majority to get the bill through. It'll probably pass later, and would then be preserved in amber until sometime in the next millennium when the senators get around to it.
Works for me.

HEADLINE: As Their Attendance Falls, Mets Try Giving Tickets Away

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
By most standards, the Mets have had an off-season to forget. Yes, they hired a new manager and several high-profile executives, including Sandy Alderson as general manager. But, despite two straight fourth-place finishes, the Mets have not signed any star players, and they let several key players go, including the pitchers Pedro Feliciano and Hisanori Takahashi. 
The team's owners have been embroiled in an increasingly public fight with the court-appointed trustee charged with recouping money from investors who profited from Bernard L. Madoff's Ponzi scheme. The uncertainty surrounding the investigation led the Mets' owners to announce that they were trying to sell up to 25 percent of the team.
The gloomy news has made it harder to sell tickets. After drawing nearly 600,000 fewer fans in 2010 than in the previous season, the Mets cut ticket prices by an average of 14 percent for 2011. In some cases, prices have been cut by as much as 38 percent. On Tuesday, the Mets came out with a new lineup of season-ticket plans -- including, for the first time, free tickets.
The new 5-, 11- and 17-game flex packs include tickets to opening day or one Subway Series game. Fans can choose from a slate of other games based on the opponent. Prices start at $99 per seat.
Fans who sign up for one of these offers will get a bonus game thrown in. Dave Howard, the Mets' executive vice president of business operations, said the extra tickets were an ''added-value benefit'' and that the flex packs were created ''in response to feedback we have received from our fans through various research and outreach efforts over the past year.''
Ticket experts said they applaud the Mets for trying to adapt to their unenviable circumstances. But while many teams in smaller markets routinely give away tickets as inducements, the practice is unusual in New York.
''It's basically another form of discounting,'' said Vince Gennaro, a consultant to several major league teams. ''I wouldn't doubt for a minute that the Mets wouldn't do this if it wasn't necessary.''
The Mets also said they will waive the normal $25 processing fee for fans who buy one of the three ticket plans before Feb. 26. That is ''a fan-friendly move,'' according to Jon Greenberg, executive editor of Team Marketing Report. ''It's like a free ticket. It's found money for the team anyway.''
It is also another reminder, he said, that with the exception of the Yankees and the Red Sox, no team can expect to easily sell tickets anymore in the wake of the recession and rising ticket prices.
''I don't think any team is immune any more,'' Greenberg said. ''But the Mets' attendance has been down, so they're in a lot worse shape.''

HEADLINE: House Leaders Facing Turmoil In G.O.P. Ranks

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Under pressure to make deeper spending cuts and blindsided by embarrassing floor defeats, House Republican leaders are quickly discovering the limits of control over their ideologically driven and independent-minded new majority.
For the second consecutive day, House Republicans on Wednesday lost a floor vote due to a mini-revolt, this time over a plan to demand a repayment from the United Nations. Earlier in the day, members of the party's conservative bloc used a closed-door party meeting to push the leadership to go well beyond its plans to trim about $40 billion from domestic spending and foreign aid this year, demanding $100 billion or more.
The spending rebellion came after the House on Tuesday rejected what was expected to be a routine temporary extension of anti-terrorism Patriot Act provisions when Democrats and about two dozen conservative Republicans balked at a fast-track procedure. Republicans, still searching for their footing after assuming control in January, were also forced to pull a trade assistance bill from the floor after conservatives raised objections. They found themselves mediating other internal fights as well.
Speaker John A. Boehner conceded that the fledgling majority was encountering turbulence. ''We have been in the majority four weeks,'' Mr. Boehner said. ''We are not going to be perfect every day.'' 
The image of Republican turmoil was heightened Wednesday when Representative Christopher Lee, a second-term Republican from upstate New York, resigned after a disclosure by a Web site, Gawker.com, that he had sent embarrassing photographs and misrepresented himself to a woman he contacted through Craigslist. His decision came after discussions with the leadership.
The fraying of party unity, if not of a scale or intensity that imperils Mr. Boehner's ability to advance the main elements of his agenda, nonetheless stood in sharp contrast to the record of Republicans in remaining remarkably united against President Obama and the Democrats over the past two years. The infighting foreshadowed potential difficulties for Republicans in holding their troops together for clashes with the White House and the Democratically controlled Senate as well as their ability to corral reluctant Republicans to vote to increase the federal debt limit.
The looser party discipline reflected Mr. Boehner's approach of allowing a more open atmosphere on the House floor and of, in his words, letting the House work its will even if events do not always unfold smoothly.
But the leadership was clearly surprised by the resistance to a measure to provide aid to workers displaced by new trade agreements and the Patriot Act renewal, two measures deemed so noncontroversial that they were brought to the floor under an expedited process that requires a two-thirds majority for passage. Republicans said they had not even considered it necessary to aggressively court support.
The willingness to buck the leadership was not unexpected given the size of the Republican freshman class, 87 new members, and the fact that newcomers and many veterans felt empowered by election results they read as a mandate to push spending cuts and shake up Congress.
''It is going to take a while for them to find their way,'' said Representative John B. Larson of Connecticut, chairman of the Democratic Caucus. ''For so many of their new members, discipline within the party and allegiance to a party doesn't mean an awful lot.''
The push for deeper spending cuts could be the most serious issue for Republican leaders at the moment since they have to find a level of savings that can offer some chance of a compromise with the Senate and Mr. Obama, who had House leaders to the White House on Wednesday for what was described as a productive lunch.
In advance of a planned release Thursday of the House Republican plan to finance the government through Sept. 30, members of the Appropriations Committee on Wednesday disclosed some of the cuts lawmakers were proposing.
Among 60 programs in line for elimination were the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, AmeriCorps and a $298 million Clinton-era program for hiring local police officers. Other planned cutbacks included nearly $900 million in energy conservation and efficiency programs; $1.8 billion from the Environmental Protection Agency; and $75 million from legal-aid programs. In a swipe at the administration, the bill would eliminate $5 billion in high-speed rail money.
''Make no mistake, these cuts are not low-hanging fruit,'' Representative Hal Rogers, Republican of Kentucky and chairman of the Appropriations Committee, said. ''These cuts are real and will impact every district across the country -- including my own.''
But during the closed party meeting, other Republicans said the cuts were too timid and that the party needed to reach the $100 billion decrease Republicans had pledged before proposing to pro-rate the cuts since the government was nearly halfway through its fiscal year.
Representative Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, said Republicans should propose an across-the-board reduction if necessary to meet the $100 billion level. ''We said we would do it, and so we should,'' Mr. Flake said.
But Mr. Rogers and other Republicans warned that doubling the cuts could have substantial consequences for federal agencies, resulting in layoffs and furloughs of federal law enforcement officers and air traffic controllers, steep cuts in education and medical research programs and major changes at the Food and Drug Administration.
Democrats also dug in against the proposals. ''The Republican plan will cost jobs, undercut American innovation and clean energy, jeopardize our safety by taking cops off the street, and threaten investments in rebuilding America -- at a time when our economy can least afford it,'' Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, said.
But Republicans have succeeded in shifting the focus to budget cutting so sufficiently that the White House will propose an array of cuts in the budget for next year that Mr. Obama sends to Capitol Hill on Monday.
Administration officials confirmed on Wednesday that the budget would propose to cut in half, to nearly $2.6 billion in fiscal year 2012, a federal program that subsidizes energy costs for low-income households.
The big reduction for the popular Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program immediately drew protests from lawmakers and antipoverty groups, as have several other cuts the administration has previewed for community service and environmental programs.
Despite concerns about cutting too deeply, Republican leaders met Wednesday night in an effort to review ways to produce more savings and mollify conservative critics. But any efforts to do so are likely to make it more difficult to reach agreement with the Senate and White House, increasing chances for a series of temporary stopgap spending bills or an impasse that could lead to a government shutdown.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 11, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about efforts by House Republicans to cut the federal budget paraphrased incorrectly in some copies from a comment by Representative Jeff Flake of Arizona regarding his party's goal for reducing spending. Mr. Flake said that Republicans should propose, if necessary, an across-the-board reduction to meet the $100 billion -- not $100 million -- level of cuts they had pledged during the recent campaign.

HEADLINE: Relief for States and Businesses

 BODY:
So many people now receive jobless benefits that 30 states have run out of their unemployment trust funds and are borrowing $42 billion from the federal government. Three of the hardest-hit states -- Michigan, Indiana and South Carolina -- have borrowed so much that they triggered automatic unemployment tax increases on employers, and the same thing is likely to happen to 20 more states this year. 
The crisis could prove to be a point of friction between Republican governors and members of Congress. On Tuesday, the Obama administration unveiled a smart proposal to delay those tax increases and provide some relief to both employers and state governments. Congressional Republicans reflexively objected to the idea, which could produce higher taxes in three years, but this plan provides relief that might stimulate hiring now when it is most needed. Republican governors in desperate states like Michigan and Indiana are likely to find that more attractive than party members in Washington do.
Under the plan, which is subject to Congressional approval, there would be a two-year moratorium on the increased taxes that employers would otherwise have to pay to support the unemployment insurance system, which could save businesses as much as $7 billion. During those same two years, states would be forgiven from paying the $1.3 billion in interest they owe Washington on the money they have borrowed. The stimulus bill provided a grace period, but it expired last year.
In 2014, when the economy will presumably have recovered somewhat, employers will have to make up for the moratorium by paying higher unemployment taxes to the states. Specifically, they will have to pay taxes on the first $15,000 of an employee's income, instead of the current $7,000. But, even then, unemployment taxes will be at the same level, adjusted for inflation, as they were in 1983, when President Ronald Reagan raised them.
The administration is proposing to cut the federal unemployment tax rate in 2014 so that employers would pay the same amount to Washington as they do now. States, if they choose to do so, could collect more from each employer to repay the federal government and restock their own unemployment trust funds.
Republicans immediately derided the proposal as an irresponsible tax increase. On his blog, Representative Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, criticized the higher taxes in 2014, but he did not mention the two-year moratorium on the automatic tax increases in 20 vulnerable states.
The proposal is not a bailout for the states or employers but rather a recognition that the automatic tax increases built into the benefits system could put a brake on hiring -- and in precisely the states where employers need the most incentive to bring people back to work.
Over the next decade, as more people return to work and the states repay their debt more quickly, the proposal is expected to bring more dollars back to the federal government than the temporary moratorium will cost, so the long-term effect on the deficit should be positive. The full details of the plan's costs and benefits will be available when President Obama submits his 2012 budget to Congress next week. When he does, both parties should take a close look at the numbers and seize the opportunity to keep this fundamental safety net solvent.

HEADLINE: A Debate Bigger Than Reform

 BODY:
While the federal courts consider whether the health care reform law is constitutional, there is an intense and even wider debate playing out in political and legal circles about the Constitution and Congress's power to solve national problems. 
At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing last week on the reform law, two witnesses argued fiercely opposing views. Walter Dellinger, a former acting solicitor general under President Bill Clinton, made a compelling case for the law's constitutionality. He said that the commerce clause was the main source of Congress's power for regulating the nation's economy, an argument going back to Chief Justice John Marshall.
Randy Barnett, a Georgetown law professor, made a countercase based on what he calls ''the lost Constitution,'' an interpretation that would limit much of that basic law, including the commerce clause.
He made plain that his attack on the health care statute is a means to severely limit the power of Congress, urging senators to reach their ''own judgment about the scope of Congressional powers,'' regardless of ''how the Supreme Court'' has ruled.
To Prof. Dellinger, the Constitution's commerce clause gives Congress broad authority to regulate economic activity crossing state lines if the regulation is necessary and proper. The statute's linked provisions prohibiting companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions and requiring most Americans to have minimum coverage fit that understanding.
Prof. Barnett contends that the mandate goes beyond regulating health insurance by regulating ''inactivity'' and penalizing people who refuse to buy insurance. He said that giving government that power would allow it to compel virtually anything.
We disagree, and so do years of judicial precedent. The Constitution contains limits on improper mandates by preserving a wide range of personal choices. And while the idea of penalizing people for not acting sounds ominous, it inaccurately describes the problem. When people don't buy health insurance -- because they can't afford it or think they don't need it -- the cost of treating them falls on the national economy.
Prof. Dellinger explained how one of the biggest controversies in American law can be resolved by applying mainstream understanding of the Constitution. Of the mandate, he concluded, ''Will it lead to some extraordinary expanse of congressional power? It will not.''
Prof. Barnett left no doubt that he was promoting a broader agenda. If the mandate is upheld, he warned sensationally, ''Congress would have all the discretionary power of a king and the American people would be reduced to its subjects.'' His re-reading of the Constitution would remove that made-up peril. Based on no good reason, it would also fundamentally weaken government's ability to address many of the nation's most serious problems.

HEADLINE: Taiwan Says It Arrested a General Who Is Accused of Spying for China

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG; Zhang Jing contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- The government of Taiwan has arrested a general on accusations of spying for China in what could be the most prominent espionage case in Taiwan in decades. 
The Ministry of National Defense discovered suspicious activity last year and arrested Maj. Gen. Lo Hsien-che on Jan. 25, according to a statement posted on the ministry's Web site late Tuesday. The statement did not give any details on what espionage activities the general might have been engaged in. He was recruited to spy for China sometime during a posting overseas from 2002 to 2005, the statement said.
The Chinese government had no immediate comment on the case.
Although Taiwan is a democratic self-governing island, the Chinese Communist Party in Beijing insists that it is part of China and is a ''core interest,'' meaning that China can use any means to defend its sovereign claims to the island. China strongly objects to American weapons sales to Taiwan and has broken off military dialogue with the United States over that issue. At the same time, under President Ma Ying-jeou, a member of the Kuomintang party, the Taiwanese government has been working with Chinese leaders to try to forge closer economic ties.
''Although the situation across the strait is easing, mainland China has never stopped spying on our military intelligence, and it's being intensified,'' the Taiwanese Defense Ministry said in the online statement. ''Our military staff and civilians should be more alert and improve our awareness of unexpected incidents.''
Some newspapers in Taiwan reported that General Lo had been based in the United States when he was recruited by China, but a military official said at a news conference in Taipei, Taiwan's capital, on Wednesday that the general was working in Thailand when he fell under the sway of China, according to a report by the official Central News Agency.
China has more than 1,000 missiles along its southeast coast aimed at Taiwan, which was occupied by the Kuomintang military when it retreated to the island after the Communist takeover of China in 1949. Before Mr. Ma took office in 2008, tensions between Beijing and Taipei ran high, after the Democratic Progressive Party enacted policies that appeared to move Taiwan closer to formal independence.

HEADLINE: Ukraine Intensifies Pressure on the Opposition

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
KIEV, Ukraine -- A year after taking office with a vow to pursue close ties to Russia, the Ukrainian president is overseeing a broad crackdown on the pro-Western opposition that mirrors the kind of pressure tactics used by his allies in the Kremlin.
Prosecutors appointed by the president, Viktor F. Yanukovich, are carrying out many investigations of opposition leaders, including the former prime minister, Yulia V. Tymoshenko, who was a hero of the Orange Revolution of 2004. 
The United States and European Union, which had held up Ukraine as a post-Soviet model for relatively fair elections and the peaceful transfer of power between political parties, have expressed growing alarm over the Yanukovich government's conduct.
Ms. Tymoshenko has been repeatedly interrogated by prosecutors who said they were examining official corruption during her tenure as prime minister. But so far they are focusing on an accusation that has not aroused much public outrage: they say she violated the law in 2009 by shifting hundreds of millions of dollars from environmental funds to pay pensions. (She is not accused of personally stealing any of the money.)
Ms. Tymoshenko, who narrowly lost the presidential election to Mr. Yanukovich in February 2010, has called the inquiries a political witch hunt. In recent weeks prosecutors have barred her from leaving Kiev, the capital, though she has not been arrested.
''Yanukovich thinks that if he puts me behind bars, he will be able to go into the next campaign without competition,'' Ms. Tymoshenko said in an interview. ''He will have the same situation that exists in other former Soviet countries where there is no opposition.''
She insisted that, if anything, the prosecution had galvanized her.
''If, after a year of investigating my activities, this is all they have found, it shows that not all politicians in Ukraine are corrupt,'' she said. ''The truth is that this criminal case has rehabilitated me.''
The clash between the politicians reflects Ukraine's geographic divide. Mr. Yanukovich is from the Russian-speaking eastern part of the country, which has long turned toward Moscow for support. Ms. Tymoshenko portrays herself as a champion of western Ukraine, where the Ukrainian language dominates and people want more bonds with Europe.
Many of Ms. Tymoshenko's colleagues have also faced intense scrutiny.
In late December a squad of masked special services agents arrested her former interior minister, Yuriy V. Lutsenko, while he was walking his dog, and he has been jailed since.
Prosecutors accused him of, among other things, hiring an official driver whose age exceeded the limit under government rules. In a statement from a detention center Mr. Lutsenko labeled the charges bizarre and described himself as a political prisoner.
Another Tymoshenko associate, a former economic minister, Bohdan M. Danylyshyn, fled to the Czech Republic and was granted asylum there last month -- an indication that the Czech authorities doubted that the case against him had merit.
The investigations into opposition figures seemed to grow in November after Mr. Yanukovich named a new prosecutor general, Viktor P. Pshonka. ''Of course, I am a member of the president's team,'' Mr. Pshonka said at the time.
Mr. Yanukovich was the loser in the pro-Western Orange Revolution, which erupted when protesters declared that his victory in the 2004 presidential election was tainted by fraud. A new election was organized and Mr. Yanukovich was defeated after his rivals portrayed him as a Kremlin lackey who would govern as an old-style Soviet boss.
But he made a comeback in the 2010 presidential campaign, pledging that he was a changed man. He said that he would safeguard political and media freedoms and guarantee that Ukraine would have warm relations with both the West and neighboring Russia. The public, meanwhile, had become wary of political bickering among Ms. Tymoshenko and her Orange colleagues.
In recent remarks Mr. Yanukovich and his senior ministers have denied that the government was persecuting the opposition. They said that since assuming power they had undertaken an evenhanded review of the previous government's policies and spending and were trying to ensure that corrupt officials were punished.
''When it comes to justice, the affiliation of this or that lawbreaker does not matter,'' Mr. Yanukovich said last week during a trip to Poland. ''The rule of law works in Ukraine.''
Government officials pointed out that they had commissioned an audit last year by two American law firms and the investigative firm of Kroll Inc. that had found evidence of six cases of financial malfeasance during Ms. Tymoshenko's tenure.
''Especially in the last five years, there was this impression in society that people in government were essentially immune from prosecution,'' the Ukrainian foreign minister, Kostyantyn Gryshchenko, said in an interview. ''We need to send a serious signal to society that this behavior is unacceptable.''
But the United States and its European allies appear increasingly skeptical of the government's motives. Western diplomats pointed out that when the Orange side was in charge in Kiev it could have easily gone after Mr. Yanukovich with the same prosecutorial fervor but instead left him alone.
They noted that the audit by the American firms looked only at Ms. Tymoshenko's tenure, not at the years when Mr. Yanukovich was in the government before becoming president.
In late December, when it appeared that Ms. Tymoshenko might be arrested, the United States Embassy in Kiev took the highly unusual step of issuing a statement chastising the Ukrainian authorities.
''When, with few exceptions, the only senior officials being targeted are connected with the previous government, it gives the appearance of selective prosecution of political opponents,'' the statement said.
The embassy seemed to be echoing language used by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton in criticizing the treatment in Russia of Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky. Mr. Khodorkovsky, formerly Russia's richest man, has been in jail since 2003 after challenging the authority of Vladimir V. Putin, who was the president then and is now prime minister.
After a second trial Mr. Khodorkovsky was sentenced to another prison term in late December that is to keep him behind bars until 2017. Mrs. Clinton said the Khodorkovsky verdict ''raises serious questions about selective prosecution -- and about the rule of law being overshadowed by political considerations.''
This month, after Ms. Tymoshenko was barred by prosecutors from traveling to Brussels to meet with the president of the European Parliament, Jerzy Buzek, he also questioned the integrity of the investigations.
For its part, the Kremlin has declined to pass judgment.
''That is an internal matter for Ukraine,'' the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, said last year after the investigations began. ''There is nothing more for me to say.''

HEADLINE: Delay of Money From State May Force Hospital to Shut

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE and ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
A struggling Brooklyn hospital is making plans to shut down in March after a decision by the Cuomo administration to delay grants to help finance a merger intended to rescue the institution, officials said on Wednesday.
The hospital, Long Island College Hospital, on the border of Cobble Hill and Brooklyn Heights, announced in October that it was merging with SUNY Downstate Medical Center, a major public university and medical center, as part of a deal put together last fall by former Gov. David A. Paterson and state health officials.
The deal included some $62 million in state grants -- $22 million for Long Island College Hospital and $40 million for SUNY Downstate -- under a program intended to encourage efficiencies and mergers in New York's health care system. 
But State Department of Health officials told the hospital's owner, Continuum Health Partners, on Tuesday night that they were delaying all undistributed grants under the program -- more than a hundred awards totaling $683 million -- as part of a broader effort to rethink the state's sprawling Medicaid program.
With the state in a financial hole, officials are warning of significant cuts to reimbursement rates that will probably require the closing of some health care institutions around the state.
Josh Vlasto, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, said the administration was reassessing the undistributed grants ''as part of an overall review of health care spending in order to ensure that grant money goes to the most viable projects and mergers.''
State officials are weighing several options for money now committed to the overall grant program, like redistributing some of it to other hospitals in distress or using it to help cushion the restructuring of the Medicaid system that the administration envisions. But no final decisions have been made.
The review is expected to take two to three weeks, Mr. Vlasto said, and most grants now in the pipeline are likely to be disbursed as originally intended.
But Stanley Brezenoff, president of Continuum Health Partners, said that conversations with state officials had left ''a clear implication'' that the grants for Long Island College Hospital ''were seriously in question.''
If the $22 million grant to LICH were rescinded, Mr. Brezenoff said, the hospital, which he said was ''running on fumes,'' would run out of cash by mid-March. At that point, he said, he would be forced to begin bankruptcy proceedings and move forward with closing the hospital and laying off its 2,500 employees.
Without the state money, Mr. Brezenoff said, Continuum could not complete moving the hospital under the SUNY umbrella.
Mr. Brezenoff said that he was already putting together a draft closing plan and preparing to send out termination notices. He said that because the conversation with the state was so recent, he had not yet warned the employees that the merger might be called off.
Ellen Watson, a spokeswoman for SUNY-Downstate Medical Center, said its officials knew the grants were under review.
''But absent a formal announcement from the governor's office, it's too early for Downstate to comment,'' she said.
Long Island College Hospital operates about 300 beds, though it is certified for 506. It annually delivers more than 2,500 babies and has 55,000 emergency room visits.
The original merger, announced in October, was considered a victory for Continuum and Governor Paterson. It came after the closing of two other hospitals -- St. Vincent's in Greenwich Village and North General in Harlem-- that foundered under hundreds of millions of dollars in debt, operating losses and the economic downturn.
Mr. Brezenoff said that the hospital needed an infusion of $90 million to $100 million to survive, and that he had been able to pull together the money through other sources that were contingent on getting the state grants.
He expressed frustration with the idea that Mr. Cuomo might be withdrawing a promise that had been thoroughly vetted and publicly announced.
''This is a stunner,'' he said. ''When is something done, done?''

HEADLINE: As British Fret Over Cuts, Top Banks Agree to Trim Pay and Increase Lending

BYLINE: By MATTHEW SALTMARSH

 BODY:
The British government on Wednesday announced an agreement with the leading banks in the country to increase their lending to businesses to help the economic recovery, while reducing bonuses and increasing transparency in pay practices.
The agreement responds in part to rising public anger at banks in a time of deep government spending cuts.
In the deal, called Project Merlin, the country's largest banks -- the Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group and the British unit of the Spanish bank Santander -- committed to lend businesses about $:190 billion ($306 billion) this year, an increase from $:179 billion ($288 billion) last year, the Treasury said in a statement. The banks could lend more if demand is higher. The loans will include $:76 billion ($122 billion) for small and midsize enterprises, 15 percent more than the amount lent in 2010. 
Project Merlin also addresses bank pay. But Banco Santander has opted out of that part of the agreement. Under the agreement, the 2010 bonus pool of the staff members in Britain of the four other banks will be lower than in 2009, ''and will reflect the explicit consideration and reflection the banks have given to the public mood,'' the Treasury said.
The banks reaffirmed commitments that a ''significant proportion'' of any bonuses would be deferred into shares and be subject to significant vesting periods. Bonuses will also be exposed to clawback, meaning they would be pegged to future performance.
The pay of the five highest-earning senior executives at each bank -- but not their names -- will be published. Added to existing commitments, this means that the salary details of at least seven executives at each bank will be published, it said. The Treasury also said that this went further than disclosure rules in the United States, where banks are required to publish data on up to five top earners.
The banks will voluntarily publish this information in 2011, covering pay for 2010. The government said it would ''consult with a view to introducing similar disclosures on a mandatory basis for all large banks from 2012 onwards.''
There was no commitment in the deal on disclosure of the size of bonuses, although R.B.S. said separately on Wednesday that it would cut the amount it set aside to cover bonuses at its investment banking unit for 2010 by 27 percent, to less than $:950 million ($1.5 billion). The salary of its chief executive, Stephen Hester, will remain unchanged for 2011 from the level set in 2008; he will receive no cash bonus but shares worth $:2.04 million ($3.3 million), deferred for three years.
Edward Balls, the opposition Labour Party's finance spokesman, said, ''The small print of the agreement has a clear get-out clause, which allows the banks to do whatever they wish to enhance the interests of their shareholders.''
British banks have come under intense public pressure to lend more and to moderate the bonuses of executives and traders. During the financial crisis, taxpayers provided major support for teetering lenders including R.B.S., Lloyds and Northern Rock. Most estimates put the size of the total aid package at more than $:500 billion ($805 billion).
Quantifying its size is difficult, because the assistance was provided through several sources of financing and guarantees, including direct injections of capital into R.B.S. and Lloyds, a $:200 billion ($322 billion) mechanism for short-terms loans to banks through the Bank of England, a Bank Recapitalization Fund, and a commitment by the government to temporarily underwrite lending among British banks.
Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec in London, said that taxpayers would probably benefit from the bailout. Much of the lending was provided at interest rates favorable to the government, he said, and the state is expected to turn a profit when it disposes of its stakes in R.B.S. and Lloyds.
The public, however, has had a difficult time accepting that argument at a time when the Conservative-Liberal coalition government is embarking on the deepest cuts in social spending in a generation. The Labour Party says that the spending cuts are driven more by ideology than economics.
On Tuesday, the Manchester City Council said it would have to cut care to the elderly and children, close all but one of its public restrooms, shut two swimming pools and reduce street cleaning to save $:109 million ($176 million) in its next financial year, and $:170 million ($274 million) the year after.
The coming weeks are likely to bring a string of similar announcements, while the banks disclose the bonuses paid to their top executives.
''Britain needs to move from retribution to recovery,'' George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, told Parliament on Wednesday.
The message was echoed by bankers' representatives. ''This must be the end of the story with regards to bonuses,'' said Stuart Fraser, policy chairman of the City of London Corporation, a municipal body that promotes the London financial district. ''They did not cause the crisis and are an entirely legitimate form of remuneration.''
Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite, the largest British labor union, took a different view. ''The top bankers will sleep easy tonight knowing their bumper bonuses will continue to be paid with no threat to their extravagant lifestyles,'' he said.
Mr. Balls, the Labour Party spokesman, has called on Mr. Osborne to repeat last year's $:3.5 billion tax ($5.6 billion) on bank bonuses. The government said Tuesday that a levy on banks, announced last June, was now expected to bring in $:2.5 billion ($4 billion) a year. It had been set initially at $:1.7 billion ($2.7 billion) for 2011 because of fears that banks would have trouble absorbing the additional expense. Mr. Osborne said that the health of the banks had improved sufficiently that they could afford the annual tax.
The announcement of Project Merlin was deferred several times after last-minute disagreements between the banks and the government, with the lenders arguing that excessive regulation would harm Britain's role as a global financial hub.
The banks also announced an additional $:1.2 billion ($1.9 billion) to support regional growth and other government-backed projects.

HEADLINE: Coke's Earnings and Revenues Soar After Buying Bottler

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Coca-Cola on Wednesday reported higher-than-expected quarterly sales as it gained market share, and expanded in each of its major markets for the first time in at least five years. 
The results are the first to include Coke's North American bottling operations. The improvement in the company's home region showed that the October acquisition was paying off, just as the economic recovery was gathering steam.
Coke shares, a component in the Dow Jones industrial average, closed up 0.45 percent to $63.15 after rising as much as 2.9 percent earlier in the session.
Both Coke and its rival PepsiCo bought their North American bottlers last year as a way to improve performance by cutting costs, speeding innovation and giving themselves more control over distribution.
Coke's fourth-quarter net income rose to $5.77 billion, or $2.46 a share, from $1.54 billion, or 66 cents a share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, earnings of 72 cents a share met the analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters.
Revenue jumped 40 percent to $10.5 billion, topping analysts' forecast of $10 billion. The bottler acquisition accounted for the bulk of the gain.
Price increases, and selling a larger proportion of higher-price drinks, contributed two percentage points of growth. That more than offset the effect of Coke selling most of its drinks in international markets, where they often cost less than in the United States.
The company said it planned to raise prices in the United States this year as it faces $300 million to $400 million in cost increases related to spikes in corn, juice, metal and plastic.
Worldwide sales volume rose 6 percent in the quarter. Excluding the distribution of some Dr Pepper Snapple Group brands taken over with the bottling purchase, volume was up 5 percent.
Including the benefit of those brands, volume rose 8 percent in North America, 5 percent in Latin America, 2 percent in Europe, 14 percent in the Eurasia and Africa segment, and 1 percent in the Pacific region.
It has been five or six years since the company has posted growth in all of its operating segments, its chief executive, Muhtar Kent, told Reuters.

HEADLINE: Amid a Yawning Pension Deficit, New Jersey's Bond Rating Is Lowered

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
A top credit-rating firm lowered New Jersey's bond rating on Wednesday, citing ballooning pension and other costs, and Gov. Chris Christie and Democrats in the Legislature wasted no time in blaming each other. 
The firm, Standard & Poor's, downgraded New Jersey's general-obligation rating to AA-, from AA, and dropped the ratings on some other state debts even lower. The changes will increase the interest rates that the state must pay when it borrows money.
Standard & Poor's has given lower ratings to just two states, California and Illinois; four others stand with New Jersey at AA-, which is the fourth-highest rating. The firm rates New York and Connecticut a notch higher, at AA.
A Standard & Poor's credit analyst, Jeffrey Panger, cited New Jersey's underfinanced pension and employee benefit funds, and his firm's shift to putting more emphasis on such obligations.
The state reported last year that its pension system had $54 billion less than it needed to meet future obligations, one of the biggest such deficits in the country, and experts have said the state could run out of money within a decade. The fund for retiree health care is even further behind.
Year after year, lawmakers have failed to contribute what actuarial rules said was required to make the systems whole, increasing the size of the payment that the rules required the following year. In 2010, Mr. Christie's first year as governor, the state was supposed to put $3 billion into the pension system, but in grappling with a large budget deficit, it contributed nothing.
The governor, a Republican, has said the state needs to curb government employee pensions and benefits to remain solvent, and at a public forum in Union City on Wednesday, he said the Democrats, who control the Legislature, had compared him to Chicken Little. ''The sky started to fall in today,'' he said, referring to the Standard & Poor's action.
Such talk brought the governor criticism last month, when he mused publicly about the prospect, however distant, of a state bankruptcy -- at a time when the state was marketing a new bond issue. Some bankers said he had spooked the market and possibly raised the state's cost of borrowing by saying what chief executives usually refused to acknowledge.
Democrats said Wednesday that the governor was responsible for the downgrade, for failing to put money into pensions last year. They noted that last year they agreed to pension and benefit reductions for newly hired employees.
''It's time the governor took responsibility for his own actions and stopped trying to blame others,'' said Assemblyman Louis D. Greenwald, chairman of the budget committee.

HEADLINE: Public Unions Alter Tactics To Influence State's Budget

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
ALBANY -- The airwaves are virtually silent. The fiery criticism of years past has given way to conciliatory press releases. And the halls of the Capitol ring not with angry protests but with the quiet hum of lawmakers and lobbyists making their daily rounds.
Faced with devastating budget cuts from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and a deeply hostile electorate, New York's most influential public-employee unions have unexpectedly shifted their strategy for defending cherished government programs and worker benefits. Put off for now are the angry denunciations and millions of dollars of advertisements, chiefly from hospitals and a health care union, that have traditionally begun haunting governors in early February. 
Instead, two coalitions of labor unions and their allies are mounting campaigns aimed chiefly at persuading Mr. Cuomo to extend the so-called millionaire's tax, a state surcharge on high-income New Yorkers that is scheduled to expire in December. The tax, which Mr. Cuomo wants to eliminate, could bring in billions of dollars in revenue in the next few years, cushioning cuts to schools and Medicaid.
The labor groups want to reframe a debate that they believe has overemphasized service cuts and cast public workers as selfish and overpaid.
One such group, the Strong Economy for All Coalition, will formally open next week with a $5 million budget, backed by S.E.I.U. 1199, the powerful health care workers' union, and the United Federation of Teachers, the New York City teachers union.
Most of the money will go not to television and radio advertisements, but for canvassing, social media and other organizing efforts intended to bring pressure on lawmakers from their own constituents, drawing in part on lessons the teachers learned from defeating candidates backed by well-financed charter school advocates in the Democratic primary last fall.
''We think the ad wars make people feel disenfranchised from the process,'' said Michael Mulgrew, president of the United Federation of Teachers. ''We want to do the grass-roots work -- training people on speaking to community groups, going to civic associations, block associations, lawmakers. We want the lawmakers to hear from their real constituents, as opposed to the people that usually lobby them.''
Indeed, an early radio ad script from the group does not mention Mr. Cuomo at all. Instead, it assails ''bankers, brokers and money managers'' on Wall Street for collecting record pay and bonuses in the midst of a state fiscal crisis.
Such a message contrasts starkly with past budget-battle advertisements. One memorable advertisement run by 1199 two years ago to protest Medicaid cuts featured a blind Bronx resident asking of former Gov. David A. Paterson, who is himself legally blind, ''Why are you doing this to me?''
A second coalition, called Growing Together New York, and joining dozens of labor, environmental and community groups, will focus more directly on opposing Mr. Cuomo's cuts, while also agitating for the extension of the income-tax surcharge. The coalition will be spearheaded by New Yorkers for Fiscal Fairness, a liberal advocacy organization whose backers include CSEA, formerly the Civil Service Employees Association, the largest union of state workers, and New York State United Teachers, the statewide teachers' union.
A press release announcing the coalition's formation last week emphasized that it was ''not looking for a confrontation with the governor'' but instead ''a healthy exchange of ideas.''
''We're mobilizing, and we have a ground strategy,'' said Ron Deutsch, executive director of New Yorkers for Fiscal Fairness. ''We're taking the show out on the road, much as the governor has with his budget.''
Mr. Deutsch added, ''We want to engage the governor in a dialogue here, and I don't know if an ad war is the way to do that.''
Both coalitions argue that the debate over New York's budget crisis has unfairly scapegoated public workers while virtually ignoring the role that Wall Street risk-taking, and the accompanying financial collapse, played. They also say that what Mr. Cuomo has described as an epidemic of overspending is as much a revenue crisis driven by tax cuts for the wealthy from the Pataki era.
The shift in tactics reflects, to some extent, Mr. Cuomo's efforts to both woo and fracture his opponents, hoping to avoid the kind of joint assault from teachers, health workers and state employees' unions that ultimately wore down Mr. Paterson and past governors.
Last week, Mr. Cuomo proposed major cuts to Medicaid, school aid and the state work force, while inviting unions to come to him with their own proposals to save money. At the same time, he has amassed a $5 million war chest of his own, money Mr. Cuomo has said he will spend on advertisements only if he is attacked first. He has helped organize a coalition of business groups, called the Committee to Save New York, with plans to spend at least $10 million this year defending his proposals to cap property taxes and rein in spending.
Mr. Cuomo also struck a deal last summer with the Working Families Party, long a potent attack force for unions on fiscal issues, to appear on their ballot line in exchange for their pledge to support his agenda, including his promise not to raise or impose new taxes. The deal did not prevent them, union officials said, from advocating for an extension of the surcharge, an existing tax.
''We are working right now with the governor's folks on the Medicaid redesign team, and we're hoping to come up with some creative ways to save money,'' said Kevin Finnegan, the political director for 1199.
Some union officials and their allies say the change in strategy also reflects a recognition that the traditional winter ad wars are not without cost to themselves, both in dollars -- 1199 alone has spent as much as $10 million a year out of a joint fund with the Greater New York Hospital Association -- and in public relations backlash.
''We have had enormous experience with the old way,'' said Kenneth E. Raske, president of the hospital association. ''The old way leaves a sour taste in our mouth, too. We've seen what happens in the past. We didn't like the process and we didn't like the outcome. You get some restorations, but you still end up with some difficult cuts.''

HEADLINE: Unions to Press Chase on Modifying Additional Mortgages

BYLINE: By CARA BUCKLEY

 BODY:
Leaders of two large New York City unions said Wednesday that they would push for their pension funds to sell their stocks and bonds in JPMorgan Chase if the bank did not help more struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure. 
The declarations were part of a campaign by New York Communities for Change to force the bank to modify more mortgages.
Jon Kest, the group's executive director, said Chase was singled out because it serviced a large number of mortgages in the city yet turned down a majority of requests for long-term mortgage modifications.
In the coming weeks, Mr. Kest said, elected and union officials and religious and community leaders would urge other investors to divest their Chase assets, and would stage weekly protests outside the bank's headquarters in Manhattan.
John Samuelsen, president of Transport Workers Union Local 100, which represents the city's transit workers, and Michael Mulgrew, president of the United Federation of Teachers, said they would urge their pension funds' trustees to sell holdings in Chase if the bank did not allow more people to adjust their mortgages.
About $40 million of the Teachers' Retirement System's $40 billion pension fund is invested in JPMorgan Chase. The transit workers are covered by the New York City Employees' Retirement System pension fund, which has $271 million in Chase stock and bonds, out of $39 billion in assets.
It is not clear whether the union leaders could successfully sway the pension boards, which include both union and government representatives.
By one measure, JPMorgan Chase is not out of step with other big banks. According to a Treasury Department report in December on its loan-modification program, which pays banks to modify mortgages by reducing interest rates or principal or extending the loan period, JPMorgan Chase permanently modified about 34 percent of the troubled mortgage loans it held that met eligibility criteria for relief, roughly the same as the average for all banks.
According to Mr. Kest, only 6 percent of 1,027 city homeowners who sought to reduce their mortgages with Chase between July 2008 and last December were able to get permanently modified loans. Michael Hickey, executive director of the Center for New York City Neighborhoods, a nonprofit group that provides mortgage counseling, said New Yorkers had more trouble getting modifications than homeowners elsewhere because their mortgages far exceeded the national average.
In a statement, a Chase spokesman, Thomas Kelly, said the bank, which inherited thousands of troubled mortgages when it bought Washington Mutual, had avoided foreclosures twice as often as it has foreclosed on homes, and had opened five centers in the New York area for mortgage counseling.
''Chase is doing everything possible to help homeowners stay in their homes,'' Mr. Kelly wrote. ''If we find we have made mistakes, we try to fix them.''

HEADLINE: Small-Business Credit Markets, Assessed by a Loan Broker

BYLINE: By ROBB MANDELBAUM

 BODY:
Up until summer 2009, Ami Kassar was a nine-to-fiver, working for Advanta, one of the largest providers of credit cards to small business. But then the company went bust, another victim of the credit crisis, and the newly unemployed Mr. Kassar decided to strike out on his own.
He formed MultiFunding, a broker that helps arrange loans for small businesses. It was hardly an auspicious time to open any business, but Mr. Kassar's challenge was particularly daunting: the freeze in small commercial loans was only beginning to thaw. Plus, business loan brokering has been a fairly obscure and even somewhat shadowy field -- but one that Mr. Kassar says he believes serves a growing need.
Running both a start-up and a loan broker, Mr. Kassar has had an unusual perspective on the small-business credit crisis. Based near Philadelphia, MultiFunding, which observed its first anniversary last week, now employs four people full time and has completed 12 transactions. It is presently helping 120 clients in 23 states secure financing. 
Mr. Kassar, who works with companies that seek at least $250,000, said that he was able to help from one-third to one-half of his prospective clients. When MultiFunding procures financing, it takes as a fee either a percentage of the financed loan -- from 1 to 2.5 percent -- or, in the case of a refinancing, two months' worth of saving over the original debt service.
Mr. Kassar recently spoke about his business and the market for small-business lending. This is a condensed version of that conversation.
Q.What accounts for MultiFunding's growth -- marketing, or a worsening economic environment for businesses?
A. I think there's a yearning and crying out for transparency and knowledge and understanding. Most small-business owners are more tradesmen than they are businessmen, and they don't really understand the finances.
Q.What don't they understand?
A. I think people have a hard time with the whole collateral concept. Also, when you get into a loan, it's extremely important to know what it's going to take to get out of it if you choose to get out of it early. A few weeks ago, we were refinancing a loan and the prepayment penalty the bank was trying to charge the client was 19.5 percent of the face value of the loan. The guy didn't even realize he had a prepayment penalty.
Q.I would guess that 15 years ago not many small businesses went to intermediaries to help them find loans. Why do businesses come to you?
A. Banks push the products or services that they have to offer. In today's world, a bank's portfolio of options represent maybe five or 10 of the options available to the customer. And in all the confusion out there with all these different structures and options, I think it's very difficult for the average small-business owner to figure out what is going on. We have lending products in our portfolio that are as low as 4 percent annual interest to as high as 60 percent annual interest. The goal is to get them the cheapest possible loan that we think we can get them.
Q.Is a 60 percent loan ever good for a business?
A. I am not a fan of 60 percent loans, but if you need money to fulfill a purchase order or buy some inventory, and you have no other collateral to work with. ... Sixty percent a year is 5 percent a month, and if you borrow that money for two months at 10 percent and you make 30 percent on it, you're still better off than you were without it. I would rather that they be aware of the choice and then they can make the decision for themselves. I don't always agree with the decisions my clients make.
But we try to bring some innovative and creative thinking. There's a client who is currently backed up on payroll taxes with the I.R.S. and their business has dropped by about a half this year, but they have plenty of collateral. We are putting them into a factoring arrangement so he can pay off the I.R.S. quickly, and then flip him into an S.B.A. loan where he can pay off the other debts.
Q.Are there people who should get loans that you can't get bank loans for at this point?
A. I think the people who aren't getting loans today are appropriately not getting loans.
Q.What disqualifies people right now?
A. Collateral. The value of their houses has collapsed, or the value of their equipment or commercial properties has collapsed. This most likely disqualifies people from S.B.A. loans or traditional commercial mortgages and drags them into factoring or asset-based lending or private money. That's about half of our fundable clients. No one is addressing that.
Q.What could be done?
A. I think there is an interesting idea for some kind of collateral exchange, if there was an eager entrepreneur out there. Companies could get someone to put up collateral for a loan in exchange for something. The investor doesn't have to put up hard cash. He's basically putting up the insurance policy for the company, if it all goes south.
Q. It sounds like derivatives trading.
A. In some ways, maybe. The other thing I have suggested on my blog is that perhaps you could borrow money against your future revenues, or your future income. I now have one lender I work with who lends between $100,000 and $200,000 to a small business with a six- to 24-month payback.
Q.Did you make that connection as a result of your blog post?
A. I did, yeah.
Q.Are there particular banks that you like to try first?
A. We hate going to the bigger banks. As a general rule, we would much rather go to a smaller community bank. For S.B.A. loans, there are a number of lenders based out of a small community bank doing S.B.A. loans on a national footprint. We like to go to those guys. If you are living in Paducah, Ky., and you go to an S.B.A. lender in your community, and they've done two S.B.A. loans that year, you're marching up the wrong street.
Q.Is your first choice to put someone in an S.B.A. loan?
A. No. If their credit is in the high fives to mid-sixes, or their collateral is a hodgepodge of things, then it's appropriate to put them in an S.B.A. loan. If they have decent collateral and the high sixes or the low sevens on a credit score and decent cash flow, I'd rather keep them away from the S.B.A. loan. There are a lot of regs, and there are a lot of rules and there are nine million papers to fill out. We joke that you have to give blood for these loans. The fastest S.B.A. loan I have ever gotten done is in 11 weeks, from start to finish.
Q.When you find that the credit scores are good enough to avoid the S.B.A., which banks do you go to?
A. We try to go to community banks or medium-sized banks in the community where that customer is, and generally speaking, from start to finish those loans are about four to six weeks.
Q.The big banks -- Chase, Citi, Wells Fargo and Bank of America -- have all been talking about their commitment to small-business lending. How well have their actions measured up?
A. Our customers have been through the wringer with them for months. They do press releases about how they're hiring all these small-business bankers. I'd like to see less talk and more walk.
Q.Have you tried to get a loan for your business?
A. No.
Q. Do you want one?
A. No. If I tried, I don't think I would be eligible.

HEADLINE: Life Lessons for Children on a Family Vacation

BYLINE: By SUZANNE MacNEILLE

 BODY:
JOHN-PIERRE L. CONTE approaches family travel planning the same way he approaches other aspects of his busy life. ''I hire the best people, they start out with a template, and I do the editing,'' said Mr. Conte, a single father of four children, ages 2 to 12, and chairman of Genstar Capital, a private equity firm based in San Francisco.
For the family's most recent trip, Mr. Conte turned to MyLittleSwans.com, a luxury family travel company run by Katrina Garnett, a software entrepreneur and start-up investor. It planned the Conte family's rambling tour of Spain, with stops in multiple cities, including in-depth child-friendly visits to places like Antoni Gaudi's Sagrada Familia basilica in Barcelona, the careful selection of hotels and enough downtime to do things like play soccer on the beach.
Depending on the destination, a family of five or six would spend tens of thousands of dollars on a custom itinerary from LittleSwans that links travelers to regional tour operators and is based on one of the dozens of trips that Ms. Garnett, an avid traveler, has taken with her own three children over the years. 
Expensive? Yes. But for parents like Mr. Conte, family travel isn't just a luxury -- it's an invaluable life lesson. ''I believe that as a parent, part of the mission is to teach your children about the world and different cultures,'' he said.
Mr. Conte is certainly not the only affluent parent intent on introducing his children to the world that lies beyond the confines of privileged neighborhoods and private schools. Whether it is a Galapagos cruise, an African safari or a trip to Costa Rica that combines surfing lessons and luxurious eco-lodges with wildlife preservation and visits to local schools, parents with the financial wherewithal are pouring considerable amounts of money into expensive family trips organized by outside agencies-- an outflow that some travel companies, including Smithsonian Journeys and Abercrombie & Kent, say has picked up significantly since the economy started showing signs of improvement last year.
''Interest really bounced back last summer,'' said Amy Kotkin, the director of Smithsonian Journeys, who said that bookings more than doubled last summer compared to 2009 on one of Smithsonian's most expensive family trips, ''Voyage to the Lands of Gods and Heroes.'' The trip, a 10-night, small-ship cruise, stops at classical Greek and Italian sites and costs from $4,895 per child and $7,495 per adult excluding airfare.
''Twenty percent of our bookings are now families,'' said Scott Wiseman, president of Abercrombie & Kent USA, which handles marketing for Abercrombie & Kent, the upscale travel company. ''Four or five years ago, it was 4 or 5 percent,'' he said, noting that the average amount of money spent by the company's clients to visit popular family destinations like East Africa or the Galapagos is $500 or $600 a day per person.
Both parents and travel professionals say that the goal of such trips isn't just to give their children a worldly education, but also for parents to spend quality time with them. ''Parents' and children's daily lives are busy -- there is so much going on, especially as you go up the economic ladder,'' said Ms. Kotkin. ''Travel is a way to spend time together without scheduling it out day to day.''
That is an observation that resonates with Charles Leiter. ''Our lives are so hectic,'' said Mr. Leiter, owner of a compounding pharmacy business in San Jose, Calif., who has taken his three children on trips -- several of them arranged by Abercrombie & Kent -- to Africa, Antarctica, the Galapagos and elsewhere. Travel allows his family -- a group that often includes Mr. Leiter's parents -- to spend time together and exposes them to issues they would never encounter in their daily lives.
''We live in an affluent neighborhood. I don't want my kids to think it is all like that. All the texting and Facebooking, it's crazy,'' said Mr. Leiter, who cherishes the memories of a side trip to a village in Kenya where the young girls were so busy carting water to the village that they didn't have time to go to school. When his daughter Rachel, now 15, returned home, she raised money to build a well there. That experience, he said, ''will be there for a lifetime, whereas all the tangible things, they come and go.''
The comparative satisfaction of purchasing prestigious objects versus spending money on experiences -- particularly the kind of shared experiences that family travel offers -- has been a recent focus of psychologists and behavioral economists. It is a topic that resonates in shaky economic times, when flaunting a Rolex or a Gucci handbag can seem gauche.
Tour operators and travel marketers have long been aware of the significance of the experience concept; the shifting values following the recession has only refined their focus. ''It's not the price of the trip that creates value, but the experience,'' said Mr. Wiseman of Abercrombie & Kent. ''It's not about going to China, it's about hugging a panda bear.''
Parents spending a small fortune on a family vacation see ''travel as an investment,'' said Ms. Garnett of MyLittleSwans. ''Destinations are chosen not for bragging rights, but for the kind of culture children can't find in the classroom.''
Melissa Biggs Bradley, founder and chief executive of Indagare.com, a luxury travel site that offers several family itineraries, said that ''travel is a way to impart what's important. Even if it is a love of food and going to Italy, that's something parents can look back on as time and money well spent. The recession brought this into focus for a lot of people.''
The places families go, she added, aren't as important as how they see them. ''Guides at the Louvre can put kids to sleep; others will have them completely entranced,'' she said, noting that Indagare specializes in finding distinctive ways for children to experience places, including gladiator school in Rome or training with former Olympics coaches in table tennis or boxing in China.
Some parents are taking it a step further and combining leisure with volunteer work that focuses on local schools, orphanages and conservations. Abercrombie & Kent offers its clients that option on some trips, as does Elevate Destinations, a travel company based in Cambridge, Mass., that combines luxury excursions with trips that involve philanthropic missions.
''People are becoming more exacting of the impact of what they invest in both financially and in terms of their time -- they want to do something that makes a difference,'' said Dominique Callimanopulos, the founder of Elevate Destinations.
A recent client was Michele Gorski, of Glencoe, Ill., who, with her two children, 13 and 11, traveled to Costa Rica, where they hiked and surfed and stayed in a lovely eco-lodge. ''We were taken care of in a manner that was magnificent -- it just happened to be in the middle of nowhere.'' But their activities also involved hiking a mountain with a conservationist tracking wild cats, and painting a latrine in a rural community.
It was a profound contrast to Glencoe, which Ms. Gorski describes as a beautiful, upscale community, ''but not real.''
''When there is so much around you, you get no satisfaction of achievement. For my kids, climbing that hill, painting that bathroom were achievements,'' she said.
Above all, she added, it showed them that ''life is not Glencoe, Ill.''

HEADLINE: Adjusting Insurance To Fit Your Needs

BYLINE: By LYNNLEY BROWNING

 BODY:
WHEN a 1930 Duesenberg Dual Cowl Phaeton came up for bidding at a recent vintage-car auction in Scottsdale, Ariz., Jim Fiske, an insurance executive, surveyed the clutch of well-heeled bidders.
But Mr. Fiske, a vice president for Chubb & Son, was not thinking of how much the glossy emerald green car, with LeBaron coachwork and an original chassis, engine and bodywork, would fetch -- anywhere from $1.2 million to $1.6 million (It eventually sold for about $1.5 million).
Instead, he was thinking about what he calls Scary 101 -- the changing risks facing wealthy individuals, and the special kinds of insurance that cover them. 
''The real issue for the high-net-worth and upper-middle-class consumer is that they have a lot more risk because of the lifestyle they lead,'' said Mr. Fiske, who is also the United States marketing manager for Chubb Personal Insurance, a unit catering to the affluent.
Amid the financial downturn and growing risk of lawsuits against the wealthy, insurers that specialize in coverage for the affluent are taking a broader view of the potential pitfalls those consumers face.
''A big trend we see is more risk awareness,'' said Jonathan Crystal, executive vice president of Frank Crystal & Company, an insurance broker for the wealthy. That means not just having the right amount of insurance for, say, the rare 1953 Fiat 8V Supersonic that went for more than $1.7 million at the Arizona auction last month, but also for personal liability that could arise from kidnapping, identity theft, potentially libelous postings on Facebook, even the toddler injured on a playground overseen by a local group where the client is on the board.
Definitions of high net worth vary, but one commonly used measure is anyone with investable assets of at least $1 million, not including a primary residence. But Main Street insurers that sell basic home and car coverage typically do not offer policies with enough coverage for that mansion in Greenwich or prized art collection acquired at Sotheby's.
So the niche group of insurers that do, including Chubb, ACE, Chartis, Fireman's Fund and Pure, is using the economic downturn as a talking point to tell would-be and current clients that their world has changed. Affluent people may pay hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in premiums for insurance of all stripes, but they are sometimes buying more insurance than they need, insurance experts say. Others, by contrast, are underinsured.
Take house insurance. The nationwide collapse in housing prices has left many wealthy owners thinking that they need less insurance, with lower deductibles. But that may not be the case, said Robert Courtemanche, chief executive of ACE Private Risk Services, a division of ACE that caters to wealthy clients.
It's the cost of replacing that historic mansion, not its current market value, that matters. ''That's been a real topic of confusion for clients,'' Mr. Courtemanche said. ''Your antique house may be worth less, but you don't want Sheetrock when there's plaster,'' or materials from Home Depot to replace an antique carved European fireplace mantel.
American consumers of all income levels spend an estimated $250 billion a year on premiums for insurance of all kinds, Mr. Courtemanche said. While $30 billion of that is spent by the affluent, only $5 billion is bought through insurers specializing in high-net-worth policies, with the rest through Main Street insurers.
Ross Buchmueller, chief executive of Privilege Underwriters Reciprocal Exchange, an insurer known as Pure, said that ''there are people in Darien with a multimillion-dollar home insured with Nationwide for half its value,'' referring to the affluent town in Connecticut. But in other parts of the country, the housing crisis may have indeed left people with more insurance than they need, he said. ''When contractors are sending fruit baskets to anyone who has ever inquired about a bathroom renovation, that's a clear sign that in some markets, replacement costs have softened. So it's possible that some people for the first time are overinsured.''
Mr. Crystal said that the depressed housing market and increased risk of being sued had made it imperative for clients to review their coverage now, and every few years or so. ''It's not uncommon that we see clients who haven't looked at their insurance in 20 or 30 years,'' he said, with most reviewing it only every five or 10 years.
Insurers are also increasingly reaching out to insurance brokers, financial advisers and family wealth offices to talk about so-called lifestyle risks. A wealthy client with three Volvos and two teenagers of driving age needs more liability insurance than the client who rarely drives that Duesenberg Phaeton. ''You look at the number of uninsured drivers on the roads now'' amid the economic downturn, ''and the affluent definitely need more coverage here,'' Mr. Courtemanche said.
Mr. Fiske, of Chubb, cited other potential risks: the nanny or gardener who sues you over wrongful termination or employment practices. The cancer prevention organization on whose board you sit, where an employee turns out to be an embezzler, leaving you in need of directors' and officers' coverage. An errant kick by your soccer-playing child ruptures another player's Achilles' tendon.
Mr. Crystal added others, including rickety shelves holding a contemporary glass sculpture collection, and a ski chalet in Montana where pipes burst and flood the house because the owners haven't arranged for a caretaker in their absence.
A lawsuit filed last August by the wrestler Hulk Hogan against two Wells Fargo insurance divisions has highlighted the need for adequate coverage to protect the family fortune. Mr. Hogan sued the divisions, through which he bought various types of insurance, for selling him a policy that provided only $250,000 of liability coverage per injured person, despite his estimated $30 million fortune and additional annual income.
In 2007, Mr. Hogan's son Nick, then a teenager, was driving one of his father's cars and crashed. A passenger, John Graziano III, suffered brain damage. Mr. Hogan later reached a confidential settlement with Mr. Graziano's family.
Wells Fargo has countered that Mr. Hogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea, declined to buy the additional coverage.
Either way, ''the more money you have, the greater a target you are for litigation,'' said Mr. Crystal, adding that last month his company created a new Web site, whatsmyliability.com, where affluent consumers could gauge their exposure. ''Your risks are driven by your lifestyle.''

HEADLINE: The Hands-On Investor

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
JEANNIE KRIEGER is not your average widowed grandmother.
In the 1980s, after her husband died unexpectedly, she took an active role in making sure the insurance money for their two children was invested safely. It helped that she had an M.B.A. -- at least she knew to steer clear of a firm in Los Angeles that wanted to manage the money but did not want to discuss how it would do it.
But in 1990, when her father, a successful surgeon, died, she felt she needed more help to manage her inheritance. ''I saw people profligately destroy estates,'' said Ms. Krieger, now 66. ''I was willing to seek any counsel not to do it.''
In the end she turned to her son-in-law, Joseph J. Duran. He had just sold his financial firm, Centurion Capital Management, to General Electric after transforming it from a commission-based to a fee-based service. And he was starting to think that Ms. Krieger's approach was the next step: advising people who wanted to be involved in managing their money and getting others interested in taking that responsibility, too. 
''I told him I knew where to go for a specific stock or bond but not for a financial plan,'' she said. ''How could I know what was the best choice?''
Ms. Krieger described her financial position as ''moderate, but not mega-wealth,'' and this was a group Mr. Duran thought needed to be involved the most.
People with $200,000 simply needed to keep working and save, he said, while those with tens of millions of dollars had plenty of advice already. He began United Capital Financial Partners to serve people who had $500,000 to $10 million, but to really concentrate on clients with $1 million to $2 million. Still, he said he would take on clients only if they were willing to take an active role in managing their money.
Making people take responsibility for managing their wealth is now emerging as a shared goal of both the brokerage firm and the advisory community.
''The client has ultimate responsibility for the management of his wealth,'' said John G. Taft, chief executive of RBC Wealth Management and chairman of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, a trade group for the brokerage industry.
Historically, people's involvement with managing their money has been in inverse proportion to their wealth and need. People who have plenty of money have been the most involved with managing their wealth -- and talking to their coterie of advisers -- while those with far less money and much more to lose from a bad investment decision have been less involved.
The financial crisis seems to have changed this.
''Clients are wanting to be much more involved than they've ever been,'' said Steve Crosby, managing director in charge of the wealth management business for the Americas at PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting firm. ''They want to sit in that right-hand seat and watch the pilot land the plane safely. They want to have queries and comments and be involved in the decisions.''
The problem many are finding is, as Mr. Crosby put it, they do not all have platinum cards. Few with assets beneath $10 million are getting the co-pilot treatment. That leaves a vast swath of the well-to-do needing, if not wanting, more service.
In fact, travel is the analogy of choice as advisers try to get input from clients on investment and spending decisions.
''They'll go to 17 different Web sites to save 17 cents on their vacation,'' said Kenneth A. Kamen, president of Mercadien Asset Management and author of ''Reclaim Your Nest Egg'' (Bloomberg Press, 2010). ''But if they spent just five hours a quarter on their money, it would bring them closer to understanding their investments so that when they speak to their advisers quarterly they can make sure they at least have questions.''
It was the questions Mr. Duran heard in his conversations with his mother-in-law that changed his thinking about how involved a client should be in managing her money.
United Capital now has $13 billion in assets, and Mr. Duran has become an evangelist for getting clients involved.
''We think we're going through a revolution with the democratization of knowledge,'' Mr. Duran said. ''Individuals know more, and they're carrying it into our industry. Just as doctors had to change and travel agents had to change or disappear, our industry has to change.''
One way that Mr. Duran is harnessing the revolution is by playing cards with his clients.
An adviser in the Ridgewood, N.J., office of United Capital came up with a game called ''Honest Conversations.'' It is played with a deck of color-coded cards and the purpose is to get husbands and wives to think independently about what money means to them.
The green cards come first and they deal with people's financial fears. They include concerns like ''Protect my family if I am not around'' and ''Have job and income security.''
The second category has blue cards listing various commitments: ''Educating those I care about,'' ''Minimizing taxes'' or ''Supporting my charitable causes.''
The game ends with pink cards meant to address what makes people happy, with thoughts like ''Personal growth,'' ''Making work optional'' and ''Doing what I've always wanted.''
Both spouses are asked to go through the cards separately and rank their concerns in each category. The goals are twofold. First, the firm wants to get the passive spouse to express his or her own financial opinion. And second, it wants to make sure the two people know what each other's financial goals are.
''When we started United Capital, we realized people have the wrong financial goals,'' said Brandon Moss, a managing director in the firm's Dallas office. ''They want to beat the S.& P. 500. If after this, they still say, 'Let's beat the S.& P. 500,' then we haven't done a good job of creating the right financial goal.''
The card game forces a conversation that gets clients thinking more broadly about the purpose of their money. It is often a disruptive exercise for clients and advisers.
''But when you can get the couple to sit down, there is this moment of, 'We have never had this conversation before,' '' Mr. Moss said. ''The clients I've done this with, it's changed how they do things.''
The game represents what can be called the moderate path in the revolution. The goal is not that people are going to learn how to invest their money, but that they are going to start asking more questions.
''When you drive a car, your family is counting on you to know what a stop sign is and a green light is, but they're not asking you to know how a combustion engine works,'' Mr. Kamen said. ''You should know enough about finances and your own situation that if you hear something that doesn't fit, you should say, 'Wait a minute.' ''
A moderate level of involvement in managing money may be the most realistic for people. But in any revolution there are going to be extremes. In this case, they are the do-nothings and the do-it-yourselfers.
On the one end there are the people who were gleeful as investments and real estate seemed to rise inexorably until 2007, probably overreacted in the downturn and are now happy that stocks are rising again.
Mr. Taft said too many people thought that giving their money to someone to manage was like buying a washing machine: the manager would make sure everything ran smoothly.
''The reality is 20 percent of the time the clothes are shredded, 20 percent of the time they come out a different color and 60 percent of the time they're clean,'' he said. ''This is the mismatch between expectations and reality.''
When some people realize this, they go to the opposite extreme and become convinced that an adviser has no value. There are now plenty of places to channel this populist anger.
''Millions of people are asking themselves, after the last 10 years where the market has gone nowhere, if they can afford the advice they've been getting,'' said Ken Kam, chief executive of Marketocracy, which operates a Web site that allows people to trade model portfolios before putting real money at stake.
''Many people want something done differently, and they feel they probably can't do worse than their advisers could do. They can do this, but it isn't simple.''
His Web site has become a haven for people who believe they can go it alone and achieve spectacular returns. The site allows would-be stock gurus to trade virtual portfolios before they put their own money at risk. All the while, Mr. Kam is trying to see who really has some skill.
Most people find out they really are not good at trading, but Mr. Kam calls those who have succeeded ''the Masters.'' There are 17 of them, and he uses their strategies to manage other people's money.
The Masters each have five-year track records in which they outperformed the market by an average of 10 percentage points. Marketocracy then enters into research contracts with them that pays each one a portion of the nearly 2 percent management fee it collects.
The gains by the Masters are significant. Mike Koza, a civil engineer in Sacramento, has turned the $100,000 he had in a brokerage account in 2000 into a net worth of more than $3 million at the end of 2010. He did this by devoting five to six hours a day to learning all he could about investing. And he has now gone beyond the stock market. In 2009, he began buying apartment buildings at distressed prices.
''I'm not attached to money so it helps me make more money,'' said Mr. Koza, who never gave up his day job. ''I'm willing to take risks, but they're not as big as some people think they are.''
He added that he was very patient and accepted that he was going to pick losing stocks from time to time -- two traits he says he believes other people who try to go it alone lack.
Matthew Schifrin, author of ''The Warren Buffetts Next Door'' (Wiley, 2010) and an editor at Forbes, has followed what Mr. Koza and nine other self-taught investors have done. He said that what they had done was unusual -- their returns were all astronomical -- but that he believed the average person could learn enough to increase returns by up to 4 percent a year.
''You can do it on your own,'' Mr. Schifrin said. ''You can also learn when an adviser is trying to sell you something that is not appropriate for you.''
While the people chronicled in Mr. Schifrin's book are at the extremes, there are also do-it-yourselfers whose enthusiasm risks frustrating their advisers or, worse, harming their retirement portfolios.
''When an adviser constructs a portfolio, it's beneficial for the client to know why those securities were selected, but it's not beneficial for the client to redo the selection or replicate the analysis,'' said Stephen Horan, head of professional education content and private wealth management at the CFA Institute, a membership organization for investment professionals.
Mr. Horan said that whenever a client questioned an adviser it offered an opportunity for greater dialogue. He said the onus was on advisers to empathize with the client's concerns, rather than offer a response full of historical data or be dismissive.
''There is a lot of communication that should precede the asset allocation,'' he said. ''That encourages client involvement and could lead to conversations that might not have happened otherwise.''
But in most instances this process is a slow one.
Sallie L. Krawcheck, president of Bank of America's global wealth and investment management unit, said studies her firm had done showed that people wanted to be more involved in their finances and investments. But the surveys suggested that new clients found the process of creating a financial plan too invasive. ''With a plan, they feel defeated before they begin,'' she said. ''Very few people can sit down and do it all at once.''
Taking it slowly was how Ms. Krieger began investing, and even after going to her son-in-law she remained engaged in managing her money for one simple reason: she wanted to have enough to live out her retirement and not be a burden to her family. If that does not get people involved, what will?

HEADLINE: In First Talk to Republican-Led House, Bernanke Defends Fed Policies

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN; Christine Hauser contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, parried tough questions Wednesday about rising gasoline prices in the United States and the soaring cost of food and grains in the emerging world as he defended the central bank's $600 billion program to shore up the recovery.
Mr. Bernanke said it was ''certainly possible'' that the Fed might cut short its efforts to loosen credit by buying Treasury bonds, especially if domestic inflation were to flare. But Mr. Bernanke maintained that for now, inflation was comfortably in check despite rising commodity prices overseas. 
In his first appearance before House lawmakers since Republicans took control of the chamber last month, they repeatedly tried to draw him into the fierce debate over a looming vote to raise the government's $14.3 trillion borrowing limit.
But the Fed chairman repeatedly declined to side with one party or the other on what was needed to plug the budget deficit. ''Congress is going to have to decide where its values are, whether it wants to raise taxes, whether it wants to cut spending or whether it wants some combination,'' Mr. Bernanke said.
The chairman reiterated his view that toying with the debt ceiling -- some Republicans want to use the vote to force the Obama administration to make immediate spending cuts -- could be disastrous if it resulted in a time-consuming debate that worried debt markets and forced the Treasury to default.
Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the new chairman of the House Budget Committee and a vocal skeptic of the Fed's bond-buying effort, told Mr. Bernanke: ''My concern is that the costs of the Fed's current monetary policy -- the money creation and massive balance sheet expansion -- will come to outweigh the perceived short-term benefits.''
Mr. Ryan described ''a sharp rise in a variety of key global commodity and basic material prices,'' and an increase in interest rates of longer-term Treasury securities. And while conceding that American consumers were not yet experiencing substantially higher prices, Mr. Ryan warned that ''the inflation dynamic can be quick to materialize and painful to eradicate once it takes hold.''
Mr. Ryan all but accused Mr. Bernanke of devaluing the dollar, saying, ''There is nothing more insidious that a country can do to its citizens than debase its currency.''
Mr. Bernanke said the rise in commodity prices was mostly ''a result of the very strong demand from fast-growing emerging market economies, coupled, in some cases, with constraints on supply.'' He did not mention China by name, but he has in the past.
He added that overall inflation was ''still quite low'' and that longer-term inflation expectations, which can influence short-term changes in prices, were stable.
In 2010, a closely watched measure of inflation, the price index for personal consumption expenditures, rose by 1.2 percent, compared with 2.4 percent in 2009. And core inflation, which excludes the food and energy prices, was 0.7 percent in 2010, compared with around 2.5 percent in 2007. Wages rose only 1.7 percent last year.
Mr. Bernanke also denied printing money to finance government borrowing, saying, ''What we're doing here is a temporary measure that will be reversed.'' Eventually, the Fed sells the bonds it acquires.
While part of the historically large deficits of the last two years stem from the government's responses to the recession, Mr. Bernanke said the budget would remain on an unsustainable path even as the economy improved because of an aging population and rising health care costs.
Though Mr. Bernanke did not take sides on the most volatile questions of fiscal policy -- whether to cut military spending, change entitlement programs like Medicare and raise personal income tax rates -- he did offer lawmakers some suggestions.
He told Representative Betty McCollum, a Minnesota Democrat, that Congress should close myriad corporate tax loopholes and then lower the corporate tax rate. He told Representative Mike Honda, a California Democrat, that wise investments in education, including community colleges and on-the-job training, were essential to lowering unemployment.
The chairman also offered some of his most detailed comments to date on what he called China's ''counterproductive policy'' of undervaluing its currency, the renminbi.
''They have an inflation problem, and the way they're addressing it is not by raising their currency value, which would reduce the demand for their exports,'' he told Representative Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat. ''Rather, they are leaving it where it is, and they are instead trying to reduce domestic demand through higher interest rates. And it would seem like a better strategy would be to let domestic demand be what it is and let people enjoy a higher standard of living in China, and reduce their exports via a higher exchange rate.''
On Tuesday, China raised interest rates for the third time since October, and many economists in Asia expect that China will do so again this year.
Mr. Bernanke said the Fed was prepared to start raising interest rates when the time came. ''Just like a quarterback has to lead a receiver,'' he told Representative James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican, the Fed has to begin tightening monetary policy before inflation becomes a problem.
But Representative Todd Rokita, Republican of Indiana, said the Fed had a poor track record in that regard. ''Can you name one time in your agency's history where you got it right, where you got on the brakes in time to correct runaway inflation?'' he asked.
Mr. Bernanke pointed to his predecessor Paul A. Volcker, who crushed inflation in the early 1980s by sharply raising interest rates. But Mr. Rokita said the Fed had not acted in time.
As Mr. Bernanke spoke, Representative Ron Paul, a Texas Republican, held his own hearing to lambast the Fed.
''There is a great recovery going on,'' said Mr. Paul, who has advocated abolishing the Fed and now leads a Financial Services subcommittee that oversees the Fed. ''But the people don't feel that way.''
The Fed did not take part in the hearing, at which three experts testified.

HEADLINE: Cisco Results Top Forecasts, But Growth Is Sluggish

BYLINE: By VERNE G. KOPYTOFF

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- John T. Chambers, Cisco Systems' chief executive, did little Wednesday to lift the dark cloud hanging over his company by reporting sluggish growth in its fiscal second quarter and making a disappointing forecast. 
His statement that spending by government agencies on technology equipment remained depressed because of the economy and that it probably would get worse in the near future helped send company shares down about 9 percent in after-hours trading to $20.07. In regular trading, Cisco shares closed up 5 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $22.04.
He spooked Wall Street three months ago with a cautious outlook with its first quarter earnings report. He noted ''air pockets'' coinciding with big declines in orders by government agencies and cable operators. He delivered much of the same message Wednesday.
Cisco, which sells telecommunications equipment and routers for directing Internet traffic, is largely alone in its struggles among large technology companies that recently reported results, including Google and Intel. Normally, Wall Street analysts and investors follow Cisco's results closely because the company is considered a bellwether for corporate technology spending. But in this case, it is an anomaly with lagging performance while other companies flourish.
Mr. Chambers, who is usually upbeat about Cisco's future, explained that it was in transition, in part because of a raft of new products in its switching business. But he bragged about the results in other areas like new businesses, including data centers, collaboration and wireless, which together grew 15 percent.
But he said that because of declines in sales of consumer product and switches, Cisco expected only 4 to 6 percent revenue growth in the current quarter. He predicted that growth would improve to 8 to 11 percent in Cisco's fourth quarter.
He said that, although the economy was picking up, there would be a delay before corporate customers started buying again. He said optimism was starting to increase and that sales should start to reflect that. For the full fiscal year, Cisco, which is based in San Jose, Calif., said its revenue growth would be in the low end of its previous forecast of 9 to 11 percent. ''I think we will look back on this period of time and wish we could have avoided it,'' he said in a conference call with analysts.
Sales to the public sector grew 7 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, although he said he expected slower growth soon. Consumer product sales fell 15 percent while revenue from switches fell 8 percent.
Cisco said that net income in its second quarter, which ended Jan. 29, fell 18 percent to $1.5 billion, or 27 cents a share, from $1.9 billion or 32 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue climbed 6 percent to $10.4 billion from $9.8 billion a year earlier.
Cisco reported adjusted income of 37 cents a share. Wall Street analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had predicted 35 cents a share on revenue of $10.24 billion.
''They owned up to some of the issues and exposed where some of the weakness are,'' said Jason Ader, of William Blair & Company. He said Cisco should probably rethink its effort to become a consumer company, given its roots with corporate customers and the stiff competition among consumer electronics companies.

HEADLINE: Shares Mixed After Fed Chief's Remarks on Joblessness

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks closed mixed Wednesday after the head of the Federal Reserve said that unemployment might remain high for several years. The Dow Jones industrial average eked out its eighth consecutive day of gains, extending its longest advancing streak in nearly a year. 
Major indexes traded lower for much of the day after Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Fed, told members of the House of Representatives that the economy was strengthening but that companies had not yet increased hiring.
Last week, the Labor Department said the unemployment rate fell to 9 percent in January.
Bond prices rose after Mr. Bernanke's testimony, reversing a slump that had pushed yields up to their highest levels since April. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 22/32, to 91 21/32 and the yield fell to 3.65 percent from 3.74 percent late Tuesday.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 6.74 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 12,239.8. The Dow has had only one down day in the last 11, on Jan. 28, when the protests in Egypt escalated. It last finished with eight consecutive days of gains in March 2010.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 3.69 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,320.88. It was the first down day for the index after four days of gains.
The Nasdaq composite lost 7.98 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,789.07.
Two members of the Dow index reported better-than-expected earnings. Coca-Cola said its income more than tripled last quarter, helped by the acquisition of a bottler and the sale of more drinks in North America. The stock rose 0.5 percent.
Walt Disney rose 5.3 percent after reporting strong earnings late Tuesday. The company beat expectations with help from higher revenue at its ABC and ESPN networks.
Disney helped push consumer discretionary stocks in the S.& P. 500 index up 0.6 percent, the largest gain of any of the 10 company groups that make up the index.
The American International Group fell 3 percent after saying that it expected to take a charge of $4.1 billion to build reserves against losses for its Chartis property and casualty insurance units.
NYSE Euronext, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, issued a statement confirming that it was in advanced talks with Germany's stock exchange, Deutsche Borse, about a possible combination. The plan being discussed would create a company 60 percent owned by Deutsche Borse shareholders with dual headquarters in Frankfurt and New York. NYSE Euronext's stock gained 17.3 percent, to $39.18.
Two stocks fell for every one that rose on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume came to 960 million shares.

HEADLINE: Labor Actions Across Egypt Lend Momentum to Anti-Mubarak Protests

BYLINE: By KAREEM FAHIM and DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK; Liam Stack, Mona El-Naggar and Thanassis Cambanis contributed reporting from Cairo, and Helene Cooper from Washington.

 BODY:
CAIRO -- Labor strikes and worker protests that flared across Egypt on Wednesday affected post offices, textile factories and even the government's flagship newspaper, providing a burst of momentum to protesters demanding the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak, even as his government pushed back with greater force against the opponents' demands.
The protests at the newspaper, Al Ahram, by freelance reporters demanding better wages and more independence from the government, snarled one of the state's most powerful propaganda tools and seemed to change its tone: On Wednesday, the front page, which had sought for days to play down the protests, called recent attacks by pro-Mubarak protesters on Tahrir Square an ''offense to the whole nation.''
In the face of the unrest, the country's foreign minister delivered stern warnings that seemed to reflect the government's growing impatience with the protests. 
Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit dismissed calls by Egyptian protesters and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to scrap the country's emergency laws, which allow the authorities to detain people without charge.
''We have 17,000 prisoners loose in the streets out of jails that have been destroyed,'' Mr. Aboul Gheit said during an interview with the NewsHour on PBS. ''How can you ask me to sort of disband that emergency law while I'm in difficulty?''
The remarks about Mr. Biden reflected the complicated relationship between Mr. Mubarak's government and the Obama administration, which had urged swift steps toward a political transition, then endorsed Mr. Mubarak's remaining until the end of his term later this year. Since then, Mr. Biden has suggested that the United States still expects some immediate changes to be made.
On Wednesday, the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, responded to the Egyptian government's claims that such changes were premature, saying, ''What you see happening on the streets of Cairo is not all that surprising when you see the lack of steps that their government has taken to meet their concerns.''
That attempt to put some distance between the United States and Mr. Mubarak, though, was unlikely to impress the protesters, who say that the Obama administration, by continuing to back the president, also ignores their concerns.
By nightfall on Wednesday, more than 1,000 protesters prepared to sleep outside the Parliament building for a second night, a symbolic move that showed the opposition's growing confidence as the protesters expanded the scope of their activism beyond Tahrir Square.
Reports from around the country of vigorous and sometimes violent protests also suggested a movement regaining steam.
Security officials said that 5 people died and more than 100 were injured during protests on Tuesday in El Kharga, 375 miles south of Cairo. Protesters responded Wednesday by burning police stations and other government buildings. In Asyut, protesters blocked a railway line. Television images showed crowds gathering again in Alexandria, Egypt's second-largest city.
Even protests that were not directly against Mr. Mubarak centered on the types of government neglect that have driven the call for him to leave power.
Protesters in Port Said, a city of 600,000 at the mouth of the Suez Canal, set fire to a government building, saying local officials had ignored their requests for better housing. And in one of the most potentially significant labor actions, thousands of workers for the Suez Canal Authority continued a sit-in on Wednesday, though there were no immediate suggestions of disruptions of shipping in the canal, a vital international waterway.
The deaths of protesters in El Kharga were a reminder of Egypt's unsettled security picture.
On Wednesday, Human Rights Watchreported that since Jan. 28, when troops took up positions in Egyptian cities, army officers and the military police had arbitrarily detained at least 119 people. In at least five cases, the group said, detainees said they had been tortured.
There were signs that the police, under the jurisdiction of the hated Ministry of Interior, were trying to remake their image. The authorities have announced in recent days that prosecutors are weighing charges against Habib el-Adly, recently removed as interior minister. The charges, including murder, are related to the killing of protesters by security officers during the unrest.
On Wednesday, some cellphone customers in Egypt received the equivalent of marketing messages from the new minister, Mahmoud Wagdy. One read, ''From the Ministry of Interior: The police will do nothing but serve and protect the people.'' Another said, ''Starting today, we will only deal through truthfulness, honesty and rule of law.''
As Mr. Mubarak held on to power, influential groups and people seemed determined to distance themselves from his government's legacy. Members of a prominent journalists' association moved toward a no-confidence vote against their leader, Makram Mohamed Ahmed, a former Mubarak speechwriter, the daily Al Masry Al Youm reported on its English-language Web site.
And the recently appointed culture minister, Gaber Asfour, a literary critic, resigned Wednesday after pressure from his colleagues, according to Al Ahram.
Outside groups, meanwhile, continued to try to take advantage of the Egyptian uprising. In an online forum, a group in Iraq affiliated with Al Qaeda called on Egyptians to ''wage violent jihad to topple the regime in Egypt,'' according to Khaled Hamza, the editor of the Web site of the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's largest opposition movement.
He bristled at the comments, saying the revolt in Egypt was nonviolent and included ''all sects, trends and religions.''
''Egyptians are capable of solving their problem without intrusion, meddling and prying from foreign groups such as Al Qaeda and similar groups advocating the use of violence,'' he said.
Increasingly, the political clamor for Mr. Mubarak's ouster seemed to be complemented by strikes nationwide. While many strikes seemed to focus on specific grievances related to working conditions, labor leaders suggested they were energized by protests against Mr. Mubarak.
Rahma Refaat, a lawyer at the Center for Trade Union and Worker Services, said, ''Most of those on strike say that we have discovered that the resources of our country have been stolen by the regime.''
The protest against the Suez Canal Authority began Tuesday night and was staged by about 6,000 workers. In Helwan, 6,000 workers at the Misr Helwan Spinning and Weaving Company went on strike, Ms. Refaat said.
More than 2,000 workers from the Sigma pharmaceutical company in Quesna began a strike while about 5,000 unemployed youths stormed a government building in Aswan, demanding the dismissal of the governor.
Postal workers protested in shifts, Ms. Refaat said. In Cairo, sanitation workers demonstrated outside their headquarters.
In Al Ahram's lobby, journalists called their protest a microcosm of the Egyptian uprising, with young journalists leading demands for better working conditions and less biased coverage.
''Egypt before the 25th is different from Egypt after the 25th,'' said Essam Saad, who does work for the newspaper, referring to Jan. 25, the first day of antigovernment protests. ''What is happening now is going to clean up Al Ahram. This newspaper is supposed to be the newspaper of the people, not the newspaper of the regime and the government.''

HEADLINE: Team Chosen for Work on Big Middle-Income Complex in Queens

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The Bloomberg administration announced Wednesday that it had selected a team led by the Related Companies to construct the first phase of a development on the Queens waterfront that will be the largest middle-income complex built in the city since the 1970s.
Related and its partners -- Phipps Houses, the largest nonprofit operator of affordable housing in the city, and Monadnock Construction, one of the largest builders of affordable housing -- will erect two towers at what is called Hunters Point South, with 908 rental apartments, at least 685 of which will be set aside for working- and middle-class families earning $32,000 to $130,000 a year. 
Hunters Point South is a signature project of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's housing and waterfront development policies. The entire 5,000-unit complex, which was first announced by the mayor more than four years ago, will offer subsidized housing for an unusually broad swath of working- and middle-class families. The city has invested heavily in the site, buying this once industrial stretch of waterfront, where Newtown Creek enters the East River, for $100 million.
The city is also spending about $175 million on a toxic cleanup of the site, a 10-acre park, roads and water and sewer lines. It is also bestowing $50 million in grants to subsidize the affordable units in the first two buildings. A school is scheduled to open in 2013.
''At Hunters Point South,'' Mr. Bloomberg said in a statement, ''not only will we build the largest affordable housing complex in more than three decades, we'll do it on a long-vacant waterfront property that has incredible views and sits adjacent to one of New York City's fastest growing neighborhoods.''
The project has been a long time coming. Years ago, as part of its ultimately unsuccessful bid for the 2012 Olympics, the Bloomberg administration wanted to use the land to build housing for athletes; after the Olympics, the housing would have been turned into apartments. At the time, some officials in Queens feared that it would become a slum.
But as developers and investors began buying up large blocks of housing for poor and working-class families, raising fears that rents would quickly rise, Mr. Bloomberg announced plans in 2006 to build affordable housing at the waterfront site.
Stephen M. Ross, chief executive of the Related Companies, at first hoped to persuade the Real Estate Board of New York, the powerful lobbying arm of the real estate industry, to build the housing on a nonprofit basis. But Mr. Ross, who then headed the board, had trouble persuading his fellow developers to take on the project, and the city was reluctant to turn the entire site over to a single entity.
''This is something I believe in passionately,'' Mr. Ross said. ''To succeed and prosper, the city has to build workforce housing. It can't be the most expensive city to live and work in. But there haven't been any middle-income housing programs for the past 20 years.''
Rival developers complained privately that the city would favor Mr. Ross because of his close ties to the Bloomberg administration. City officials went to great lengths to explain why the Related team was chosen.
Rafael E. Cestero, the city's housing commissioner, said that the Related-Phipps-Monadnock team had submitted the lowest-cost bid and adhered most closely to the city's design guidelines. Indeed, it was the only one, he said, that offered to build all the apartments for poor, working- and middle-class families. The city will be subsidizing only 75 percent of the project because of financial constraints on its part, Mr. Cestero said.
''I'm disappointed,'' said K. Thomas Elghanayan, chairman of TF Cornerstone, a finalist in the competition. ''But Related is a very competent firm.''
The Related proposal is a victory of sorts for the city, which was hoping for at least 60 percent of the units to be affordable. The city plans to begin building the water and sewer lines next month, along with 5 acres of the planned 10-acre park.
Construction of the two apartment buildings will not begin until June 2012 and will take about two years to complete. The rest of Hunters Point South will not be completed until after Mr. Bloomberg leaves office.

HEADLINE: House Republicans Take E.P.A. Chief to Task

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Congressional Republicans on Wednesday opened a formal assault on the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate greenhouse gases, raising doubts about the legal, scientific and economic basis of rules proposed by the agency.
The forum was a hearing convened by the energy and power subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee to review the economic impact of pending limits on carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases. But much of the discussion focused instead on whether climate science supports the agency's finding that greenhouse gases are a threat to health and the environment; that finding is what makes the gases subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act.
Lisa P. Jackson, the E.P.A. administrator, was subjected to more than two hours of questioning, some of it hostile, about proposed limits on emissions from factories, refineries, power plants and vehicles. 
Republican lawmakers asserted that the science underpinning the regulatory effort was a hoax, questioned the agency's interpretation of a Supreme Court decision giving it power to regulate carbon dioxide, and accused the Obama administration of sacrificing American jobs in its misplaced zeal to address climate change.
''The E.P.A. and the Obama administration have decided that they want to put the American economy in a straitjacket, costing us millions of jobs and billions of dollars a year,'' Representative Joe L. Barton, Republican of Texas, said in his opening remarks. ''They couldn't get it through the legislative process, so they've tried to do it by a regulatory approach. It's not going to work.''
He later told Ms. Jackson that he was delighted she could appear before the committee and said that she should plan to be there frequently over the next two years.
Another Republican, Representative John Shimkus of Illinois, asked Ms. Jackson whether she believed in the law of supply and demand. Ms. Jackson, who holds a graduate degree in chemical engineering from Princeton University, replied, ''I was trained in it.''
''But do you believe that as costs go up, supply goes down?'' Mr. Shimkus demanded.
''It depends on the elasticity of the cost curve,'' Ms. Jackson responded.
A third Republican questioner, Representative Lee Terry of Nebraska, asked Ms. Jackson facetiously if she liked puppies. She started to answer that she did, provided that they were properly housebroken. Mr. Terry sharply interrupted, saying he was only mocking the gentle questions that Democrats were asking to elicit rehearsed answers.
Ms. Jackson repeated her now-familiar defense of greenhouse gas regulation at the hearing, saying that cleaning up the environment would not only improve health but also create jobs.
She said the Supreme Court, in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, obliged the agency to determine whether carbon dioxide emissions endangered human health and welfare. Ms. Jackson said that both the George W. Bush administration and the Obama administration had concluded that the emissions do so.
And she strenuously objected to a bill introduced last week by two top Republicans on the committee, Representatives Fred Upton of Michigan and Edward Whitfield of Kentucky, seeking to overturn that court decision and thwart the agency's efforts to carry it out.
''Chairman Upton's bill is part of an effort to delay, weaken or eliminate Clean Air Act protections of the American public,'' Ms. Jackson said in her opening statement. ''Chairman Upton's bill would, in its own words, repeal the scientific finding regarding greenhouse gas emissions. Politicians overruling scientists on a scientific question -- that would become part of this committee's legacy.''
Mr. Upton said that his bill, called the Energy Tax Prevention Act of 2011, was narrowly drawn to restrict agency regulation only of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, not the other air pollutants that have been shown to have more direct effects on health.
He said that regulating carbon dioxide emissions would make the most abundant fuels prohibitively expensive to use, and would put American manufacturers at a disadvantage compared with industries in countries that have no such rules.
''Needless to say,'' Mr. Upton said, ''the Chinese government and other competitors have no intention of burdening and raising the cost of doing business for their manufacturers and energy producers the way E.P.A. plans to do here in America. Our goal should be to export goods, not jobs.''

HEADLINE: MetLife and Prudential Beat Estimates

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Major insurers posted mixed results on Wednesday as the Allstate Corporation fell short of estimates because of catastrophe-related losses, while the life insurers MetLife and Prudential Financial had stronger results, helped by returns on their annuity businesses. 
Allstate's catastrophe losses rose 64 percent in the quarter compared with a year earlier. The company's auto premiums also declined. The catastrophe-related losses had been expected as a result of the high number of storms late in the year, but had not been taken into account in market forecasts.
While MetLife and Prudential reported smaller profits than a year ago, both managed to beat expectations. MetLife had record variable annuity sales and a 23 percent rise in retirement product fees.
MetLife posted a net profit of $51 million, or 5 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $289 million, or 35 cents a share. Operating earnings were $1.14 a share, better than the $1.10 expected by analysts.
MetLife said net income fell in the quarter because of a number of factors, including hedging related to its variable annuity business and higher amortization of costs related to its acquisition of new business.
Stock in MetLife, which is based in New York, fell 87 cents, to $47.60 a share.
Prudential reported a net profit of $213 million, or 45 cents a share, against a year-earlier profit of $1.79 billion, or $3.78 per share.
Adjusted operating earnings were $1.78 a share. Analysts expected earnings of $1.48 a share for the period.
Net profits sank on nearly $1 billion in realized losses and related adjustments, tied largely to the falling value of derivatives used in the company's hedging programs. Prudential blamed fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currencies for the losses.
Stock in Prudential, which is based in Newark, fell 88 cents, to $63.13 a share.
Allstate had a net profit of $296 million, or 55 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $518 million, or 96 cents a share. Operating earnings of 50 cents fell short of the 88 cents expected by analysts.
Allstate's declines were tied mostly to the higher catastrophe losses and a rise in claims and claims expense, plus a jump in operating costs. Allstate's chief executive, Thomas J. Wilson, said the company was still working to get the right pricing and customer mix in its homeowners' operations.
Stock in Allstate, which is based in Northbrook, Ill., fell 20 cents, to $32.36 a share.
''We still have a ways to go before we get a return on that business,'' Mr. Wilson said in an interview, adding that he thought the goal was 12 to 18 months away.

HEADLINE: At Center of Derivatives Debate, a Gung-Ho Regulator

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS and MAC WILLIAM BISHOP


HIGHLIGHT: In the latest DealBook Portrait, Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, says he wants to bring more transparency to the murky $600 trillion derivatives market.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - Gary Gensler has his work cut out for him.
As chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, he is leading the charge to overhaul the murky $600 trillion derivatives market, which was at the center of the financial crisis. The Dodd-Frank Act, the financial overhaul law enacted last year, requires Mr. Gensler's agency to draft dozens of new derivatives rules by July.
Since taking the helm of the commission in early 2009, Mr. Gensler, 53, has developed a reputation as a consumer-friendly regulator - despite his 18 years on Wall Street, including nine as a Goldman Sachs partner. He has been pushing aggressively to impose the Dodd-Frank rules, although he has had to dial back on a few occasions in order to strike a compromise.
Mr. Gensler keeps on his desk a copy of the 848-page law that features a personal inscription from the authors of the legislation, including Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, who wrote in the margin, "You should derive satisfaction from this."
His gung-ho approach has drawn the ire of the new Republican Congress, which is threatening to withhold additional money from Mr. Gensler's agency. Wall Street lobbyists have bombarded him with complaints and requests for exemptions, too.
It's a political storm familiar to Mr. Gensler. A Baltimore native, he served as assistant Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration and later advised Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland and the architect of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which overhauled the nation's accounting rules.
In a recent interview from his Washington office, Mr. Gensler spoke with DealBook about the challenges of Dodd-Frank, his days on Wall Street and life as a single father of three since his wife, the artist Francesca Danieli, died more than four years ago from breast cancer.
Q.
You've been in the job since 2009. What's the most challenging aspect?
A.
Partly, it's that I have three daughters, and it's just finding the time to be with them. With regard to the job itself, I think it's a great staff here and a great set of commissioners. But we do all come with different perspectives.
Q.
The C.F.T.C. has taken up much of the implementation of Dodd-Frank. How challenging has it been?
A.
I think this is a great honor to be in this job. It is also a challenge to integrate all of these public comments, all of the different views and actually end up with a result that benefits the American public.
Q.
What's the most absurd complaint you've received about the new regulations?
A.
I'm not bothered by any of this because it's often motivated by profits. But there are an awful lot of folks in industry who want an exception. And some of those exceptions are appropriate, but some of them you have to be amused and laugh at. As it relates to Wall Street directly, they tend to want less transparency because that helps their profits and their revenues.
Q.
How would you describe the response you've received from industry lobbyists?
A.
It's professional. It's active. We've had about 475 meetings in five months. And since the lobbyists haven't found us on the weekends (usually), you can do the arithmetic. It's quite a bit.
I will say this: In America, large institutions have a great deal more resources than the investor advocates. If you looked at those 475 meetings - and we're posting every one of them on our Web site - 90-plus percent are probably larger institutions or corporations.
Q.
Can your staff handle the load?
A.
This agency, just this past year, got back to the size it was in 1999. We think we need about 400 more people - even though we're taking on markets that are seven times the size of what we currently regulate and far more complicated. So we're going to continue to make the case. Even though our great nation has a very large deficit, this is the best investment for taxpayer money.
Q.
Republicans have said that the C.F.T.C. is moving too fast in developing regulations. Are they right?
A.
I think we have to remember there was a great financial crisis in 2008. Every American was affected - millions of Americans are out of work, millions of Americans have homes that are worth less than their mortgages. Derivatives played a role in that.
We're human. Some things will slip. But I think this is an appropriate goal.
Q.
Does it ever get overwhelming?
A.
There's certainly moments where I need to take a breath. I've been a lifelong runner, and I think of this like a marathon, which I've done many of, or mountain climbing, which I've also done. So there are times that you just want to take a breath. But we have the task that the American public expects us to do: to lower risk and promote transparency.
Q.
Which is tougher, life on Wall Street or life in Washington?
A.
I was honored to be on the Street for 18 years. There the competition is of course about client services, but ultimately about profits and revenues. Here the big difference is, everything is exposed and transparent.
Q.
Would you ever go back to Goldman?
A.
I was blessed. I went to public schools in Maryland. Neither of my parents went to college. I ended up as a young kid, really, at 21 at this financial firm on the Street and had a fabulous 18 years, challenging and rewarding. But this stage of my life is really about public service. So no, I don't have any interest to do that.
Q.
Why leave a profitable career to come to Washington?
A.
I think what government does makes a difference. I was also a kid that was involved in student government in high school. I was treasurer. I lost for senior class president.
Q.
Will you run for public office?
A.
I don't know.
Q.
How are you coping as a single father?
A.
Francesca was a beautiful woman, an artist - a bit irreverent and a great sense of humor. But she showed remarkable courage through 20-plus years of cancer. She actually had cancer from the time we were dating.
We have three beautiful girls. Sometimes around the house it is one step removed from a sitcom. There are things that don't get done. But we make it work.

HEADLINE: Citing Lawsuit Against Mets' Owners, Moody's Reassesses Citi Field's Bonds

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
Although Citi Field is not a target of the lawsuit against the Mets' owners by the trustee for the victims of Bernard L. Madoff's fraud, the bonds that financed it have a new black mark against them.
Moody's Investors Service on Thursday changed its outlook on the $695 million in bonds from stable to negative. Last year, Moody's and Standard & Poor's downgraded the debt on the stadium to a rating of junk status. That rating remains in effect. 
In its statement, Moody's said its gloomier assessment of the Citi Field bonds ''acknowledges the close connection between the health and performance of the Mets baseball team and the long-term credit of the stadium project.'' The change in Moody's outlook could be a precursor to another downgrade in the rating.
Moody's more sober view, and any future rating cut, would increase the cost of future borrowings for the stadium. The Mets also have a lot of debt, as does their SNY network, and they have borrowed to their limit on Major League Baseball's credit line.
In changing its view of the bonds, Moody's said it was looking at the trustee's demands for $300 million from the Mets' owners in ''fictitious profits'' -- their suspected net gains in Madoff investment accounts -- and $700 million more for what the trustee said was their willful ignorance of the Ponzi scheme.
Moody's said that the lawsuit by the trustee, Irving H. Picard, could ''negatively affect the quality and performance'' of the Mets and attendance at the stadium.
In a statement, the Mets said: ''To clarify, Moody's has affirmed the current rating on the IDA bonds, although it has changed its subjective outlook.'' The bonds were issued by the New York City Industrial Development Agency. ''As Moody's noted in its release,'' the team added, ''the litigation in question does not involve Queens Ballpark Company LLC,'' which is, according to the Mets, the subsidiary that developed Citi Field.
One sign of the pressure created by Picard's lawsuit was the recent decision by Fred Wilpon, the principal owner of the Mets, to seek investors willing to buy up to 25 percent of the team.
The action by Moody's reflects concerns about the team as the Mets' owners vow to fight the trustee in court. Last year's reduction of the bonds to junk status arose largely because of the problems of Ambac Assurance Corp., which was chosen to guarantee the bonds if the Mets missed a debt payment. As a result of Ambac's problems -- its parent company later filed for bankruptcy protection -- S&P said the stadium bonds lacked enough of a reserve fund if cash flow slowed.
In its opening season of 2009, Citi Field had revenue of $180.4 million and expenses of $84.9 million, including $42.9 million in bond payments. Net income totaled $98.7 million.
The mostly tax-exempt bonds are paid by the Mets from stadium revenue generated from a portion of premium seat sales, concessions, parking and other sources. The price of one of the largest parts of the bonds has fallen about 20 percent since October, which creates paper losses for bondholders and increases the risk to buyers.

HEADLINE: Community Colleges Are Uneasy as Ax Hangs Over State Aid for Health Benefits

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER A. SMITH. 
csmith@texastribune.org

 BODY:
The Legislature's initial state budget proposals calling for the closing of four community colleges caught many lawmakers off guard. But what largely escaped their attention -- the slashing of health benefits across all such institutions -- is what concerns community college officials the most. 
The Senate's proposed budget would finance only 50 percent of health care costs for community college employees, down from 83 percent currently. The House budget would cover even less, about one-fifth of current financing, or $75 per eligible employee per month.
If these cuts are approved, community colleges will have to scramble to squeeze millions of dollars more out of their already tight budgets -- most likely leading to fewer teachers, fewer classes and higher tuition for their growing population of students.
''Colleges are going to get smaller; there is going to be less access; there's going to be fewer employees; there's going to be fewer programs. And that has ramifications for the state's economy,'' said Steven Johnson, a spokesman for the Texas Association of Community Colleges.
Like state agencies and public colleges and universities, community colleges receive state money to cover the premiums for employee health insurance. This financing is discretionary, meaning lawmakers can cut it.
But while community colleges are facing such large cuts in their health coverage financing, Mr. Johnson said, such financing for the state's four-year institutions has never dropped below 90 percent.
Texas' community colleges trimmed their budgets by 5 percent last year, on Gov. Rick Perry's orders, and they submitted budgets with 10 percent cuts for the 2012-13 biennium, as state leaders requested.
Leo Zuniga, a spokesman for Alamo Colleges, a community college system in San Antonio, said he was not sure how the schools would further reduce spending or raise more money.
College officials have already taken several steps, including raising local taxes, instituting a hiring freeze, increasing class size and increasing tuition.
Complicating matters is the fact that the student body in the state's community colleges is growing exponentially. Mr. Zuniga said enrollment at Alamo Colleges had jumped to nearly 64,000 students in the fall of 2010 from about 52,000 in 2008.
''It is a tremendous reduction,'' Mr. Zuniga said of the proposed cuts, ''and I don't know how we would deal with it.''
Statewide, community college enrollment has grown by nearly 67 percent since 2000, according to the Legislative Budget Board. Community colleges now educate more than 50 percent of all college students in Texas. In the fall of 2010, 64 percent of all first-time college students enrolled in community colleges, according to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.
State Representative Dennis Bonnen, Republican of Angleton, was among the most vocal lawmakers displeased with the House budget, which would close Brazosport College in his district. While Mr. Bonnen said he was confident that the college would get enough state money to keep its doors open, he said restoring money for employee health care financing was just as important.
''It's a hell of a cut,'' he said. ''I mean, the money's got to come from somewhere.''

HEADLINE: Old Mines Reopen in a Revival of California's Gold Rush

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

 BODY:
SUTTER CREEK, Calif. -- Standing in a cramped, slanted and slippery crevice some 500 feet below the earth's surface, David Cochrane turned his eyes to a ribbon of marbled quartz -- mainly gray, amber and white -- and found the one hue he was actually looking for.
''Right there, see? It's small but it's very colorful,'' Mr. Cochrane said, pointing at a shiny speck no bigger than a seed. ''It's got that nice yellow color.''
It was gold, and if people like Mr. Cochrane have their way, gold will soon be big business again in California's Mother Lode, in the same area of the Sierras -- and occasionally the same mines -- where the old-time prospectors once used pick axes, ore carts and burros to chase their riches. 
''People say the Mother Lode's mined out,'' said Mr. Cochrane, a vice president with Sutter Gold Mining Inc., based in Colorado. ''But that's not the case.''
Indeed, Sutter Gold is just one of several companies seeking to reignite a long-dormant industry in California, a state whose early history and growth were intimately intertwined with gold's discovery, excavation and exploitation.
Most of California's large mines closed after World War II as price controls made the business model unappealing. But with controls gone, and gold now selling at more than $1,300 an ounce, the math makes sense again.
''The price is there,'' said James Hesketh, the president and chief executive of Atna Resources, which reopened the Briggs Mine on the western border of Death Valley National Park in 2009. ''It's still a very well-endowed resource state.''
Sutter Gold estimates that there could be $800 million in ore under the 3.6 mile stretch it owns in the Mother Lode. And with most of about three dozen local, state, and federal permits already in hand, its new Lincoln Mine could be producing gold as early as next year.
But Sutter Gold will not be the first to get back in the game in California. In addition to the Briggs Mine, which last year produced some 25,000 ounces of gold -- or about $30 million worth -- there is the Mesquite Mine, in Imperial County on the Mexican border, which reopened in 2008. In 2010, that mine outstripped company estimates to produce nearly 170,000 ounces of gold.
Both the Briggs and Mesquite projects are open-pit mines. But here in the Sierra foothills, where the discovery of nuggets in 1848 set off the world's first gold rush, miners are headed back underground. In addition to the Lincoln Mine, plans are afoot to reopen the Idaho-Maryland mine in Grass Valley, a family-friendly area 50 miles northeast of Sacramento.
That mine -- now flooded -- has not had hard hats in it since 1956, but a Canadian company is convinced that more than one million ounces of gold were left behind. ''This was a world-class ore body,'' said David Watkinson, chief executive of the Emgold Mining Corporation, which owns the mine.
The Idaho-Maryland project is much further from being shovel-ready than the Lincoln Mine: pumping out more than 50 years of water will take time, after all, as does completing a variety of environmental impact reports and permitting processes. And the prospect of a newly opened mine has also been met with opposition from some local activists, whose worries are rooted in both the legacy of the first Gold Rush -- including contaminated and sediment-filled rivers and hillsides denuded by hydraulic drills -- and by more modern quality-of-life concerns like traffic, noise and water rights.
''We'd be looking at reopening a mine in the middle of a city,'' said Ralph Silberstein, the president of a grass-roots group called Citizens Looking At the Impacts of Mining in Grass Valley (or Claim-GV). ''Which is not a good idea.''
Indeed, like many of the other towns in the Mother Lode, Grass Valley has long since moved its economy away from mining toward things like software and tourism. The Gold Rush itself peaked in 1852, according to the state's Department of Conservation, when nearly four million ounces were discovered in California. By 1971, when the nation went off the gold standard, less than 2,000 ounces were produced in California.
But the rebound in price has led to a rebound in production. Domestic gold mine production in 2010 increased for the first time in a decade, according to the United States Geological Survey. Nevada is by far the largest gold-producing state, producing roughly four times that of all other states combined.
Most of Nevada's mines are open pits, but early California prospectors used pans and their hands to find nuggets in freezing cold streams. Methods soon became more intrusive, however, with machinery and dynamite being used to dig into hard rock and lethal chemicals like mercury and cyanide used to help process the crushed ore.
And while today's methods are safer, Izzy Martin, chief executive of the Sierra Fund, a nonprofit group devoted to preservation of the Sierra Nevada, says there are several challenges to mining old mines, including what previous companies might have left behind.
''There's a lot of toxic materials in there,'' Ms. Martin said. ''And you have to clean it up.''
Such processes can be expensive, particularly in an environmentally attuned state like California. And the worry, Ms. Martin said, is that companies could abandon the work halfway. ''And then we'll be left with this gigantic eyesore,'' she said.
For its part, Emgold says its mine will be ''a forward-thinking, environmentally responsible business,'' which will provide jobs and tax dollars for the local economy. Water from the mine will be treated before it is returned to local creeks, the company says, and some of the mine's waste rock will even be used to make another product: tile.
And while the Gold Rush miners swarmed the region in a near-lawless crush, Mr. Watkinson says today's deliberate pace of exploration, permitting and local approval -- the Idaho-Maryland project has been in the works on and off for nearly two decades -- has made the hunt for nuggets seem almost dull.
''The concept of a 'gold rush' is no longer applicable into today's world,'' Mr. Watkinson said. ''All anyone can expect to see is resurgence, not a rush.''
That said, there is an undeniable romance surrounding the idea of gold in places like Sutter Creek, a picturesque town of 3,000 where there is a Eureka Street, a Gold Dust Trail and Oro Madre Way.
The Lincoln Mine itself sits just off Highway 49, a reference to the year -- 1849 -- when the first Gold Rush kicked into high gear. Pending a few more permits, Sutter Gold Mining hopes to break ground this year on its new mill -- designed to look like an old mill, per an agreement with the town.
The actual mine will be built out from an existing tunnel that is currently used for tours, a popular attraction drawing some 50,000 visitors a year. But Mr. Cochrane says a mine could be even more lucrative; engineers, using calculations made with modern surveying equipment as well as historic mine records, believe there is nearly 700,000 ounces still in the ground.
On a recent tour, Mr. Cochrane showed off several veins of quartz, flecked with what he said could be either gold -- or its deceptive cousin, iron pyrite. Once the mine is fully operational -- probably by 2013 -- he expects dozens of miners to be blasting into those veins.
''They're our friends,'' he said of the quartz veins. ''Because that's where the gold is.''

HEADLINE: In China, Tentative Steps Toward a Global Currency

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

 BODY:
SHANGHAI -- Now that it has passed Japan to become the world's second-largest economy after the United States, China is considering the next step as a world power: making its money a global currency.
No one expects that to happen immediately. And even the Chinese government is wary of making some of the free-market moves that would enable the renminbi to take its place alongside the dollar, euro and Japanese yen as a fully convertible reserve currency.
Still, over the last year Beijing has begun to gradually loosen its tight currency controls. For the first time, for example, American companies like McDonald's and Caterpillar have been allowed to finance their China projects by selling renminbi-denominated bonds in Hong Kong.
Richard Lavin, a group president at Caterpillar, said his company's $150 million Hong Kong offering last November was less expensive than taking out a loan in China or raising the money in dollars and then converting those dollars into renminbi. The bonds were issued to help finance Caterpillar's equipment leasing business in China. 
''This was a successful issue,'' Mr. Lavin said. ''Before, we were funding our operations by bringing in dollars and changing them to RMB.''
Meanwhile, in Russia, Vietnam and Thailand, some cross-border trades with China can now be settled in renminbi, so that trading partners do not have to convert in and out of dollars. One pilot program lets Russian companies like Sportmaster, a retail chain based in Moscow, buy or sell goods using Chinese currency.
And in New York, the Chinese government has permitted an overseas branch of Bank of China to accept deposits in renminbi. That enables depositors outside China to bet on a currency that is widely expected to appreciate against the dollar over the next few years.
''This is all encouraging the internationalization of the renminbi,'' Kelvin Lau, an economist at Standard Chartered Bank who is based in Hong Kong, said of Beijing's recent moves. ''They want to make the Chinese currency a popular currency.''
At Thursday's exchange rates, renminbi were trading just below 6.59 to the United States dollar -- a level that many experts say values the Chinese currency artificially low, as a result of Beijing's intervention efforts. Five years ago, the renminbi was trading at slightly more than 8 to the dollar.
Beyond mere bragging rights, China has economic motives for trying to go global with the renminbi. Analysts say the moves, if successful, could strengthen China's influence in overseas financial markets and begin to erode the dollar's dominance. Beijing could also eventually reap the rewards, like cheaper debt financing, that come with being recognized as a world reserve currency.
Global investors eager to bet on China's growth story, meanwhile, could find that looser controls on the renminbi make it easier to invest directly in bonds and other assets denominated in renminbi.
And importers and exporters could reduce their currency-fluctuation risks by settling China-related trade deals in renminbi rather than dollars or euros.
Robert A. Mundell, a Nobel laureate economist whose research is credited with helping develop the euro, says the renminbi's rise is all but inevitable.
''The RMB is likely to become a reserve currency in the future, even if the government of China does nothing about it,'' Professor Mundell said in an e-mail response to questions. He noted that the renminbi was already a regional currency in Southeast Asia, where China had become the dominant trading partner of many countries.
If China does eventually open its capital market by eliminating currency exchange controls, he said, ''the progress of the RMB as an international currency will be assured.''
But analysts caution that right now the renminbi is far from ready to mount a serious challenge to the United States dollar as the world's leading reserve currency. For one thing, China needs to assure investors that its political system is stable and that its economy still has plenty of growth ahead. For all its rapid growth over the last 30 years, China remains relatively poor compared with the United States, the Europe Union or Japan.
As an influence on global financial markets, the renminbi is ''still a distant, distant, distant fourth,'' said Albert Keidel, a China specialist at the Public Policy Institute at Georgetown University in Washington. ''People are going to start holding more renminbi, but it will be at least a decade or two for it to become a leading world reserve currency.''
China is the world's largest exporter and one of the biggest destinations for foreign direct investment, but the Chinese government still maintains strict control over its currency and banking system and the flow of money in and out of the country.
Economists say these restrictions allow Beijing to manage -- some say manipulate -- the renminbi exchange rate, keeping the currency undervalued enough to bolster exports. The policies also restrict the amount of capital that can enter the country -- or exit in the event of a sudden downturn.
China has been reluctant to make its currency fully convertible because its banks and financial system are still immature. What is more, allowing money to flow in and out of the country with few restrictions would effectively mean surrendering control over vital aspects of the state-run banking system.
But analysts say Beijing may eventually be forced to change its approach because its self-imposed financial restrictions leave the door to international markets only half open for China, undermining its global ambitions.
China's tight management of exchange rates also leads to complex market distortions that analysts say force Beijing to accumulate huge foreign exchange reserves -- much of them in the form of American Treasury bonds.
As long as China continues tightly linking the renminbi to the dollar, analysts say, the People's Bank of China is effectively outsourcing the nation's monetary policy to the United States Federal Reserve. And as the value of the dollar has dropped in recent years, Beijing has begun complaining that the United States' soaring budget deficits are eroding the value of China's huge dollar-denominated holdings.
Eswar S. Prasad, a professor of economics at Cornell University and the former head of the International Monetary Fund's China division, says these concerns are pushing China to step up its own efforts to reduce its reliance on the dollar and internationalize its own currency.
''This is a striking change,'' Professor Prasad said. ''But this is all conditional on whether they can reform their own financial markets. They know that if they open and their financial markets are not ready, it could lead to a disaster.''
If Beijing is not willing to take the steps necessary for making the renminbi fully convertible, many analysts doubt whether China can internationalize its currency in the coming years.
''They're in uncharted territory,'' says Nicholas R. Lardy, an economist and China specialist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. ''But this is how China does everything. They experiment around the edges. You might look back 10 years from now and say it was the opening wedge in a transformation. Or it could be a flop.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article last Friday about China's tentative steps toward making the renminbi a global currency described the trend in its value versus the American dollar incorrectly in some editions. The renminbi, which was trading just below 6.59 to the dollar on Thursday, Feb. 10., was slightly more than 8 to the dollar five years ago-- 20 percent lower than now, not higher.

HEADLINE: Military Is Caught Between Two Sides

BYLINE: By SCOTT SHANE and DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK; Scott Shane reported from Washington, and David D. Kirkpatrick from Cairo; Thom Shanker contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Even as pro-democracy demonstrations in Cairo have riveted the world's attention for 17 days, the Egyptian military has managed the crisis with seeming finesse, winning over street protesters, quietly consolidating its domination of top government posts and sidelining potential rivals for leadership, notably President Hosni Mubarak's son Gamal.
Then came Thursday, a roller coaster of a day on which the military at first appeared to be moving to usher Mr. Mubarak from the scene -- and then watched with the world as Mr. Mubarak clung to his title, delegating some powers to Omar Suleiman, the vice president and former longtime intelligence chief.
The standoff between the protest leaders and Mr. Mubarak, hours before major demonstrations set for Friday, could pose a new dilemma for military commanders. Mr. Suleiman called for an end to demonstrations, and Human Rights Watch said this week that some military units had been involved in detaining and abusing protesters. But by most accounts, army units deployed in Cairo and other cities have shown little appetite for using force to clear the streets. 
Early Friday, Mohamed ElBaradei, an opposition leader and the former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, posted a message on Twitter saying: ''Egypt will explode. Army must save the country now.''
Andrew McGregor of the Jamestown Foundation, a Washington research center, said that the military was caught between Mr. Mubarak and the protesters, and that it was hard to predict how officers might react. ''For the first time, I think there's the possibility of a split in the military,'' said Mr. McGregor, author of ''A Military History of Modern Egypt.''
The protesters' hopes soared Thursday afternoon, when the chief of staff of the armed forces, Lt. Gen. Sami Hafez Enan, visited Tahrir Square in Cairo and suggested that their demands would soon be met. He also presided along with the defense minister, Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, over a meeting of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces. Paul J. Sullivan, an expert on the Egyptian military at the National Defense University, said it was only the third time in Egypt's history that the council had met; the other meetings were during wars with Israel in 1967 and 1973.
Neither Mr. Mubarak nor Mr. Suleiman were at the meeting, and the resulting communique declared that the council had met ''in affirmation of support for the legitimate demands of the people.'' So it came as a shock when Mr. Mubarak said he was not stepping down.
The military has been an anchor of Egypt's authoritarian government for nearly 60 years. It helped usher Mr. Mubarak, a former air force chief, into office after the assassination of Anwar el-Sadat in 1981. But under Mr. Mubarak's rule, its role in Egyptian politics has been reduced, with the separate domestic security services playing the role of political enforcer. Many top military officers have kept busy overseeing the military industries that represent an estimated 5 to 15 percent of the economy.
Assuming military leaders went along with it, the decision to leave Mr. Suleiman in place suggests no irreversible commitment to move toward democracy. Even in recent days, Mr. Suleiman has suggested that the country is not ready for democracy and that the emergency rule in place for decades should not be ended yet, a point Mr. Mubarak echoed in his speech. At 74, Mr. Suleiman has been one of Mr. Mubarak's closest aides for nearly two decades, serving as chief of military intelligence and then the nation's intelligence director until he was named vice president on Jan. 28.
His relationship with General Enan is unclear. General Enan, 63, is a generation younger than Mr. Mubarak. He has spent extended periods in the United States and is closer to American commanders than the oldest Egyptian military leaders, including Mr. Tantawi, 75, the defense minister, who were trained by the Soviet Union.
American officials said General Enan had offered them assurances that the armed forces would defend Egyptian institutions, not individuals, and that they would not open fire on civilians. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has commended the Egyptian military for what he called ''exemplary'' conduct amid the street protests and said it had ''made a contribution to the evolution of democracy.''
In addition to its role as the ultimate source of political power, the military has a huge role in the Egyptian economy. Since a peace treaty was signed with Israel in 1979, military industries have expanded in part to keep a relatively idle officer corps content.
''Part of the strategy was to buy their acquiescence through a greater economic role for them,'' said Michael Wahid Hanna, an analyst with the Century Foundation, a research organization, who has been in Cairo during the crisis. ''Their business interests are vast,'' he said, and include benefits like officers clubs and a boat on the Nile for the air force.
After the protests began Jan. 25, the military asserted itself in domestic politics for the first time in years, deploying in Cairo and other cities. The initial reshuffling of Mr. Mubarak's government, though perceived abroad as a concession to the demonstrators, tightened the grip of the military and intelligence old guard.
First came the advance of Mr. Suleiman, whose appointment to the vice presidency has all but ruled out the succession of the president's son Gamal, 47, a well-connected businessman, removing a challenge to the military's dominance. Gamal Mubarak has no military background, but he was widely discussed as a possible successor to his father, to the distress of military and security officials.
''Suleiman hates Gamal,'' Mr. McGregor said.
In the personnel changes Mr. Mubarak announced days into the protests, the prime minister, Ahmed Nazif was replaced by the former commander of the air force, Ahmed Shafiq. The defense minister, Mr. Tantawi, was given the additional title of deputy prime minister while remaining commander in chief of the armed forces.
''This is a security cabinet put in place by Mubarak,'' said Michele Dunne, an expert on Egypt at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ''He fired all the economic reform people and brought in others who are security minded.''
Now the military finds itself in an unfamiliar role, caught between swelling protests and civilian leaders who appear reluctant to cede real power.
Mr. Hanna, of the Century Foundation, said the military had no training in policing the streets in the face of angry civilians. ''It is an open question,'' he said, ''whether the chain of command would be respected in a situation when it tasked a foot soldier or even a commander to kill their own people.''
Mr. Sullivan of the National Defense University said he had ''never been more worried about Egypt and the region than now.''
He said: ''When you have hopes that are dashed, that's the most dangerous moment. All bets are off.''

 BODY:
The sweet smell of daffodils was in the air at McCormick Place on Wednesday as hybrid-electric Chevrolet Volts glided silently along a test track.
The scent was detectable 50 feet away, on a stage where Chevrolet was introducing the Camaro ZL1, a supercharged 550-horsepower convertible painted an eye-catching orange.
The eco-friendly Volt and the muscular Camaro illustrate the conflicting messages sent by carmakers at the 2011 Chicago Auto Show, which opens to the public on Friday.
Across the sprawling exhibition, the country's largest in terms of space, automakers are doing their best to convince consumers that they offer both fuel-efficient cars and those that are exciting to drive. The companies believe both are necessary to continue the industry's climb out of its worst slump in a quarter-century. 
The Chicago show is considered a prime testing ground for consumer sentiment, more so than its rivals in Detroit and New York. Detroit's show tends to be dominated by its hometown auto companies, and New York's is skewed toward imports and luxury models, especially those from Germany.
''This is one of those rare markets where domestics and imports compete for equal share,'' James D. Farley, a group vice president at Ford Motor, said at a breakfast Wednesday kicking off press previews for the event.
Although automakers have turned to social-media campaigns on Twitter and Facebook, where Ford recently introduced the latest version of its Explorer sport utility vehicle, auto shows remain the best way to bring cars directly to potential buyers, Mr. Farley said.
That may explain why the twin message of performance and economy was so prevalent across the show's 1.2 million square feet of display space. Ford Motor displayed a pickup truck labeled Ecoboost -- its name for a series of more efficient engines -- sitting on top of a display for the Mustang muscle car.
Hyundai executives talked up the four models in their lineup that achieve 40 miles per gallon, then showed a version of the Genesis, a luxury coupe, rated at 429 horsepower.
Even Dodge, long a Chrysler division with rugged, powerful vehicles, tried to straddle the line. Much of its Wednesday news conference was spent touting a lineup peppered with high-powered cars, sport utilities and even a version of its Dodge Caravan minivan aimed at male buyers and labeled a ''man van.''
But those models have better fuel economy than in the past, said Ralph Gilles, the division's president. He spoke in front of a screen displaying a series of company slogans, including ''Cars can be fuel-efficient without being neutered.''
Ford's Mr. Farley, who was previously with Toyota, spoke bluntly about the threat posed by higher gasoline prices. ''We don't see $4- to $5-a-gallon gasoline as a question of if; it's a question of when,'' he told journalists at the breakfast.
But the timing of higher gasoline prices may be good for Ford, the only company that produces vehicles in Chicago -- the Explorer at a factory on the South Side.
Next month, Ford will introduce the 2012 version of the small Focus, bringing American buyers the same high-gas-mileage car that it sells overseas. Ford spent $550 million to retool a Michigan factory, which once turned out big pickups and S.U.V.'s, to make the cars that the company expects to be in hot demand as gas prices rise.
Bob Carter, a group vice president in charge of the Toyota division, said he, too, was bracing for more expensive gasoline. ''We are planning for a $3.50 national average this summer,'' said Mr. Carter, noting that many Chicago-area gas stations already charge that much per gallon.
Toyota, which sells more hybrid-electric vehicles than any other car company, is placing more emphasis on its hybrid lineup. Its display at the auto show includes two new models bearing the Prius nameplate: the Prius V, a sport utility model, and the Prius C, a concept version of the small plug-in hybrid that Toyota plans to introduce in the United States next year. Within a decade, Mr. Carter said, Toyota expects the sales of the two new models plus the original Prius to equal those of the midsize Camry, the nation's best-selling car since the late 1990s.
At last year's show, a pack of reporters pinned Mr. Carter against a Toyota Sienna minivan and questioned him about reports of sudden, unintended acceleration in its cars.
This week the United States Department of Transportation said an investigation of those reports showed the problem was not related to electronic systems on the vehicles. Instead, it blamed sticky accelerators and ill-designed floor mats, the defects that have led Toyota to recall more than 11 million vehicles worldwide.
''We're feeling very good,'' Mr. Carter said of the government's findings. ''We are moving on.''
At Dodge, Mr. Gilles was also basking in his parent company's newfound optimism. Chrysler received an overwhelmingly positive reaction to a two-minute commercial that was shown during the Super Bowl last Sunday.
The ad, featuring the rapper Eminem, a Detroit native, showed the new Chrysler 200 driving through the city, with the tag line ''Imported from Detroit.'' Those words are on a sign at McCormick, and Mr. Gilles said that Chrysler had received requests for T-shirts.
Even though he is a Montreal native, Mr. Gilles ''choked up'' upon viewing the ad, he said. ''It touches your heart.''
Mr. Gilles said dealers had ordered more Chrysler 200 cars, anticipating that sales would rise because of the ad. It was a boost for a company that went through a federally sponsored bankruptcy in 2009 and is now under the management control of Fiat, the Italian automaker.
Until last Sunday's commercial, the most attention-getting vehicle at Chrysler was the Fiat 500, which goes on sale this year and is imported from Mexico.
Across the industry, automakers are placing a series of bets on 2011 sales. The National Automobile Dealers Association predicts the companies will sell about 13 million cars and trucks this year, a projection shared by J. D. Power and Associates, the industry analysis firm. Last year, domestic and foreign companies sold about 11.5 million cars and trucks in the United States, compared with 10.4 million in 2009. Forecasters say sales should rise by at least another one million vehicles in 2012.
Others are not as optimistic. John Krafcik, the president of Hyundai Motor America, says his company expects sales of 12.8 million vehicles this year.
''We think that's more realistic,'' he said.
Over the years, industry economists have looked at three economic factors -- home sales, employment numbers and consumer confidence -- to gauge how well the car market will do.
''Housing hasn't come back yet,'' Mr. Krafcik said, ''and jobs haven't come back.'' Because of that, he said, car companies may not be able to resist incentive wars, in hopes of luring consumers back with attractive deals.
''It's going to be a really interesting year to watch,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Metrodome Roof to Be Replaced

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission, the landlord of the Metrodome in Minneapolis, voted unanimously Thursday to replace the stadium's roof, which collapsed in a December snowstorm. The vote came after engineers recommended that the roof be replaced rather than repaired. 
Replacing the roof raises the possibility that the Vikings' preseason games could be disrupted, but the commission's goal is to finish the job by Aug. 1.
Engineers wrote that replacement of the roof was the only way to guard against another deflation from defects they might not have found. Several panels ripped under the weight of the snow, but others appeared undamaged. The Vikings said they supported the roof replacement but intended to continue pursuing a new stadium.
Ray Lucas, a former Jets and Rutgers quarterback, said he was in a Florida rehabilitation center for an addiction to painkillers. On Facebook, he is detailing his bouts with withdrawal from the addiction, which he said he developed during his playing career. lucas

At 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village , thestonenyc.com; $20. (Chinen)20110210
Jerome Sabbagh Trio (Friday) On his 2008 album, ''One Two Three'' (Bee Jazz/Sunnyside), the saxophonist Jerome Sabbagh opted for a pianoless trio setting that recalls 1950s-era Sonny Rollins.

- David Sanchez Quartet (Tuesday through Thursday) In his action-oriented bands of the last few years, the Puerto Rican tenor saxophonist David Sanchez has forged a great slashing clarity, attacking harmonically advanced postbop with an underlay of abstracted Afro-Caribbean rhythm.

- McCoy Tyner Trio, With Jose James and Eric Alexander (Monday through Wednesday) ''John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman,'' released on Impulse! in 1963, is one of the great ballad albums in jazz, and one of the unlikeliest. Here it's the subject of a promising tribute spearheaded by the pianist McCoy Tyner, the surviving member of the John Coltrane Quartet, and featuring two earnest stand-ins: Mr. James, a charismatic young singer with a voice rich enough to evoke Hartman; and Mr. Alexander, an articulate tenor saxophonist deeply indebted to Coltrane. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village , (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; $45 cover at tables, $30 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)20110210
Nasheet Waits Equality Band (Friday) The drummer Nasheet Waits has been a force of earthy enlightenment in some of the smartest working jazz groups in recent memory, especially those led by pianists: Jason Moran, Fred Hersch, Andrew Hill.

At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village , (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; $10 cover, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)20110210

HEADLINE: Privately, Public Workers See Cuts as Inevitable

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

 BODY:
UNION, N.J. -- The meeting of the public-workers' union had ended, the rallying cries about hostile lawmakers and ominous contract deadlines had given way to a buffet dinner.
Sitting down to eat, Andrea Douglas, a claims representative for the State of New Jersey for the past 10 years, quietly conceded what few union leaders say aloud: Government workers have to give up some of their benefits. ''I'm a realist,'' Ms. Douglas said. ''The private sector is looking at us, and we do look good. I know we'll have to give. Everybody else is asking, 'How am I going to pay rent?' ''
Around the table, fellow workers stared, taken aback by her talk of concessions.
''You don't see it coming?'' she said to them. ''We're going to have to give. I'm more than willing to pay more to support my benefits. But you can't ask me to give so much that I can't afford to live. At least negotiate with me on that.'' 
Public-sector workers these days are under assault, their hard-won salaries and benefits depicted as drains on the body politic. Labor unions have responded angrily to that sort of talk, pledging to fight to keep what is theirs.
But in interviews and discussions among themselves, public employees express more complicated feelings. The police officers, teachers and workers are struggling with anger and fear. But many also acknowledge that the world they have known and the assumptions they have built their lives on are crumbling before their eyes.
Nowhere has the environment for public workers been more stinging than in New Jersey, where Gov. Chris Christiehas earned folk-hero status for his aggressive antiunion posture. And the public has responded: a Quinnipiac University poll released on Thursday showed voters here favored by wide margins wage freezes, furloughs and pension cuts for those on the state payroll.
To be sure, unions have won many victories over the years: current state workers contribute only 1.5 percent of their pay for health care, for example. Mr. Christie wants them to pay 30 percent of the cost of their insurance.
Straining the conversations among neighbors and in bars, breakfast joints and bowling alleys is the growing rift between government workers and their brethren in the building trades: under-employed laborers, carpenters, ironworkers and others who no longer see the powerful public-sector unions as allies.
''It goes back to the idea of divide and conquer,'' said Calvin McCullars, a disability-claims processor for 22 years. ''A few years ago, nobody really cared about state workers. And now, since the economy went bad, other people are getting laid off, and everybody's attacking us like we're doing something wrong. We're getting picked on, like a scapegoat.''
William Elliott, a state revenue agent, said people seemed to have forgotten that Wall Street greed and deregulation caused the financial meltdown, not working people. ''I feel like the public is being played,'' he said. ''I remember hearing someone say, 'Why waste a perfect crisis to advance your cause?' ''
As others filtered out into the icy night, Naomi Monroe, a principal clerk for the Board of Nursing, lingered. She said she was eligible to retire but recently learned that she needed to work another five years to be able to live on her pension.
''The way things are going now, I'll probably have to look for another job,'' Ms. Monroe said. ''I keep praying they'll lay me off, because I'll make more on unemployment than working, and then at least I can go to school to learn something new.''
Thanks to earlier cuts, people calling her office sometimes have to be put on hold, she said, and at least two or three erupt each day over the delay. ''They're yelling and screaming about how lazy public workers are,'' she said. ''When I came here, I had hypertension. I've been carried out by ambulance before. It's so stressful.''
A few miles from the State House at JoJo's Tavern in Hamilton, N.J., an always-crowded gathering place, the pizza is thin-crusted but the atmosphere is thick with griping and dread.
Robert Haupt, a retired electrician, was a member of a union, but he has issues with state workers. ''I object to them squawking about getting the day off after Thanksgiving with pay,'' he said, referring to a perk the governor tried but failed to revoke. ''They can bank sick days to the point where they can leave work two years ahead of time. I never had that privilege. If I didn't get work, I didn't get paid.''
But across the bar, Tim Connery, 59, a middle-school music teacher, shared his own fears for the future with Wayne Lonabaugh, a retired colleague. Mr. Lonabaugh remembered the calculations he made starting out.
''I only made $4,200 a year, but older people said, the pension is the big thing,'' Mr. Lonabaugh said. ''So I had two jobs. I worked in a cement plant. But I got my pension.''
''I got 38 years in,'' Mr. Connery said softly over his drink. ''But everything's up in the air. They're taking 10 percent out of the principal every year to pay existing retirees. I'm worried that it won't be there for me.''
The two said that they had always accepted earning less than they might have made in another job, partly because the benefits were so good. Mr. Lonabaugh, who taught math and science for 35 years, now enjoys free health insurance. ''Twenty-five years ago, a Democrat told me, 'You'll never get free health for retirees, because it would bankrupt the state,' '' Mr. Lonabaugh, a Republican, said with a slightly rueful smile. ''And we got it. And he was right.''
George Dzurkoc, a detective who leads the police officers' union in Trenton, was at the next bar stool with his fiancee, talking about his struggles to calm his fellow officers' anxieties. ''It's horrible,'' he said. ''You have people's lives hanging in the balance, and you can't give them answers. They ask me every day: 'Are they laying us off?' ''
Mr. Dzurkoc did not take issue with the governor's measure that caps property taxes, but said there were better ways to cut costs. ''Do we need two-day-a-week garbage pickup in the wintertime?'' he said. ''Do we need 500-plus school districts and superintendents? The problem is no one wants to give up their own fiefdoms.''
Down the block, where retirees gather at Fred & Pete's delicatessen, the easy banter now gives way to serious concerns.
''Teachers are being downgraded,'' said Joan Schutts, who gave up her kindergarten class eight years ago. ''My daughter's a middle-school teacher now, and she's hearing things from people. Even from children: 'You're making too much money.' ''
Mrs. Schutts's husband, Richard, a retired utility worker, said that politicians who took fiscal shortcuts like skipping payments into New Jersey's pension system created the crisis.
''And nobody wants the solution to come out of their pocket,'' he said. ''It's that simple.''
''I don't feel that way,'' said their friend Bettie Herzstein, who retired from teaching elementary school in 2004. ''Do it to me, but do it evenly to everybody.''
Ms. Herzstein said she was willing to pay for part of her health care. ''I think that's only fair. But somebody has to do something to the medical profession, too,'' she said. ''My husband and I were just recently in the hospital. One test, just for the doctor to read the test, was $2,400. And my bill for two weeks in the hospital was $100,000.'' Her share of that? ''Not a penny,'' she said. ''Thank God for the teachers' union.''

HEADLINE: Hospitals Shift Smoking Bans To Smoker Ban

BYLINE: By A. G. SULZBERGER; Alain Delaqueriere contributed research.

 BODY:
Smokers now face another risk from their habit: it could cost them a shot at a job.
More hospitals and medical businesses in many states are adopting strict policies that make smoking a reason to turn away job applicants, saying they want to increase worker productivity, reduce health care costs and encourage healthier living.
The policies reflect a frustration that softer efforts -- like banning smoking on company grounds, offering cessation programs and increasing health care premiums for smokers -- have not been powerful-enough incentives to quit.
The new rules essentially treat cigarettes like an illegal narcotic. Applications now explicitly warn of ''tobacco-free hiring,'' job seekers must submit to urine tests for nicotine and new employees caught smoking face termination. 
This shift -- from smoke-free to smoker-free workplaces -- has prompted sharp debate, even among anti-tobacco groups, over whether the policies establish a troubling precedent of employers intruding into private lives to ban a habit that is legal.
''If enough of these companies adopt theses policies and it really becomes difficult for smokers to find jobs, there are going to be consequences,'' said Dr. Michael Siegel, a professor at the Boston University School of Public Health, who has written about the trend. ''Unemployment is also bad for health.''
Smokers have been turned away from jobs in the past -- prompting more than half the states to pass laws rejecting bans on smokers -- but the recent growth in the number of companies adopting no-smoker rules has been driven by a surge of interest among health care providers, according to academics, human resources experts and tobacco opponents.
There is no reliable data on how many businesses have adopted such policies. But people tracking the issue say there are enough examples to suggest the policies are becoming more mainstream, and in some states courts have upheld the legality of refusing to employ smokers.
For example, hospitals in Florida, Georgia, Massachusetts, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Texas, among others, stopped hiring smokers in the last year and more are openly considering the option.
''We've had a number of inquiries over the last 6 to 12 months about how to do this,'' said Paul Terpeluk, a director at the Cleveland Clinic, which stopped hiring smokers in 2007 and has championed the policy. ''The trend line is getting pretty steep, and I'd guess that in the next few years you'd see a lot of major hospitals go this way.''
A number of these organizations have justified the new policies as advancing their institutional missions of promoting personal well-being and finding ways to reduce the growth in health care costs.
About 1 in 5 Americans still smoke, and smoking remains the leading cause of preventable deaths. And employees who smoke cost, on average, $3,391 more a year each for health care and lost productivity, according to federal estimates.
''We felt it was unfair for employees who maintained healthy lifestyles to have to subsidize those who do not,'' Steven C. Bjelich, chief executive of St. Francis Medical Center in Cape Girardeau, Mo., which stopped hiring smokers last month. ''Essentially that's what happens.''
Two decades ago -- after large companies like Alaska Airlines, Union Pacific and Turner Broadcasting adopted such policies -- 29 states and the District of Columbia passed laws, with the strong backing of the tobacco lobby and the American Civil Liberties Union, that prohibit discrimination against smokers or those who use ''lawful products.'' Some of those states, like Missouri, make an exception for health care organizations.
A spokesman for Philip Morris said the company was no longer actively working on the issue, though it remained strongly opposed to the policies.
Meghan Finegan, a spokeswoman for the Service Employees International Union, which represents 1.2 million health care workers, said the issue was ''not on our radar yet.''
One concern voiced by groups like the National Workrights Institute is that such policies are a slippery slope -- that if they prove successful in driving down health care costs, employers might be emboldened to crack down on other behavior by their workers, like drinking alcohol, eating fast food and participating in risky hobbies like motorcycle riding. The head of the Cleveland Clinic was both praised and criticized when he mused in an interview two years ago that, were it not illegal, he would expand the hospital policy to refuse employment to obese people.
''There is nothing unique about smoking,'' said Lewis Maltby, president of the Workrights Institute, who has lobbied vigorously against the practice. ''The number of things that we all do privately that have negative impact on our health is endless. If it's not smoking, it's beer. If it's not beer, it's cheeseburgers. And what about your sex life?''
Many companies add their own wrinkle to the smoking ban. Some even prohibit nicotine patches. Some companies test urine for traces of nicotine, while others operate on the honor system.
While most of the companies applied their rules only to new employees, a few eventually mandated that existing employees must quit smoking or lose their jobs. There is also disagreement over whether to fire employees who are caught smoking after they are hired. The Truman Medical Centers, here in Kansas City, for example, will investigate accusations of tobacco use by employees. In one recent case a new employee returned from a lunch break smelling of smoke and, when confronted by his supervisor, admitted that he had been smoking, said Marcos DeLeon, head of human resources for the hospital. The employee was fired.
Even antismoking advocates have found the issue tricky to navigate. The American Lung Association, the American Cancer Society and the World Health Organization do not hire smokers, citing their own efforts to reduce smoking.
But the American Legacy Foundation, an antismoking nonprofit group, has warned that refusing to hire smokers who are otherwise qualified essentially punishes an addiction that is far more likely to afflict a janitor than a surgeon. (Indeed, of the first 14 applicants rejected since the policy went into effect in October at the University Medical Center in El Paso, Tex., one was applying to be a nurse and the rest for support positions.)
''We want to be very supportive of smokers, and the best thing we can do is help them quit, not condition employment on whether they quit,'' said Ellen Vargyas, chief counsel for the American Legacy Foundation. ''Smokers are not the enemy.''
Taking a drag of her cigarette outside the University of Kansas School of Nursing, just beyond the sign warning that smoking is prohibited on campus, Mandy Carroll explained that she was well aware of the potential consequences of her pack-a-day habit: both her parents died of smoking-related illnesses. But Ms. Carroll, a 26-year-old nursing student, said she opposed any effort by hospitals to ''discriminate'' against her and other smokers.
''Obviously we know the effects of smoking, we see it every day in the hospital,'' Ms. Carroll said. ''It's a stupid choice, but it's a personal choice.''
Others do not mind the strict policy. John J. Stinson, 68, said he had been smoking for more than three decades when he decided to apply for a job at the Cleveland Clinic, helping incoming patients, nearly three years ago.
It turned out to be the motivation he needed: he passed the urine test and has not had a cigarette since. ''It's a good idea,'' Mr. Stinson said.

HEADLINE: Beyond Reason on the Budget

 BODY:
After two years of raging at President Obama's spending plans, House Republican leaders have finally revealed their real vision of small government: tens of billions in ideologically driven cuts to job training, environmental protection, disease control, crime protection and dozens of other critical functions that only the government can perform.
In all, they want more than $32 billion in cuts below current spending packed into the next seven months. They would be terribly damaging to a frail recovery and, while spending reductions must be part of long-term deficit control, these are the wrong cuts, to the wrong programs, at the wrong time. 
But they are not deep enough for many Tea Party members, freshmen and other extremists in the House Republican caucus. In a closed-door meeting on Wednesday, they forced the leadership to abandon its cuts and prepare to double them. The new list is expected on Friday and promises to be one of the most irresponsible budget documents ever issued by a House majority.
The Senate should make it clear that it is not worthy of consideration, and President Obama should back them up with a veto threat.
If House Republicans don't come to their senses, they could shut down the government on March 4 when the stopgap measure that is now financing it runs out. If that does take place, it will at least be clear to voters that their essential government services were turned off in the service of two single-minded and destructive goals: giving the appearance of cutting a deficit that was deliberately inflated by years of tax cuts for the rich, and going after programs that the Republicans never liked in good times or bad.
Many of the Republican freshmen want to stick to the ''Pledge to America'' that they would cut $100 billion from the president's 2011 budget, a nice round number apparently plucked from thin air. More experienced Republican leaders knew it would be impossible to cut that much in the remaining few months of the fiscal year and said they would trim the equivalent percentage. Harold Rogers, the Republican chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, warned that the full cut would require laying off F.B.I. agents and air traffic controllers.
If he was trying to make his $32 billion in cutbacks seem modest by comparison, he failed. The list would cut $2 billion from job training programs -- precisely what is needed to help employ workers mismatched with the job market. It would cut $1.6 billion from the Environmental Protection Agency, which is struggling to keep up with the growth of greenhouse gases. There would be significant cuts to legal assistance for the poor and renewable energy programs and an end to all spending for AmeriCorps, public broadcasting and high-speed rail.
The battle over the rest of the 2011 budget is only a prelude, of course, to the bigger fight about to begin over the 2012 budget. President Obama is scheduled to unveil his budget on Monday, and already he seems willing to feed the bottomless Republican hunger for cuts rather than fight them. An ominous early sign is his proposal to cut the low-income heating assistance program nearly in half to $2.57 billion. Administration officials say that energy prices have fallen, but, as Democratic lawmakers from the frostbitten Northeast have pointed out to him, there are many more unemployed people now.
Some cuts will have to be made, but strategically it seems to make little sense to start giving away important ones before reaching the negotiating table. Republican lawmakers in the House have already made it clear that they are indifferent to the suffering and increased joblessness their cuts will cause. As the extreme reductions are heaped up in the next few days, Democrats in Congress and in the White House need to make a clear case to the public that quality of the nation's civic life is at stake.

HEADLINE: Abraham Lincoln, Inflationist

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
There was a time when Republicans used to refer to themselves, proudly, as ''the party of Lincoln.'' But you don't hear that line much these days. Why?
The main answer, presumably, lies in the G.O.P.'s decision, long ago, to seek votes from Southerners angered by the end of legal segregation. With the old Confederacy now the heart of the Republican base, boasting about the party's Civil War-era legacy is no longer advisable.
But sooner or later, Republicans were bound to notice other reasons to disavow Lincoln. He was, after all, the first president to institute an income tax. And he was also the first president to issue a paper currency -- the ''greenback'' -- that wasn't backed by gold or silver. ''There is nothing more insidious that a country can do to its people than to debase its currency,'' declared Representative Paul Ryan in one of two hearings Congress held on Wednesday on monetary policy. So much, then, for the Great Liberator. 
Which brings me to the story of what went on in those monetary hearings.
One of the hearings was called by Representative Ron Paul, a harsh critic of the Federal Reserve, who now has an oversight role over the very institution he wants abolished in favor of a return to the gold standard. Mr. Paul's subcommittee called three witnesses, one of whom was an odd choice: Thomas DiLorenzo, a professor at Loyola University and a senior fellow at the Ludwig von Mises Institute.
What was odd about that choice? Well, Mr. DiLorenzo hasn't actually written much about monetary policy, although he has described Fed policy -- not just recently, but since the 1960s -- as ''legalized counterfeiting operations.'' His main claim to fame, instead, is as a critic of Lincoln -- he's the author of ''Lincoln Unmasked: What You're Not Supposed to Know About Dishonest Abe'' -- and as a modern-day secessionist.
No, really: calls for secession run through many of Mr. DiLorenzo's writings -- for example, in his declaration that ''healthcare freedom'' won't be restored until ''some states begin seceding from the new American fascialistic state.'' Raise the rebel flag!
O.K., it's going to be a while before the G.O.P. as a whole embraces neo-secessionism, and Mr. Paul, although highly visible, is, in fact, a somewhat marginal figure even within his own party. But Mr. Ryan, who led the other hearing -- the one at which Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, testified -- is a rising Republican star. So it's worth noting that Mr. Ryan's hard-money rhetoric was nearly as bizarre as Mr. DiLorenzo's.
Start with that bit about debasing our currency. Where did that come from? The dollar's value in terms of other major currencies is about the same now as it was three years ago. And as Mr. Bernanke pointed out, consumer prices rose only 1.2 percent in 2010, an inflation rate that, for the record, is well below the rate under the sainted Ronald Reagan. The Fed's preferred measure, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was up only 0.7 percent, well below the target of around 2 percent.
But Mr. Ryan is sure that the dollar is being debased and won't take no for an answer. In an attempt to create a gotcha moment, he waved a copy of a newspaper bearing the headline ''Inflation Worries Spread'' at the Fed chairman. But the gotcha actually went the other way. As Mr. Bernanke immediately pointed out, the article was about inflation in China and other emerging markets, not in the United States. And the Fed chairman declared, correctly, that ''inflation made here in the U.S. is very, very low.''
Advantage Bernanke. But the facts don't matter, because conservative hard-money mania, the demand that the Fed stop trying to rescue the economy, isn't really about inflation fears.
Mr. Ryan said as much in Wednesday's hearing, in which he declared that our currency ''should be guided by the rule of law, not the rule of men.'' A few years ago, my response would have been, say what? After all, even Milton Friedman saw the conduct of monetary policy as a technical issue, not a matter of principle; his complaint about the Fed's role in the Great Depression was that it didn't print enough money, not that it printed too much.
But then Friedman, who believed that it sometimes makes sense to let your currency depreciate, who urged Japan's central bank to adopt a policy very similar to what the Fed is doing now, was a leftist by the standards of today's G.O.P.
Wednesday's hearings aren't likely to have any immediate effect on monetary policy. But they offer a revealing -- and appalling -- look at the mind-set of one of our two major political parties. We've always known that the modern G.O.P. wants to take America back to the way it was before the New Deal; but now it's clear that the party wants to build a bridge to the 19th century, and maybe even to the antebellum era. Backward, march!

HEADLINE: Walgreens Starts Campaign To Push Store-Brand Products

BYLINE: By TANZINA VEGA

 BODY:
THE next time consumers visit a Walgreens drugstore looking for something to soothe their achy heads, the company hopes they will reach for its private-label pain reliever and not a brand name.
To help consumers make that choice, the drugstore chain will begin the first national advertising campaign for Walgreens branded health and wellness products on Sunday. The campaign is the first time Walgreens has gone beyond Sunday newspaper circulars and in-store signs to advertise its own brand.
The campaign emphasizes the affordability and quality of the Walgreens brand products and uses the store's 26,000 pharmacists as a central theme. Kim L. Feil, the chief marketing officer at Walgreens, said that while the ailing economy had spurred an increase in the number of people buying store-brand products, ''It's equally important that we elevate the Walgreens brand and product not just on the basis of lower cost.'' 
Of 1,006 adults in the United States surveyed by Walgreens and the Opinion Research Corporation in January, 84 percent said they purchased store-brand over-the-counter medications when they were available and 36 percent said they had increased their purchases of store-brand products in the last year, according to a statement provided by the company.
For its new advertising effort, the company partnered with Digitas, part of the Publicis Groupe, on the digital portion of the campaign. Last spring, in conjunction with Digitas and DECA, a digital media company, Walgreens began a partnership with the health and parenting Web site ParentsAsk.com to present branded content.
On the page dedicated to Walgreens, viewers see ads for the new campaign along with videos about things like choosing the right day care and protecting children from springtime risks like bee stings. The page also features advice videos from a Walgreens pharmacist, Stacia Woodcock.
While the videos are not new to the campaign, the fact that Ms. Woodcock will begin recommending Walgreens brand products is, said Susan McNally, an associate media director at Digitas.
Banner ads comparing Walgreens store brands to name brands will also appear on the page and on Web sites like ABC.com and CBS.com, where the company has purchased video spots that will run before prime-time shows like ''Grey's Anatomy,'' ''Modern Family,'' ''How I Met Your Mother,'' ''Survivor'' and ''The Big Bang Theory.''
The banner ads list the crucial comparison points between store brands and brand names, including when store brands contain the same active ingredients or may be less expensive and usually backed by a guarantee. The ads also contain a link to the Walgreens Web site where users can purchase products and see the best-selling store-brand items.
As part of its digital strategy, Walgreens also partnered with the women-centric blog publishing network, BlogHer, to reach its target demographic of women between the ages of 25 and 54. The company provided seasonal products like cold and flu remedies to bloggers at sites like TheFrugalGirl.com and SliceOfLemon.com so the bloggers could review them and encourage their readers to try them, Ms. McNally said.
Walgreens will continue to provide products to a variety of bloggers -- primarily those who focus on mothers and deal seekers -- throughout the year. All of the participating bloggers will be paid to participate in the campaign and will be allowed to combine Walgreens brand principles in their posts, Ms. McNally said.
Banner ads will also appear within the BlogHer.com network of sites that will incorporate comments from users and snippets of blog posts about the products.
Walgreens spent $271 million on advertising for the 2010 fiscal year, $334 million in 2009 and $341 million in 2008, according to the company. Its new advertising effort is an extension of a campaign Walgreens began in 2009 called ''There's a Way,'' which was aimed at increasing consumer awareness of all of its health services and products.
For its new television commercial and the print ads, Walgreens worked with its agency of record, Downtown Partners. The work emphasizes the theme of pharmacists recommending the Walgreens private-label products.
The television commercials show three scenes, including a woman in an elevator whose Walgreen pharmacist recommended ''cold tablets and hot soup'' for her cold. After she sneezes, a fellow elevator passenger gives her a cautious look.
The second and third scenes in the commercial include a mother whose Walgreen pharmacist recommends ''bubble gum flavor and patience'' as her son hides behind a toy shield, and a man standing in a restaurant who is recommended ''antacid tablets and only one taco.''
The idea was to make the spots memorable and warm so that viewers could identify with the characters, said Jim Schmidt, a creative partner at Downtown Partners. ''It's a pretty heavily informative commercial. We hopefully succeeded in making it likable,'' Mr. Schmidt said.
Consumers who purchase the store-brand products will also be able to make others feel better through the cause-marketing portion of the campaign. On Feb. 1, Walgreens began donating a penny from the purchase of every store-brand health and wellness product to its Walgreens Way to Well fund, which provides health services and educational efforts to local communities, including preventative health tests and vouchers for products. Walgreens will donate up to $3 million annually.
To extend the store-brand campaign in the spring, Walgreens will introduce new in-store signs featuring frequently asked questions about health and wellness products on store shelves.

 BODY:
DELAYED TRIAL A federal judge on Thursday pushed back by a week the trial of Raj Rajaratnam, below, who has been accused of being at the center of an insider trading network. 
The trial, which was scheduled to start on Feb. 28, will now begin on March 8, according to the order from Judge Richard J. Holwell of United States District Court in Manhattan. He gave no reason for the postponement.
In addition, lawyers for Mr. Rajaratnam, the founder of the Galleon Group, are objecting to some evidence they expect the government to present at trial. The defense filing focuses on certain recorded conversations between Mr. Rajaratnam and Ali Far, a hedge fund manager now cooperating with authorities. AZAM AHMED NEW CRISIS DETAILS Big banks like Citigroup and Morgan Stanley, which were battered by the 2008 financial crisis, are once again on solid ground.
But a set of documents, e-mail messages and minutes of crucial regulatory meetings released recently by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission provides fresh detail about just how close to the brink both firms came. SUSANNE CRAIG RECOVERY As the hedge fund industry recovered from the financial crisis in 2009, the Och-Ziff Capital Management Group, the publicly traded hedge fund led by Daniel S. Och, left, hit a milestone -- it passed its high-water mark.
That essentially meant the firm had recovered from the losses sustained during the crisis and, more important, could begin collecting performance fees of about 20 percent on any profits it earned.
By the fourth quarter of last year, those fees -- totaling about $435 million -- helped produce a 7.7 percent increase in profit, Och-Ziff reported Thursday. AZAM AHMED I.P.O. GROWS Kinder Morgan, an oil-and-gas pipeline company, priced the shares of its initial public offering at $30 on Thursday, above its previously announced range of $26 to $29.
The size of the offering -- accounting for 13.5 percent of the company -- was increased to 95.5 million shares from 80 million. At $2.9 billion, it will the largest private equity-backed I.P.O. in American history. nytimes.com/dealbook

HEADLINE: India and Pakistan Agree to Resume Talks Derailed by 2008 Terrorist Attacks

BYLINE: By LYDIA POLGREEN; Lydia Polgreen reported from New Delhi, and J. David Goodman from New York.

 BODY:
NEW DELHI -- India and Pakistan announced Thursday that they would resume peace talks that had been stalled since 2008, when Pakistani militants staged coordinated terrorist attacks in Mumbai. 
The agreement, announced by bothgovernments, followed meetings on Sunday between the foreign secretaries of India and Pakistan. It appeared to set the stage for high-level, open-ended talks on a variety of contentious issues like counterterrorism and improving economic relations.
The renewal of talks is likely to be welcomed by the United States, which has been eager to ease tensions between the two countries so that Pakistan can divert troops from its border with India to its frontier with Afghanistan and aid the American fight against Taliban insurgents.
India had previously balked at restarting talks unless Pakistan demonstrated that it was cracking down on terrorist groups within its borders and aggressively prosecuting the planners of the Mumbai attacks, which left at least 163 people dead.
But Thursday's announcement made no mention of those issues, leading analysts here to conclude that India decided it was better to engage Pakistan without preconditions.
Indian hard-liners have argued that India must not begin talks with Pakistan unless the Pakistanis take visible steps against terrorist groups that threaten India.
But others, including India's prime minister, Manmohan Singh, who was born before the partition of India in a part of Punjab that is now in Pakistan, have argued that avoiding dialogue is folly.
''I think the prime minister genuinely wants to give it a last shot,'' said Amitabh Mattoo, a professor of strategic affairs at Jawarharlal Nehru University. ''He has been able to convince the establishment that a policy of nonengagement has not delivered.''
As part of the agreement, Pakistan's foreign minister, Makhdoom Shah Mahmood Qureshi, will visit India in July to review the progress of the discussions, which will include meetings focused on defusing tensions over the disputed border region of Kashmir. Each side holds a portion of Kashmir but claims the entire region, and Pakistan-based militants have waged an insurgency inside India aimed at breaking the province away.
Pakistan was created when Britain partitioned colonial India in 1947, and the two countries have fought three wars since then, two of them over Kashmir. They have also clashed over water rights, trade and even a barren chunk of glacier high in the Himalayas. The talks are expected to address less contentious issues before moving on to Kashmir.
The Pakistan-India peace talks were initiated in early 2004, after the armies of the nuclear-armed neighbors nearly went to war in 2001, but the talks were abruptly terminated in the wake of the Mumbai attacks.
Secret talks in 2007 came close to resolving some of the most difficult issues, including the status of Kashmir. But they lapsed as the president of Pakistan at the time, Pervez Musharraf, lost his grip on power, and the attacks the following year plunged relations into their worst freeze since 2001.
The Mumbai attackers belonged to a terrorist group whose main aim was to take over the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir.

HEADLINE: Gas Plant In Alaska To Be Closed

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
ConocoPhillips and Marathon Oil said on Thursday that they planned to shut the Kenai liquefied natural gas plant in Alaska in the coming months. 
Exports from Alaska could cease by April or May this year, a Conoco spokeswoman said. The small-scale plant, which has been shipping liquefied natural gas to Asia since 1969, will be mothballed for potential future use.
Conoco, which operates and owns 70 percent of the plant, said ''market conditions in Asia'' were behind the decision to shut the plant, while Marathon, which owns the remaining 30 percent of the facility, said that domestic gas supply declines were also a factor.
''The business case did not make it feasible to continue L.N.G. exports,'' a Marathon spokeswoman said, adding that drilling activity in the Cook Inlet, which supplies gas to Kenai, has not offset declining production rates.
''The decision to cease exports will enable us to continue to meet our contractual obligations to supply gas to the region.''
Liquefied gas demand in Asia soared last year as demand in the major importers Japan and Korea recovered from recession. The greater demand was met mainly by increases in Asian and Middle Eastern production, which kept the market well supplied in 2010. Kenai exports, which rely on the use of a single tanker, remained steady.
Conoco and Marathon have a license to export liquefied natural gas from Alaska to Asia until 2013, under an extension granted last year.

HEADLINE: Jobless Filings at Lowest Level Since 2008

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of people applying for unemployment benefits declined last week to the lowest level in about two and a half years.
Applications sank by a seasonally adjusted 36,000, to 383,000, the lowest point since early July 2008. 
Unemployment applications reflect the level of layoffs, but also can indicate whether companies are willing to hire.
Applications are well below their peak of 651,000, in March 2009, when the economy was deep in recession. Applications below 425,000 tend to signal modest growth, but they would need to dip consistently to 375,000 or below to indicate a significant and steady decline in the unemployment rate.
Last week's decline continued a downward trend that took shape late last year. The last time applications fell below 400,000 was near the end of December.
Harsh weather, including snowstorms along the Eastern seaboard, forced some companies to temporarily lay off workers last month. That sent applications for unemployment benefits surging to 457,000 in the week of Jan. 22, but since then, applications have been falling.
The four-week average, a less volatile measure, dipped to 415,500 last week. That is slightly above the two-year low of 411,250, reached in the week ended Jan. 1.
In a second report, the Commerce Department said that businesses at the wholesale level added to their inventories in December even though demand for their products slowed.
Wholesale businesses increased inventories by 1 percent in December, pushing the total to $430.5 billion, the Commerce Department reported. Economists consider that a healthy level for inventories. It is 11.4 percent above the low reached in September 2009, when companies were cutting their stockpiles in response to a deep recession.
Sales at the wholesale level rose 0.4 percent in December, a smaller-than-expected increase and the poorest showing since July. However, the December advance followed a 1.9 percent rise in November.
Inventory restocking had been unchanged in November after 10 months of increases. Economists did not view that slowdown as troubling, arguing that sales were so strong in November that wholesalers probably had trouble keeping up with demand.
For December, wholesalers increased their inventories for autos, lumber and computers, but stockpiles of clothing at the wholesale level declined.

HEADLINE: In a Reversal, Breast-Feeding Supplies Win I.R.S. Tax Breaks

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

 BODY:
Ending a long-running dispute with pediatricians and breast-feeding advocates, the Internal Revenue Service announced Thursday that it would grant nursing mothers a tax break on pumps and other breastfeeding supplies.
The ruling, which will affect expenses incurred starting in 2010, will allow mothers to use pretax money from their flexible spending accounts to cover the cost of breast pumps and other supplies. Those without flexible spending accounts may deduct breast-feeding costs if their total unreimbursed medical expenses exceed 7.5 percent of their adjusted gross income and they itemize.
Breast-feeding advocates said the new policy would help millions of working mothers continue breast-feeding after returning to the workplace, and improve the health of infants who receive antibodies from the breast milk. 
''Now, more women will be able to pass on the health benefits of breast-feeding to their babies, which include protections against asthma and other respiratory illnesses, bacterial and viral infections, and obesity, among other ailments,'' said Dr. O. Marion Burton, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
A study by Harvard Medical School last year showed that if 90 percent of mothers followed the standard medical advice of feeding infants only breast milk for their first six months, the United States could save $13 billion a year in health care costs and prevent the premature deaths of 900 infants each year from respiratory illness and other infections.
But as recently as last year, the I.R.S. rebuffed those arguments. The I.R.S. code considers nutrition a necessity rather than a medical condition, and the agency's analysts said they viewed breast milk as nothing more than a healthy food -- meaning that breast pumps, bottles and pads were no more deserving of a tax break than a vegetable steamer.
In a letter reversing that ruling, Douglas H. Shulman, the I.R.S. commissioner, made no mention of the positive health effects of breast milk, but said that pumps and other equipment should be considered a medical expense because ''they are for the purpose of affecting a structure or function of the body of the lactating woman.''
I.R.S. officials declined to elaborate. But studies show that breast-feeding is also beneficial for the nursing mother, helping her avoid Type 2 diabetes, ovarian cancer, breast cancer and postpartum depression.
Whatever the rationale for the policy change, breast-feeding advocates say it will make it easier for millions of women to heed the prevailing medical advice.
To continue breast-feeding once they return to the workplace, many mothers need to use pumps to extract milk, which can be chilled and fed by bottle to the child later. The pump and the accessories needed to store milk cost about $500 to $1,000 for most mothers over the course of a year, according to the United States Breastfeeding Committee.
A survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that about 75 percent of the 4.3 million mothers who gave birth in 2007 started breast-feeding. By the time the baby was 6 months old, the portion dropped to 43 percent, and on the child's first birthday, to 22 percent.
The I.R.S.' s initial refusal to classify breast-feeding as a medical expense has frustrated women's health advocates and pediatricians for years, especially since the federal government offers tax breaks on items like acne cream and denture adhesive. After a news report last fall about the I.R.S. turning down a nursing mother's effort to use pretax funds for a breast pump, Representative Carolyn Maloney, a New York Democrat, and 55 other members of Congress wrote to Mr. Shulman asking him to revise the policy.
Robin W. Stanton, chairwoman of the United States Breastfeeding Committee, called the announcement a major victory for mothers, infants and America.
''It is critical to our nation's health that the majority of American women are supported in their decision to breast-feed: the health, psychosocial, economic, and environmental benefits are undeniable,'' she said.

HEADLINE: In Montana, A Bid to End Medical Use Of Marijuana

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
HELENA, Mont. -- The Montana House of Representatives voted Thursday to repeal the state's six-year-old medical marijuana law.
The 63-to-37 vote, largely along party lines in the Republican-controlled chamber, pushed Montana to the front lines of a national debate about social policy, economics and health as medical marijuana use has surged in the 15 states and the District of Columbia that allow its use.
''We were duped,'' said the House speaker, Mike Milburn, a Republican and sponsor of the repeal bill, who said he thought that the arguments about medical use had been a pretext for encouraging recreational use and creating a path to full legalization. He said he feared gang drug wars in Montana's cities and debilitation of its youth. 
''This bill says, Shut down everything -- it's gone way too far,'' Mr. Milburn told the chamber before the vote.
The State Senate, also controlled by the Republicans, will also consider the measure, and House members will have an opportunity to vote on it again as early as Friday before sending it there. If passed by the Senate it would face an uncertain fate on the desk of Gov. Brian Schweitzer, a Democrat.
Mr. Schweitzer has said he believes the laws need to be tightened, but he has not taken a position on repeal. His spokeswoman, Sarah Elliott, said in an e-mail, ''The business has gotten out ahead of the regulatory environment, and we need to build some boundaries.''
But in the voices of the lawmakers on Thursday, the weight and passion of the issue were evident.
''We tried prohibition,'' said Representative Diane Sands, a Democrat. ''Marijuana has been in our community for years; it is not going away,'' she added. ''We have to deal with that fact.''
Other states and cities are also wrestling with the question of what medical marijuana is, or should be. New Mexico's new Republican governor, Susana Martinez, expressed interest in repeal this year. Colorado is formulating some of the most detailed rules in the nation for growing and selling. Lawmakers in New Jersey have jousted with the governor over regulation.
And although party line positions have defined the issue in Montana, with Republicans mostly lined up in favor of restriction or repeal, there is widespread agreement among legislators and residents that medical marijuana has become something very different than it was originally envisioned to be.
Sixty-two percent of voters approved the use of medical marijuana in a statewide referendum in 2004. But the real explosion of growth came only in the last year, after the federal Department of Justice said in late 2009 that medical marijuana would not be a law enforcement priority.
Since then, the numbers of patients have quadrupled to more than 27,000 -- in a state of only about 975,000 people -- and millions of dollars have been invested in businesses that grow or supply the product.
Here in Helena, at least 16 other bills in addition to the repeal measure have been filed or drafted since the legislative session began last month, calling for everything from a marijuana tax to another voter referendum.
''I've lobbied every session since '81, and I've never seen an issue as fluid as this,'' said Tom Daubert, an advocate for medical marijuana and an author of the 2004 ballot measure. ''It changes by the minute, by the hour, by the day.''
But in a huge, mostly rural state where a libertarian, keep-government-off-my-back spirit runs deep, the debate is also different in temper and geography than in other states. Marijuana, many people here say, has intensified suspicions between the two Montanas that are zipped together by the Rocky Mountains -- conservative ranching and agriculture country to the east, liberal college towns and tourist communities to the west.
The change in the pattern and scale of medical marijuana use across Montana has coincided with a seismic change in politics here, where Republicans surged from a 50-50 tie in the House before last November's election to a 68-to-32 majority now. Republicans have a 28-to-22 majority in the Senate.
Several House members who spoke against repeal said the Legislature, by declining in past years to take up bills that would have regulated or controlled medical marijuana when its use was not so widespread, had only itself to blame.
''We had many years to regulate something that 62 percent of Montanans wanted, and we chose to do nothing,'' said Representative Pat Noonan, a Democrat. ''Don't vote against the citizens.''

HEADLINE: Credit Suisse Cuts Back 2011 Outlook

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
7:21 p.m. Updated
Credit Suisse posted a lower-than-expected fourth-quarter profit on Thursday and said it was cutting its outlook for 2011 to reflect the ''new reality'' in bank regulation, including tougher capital rules.
The bank, based in Zurich, reported fourth-quarter net profit of 841 million Swiss francs ($867 million), up 6 percent from the period a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News had expected profit of about 928 million francs. 
For the full year, net income fell 24 percent, to 5.1 billion francs, compared with 2009.
''For 2010, the return on equity attributable to shareholders was 14.4 percent,'' the bank said in a statement. ''Going forward, in light of Credit Suisse Group's strategic plan, the target for annualized return on equity attributable to shareholders is set at above 15 percent, down from 18 percent previously.''
After ''significant progress in defining the new regulatory environment'' in 2010, the bank said the new targets ''represent a prudent expectation of what our business can generate over the long term.''
Brady W. Dougan, the chief executive, suggested that Credit Suisse was taking a more realistic view than some of its rivals. He said that new rules on the banking sector under Basel III and other new capital requirements meant to reduce risk would inevitably reduce profits.
''We think it's actually a recognition of the new reality and the new environment, and it's a pretty good level,'' he said of the new target, which he called ''reliable, reasonable,'' and one ''that we can exceed over time.''
Jon Peace, a banking analyst at Nomura International in London, said that in addition to the Basel III changes faced by banks, higher taxes - like those announced by the British government this week - and changes to market structures like those being introduced in the United States by the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul, would inevitably weigh on profitability.
Regarding the controversial issue of bank pay, Mr. Dougan said Credit Suisse's total compensation per person in 2010 was down about 9 percent from the 2009 level, while the bonus pool declined 25 percent. He said the executive board would take no variable compensation in cash form, only deferred, as in recent years.
He said more details would come in late March with the annual report.
Under Mr. Dougan, the bank has been gaining on UBS in the business of managing assets for wealthy clients.
UBS, the biggest Swiss bank, on Tuesday reported fourth-quarter profit of 1.3 billion francs. But it has only just begun to bounce back from the damage of the financial crisis and a conflict with United States tax authorities over suspected tax evaders.
Credit Suisse, which avoided a government bailout during the crisis, said it had attracted net new assets of 54.6 billion francs last year, up from the net 41.6 billion francs it added in 2009.
The cost of drawing in additional money can be high, and Mr. Dougan has not shied away over the last year from hiring well-paid employees to bring in new clients. Mr. Dougan defended his aggressive hiring on Thursday, saying the investments had left Credit Suisse's private banking business ''very well positioned for a recovery in client activity levels.''
Credit Suisse said the appreciation of the Swiss franc against the dollar and euro held back earnings. The stronger local currency means money earned overseas buys fewer francs when it is repatriated.
The bank said its Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of financial strength, stood at a ''very strong'' 17.2 percent at the end of December, up from 16.7 percent at the end of September.
Mr. Peace said that Credit Suisse and UBS faced several competitive disadvantages in the stricter capital requirements imposed on them by the Swiss government.
The authorities in Switzerland, having survived a near disaster when UBS's American portfolio of mortgage-backed securities blew up, want the two banks to carry additional equity as a buffer, insisting, for example, on a minimum of 10 percent Tier 1 capital, compared with the 7 percent German banks must hold.

HEADLINE: Sole Fed Governor With Close Ties to Conservatives Resigns

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Kevin M. Warsh, who was the Federal Reserve's chief liaison to Wall Street, will resign from the central bank's board at the end of March, giving President Obama yet another chance to leave his stamp on the Fed.
In an unusual move, Mr. Warsh, 40, had publicly expressed skepticism about the Fed's $600 billion plan, begun in November, to buy bonds to lower long-term interest rates and stimulate bank lending. 
He was the only one of the Fed governors, who are presidentially appointed, to voice such doubts, though he never voted against the plan. A former aide to President George W. Bush, he was the only governor with close ties to Republicans in Congress and to conservative organizations, like the Hoover Institution.
With his departure, the Fed board loses that link to conservatives at a time when conservative economists and some Republicans on Capitol Hill are sharply critical of the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and his policies.
The central bank looks to be increasingly dominated by so-called doves, who emphasize policies intended to create jobs and economic growth equally with fighting inflation, rather than those known as hawks, for whom stable prices and low inflation are paramount.
''It seems likely that anyone nominated by President Obama will be more 'dovish' than Kevin Warsh right now,'' on inflation, said Alan S. Blinder, a Princeton economist and former Fed vice chairman.
The Fed's seven-member board already overwhelmingly bears Mr. Obama's mark. He named Mr. Bernanke to a second four-year term that began last year and has installed three other governors: Daniel K. Tarullo and Sarah Bloom Raskin, who specialize in bank regulation, and the economist Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's vice chairwoman.
Another Obama nominee, the economist and Nobel laureate Peter A. Diamond, is awaiting Senate confirmation to the only vacancy on the board.
Mr. Warsh, a former specialist in mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley, helped manage the Fed's response to the 2008 financial crisis, playing a crucial role in the decisions to broker the sale of Bear Stearns to JPMorgan Chase, to allow Lehman Brothers to go bankrupt and to bail out the American International Group. He joined the Fed board five years ago, after serving in the White House.
Mark W. Olson, a former Fed governor who overlapped with Mr. Warsh for several months in 2006, said Mr. Warsh's departure would leave a gap. ''One thing the Fed needs to understand is the perspective of Wall Street, and Kevin brought that in a way that nobody else did at that point,'' he said. ''Kevin's real value was to help us understand what the capital markets thought and how they were responding to the decisions we made.''
Mr. Olson said ''it will be incumbent on the Fed board to reach out'' to conservatives, just as it tries to reflect the perspectives of consumers and not just bankers.
The Fed board has been fairly unified on monetary policy lately. With unemployment at 9 percent and inflation below the Fed's unofficial target of around 2 percent, Mr. Bernanke has expressed confidence that the Fed's extraordinarily easy monetary policy is justified. But some conservatives say that Mr. Bernanke might be setting the stage for future inflation and asset bubbles. Mr. Warsh served at times as a liaison between Mr. Bernanke and those conservative critics.
In a statement, Mr. Bernanke praised Mr. Warsh for ''exemplary service'' and ''intimate knowledge of financial markets and institutions.'' He added: ''I deeply appreciate his insights and wise counsel, and most especially, his fortitude and friendship during the difficult days, nights and weekends of the crisis.''
But Mr. Warsh has at times tried to keep his distance from Mr. Bernanke. Five days after the Fed's policy-marking arm voted on Nov. 3 to buy $600 billion in Treasury securities -- the second round of a strategy known as quantitative easing that is intended to lower long-term interest rates -- The Wall Street Journal published an article by Mr. Warsh expressing doubt.
Though Mr. Warsh voted for the bond-buying plan -- by Fed tradition, board members almost never vote against the chairman -- he said he viewed the strategy as ''necessarily limited, circumscribed and subject to regular review.'' He added, ''Policies should be altered if certain objectives are satisfied, purported benefits disappoint or potential risks threaten to materialize.''
The piece was seen in some quarters as presaging his departure.
Officials said Mr. Warsh, a lawyer, would return to New York, where his wife, Jane Lauder, lives, and work in the private sector. He declined to comment on Thursday.
Randall S. Kroszner, who served with Mr. Warsh on the board, remarked on the significant shift in economic conditions since they started together.
''When Kevin and I had our confirmation hearing together, almost exactly five years ago, Valentine's Day 2006, neither of us could have envisaged the historic challenges the Fed was soon to face,'' said Mr. Kroszner, an economist at the University of Chicago business school. ''The crucial issue at the time was to rein in inflation, but a key challenge of the crisis a couple of years later was to prevent a Japan-style collapse and deflation.''

HEADLINE: Behind a Push for Parole in Chicago, a Prisoner's Old Neighborhood

BYLINE: By EMMA GRAVES FITZSIMMONS

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- At a cafe in the heart of this city's exuberant Puerto Rican community, in the neighborhood of Humboldt Park, a waitress serves up favorites from the island: cafe con leche, rice and beans and guava pastries. On the counter, a framed photograph of a white-haired man sits next to a stack of petitions calling for his release from prison.
The petitions are posted at more than a dozen businesses in the neighborhood, where the campaign to free 68-year-old Oscar Lopez Rivera has deep and stubborn roots: he is the last remaining member of the radical group known as the F.A.L.N. (Spanish initials for Armed Forces of National Liberation) still in prison among more than a dozen convicted in the 1980s.
Volunteers in the neighborhood, on the city's northwest side, have increased efforts in recent weeks to collect signatures outside train stops, grocery stores and churches. 
Mr. Lopez Rivera, who has been in prison for almost 30 years, is viewed by some as a political prisoner and others as an unrepentant terrorist. Since he applied for parole last year, both sides have been lobbying the four-member United States Parole Commission, which is expected to make a decision soon.
The commission has received three large boxes of letters in support of his parole and many calls against it, said Johanna Markind, assistant general counsel for the commission. The response has included passionate requests from prominent leaders, a letter supporting parole from four Puerto Rican members of Congress, and a letter against parole from Patrick J. Fitzgerald, the United States attorney in Chicago.
Mr. Lopez Rivera was convicted here in 1981 of numerous charges, including seditious conspiracy, a charge used for those plotting to overthrow the United States government. He was sentenced to 70 years in prison.
President Bill Clinton offered Mr. Lopez Rivera and other members of the F.A.L.N. clemency in 1999, a decision that stirred an emotional debate. Mr. Clinton said their sentences were out of proportion with their offenses.
While 12 prisoners accepted the offer and were freed, Mr. Lopez Rivera rejected the chance to reduce his sentence because it did not include all the group's members, his lawyer, Jan Susler, said. If he had accepted the agreement, she said, he would have been eligible for release in 2009.
In January, a hearing examiner for the Parole Commission recommended that Mr. Lopez Rivera should not be paroled, according to several people who were at the closed hearing.
The F.A.L.N. was involved in more than 100 bombings in New York, Chicago and other cities, according to federal officials. A bombing at Fraunces Tavern in New York in 1975 killed four people, including Frank Connor, a 33-year-old banker.
His son Joseph has been a consistent voice against parole for any members of the F.A.L.N. When Mr. Connor testified at the parole hearing, he said he had hoped that Mr. Lopez Rivera would apologize or show some sense of contrition.
''He wouldn't take responsibility for anything,'' Mr. Connor said in an interview.
Although Mr. Lopez Rivera was not charged specifically with the Fraunces Tavern bombing, Mr. Connor said that he blames Mr. Lopez Rivera for his father's death because he was a leader of the group that took responsibility for the bombing. Mr. Connor has written about the case for various Web sites and has encouraged friends and family to call the commission.
Ms. Susler said Mr. Lopez Rivera had no involvement in the Fraunces Tavern bombing. ''It was very impactful, moving testimony from people who had terrible losses,'' Ms. Susler said, ''but it had nothing to do with Mr. Lopez.''
Since the hearing, the National Boricua Human Rights Network, which is active in Puerto Rican issues, said it had gathered more than 4,000 signatures supporting parole in Chicago. The city has the second-largest Puerto Rican community in the country, after New York.
The group has argued that Mr. Lopez Rivera poses no threat to the public and that others who were released have lived productive lives without getting in trouble again. It is an opinion shared by many in Humboldt Park.
On a recent afternoon, the owner of a barbershop in the neighborhood, Reinaldo Oquendo, sat at a table with a group of men playing dominoes.
''I think it is about time they let him out,'' Mr. Oquendo said without looking up from his game. ''Thirty years is a lifetime. Nobody deserves to be in prison for that long.''
The parole case still resonates here because his family continues to work in the neighborhood and many here have an interest in Puerto Rican history, ''which is very much a part of their lives,'' said Ana Ramos-Zayas, an associate professor of anthropology at Rutgers University who has studied the community.
Many people here knew Mr. Lopez Rivera, who worked as a community organizer in the neighborhood after serving in the Vietnam War. His younger brother Jose Lopez is the longtime executive director of the Puerto Rican Cultural Center, which runs a day care, an AIDS clinic and a youth center in the neighborhood.
There has been a concerted effort to establish Humboldt Park as a cultural and economic hub for the Puerto Rican community in Chicago, which numbers about 113,000 people, compared with more than 750,000 in New York, according to Census Bureau figures.
Crowds flock to several annual parades and festivals along a portion of Division Street known as Paseo Boricua, where two huge, red and blue steel flags extend over the road at both ends of the business district. The neighborhood is filled with Puerto Rican murals, restaurants, record shops, and bookstores.
Recently, Jose Lopez walked down the street greeting people and checking on the cultural center's many projects. He was particularly excited about the opening this spring of a new Institute of Puerto Rican Arts & Culture in the neighborhood.
Mr. Lopez said that his brother's absence had taken a great toll on his family. Their parents and a sister have died while he was in prison.
''It is a continual punishment for our family not to have Oscar here for these moments,'' he said.
Mr. Lopez Rivera still believes in Puerto Rican independence but he does not talk about the F.A.L.N., his lawyer said. At the federal prison holding him, in Terre Haute, Ind., he spends his days reading about current events, working as an orderly, and painting scenes of Puerto Rican life and leftist leaders like Fidel Castro. He sells them online to benefit the National Boricua Human Rights Network.
He could remain in prison for 15 more years if the commission denies his request for parole. But if Mr. Lopez Rivera is released, there is likely to be another celebratory rally in Humboldt Park as there has been for prisoners in the past.
Epifanio Velez, who opened a restaurant on Paseo Boricua four years ago, is looking forward to his return.
''He has done his time,'' he said. ''I want to meet him.''

HEADLINE: At Center of Debate Over Derivatives, a Gung-Ho Regulator

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS and MAC WILLIAM BISHOP

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - Gary Gensler has his work cut out for him.
As chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, he is leading the charge to overhaul the murky $600 trillion derivatives market, which was at the center of the financial crisis. The Dodd-Frank Act, the financial overhaul law enacted last year, requires Mr. Gensler's agency to draft dozens of new derivatives rules by July.
Since taking the helm of the commission in early 2009, Mr. Gensler, 53, has developed a reputation as a consumer-friendly regulator - despite his 18 years on Wall Street, including nine as a Goldman Sachs partner. He has been pushing aggressively to impose the Dodd-Frank rules, although he has had to dial back on a few occasions in order to strike a compromise. 
Mr. Gensler keeps on his desk a copy of the 848-page law that features a personal inscription from the authors of the legislation, including Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, who wrote in the margin, ''You should derive satisfaction from this.''
His gung-ho approach has drawn the ire of the new Republican Congress, which is threatening to withhold additional money from Mr. Gensler's agency. Wall Street lobbyists have bombarded him with complaints and requests for exemptions, too.
It's a political storm familiar to Mr. Gensler. A Baltimore native, he served as assistant Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration and later advised Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland and the architect of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which overhauled the nation's accounting rules.
In a recent interview from his Washington office, Mr. Gensler spoke with DealBook about the challenges of Dodd-Frank, his days on Wall Street and life as a single father of three since his wife, the artist Francesca Danieli, died more than four years ago from breast cancer.
Q.You've been in the job since 2009. What's the most challenging aspect?
A.Partly, it's that I have three daughters, and it's just finding the time to be with them. With regard to the job itself, I think it's a great staff here and a great set of commissioners. But we do all come with different perspectives.
Q.The C.F.T.C. has taken up much of the implementation of Dodd-Frank. How challenging has it been?
A.I think this is a great honor to be in this job. It is also a challenge to integrate all of these public comments, all of the different views and actually end up with a result that benefits the American public.
Q.What's the most absurd complaint you've received about the new regulations?
A.I'm not bothered by any of this because it's often motivated by profits. But there are an awful lot of folks in industry who want an exception. And some of those exceptions are appropriate, but some of them you have to be amused and laugh at. As it relates to Wall Street directly, they tend to want less transparency because that helps their profits and their revenues.
Q.How would you describe the response you've received from industry lobbyists?
A.It's professional. It's active. We've had about 475 meetings in five months. And since the lobbyists haven't found us on the weekends (usually), you can do the arithmetic. It's quite a bit.
I will say this: In America, large institutions have a great deal more resources than the investor advocates. If you looked at those 475 meetings - and we're posting every one of them on our Web site - 90-plus percent are probably larger institutions or corporations.
Q.Can your staff handle the load?
A.This agency, just this past year, got back to the size it was in 1999. We think we need about 400 more people - even though we're taking on markets that are seven times the size of what we currently regulate and far more complicated. So we're going to continue to make the case. Even though our great nation has a very large deficit, this is the best investment for taxpayer money.
Q.Republicans have said that the C.F.T.C. is moving too fast in developing regulations. Are they right?
A.I think we have to remember there was a great financial crisis in 2008. Every American was affected - millions of Americans are out of work, millions of Americans have homes that are worth less than their mortgages. Derivatives played a role in that.
We're human. Some things will slip. But I think this is an appropriate goal.
Q.Does it ever get overwhelming?
A.There's certainly moments where I need to take a breath. I've been a lifelong runner, and I think of this like a marathon, which I've done many of, or mountain climbing, which I've also done. So there are times that you just want to take a breath. But we have the task that the American public expects us to do: to lower risk and promote transparency.
Q.Which is tougher, life on Wall Street or life in Washington?
A.I was honored to be on the Street for 18 years. There the competition is of course about client services, but ultimately about profits and revenues. Here the big difference is, everything is exposed and transparent.
Q.Would you ever go back to Goldman?
A.I was blessed. I went to public schools in Maryland. Neither of my parents went to college. I ended up as a young kid, really, at 21 at this financial firm on the Street and had a fabulous 18 years, challenging and rewarding. But this stage of my life is really about public service. So no, I don't have any interest to do that.
Q.Why leave a profitable career to come to Washington?
A.I think what government does makes a difference. I was also a kid that was involved in student government in high school. I was treasurer. I lost for senior class president.
Q.Will you run for public office?
A.I don't know.
Q.How are you coping as a single father?
A.Francesca was a beautiful woman, an artist - a bit irreverent and a great sense of humor. But she showed remarkable courage through 20-plus years of cancer. She actually had cancer from the time we were dating.
We have three beautiful girls. Sometimes around the house it is one step removed from a sitcom. There are things that don't get done. But we make it work.

HEADLINE: Obama Unveils Wireless Expansion Plan

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
MARQUETTE, Mich. -- Declaring that ''we can't expect tomorrow's economy to take root using yesterday's infrastructure,'' President Obama traveled to this snowbound town in a remote corner of Michigan on Thursday to make the case that expanding wireless access is critical to the nation's economic recovery.
''This isn't just about a faster Internet or being able to find a friend on Facebook,'' Mr. Obama said in a speech at Northern Michigan University here, after viewing a demonstration on long-distance learning over the Internet. 
''It's about connecting every corner of America to the digital age,'' the president said. ''It's about a rural community in Iowa or Alabama where farmers can monitor weather across the state and markets across the globe. It's about an entrepreneur on Main Street with a great idea she hopes to sell to the big city. It's about every young person who no longer has to leave his hometown to seek new opportunity -- because opportunity is right there at his or her fingertips.''
In his State of the Union address last month, Mr. Obama called for securing high-speed wireless coverage to 98 percent of all Americans within five years. On Thursday, the White House released details of how he would spend billions of dollars for the plan, which also includes a high-tech wireless public safety system that would tie cities and towns together in the event of a national emergency like the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
Under Mr. Obama's proposal, which the White House maintains would also raise enough revenue to cut the deficit by $9.6 billion over the next decade, the government would nearly double the wireless spectrum available for mobile broadband. That would be achieved in part through ''voluntary incentive auctions'' in which broadcasters, who license the spectrum through the Federal Communications Commission, would release some of it back to the government, which would in turn sell it to wireless companies.
The administration calculates that the auctions, coupled with more efficient government use of the spectrum, would raise $27.8 billion in revenue over the next decade. But that figure depends on whether broadcasters cooperate, and it is difficult to know whether the administration's calculations are correct.
''A plan such as this necessarily requires a lot of assumptions,'' Matt Wood, associate director of the Media Access Project, a nonprofit advocacy group, said in an e-mail. ''It is very hard to predict exactly how much money these auctions would raise, and how much will have to be shared with incumbent licensees. Thus, while these initiatives may be on the right track, questions remain as to whether this plan will work.''
Mr. Obama is also asking Congress to make a one-time investment of $5 billion to bring wireless coverage to rural areas, and is proposing to spend $3 billion of the spectrum proceeds on research and development into new wireless technologies. And the president is calling for a $10.7 billion commitment to support what the administration describes as a ''nationwide wireless broadband network'' for public safety.
The plan, which will be included in the budget Mr. Obama releases next week, requires Congressional approval at a time when Republicans have said they are interested in cutting federal spending. Mr. Obama's trip to northern Michigan was his latest appearance across the country to promote an agenda of selected investment in areas like clean energy, education and infrastructure that the president maintains will create jobs and boost the fragile recovery.
Mr. Obama chose Marquette, a city of about 21,000 on Lake Superior on Michigan's Upper Peninsula, because Northern Michigan University has worked on ways to expand wireless access for students and the surrounding areas. For more than a decade, the university has given a new laptop to every incoming student.
The university has also joined up with business to build what Mr. Obama called ''a high-speed, next-generation wireless network,'' and worked with nearby towns to expand the network by retrofitting their cell towers with new equipment.

HEADLINE: Elder Care Workers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Germany Fights a Lack of Labor, Not Joblessness'' (Business Day, Feb. 5) should remind us that our nation, too, faces a severe shortage of workers to care for the elderly. 
While the article notes that Germany will need one million new caregivers by 2030, the United States is projected to need an additional 1.1 million direct-care workers between 2008 and 2018. Yet only 850,000 women ages 24 to 54 -- the people who typically fill these positions -- are expected to enter the entire United States work force during this period.
Shortages in the United States will grow even more extreme as we near 2030, and increased immigration is no more likely to resolve our ''care gap'' than it will Germany's.
To close our care gap, we must make these jobs far more attractive -- providing better wages, benefits, training and opportunities for advancement. Moreover, at a time when our political leaders are grappling with job creation, improving direct-care worker jobs will not only lead to better care, but it will also help strengthen the economy -- particularly within low-income communities.
Steven L. Dawson Bronx, Feb. 9, 2011
The writer is president of PHI, which works to improve the lives of people who need long-term services and the lives of people who provide that care.

HEADLINE: E.P.A. and Public Broadcasting Are on House Republicans' List for Deep Cuts

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- House Republicans on Friday rolled out what they called historic cuts in federal spending after conservatives in the party's new majority demanded that the leadership follow through on a pledge to carve $100 billion from the current year's budget.
The spending bill, put forward by the Appropriations Committee for consideration on the floor next week, proposes slashing a wide portfolio of domestic programs and foreign aid. It blocks the spending of about $2 billion in unused economic stimulus money and seeks to prevent the Internal Revenue Service from enforcing the new health care law. The measure also cuts financing directly from the office of the president. 
Republicans take aim at some of their favorite targets in the measure, reducing financing to the Environmental Protection Agency by $3 billion -- an almost 30 percent cut from current levels. The measure would also block the agency from implementing new emissions regulations, and it would cut more than $100 million in spending on climate change programs.
Housing, energy and transportation spending is also trimmed substantially. Dozens of programs, including the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, are eliminated.
''These were hard decisions, and I know many people will not be happy with everything we've proposed in this package,'' Representative Hal Rogers, the Kentucky Republican who is chairman of the Appropriations Committee, said in a statement Friday night. ''That's understandable and not unexpected, but I believe these reductions are necessary to show that we are serious about returning our nation to a sustainable financial path.''
The bill, which allocates spending through the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, will run into stiff opposition from Senate Democrats, who warned that Republicans were on a dangerous path to a potential shutdown of the federal government. The Democrats are urging a more measured approach, along the lines of a five-year freeze at 2010 levels for many programs advocated by President Obama in his State of the Union address.
''The priorities identified in this proposal for some of the largest cuts -- environmental protection, health care, energy, science and law enforcement -- are essential to the current and future well-being of our economy and communities across the country,'' said Senator Daniel K. Inouye, Democrat of Hawaii and chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. ''Such an approach would knock the legs out from under our nascent economic recovery, kill jobs and do virtually nothing to address the long-term fiscal crisis facing our country.''
Were the Republican cuts to be enacted in full, they would reverberate throughout the operations of federal agencies, and represent one of the largest efforts to reverse the outflow of federal dollars in modern times.
''It is not going to be pretty,'' said Representative Mike Simpson, Republican of Idaho and the chairman of an appropriations subcommittee that finances the Interior Department and other agencies. He said his committee had tried to be selective in reaching its goal.
''Obviously we don't want to close the national parks and some other things,'' he said. ''There are areas where we can find reductions, which we've done. Are all of those acceptable to everybody? I don't know.''
Democrats warned that Republicans were proposing unacceptable reductions with time running short before a March 4 deadline when the stopgap measure now financing the federal government runs out. Democrats said a stalemate would lead to a government shutdown like the one in 1995 that followed a face-off between Congressional Republicans and the Clinton administration.
''We know cutting is necessary; the question is what are we going to cut,'' the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, told reporters on a conference call. ''We cannot use a meat ax, and that's what they are doing.''
Mr. Reid declined to specify an amount that Democrats would be willing to slice from federal spending this year, but he also chastised Republicans for struggling to agree on such a number among themselves.
Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Democrat, said Republicans had boxed themselves in by specifying a target for cuts without first identifying how to carry out the reductions. ''The trouble they're having is that they seem to have a number in their head but not where the cuts come from,'' Mr. Schumer said. ''And so when they try to implement their number, it doesn't work.''
House leaders had initially proposed a smaller level of reductions in domestic spending and foreign aid amounting to about $32 billion through Sept. 30. Republicans said those cuts, prorated for the balance of the fiscal year, would have fulfilled their campaign pledge to cut $100 billion from Mr. Obama's budget request, which was never enacted.
But Republicans who campaigned on the $100 billion figure balked, forcing the Appropriations Committee back to the drawing board. The new cuts will total about $60 billion, and the plan appeared to be winning support from the conservative rank and file.
''House Republicans will keep our word to the American people,'' said Representative Mike Pence, Republican of Indiana.
The Republicans had given themselves an extraordinarily difficult task by promising ahead of the November elections to exclude military and domestic security spending from their reductions. Roughly two-thirds of federal spending is for Social Security, Medicare and interest on the debt, and therefore outside the control of lawmakers looking to exact immediate cuts. Pentagon and security spending further narrowed the portion of the federal budget headed for the chopping block.

HEADLINE: Donations Preserve 3 Varsity Teams at Cal but Can't Save Baseball

BYLINE: By KATIE THOMAS

 BODY:
The University of California, Berkeley, announced Friday that it was reinstating three of the five varsity teams it cut in September after a group of donors, alumni and fans raised as much as $13 million in private donations to restore the teams.
The university will keep women's lacrosse, women's gymnastics and men's rugby, which Cal had planned to demote to a newly created category called varsity club. Baseball and men's gymnastics will not return. Because both women's teams were restored, Cal officials said they no longer had to make cuts to the remaining men's teams in order to comply with Title IX, the federal gender-equity law.
''We are all greatly impressed by how our community organized itself in the attempt to help these five sports and the university,'' Vice Chancellor Frank Yeary said in a statement. ''We are delighted that, together, we have found a path that allows us to retain the two women's teams and our rugby program without adding costs to the strained budgets of the university and Cal Athletics.'' 
Cari DuBois, the coach of the women's gymnastics team, said the announcement Friday created mixed emotions. ''It's hard to put into words how happy I am for my team and women's gymnastics,'' she said. ''And at the same time, my heart goes out to the men's baseball and the men's gymnastics team, because we train with them.''
Cal had initially eliminated the teams to save an estimated $4 million a year and to quell criticism that the athletic department had been accepting $10 million to $15 million a year in university subsidies while the rest of the campus was struggling with severe budget cuts. The new plan is part of a goal to limit the university's annual contribution to athletics to $5 million a year by 2014.
The decision to cut the teams led to an uproar by donors, alumni and supporters of the teams, particularly men's rugby, which had won 25 national championships since 1980, and baseball, which had been a varsity sport for more than a century. Officials had originally said supporters would have to raise as much as $100 million to reinstate the teams, but they recently lowered the target to $25 million if backers could also demonstrate a long-term plan for supporting the teams financially.
University officials said in a news release Friday that at least $8 million of the $12 million to $13 million in philanthropic pledges would be enough to finance the women's lacrosse, women's gymnastics and rugby teams for the next 7 to 10 years. Rugby raised enough money to help support the two women's teams, Yeary said Friday. Enough money was raised to support men's baseball and men's gymnastics for about two years, officials said. ''Both programs would have needed to raise multiples of what they actually did raise to meet our criteria,'' Yeary said in the statement. ''In the context of both current and forecasted economic and financial conditions, we simply could not agree to short-term, stopgap measures.''
Dave Esquer, the head coach of the men's baseball team, had been under the impression that either all five teams would be reinstated, or none would. ''Our efforts have been to get all five back,'' he said, adding that many of his donors gave money to help all the teams. ''The fact that we didn't get all five back, just a portion of it, was just confusing.''
Theresa Sherry, the coach of the women's lacrosse team, said Friday that even though she was happy her team was spared, the uncertainty had created problems that would not be easy to fix. After the announcement that the team had been cut, Sherry said she helped the women she had recruited to come to Cal next fall find new universities. ''We have no freshman class next year, so it will mean scrambling,'' she said. And Sherry said she had few details about the level of financing the team would receive. ''I think it's great for the sport to have lacrosse back, but we just really don't know to what kind of level we're going to be able to compete,'' she said.
The restoration of the teams most likely solves another problem for the university: Athletic Directory Sandy Barbour said Friday that Cal would now scrap plans to make another round of cuts to men's teams to satisfy Title IX.
According to numbers the university provided, officials would have had to cut about 80 men from team rosters by next fall -- and to add about 50 players to women's teams -- to comply with Title IX. Cal faced this predicament because it had been arguing that it was meeting the ''interests and abilities'' of its female student body, one of three options, or prongs, that institutions can use to show they are complying with the law. But it could no longer make that claim after it cut women's lacrosse and gymnastics, and it could not show a continuing history of improving opportunities for women, another option.
The university was not in compliance with the only remaining prong, proving that the percentage of female athletic participants was proportionate to overall female enrollment at the university. Forty percent of athletic participants at Cal are women, even though women make up 53 percent of enrollment. So to come into compliance, officials planned to make cuts to their men's teams, while adding players to their women's teams.
The news was a relief for Travis Bickham, a member of the men's water polo team, who said his team was told it would have to reduce its planned roster next fall to 28 men from 41. ''Hopefully that means that we can keep more if not all of our guys,'' he said.
Barbour said that the university planned to continue with its original method of compliance and that she was confident that Cal would meet the requirements of the law.
However, Noreen Farrell, managing attorney at Equal Rights Advocates, which has sued universities for Title IX violations on behalf of female athletes, questioned whether Cal can claim it is meeting the interests and the abilities of its female students, especially since it recently turned down a request by the women's club rugby team to be elevated to varsity status.
Farrell said that while the announcement that Cal would reinstate the teams was good news, ''young women are clamoring for more intercollegiate sports opportunities, including rugby players on its own campus,'' she said. ''Berkeley's work is not done.''

HEADLINE: Old Mines Reopen In a New Cry Of 'Gold!'

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

 BODY:
SUTTER CREEK, Calif. -- Standing in a cramped, slanted and slippery crevice some 500 feet below the earth's surface, David Cochrane turned his eyes to a ribbon of marbled quartz -- mainly gray, amber and white -- and found the one hue he was actually looking for.
''Right there, see? It's small but it's very colorful,'' Mr. Cochrane said, pointing at a shiny speck no bigger than a seed. ''It's got that nice yellow color.''
It was gold, and if people like Mr. Cochrane have their way, gold will soon be big business again in California's Mother Lode, in the same area of the Sierra -- and occasionally the same mines -- where the old-time prospectors once used pickaxes, ore carts and burros to chase their riches. 
''People say the Mother Lode's mined out,'' said Mr. Cochrane, a vice president with Sutter Gold Mining Inc., based in Colorado. ''But that's not the case.''
Sutter Gold is just one of several companies seeking to reignite a stagnant industry in California, a state whose early history and growth were intertwined with gold's discovery, excavation and exploitation.
Mining largely dried up in California after World War II as price controls made the business model unappealing. But with controls gone, and gold now selling at more than $1,300 an ounce, the math makes sense again.
''The price is there,'' said James Hesketh, the president and chief executive of Atna Resources, which reopened the Briggs Mine on the western border of Death Valley National Park in 2009. ''It's still a very well-endowed resource state.''
Sutter Gold estimates that there could be $800 million or more in ore under the 3.6 mile stretch it owns in the Mother Lode. And with most of about three dozen local, state and federal permits already in hand, its new Lincoln Mine could be producing gold as early as next year.
But Sutter Gold will not be the first to get back in the game in California. In addition to the Briggs Mine, which last year produced some 25,000 ounces of gold -- or about $30 million worth -- there is the Mesquite Mine, in Imperial County on the Mexican border, which reopened in 2008. In 2010, that mine outstripped company estimates to produce nearly 170,000 ounces of gold.
Both the Briggs and Mesquite projects are open-pit mines. But here in the Sierra foothills, where the discovery of nuggets in 1848 set off the global rush of prospectors to California, miners are headed back underground. In addition to the Lincoln Mine, plans are afoot to reopen the Idaho-Maryland mine in Grass Valley, a family-friendly area 50 miles northeast of Sacramento.
That mine -- now flooded -- has not had hard hats in it since 1956, but a Canadian company is convinced that more than one million ounces of gold were left behind. ''This was a world-class ore body,'' said David Watkinson, chief executive of the Emgold Mining Corporation, which is spearheading the project.
The Idaho-Maryland project is further from being shovel-ready than the Lincoln Mine: pumping out more than 50 years of water will take time, after all, as does completing a variety of environmental impact reports and permitting processes. And the prospect of a newly opened mine has also been met with opposition from some local activists, whose worries are rooted in both the legacy of the first Gold Rush -- including contaminated and sediment-filled rivers and hillsides denuded by hydraulic mining -- and by more modern quality-of-life concerns like traffic, noise and water rights.
''We'd be looking at reopening a mine in the middle of a city,'' said Ralph Silberstein, the president of a grass-roots group called Citizens Looking at the Impacts of Mining in Grass Valley (or Claim-GV). ''Which is not a good idea.''
Like many of the other towns in the Mother Lode, Grass Valley has long since moved its economy away from mining toward things like software and tourism. The Gold Rush itself peaked in 1852, according to the state's Department of Conservation, when nearly four million ounces were discovered in California. By 1971, when the nation went off the gold standard, less than 2,000 ounces were produced in California.
But the rebound in price has led to a rebound in production. Domestic gold mine production in 2010 increased for the first time in a decade, according to the United States Geological Survey. Nevada is by far the largest gold-producing state, producing roughly four times that of all other states combined.
Early California prospectors used pans and their hands to find nuggets in freezing cold streams. Methods soon became more intrusive, however, with machinery and dynamite being used to dig into hard rock and lethal chemicals like mercury and cyanide used to help process the crushed ore.
And while today's methods are safer, Izzy Martin, chief executive of the Sierra Fund, a nonprofit group devoted to preservation of the Sierra Nevada, says there are several challenges to mining old mines, including what previous companies might have left behind.
''There's a lot of toxic materials in there,'' Ms. Martin said. ''And you have to clean it up.''
Such processes can be expensive, particularly in an environmentally attuned state like California. And the worry, Ms. Martin said, is that companies could abandon the work halfway. ''And then we'll be left with this gigantic eyesore,'' she said.
For its part, Emgold says its mine will be ''a forward-thinking, environmentally responsible business,'' which will provide jobs and tax dollars for the local economy. Water from the mine will be treated before it is returned to a local creek, the company says, and some of the mine's waste rock will even be used to make another product: tile.
And while the Gold Rush miners swarmed the region in a near-lawless crush, Mr. Watkinson says today's deliberate pace of exploration, permitting and local approval -- the Idaho-Maryland project has been in the works on and off for nearly two decades -- has made the hunt for nuggets seem almost dull.
''The concept of a 'gold rush' is no longer applicable into today's world,'' Mr. Watkinson said. ''All anyone can expect to see is resurgence, not a rush.''
That said, there is an undeniable romance surrounding the idea of gold in places like Sutter Creek, a picturesque town of 3,000 where there is a Eureka Street, a Gold Dust Trail and Oro Madre Way.
The Lincoln Mine itself sits just off Highway 49, a reference to the year -- 1849 -- when the first Gold Rush kicked into high gear. Sutter Gold Mining hopes to break ground this year on its new mill -- designed to look like an old mill, per a requirement with the county.
The actual mine will be built out from an existing tunnel that is currently used for tours, a popular attraction drawing some 50,000 visitors a year. But Mr. Cochrane says a mine could be even more lucrative; engineers, using calculations made with modern surveying equipment as well as historic mine records, believe there is nearly 700,000 ounces still in the ground.
On a recent tour, Mr. Cochrane showed off several veins of quartz, flecked with what he said could be either gold -- or its deceptive cousin, iron pyrite. Once the mine is fully operational -- probably by 2012 -- he expects dozens of miners to be blasting into those veins.
''They're our friends,'' he said of the quartz veins. ''Because that's where the gold is.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.
Online Correction: February 11, 2011, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A previous version of this article misstated the year that Sutter Gold Mining's Lincoln Mine will probably be operational; it is 2012, not 2013. And the new mill is designed to look like an old mill per a requirement with the county, not the town.

HEADLINE: A Brittle Leader, Appearing Strong

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN

 BODY:
Hosni Mubarak's legacy was supposed to be stability. During almost three decades in power, he rejected bold action in favor of caution. He took half-steps at economic liberalization, preserved the peace with Israel, gave his police force the power to arrest without charge and allowed only the veneer of democracy to take hold.
But history upended Mr. Mubarak, and his fall came as suddenly and surprisingly as his unlikely elevation to the presidency 30 years ago. Mr. Mubarak's Egypt rose up against him. The streets and squares filled with hundreds of thousands of protesters day and night until he could no longer deny the inescapable conclusion that in order to restore stability, he needed to go.
It was an unexpected epitaph for a military man who until recently was revered -- and reviled -- as Egypt's modern-day pharaoh, serving longer than any contemporary Egyptian leader since Muhammad Ali, the founder of the modern state. ''He's the accident of history who brilliantly survived as the longest accidental ruler of Egypt,'' said Emad Shahin, an Egyptian scholar at the University of Notre Dame who, like many other Egyptians living abroad, rushed to Tahrir Square in recent days to share in the moment. 
In his final appearance on state television on Thursday, when he astounded most of his listeners by appearing to say he would remain in office, he was no longer the stocky, confident military man who was the only leader most Egyptians had ever really known. At 82, he was frail and thin, with dyed black hair and a sometimes poignant undercurrent of self-justification.
The Egyptian public, Egyptian political and military leaders, and American officials all expected him to say he was handing over power. But he apparently could not bring himself to say so, clinging to his vision of himself as a reluctant leader tapped by fate to lead a nation that could not survive without his guiding hand.
With his authority already belittled by the crowds in the streets, with the people no longer silenced by the fear his security apparatus had enforced, his words served only to demonstrate how out of touch he had become.
''I have given my life serving Egypt and the people,'' he said, suggesting it was he who was tired of them, and not the other way around.
He failed this time using tactics that had so long sustained his rule: the ability to divide and conquer the masses, to anesthetize the population with promises, pay raises, subsidies and government reshuffling. He spoke of preserving his dignity, but that is exactly what the crowds in the street were fighting for, but for themselves.
During his tenure, Egypt's population doubled, to more than 80 million. Life grew harder as the social contract between the state and citizens broke down. Satellite television and the Internet meant the state could no longer control what people knew, and so its narrative was often ignored or even mocked.
The gap between rich and poor became greater, and politics became less ideological and more about common demands: for freedom, democracy, social justice, rule of law and economic equality. Mr. Mubarak's government struggled to prevent people's economic dissatisfaction from becoming political, but in the end, that failed, too. As he feared, the Egyptian people blamed the entire system.
But perhaps most of all, Mr. Mubarak's concept of stability -- one that was embraced by Washington -- in the end proved the ultimate destabilizer, experts in Egypt said. Facing a police state that choked off competing ideas and ideologies, preventing free elections and manipulating the state media, the public found the only way to achieve its goals was on the streets, occupying the symbolic heart of the nation, Tahrir Square, and refusing to go home.
Mr. Mubarak leaves office now with the country's future more uncertain than at any time since assassins killed President Anwar el-Sadat, elevating Mr. Mubarak to the presidency.
''The idea of integration did not exist in Egypt under Mubarak,'' said Amr El-Shobaki, a political analyst at the state-financed Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies, in an interview before the crisis. ''When they see the opposition, they only think, 'How do we eliminate them?' We have a lot of issues in society, political and social, and we don't have any legal body to express these demands or needs. This is our crisis.''
The people found a way, organized by social media and old-fashioned political mobilization, united by anger and hope.
If stability was to be the hallmark of his reign, that very goal proved to be at least part of his undoing. Stability to many Egyptians came to mean stagnation, as the economy grew and so did the number of people living in poverty. Where once the rich, poor and middle class lived in the same neighborhoods, the wealthy later retreated to walled compounds of grass yards and swimming pools, while Mr. Mubarak's government struggled even to keep the streets clean of trash.
Nearly every step he took in his quest to preserve the status quo ended up diminishing the standing of the nation as a whole -- a blow to a nation that once saw itself as the center of civilization and the Arab world, many political analysts and social commentators said.
Egyptians were shocked when their country did not receive even one vote to host the World Cup soccer tournament in 2000, and then were shocked again this year when Qatar, the tiny oil-and-gas-rich Persian Gulf nation, succeeded in winning the right to host the event in 2022.
''He used the security forces, every political device, and 'crony capitalism' to realize his ends, sacrificing the dynamism, autonomy and capabilities of Egyptians, particularly young people,'' said Diane Singerman, a professor at American University and an expert on contemporary Egypt.
Mr. Mubarak was initially seen as the perfect antidote to what ailed his nation. He came to power in 1981, when Mr. Sadat was assassinated by Islamic radicals in the military. Mr. Mubarak, sitting next to him, was seared by the experience and pledged to assure security.
He came to power when Egypt was hugely in debt and unsure whether it could pay its bills. It was still ostracized by its Arab neighbors for making peace with Israel.
Mr. Mubarak's role was to bring calm, stability and unity to his nation, and at first, he did. He was a taciturn military officer, offering a welcome contrast to his two predecessors, charismatic leaders who marked their place in history for bold if not always successful ideas. President Gamal Abdel Nasser promoted pan-Arabism, and Mr. Sadat made peace with Israel, a peace many Egyptians never fully accepted.
''This guy came to power and he kept the country together,'' Abdel Moneim Said, the chairman of Al Ahram Newspaper and Publishing, said in an interview before the uprising. Mr. Mubarak also presented himself as a humble leader, tapped by fate to lead his nation. He was a former athlete, a squash player, a former military man and commander of the air force who, analysts and peers said, believed that long hours and hard work equaled good leadership.
He publicly rejected nepotism, though in later years he would maneuver to have his son succeed him. He publicly shunned corruption, although Egyptians became convinced that the powerful enriched themselves at the public's expense.
His early successes were substantial, especially in the realm of foreign policy. He helped to bring Egypt back into the Arab fold, but also managed to serve as a strong voice for peace between Arab nations and Israel. In the mid-1990s, he was instrumental in helping to forge the agreements with Israel and the P.L.O. that were intended to foster a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza.
Mr. Mubarak oversaw substantial improvements in Egypt's infrastructure and helped, initially, to reschedule debt and stabilize the economy. He was also a friend of Washington, which gave annual military and economic aid of as much as $2 billion. In 1991, he helped to organize the coalition of Arab armies that agreed to join the United States in the first Persian Gulf war to push Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait.
Even during the years when Mr. Mubarak was unhappy with President George W. Bush for talking about human rights and democracy in Egypt, he was seen as an ally willing to help with many issues, including the effort to thwart Iran's growing regional influence and to try to contain the militant group Hamas, which had seized control of the Gaza Strip. Egypt was a partner in carrying out the widely criticized policy of rendition, in which terrorism suspects were flown to third countries for harsh interrogation, even torture.
''He kept close to the United States, but independent of it,'' said Mr. Said, who was a member of Mr. Mubarak's ruling National Democratic Party. On the day before the Jan. 25 protest that ultimately pushed Mr. Mubarak out of office, Mr. Said said he thought such an outcome was out of the question.
But Mr. Mubarak's approach never seemed to change with the times, experts said, and he ultimately became viewed as an isolated autocrat, who allowed, or promoted, corruption and cronyism. He preserved an emergency law that allowed the police to arrest without cause, restricted the right to assembly, and set up a military court.
The public anger grew, visible to many -- but not to the president or his circle.
''The government does what it wants and they think nobody can do anything about it,'' said Fahmy Howeidy, a social commentator, speaking before the uprising began. ''But there is a difference between people swallowing this and the anger accumulating in the people. Civil society institutions are in a state of collapse and are extremely weakened. But the people are there and they are angry.''
Mr. Mubarak's political organization, the ruling National Democratic Party, was less a party than a collection of interests. It grew to be widely despised, and during the recent tumult in the street the protesters set its headquarters on fire.
''If he left in 1993, he would have been a great president for sure,'' said Mr. Shobaki of the Ahram Center. ''If he left in the '90s, it's average. And starting in 2000, we start the real decline.''
Mr. Mubarak appointed a cabinet to put in place economic improvements, and made some cosmetic political changes. The first three times he ran for re-election, he ran unopposed, in what were called referendums. The fourth time, he allowed opposition candidates, but won with millions of votes and suspicions of electoral manipulation. The nearest challenger, Ayman Nour, got about 600,000 votes, and was later jailed on what were widely seen as politically motivated charges.
During his three decades in power, Mr. Mubarak, his allies and his party never managed to define an idea for Egyptians to believe in. ''The excesses of free markets without freedoms, the increased economic inequality in Egypt and crass inattention and suspicion of the needs and aspirations of the majority of Egyptians, finally rose up to pierce the monarchical, securitized state that he and his supporters had built,'' said Mrs. Singerman, the American University professor.
During his tenure, Egyptians never lost their well-known sense of humor and their zest for satire. And it was not long after he took office that his hallmark, stability, was already mocked not as a legacy, but as a punch line.
The joke from the late 1980s went like this: Mr. Mubarak's driver came to a fork in the road. He asked his driver which way President Nasser went and the response was, ''Always left.'' He asked about President Sadat and the answer was, ''Always right.''
''Signal left, then right, and park,'' Mr. Mubarak told his driver.

HEADLINE: MUBARAK OUT

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK; Anthony Shadid, Mona El-Naggar and Liam Stack contributed reporting.

 BODY:
CAIRO -- An 18-day-old revolt led by the young people of Egypt ousted President Hosni Mubarak on Friday, shattering three decades of political stasis here and overturning the established order of the Arab world.
Shouts of ''God is great'' erupted from Tahrir Square at twilight as Mr. Mubarak's vice president and longtime intelligence chief, Omar Suleiman, announced that Mr. Mubarak had passed all authority to a council of military leaders.
Tens of thousands who had bowed down for evening prayers leapt to their feet, bouncing and dancing in joy. ''Lift your head high, you're an Egyptian,'' they cried. Revising the tense of the revolution's rallying cry, they chanted, ''The people, at last, have brought down the regime.''
''We can breathe fresh air, we can feel our freedom,'' said Gamal Heshamt, a former independent member of Parliament. ''After 30 years of absence from the world, Egypt is back.'' 
Mr. Mubarak, an 82-year-old former air force commander, left without comment for his home by the Red Sea in Sharm el Sheik. His departure overturns, after six decades, the Arab world's original secular dictatorship. He was toppled by a radically new force in regional politics -- a largely secular, nonviolent, youth-led democracy movement that brought Egypt's liberal and Islamist opposition groups together for the first time under its banner.
One by one the protesters withstood each weapon in the arsenal of the Egyptian autocracy -- first the heavily armed riot police, then a ruling party militia and finally the state's powerful propaganda machine.
Mr. Mubarak's fall removed a bulwark of American foreign policy in the region. The United States, its Arab allies and Israel are now pondering whether the Egyptian military, which has vowed to hold free elections, will give way to a new era of democratic dynamism or to a perilous lurch into instability or Islamist rule.
The upheaval comes less than a month after a sudden youth revolt in nearby Tunisia toppled another enduring Arab strongman, President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali. And on Friday night some of the revelers celebrating in the streets of Cairo marched under a Tunisian flag and pointed to the surviving autocracies in Syria, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Yemen. ''We are setting a role model for the dictatorships around us,'' said Khalid Shaheen, 39. ''Democracy is coming.''
President Obama, in a televised address, praised the Egyptian revolution. ''Egyptians have made it clear that nothing less than genuine democracy will carry the day,'' he said. ''It was the moral force of nonviolence -- not terrorism and mindless killing -- that bent the arc of history toward justice once more.''
The Muslim Brotherhood, the outlawed Islamist movement that until 18 days ago was considered Egypt's only viable opposition, said it was merely a supporting player in the revolt.
''We participated with everyone else and did not lead this or raise Islamic slogans so that it can be the revolution of everyone,'' said Mohamed Saad el-Katatni, a spokesman for the Brotherhood. ''This is a revolution for all Egyptians; there is no room for a single group's slogans, not the Brotherhood's or anybody else.''
The Brotherhood, which was slow to follow the lead of its own youth wing into the streets, has said it will not field a candidate for president or seek a parliamentary majority in the expected elections.
The Mubarak era ended without any of the stability and predictability that were the hallmarks of his tenure. Western and Egyptian officials had expected Mr. Mubarak to leave office on Thursday and irrevocably delegate his authority to Vice President Suleiman, finishing the last six months of his term with at least his presidential title intact.
But whether because of pride or stubbornness, Mr. Mubarak instead spoke once again as the unbowed father of the nation, barely alluding to a vague ''delegation'' of authority.
The resulting disappointment enraged the Egyptian public, sent a million people into the streets of Cairo on Friday morning and put in motion an unceremonious retreat at the behest of the military he had commanded for so long.
''Taking into consideration the difficult circumstances the country is going through, President Mohammed Hosni Mubarak has decided to leave the post of president of the republic and has tasked the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces to manage the state's affairs,'' Mr. Suleiman, grave and ashen, said in a brief televised statement.
It is now not clear what role Mr. Suleiman, whose credibility plummeted over the past week as he stood by Mr. Mubarak and even questioned Egypt's readiness for democracy, will have in the new government.
The transfer of power leaves the Egyptian military in charge of this nation of 85 million, facing insistent calls for fundamental democratic change and open elections. Hours before Mr. Suleiman announced Mr. Mubarak's exit, the military had signaled its takeover with a communique that appeared to declare its solidarity with the protesters.
Read on state television by an army spokesman, the communique declared that the military -- not Mr. Mubarak, Mr. Suleiman or any other civilian authority -- would ensure the amendment of the Constitution to ''conduct free and fair presidential elections.''
''The armed forces are committed to sponsor the legitimate demands of the people,'' the statement declared, and the military promised to ensure the fulfillment of its promises ''within defined time frames'' until authority could be passed to a ''free democratic community that the people aspire to.''
It pledged to remove the reviled ''emergency law,'' which allows the government to detain anyone without charges or trial, ''as soon as the current circumstances are over'' and further promised immunity from prosecution for the protesters, whom it called ''the honest people who refused the corruption and demanded reforms.''
Egyptians ignored the communique, as they have most official pronouncements of the Mubarak government, until the president's resignation was announced. Then they hugged, kissed and cheered the soldiers, lifting children on tanks to get their pictures taken. ''The people and the army are one hand,'' they chanted.
Standing guard near the presidential palace, soldiers passed photographs of ''martyrs'' killed during the revolution through barbed wire to attach them to their tanks. At Tahrir Square, some slipped out of position to join the roaring crowds flooding the streets.
Whether the military will subordinate itself to a civilian democracy or install a new military dictator will be impossible to know for months. Military leaders will inevitably face pressure to deliver the genuine transition that protesters did not trust Mr. Mubarak to give them.
Yet it may also seek to protect the enormous political and economic privileges it accumulated during Mr. Mubarak's reign. And the army has itself been infused for years with the notion that Egypt's survival depends on fighting threats, real and imagined, from foreign enemies, Islamists, Iran and the frustrations of its own people.
Throughout the revolt, the army stood passively on the sidelines -- its soldiers literally standing behind the iron fence of the Egyptian Museum -- as the police or armed Mubarak loyalists fought the protesters centered in Tahrir Square.
But Western diplomats, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were violating confidences, said that top army officials had told them that their troops would never use force against civilians, depriving Mr. Mubarak of a decisive tool to suppress the dissent.
It has been ''increasingly clear,'' a Western diplomat said Friday, that ''the army will not go down with Mubarak.''
Now the military, which owns vast commercial interests here but has not fought in decades, must defuse demonstrations, quell widespread labor unrest and rebuild a shattered economy and security forces. Its top official, Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, 75, served for decades as a top official of Mr. Mubarak's government. And its top uniformed official, Gen. Sami Hafez Enan, has not spoken publicly.
Egypt's opposition has said for weeks that it welcomed a military role in securing the country, ideally under a two- to five-member presidential council with only one military member. And the initial reaction to the military takeover was ecstatic.
''Welcome back,'' said Wael Ghonim, the Google executive who administered the Facebook group that helped start the revolt.
Mr. Ghonim, who was detained for 12 days in blindfolded isolation by the Mubarak government as it tried to stamp out the revolt, helped protesters turn the tide in a propaganda war against the state media earlier this week, when he described his captivity in an emotional interview on a satellite television station.
''Egypt is going to be a democratic state,'' he declared Friday, in another interview. ''You will be impressed.''
Dr. Shady el-Ghazaly Harb, 32, a transplant surgeon who was among the small group of organizers who guided the revolution, said the leaders had decided to let the protests unwind on their own. ''We are not going to ask the people to stay in the square or leave -- it is their choice,'' he said. ''Even if they leave, any government will know that we can get them to the streets again in a minute.''
''Our country never had a victory in our lifetime, and this is the sort of victory we were looking for, a victory over a vicious regime that we needed to bring down,'' Dr. Harb said.
Amr Ezz, 27, another of revolt's young leaders, said that calling the revolution a military coup understated its achievement. ''It is the people who took down the president and the regime and can take down anyone else,'' he said. ''Now the role of the regular people has ended and the role of the politicians begins. Now we can begin negotiations with the military in order to plan the coming phase.''
The opposition groups participating in the protest movement had previously settled on a committee led by Mohamed ElBaradei, the former diplomat and Nobel laureate, to negotiate with the army if Mr. Mubarak resigned.
Mr. ElBaradei could not be reached for comment on Friday, but in a television interview he indicated that he expected the talks with the military to begin within days.
''I'd like to see that started tomorrow so we can have a sharing of power, the civilian and the military, and tell them what our demands are, what they need to do,'' he said.
By evening, Egyptian politicians were beginning to position themselves to run for office. Amr Moussa, one of the country's most popular public figures, resigned his position as secretary general of the Arab League, and an aide, Hesham Youssef, confirmed that Mr. Moussa was considering seeking office.
In Switzerland, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it had frozen possible assets of ''the former Egyptian president'' and his associates.
In the military's final communique of the day, its spokesman thanked Mr. Mubarak for his service and saluted the ''martyrs'' of the revolution.
In Tahrir Square, protesters said they were not quite ready to disband the little republic they had built up during their two-week occupation, setting up makeshift clinics, soundstages, a detention center and security teams to protect the barricades.
Many have boasted that their encampment was a rare example of community spirit here, and after Mr. Mubarak's resignation the organizers called on the thousands who protested here to return once again on Saturday morning to help clean it up.

HEADLINE: For Egyptian Military Leaders, a New Test: How to Share Power With the People

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER and ERIC SCHMITT; Mark Mazzetti contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The two military officers who have risen to power in Egypt are members of the very elite that benefited from the reign of President Hosni Mubarak. Now the question being raised here and in Cairo is whether they can figure out a way to share power with a restive population that for decades has had none.
Both are members of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which has rarely met but will run the country at least until elections are held later in the year. Each gained credibility with protesters during the turmoil of the past three weeks by venturing out into the streets and mingling with the crowds, sending strong signals that they would not stand behind the president or order soldiers to fire on the demonstrators. 
Despite this nod to populism, American military officers who know them say that neither officer is fiercely pro-democracy; in fact one of them, Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, is seen as a strident opponent of political change. Both are likely to have calculated that protecting the military's status and credibility was more important than standing behind an increasingly isolated and weakened president.
Field Marshal Tantawi, 75, the Egyptian defense minister, has the higher profile of the two officers, a member of the ruling clique for decades and widely known to American officials.
Although he has been derided on the street, and in classified diplomatic cables, as a ''poodle'' to Mr. Mubarak, Field Marshal Tantawi is portrayed by some senior American officers who know him personally as a shrewd operator who played a significant role in the relatively nonviolent ouster of his patron.
These officers say Field Marshal Tantawi is likely to be the most powerful military figure during the transition, because he is canny, knows the system and is more experienced.
By contrast, the second officer, Lt. Gen. Sami Hafez Enan, chief of staff of the armed forces, is a bit of a cipher to American officials, who say he has never sought to project a separate identity from the army he leads.
He is younger than the defense minister, and thus would most likely be promoted to the more senior ministry position if the military can calmly guide the nation toward democracy.
Americans who have worked with General Enan describe him as bright and innovative.
The army's role in Egyptian society says much about the general who leads it. General Enan commands a conscription army -- drawn by law from all sectors of Egyptian society and therefore tightly knitted with the populace. Every adult male is required to serve.
American officials said General Enan had made it clear to them in several telephone calls to Washington that his troops would not fire on the protesters, even as the military sought to protect the institutions of government.
Classified diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks illuminate the symbiotic relationship between top Egyptian commanders and their American counterparts, especially their mutual concern about regional threats.
General Enan comes across as particularly worried about Iranian power in the Middle East.
According to one cable, General Enan in April 2009 ''stressed the importance of resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict in order to deter Iranian interference in the region.'' Three months later, Gen. David H. Petraeus, then the commander of the United States Central Command, told General Enan that Egypt's success in constraining Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist group, had blunted Iran's influence.
That same trove of cables offers a critical assessment of Field Marshal Tantawi. In the view of American diplomats and senior military officers, he was seen as a Mubarak confidant who had consistently resisted not only changes to the Egyptian military's mission, but also social reforms in the country.
A classified cable prepared before a visit to Egypt in December 2008 by General Petraeus said the United States had pressed Egypt's military to expand its mission to counter emerging threats like piracy, border security and terrorism.
''Egypt's aging leadership, however, has resisted our efforts and remains satisfied with continuing to do what they have done for years: train for force-on-force warfare with a premium on ground forces and armor,'' the cable said, adding that Field Marshal Tantawi, in particular, ''has been the chief impediment to transforming the military's mission to meet emerging security threats.''
A September 2008 cable cited a political analyst at a research center run by the Egyptian government as saying that Field Marshal Tantawi had made clear the Defense Ministry ''will not tolerate independent thought within its own ranks.''
A March 2008 cable also characterized Field Marshal Tantawi as resistant to the kind of social changes that were among the top priorities of the hundreds of thousands of Egyptians who have been protesting for three weeks. ''In the cabinet, where he still wields significant influence,'' it said, ''Tantawi has opposed both economic and political reforms that he perceives as eroding central government power.''
The cable concluded: ''He and Mubarak are focused on regime stability and maintaining the status quo through the end of their time. They simply do not have the energy, inclination or world view to do anything differently.''
American experts on the Egyptian military shared the cables' assessments.
''Tantawi has a reputation for basically being Mubarak's shadow,'' said Anthony H. Cordesman, an expert on the Egyptian military at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ''He's loyal without making waves or shaking structures.''
Mr. Cordesman said that General Enan ''has a reputation for being more progressive and has a better understanding of the outside world. But neither of these people have ever governed anything.''

HEADLINE: Lots of Modern Angst, and Free Beer

BYLINE: By JASON ZINOMAN

 BODY:
Ashlin Halfnight, 35, is a playwright on the verge. Moving from Toronto to Harvard to a stint in professional hockey to downtown theater, he has a biography that is catnip for profile writers. So is his glamorous name.
He already has written several well-reviewed plays, including ''Artifacts of Consequence,'' an outlandish, post-apocalyptic drama bubbling with fresh theatrical ideas. Theater in the Dark, With Lights, a mini-festival in which three of his works are receiving short runs, provides an opportunity to judge whether this emerging writer has arrived.
It feels like a coming-out party. The attractive young actors are milling around at Performance Space 122 when you walk in. There is free beer. For those of us who find that the usual solemnity of uptown theatergoing often turns the excitement of live performance into dutiful ritual, the atmosphere is refreshing. 
Then the performance starts, and while there is considerable talent displayed, the plays only occasionally live up to the celebratory mood. They are uneven and occasionally meandering, and the impression they leave is of a promising artist with many interesting voices rather than a single vital one. Mr. Halfnight has a gift for punchy, coarse dialogue; an interest in bittersweet detail; and an ear for the inarticulate angst of young people stuck in limbo. What's most interesting, however, is that the differences among his shows are more striking than their similarities.
''Lathem Prince'' is a winking modern update of ''Hamlet''; ''Laws of Motion'' delivers a melancholy series of minor-key stories that bring Chekhov to mind or, more specifically, Eric Bogosian paying homage to Chekhov; and the influences of ''God's Waiting Room,'' which had an earlier run, can be traced to Beckett and Brecht. The range here is impressive, but not one of these plays seems fully realized.
''Lathem Prince'' is the most satisfying, making the Hamlet stand-in, Lathem (Kris Kling), an aimless, stoned dude who returns from Boston College to find his father dead and his mother marrying an annoying, sexually uninhibited Frenchman from Detroit. (Lathem's name scrambles the letters to Hamlet, and his nickname, P D, could refer to the Prince of Denmark.) But this play isn't a parody so much as slacker Shakespeare that elbows you with knowing references.
Three characters from ''Hamlet'' are conflated into Patio (Bryan Grossbauer), the brother of Lia, the Ophelia stand-in. She is played charmingly by Hanna Cheek, who telegraphs flirtatious insanity in the flip of her head right down to the constant arching of her leg. In a laid-back drawl, Patio muses aloud about Lathem's situation: ''Tragedy. Tragedy,'' he says. ''Like Othello. Only your dad was white.''
In the end, it feels like a lark. That's not the case with ''Laws of Motion,'' a sprawling recession-era New York play featuring four rotating stories focusing on broken families, careers and psyches. Some of these scenes appear familiar, like the corporate Darwinian battle where an ineffectual businessman (Daniel Kublick) is bullied into betting his family's savings, leading to the unraveling of his marriage.
This messy, overpacked play (its run ends on Saturday) becomes gripping when the focus turns to the budding romance between Christopher (Gregg Mozgala), a handicapped Kinko's employee who calls his job working ''in publishing,'' and Anna (Sara Buffamanti), a dominatrix. They meet cute, sitting next to each other on the subway, where he jokes that he maintains the Astor Place Cube, an apt symbol for the downtown of yesteryear and going in circles.
This sweet, modest, romantic interlude is as cliched as it is contrived. But since Mr. Halfnight imbues these scenes with emotional punch and genuine wit, you won't care.
''God's Waiting Room'' is a murky, ruminative drama with a fractured narrative of incomplete scenes that requires the audience to fill in the blanks. It's set in Purgatory and centers on a love triangle involving a drug dealer, his wife and his girlfriend. Like the previous two plays, it features characters in a frustrating paralysis. The style here mixes fourth-wall-busting humor with story fragments that lack urgency.
Kristjan Thor's staging employs minimal design, but that's not why these plays seem less finished than the other work of Mr. Halfnight that I've seen, including ''Artifacts of Consequence.'' The compelling moments are not emphasized in ways that would bring the plays into focus. Instead, too often the productions seem quickly drawn, emotions reaching their peak too early, like the shorthand of the relationship scenes in an action movie. The festival reminds us of the writer's talent, but does not convince us that he has finished verging.
Theater in the Dark, With Lights continues through Sunday at Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at 10th Street, East Village; (212) 352-101, ps122.org.

HEADLINE: When Democracy Weakens

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
As the throngs celebrated in Cairo, I couldn't help wondering about what is happening to democracy here in the United States. I think it's on the ropes. We're in serious danger of becoming a democracy in name only.
While millions of ordinary Americans are struggling with unemployment and declining standards of living, the levers of real power have been all but completely commandeered by the financial and corporate elite. It doesn't really matter what ordinary people want. The wealthy call the tune, and the politicians dance. 
So what we get in this democracy of ours are astounding and increasingly obscene tax breaks and other windfall benefits for the wealthiest, while the bought-and-paid-for politicians hack away at essential public services and the social safety net, saying we can't afford them. One state after another is reporting that it cannot pay its bills. Public employees across the country are walking the plank by the tens of thousands. Camden, N.J., a stricken city with a serious crime problem, laid off nearly half of its police force. Medicaid, the program that provides health benefits to the poor, is under savage assault from nearly all quarters.
The poor, who are suffering from an all-out depression, are never heard from. In terms of their clout, they might as well not exist. The Obama forces reportedly want to raise a billion dollars or more for the president's re-election bid. Politicians in search of that kind of cash won't be talking much about the wants and needs of the poor. They'll be genuflecting before the very rich.
In an Op-Ed article in The Times at the end of January, Senator John Kerry said that the Egyptian people ''have made clear they will settle for nothing less than greater democracy and more economic opportunities.'' Americans are being asked to swallow exactly the opposite. In the mad rush to privatization over the past few decades, democracy itself was put up for sale, and the rich were the only ones who could afford it.
The corporate and financial elites threw astounding sums of money into campaign contributions and high-priced lobbyists and think tanks and media buys and anything else they could think of. They wined and dined powerful leaders of both parties. They flew them on private jets and wooed them with golf outings and lavish vacations and gave them high-paying jobs as lobbyists the moment they left the government. All that money was well spent. The investments paid off big time.
As Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson wrote in their book, ''Winner-Take-All Politics'': ''Step by step and debate by debate, America's public officials have rewritten the rules of American politics and the American economy in ways that have benefited the few at the expense of the many.''
As if the corporate stranglehold on American democracy were not tight enough, the Supreme Court strengthened it immeasurably with its Citizens United decision, which greatly enhanced the already overwhelming power of corporate money in politics. Ordinary Americans have no real access to the corridors of power, but you can bet your last Lotto ticket that your elected officials are listening when the corporate money speaks.
When the game is rigged in your favor, you win. So despite the worst economic downturn since the Depression, the big corporations are sitting on mountains of cash, the stock markets are up and all is well among the plutocrats. The endlessly egregious Koch brothers, David and Charles, are worth an estimated $35 billion. Yet they seem to feel as though society has treated them unfairly.
As Jane Mayer pointed out in her celebrated New Yorker article, ''The Kochs are longtime libertarians who believe in drastically lower personal and corporate taxes, minimal social services for the needy, and much less oversight of industry -- especially environmental regulation.'' (A good hard look at their air-pollution record would make you sick.)
It's a perversion of democracy, indeed, when individuals like the Kochs have so much clout while the many millions of ordinary Americans have so little. What the Kochs want is coming to pass. Extend the tax cuts for the rich? No problem. Cut services to the poor, the sick, the young and the disabled? Check. Can we get you anything else, gentlemen?
The Egyptians want to establish a viable democracy, and that's a long, hard road. Americans are in the mind-bogglingly self-destructive process of letting a real democracy slip away.
I had lunch with the historian Howard Zinn just a few weeks before he died in January 2010. He was chagrined about the state of affairs in the U.S. but not at all daunted. ''If there is going to be change,'' he said, ''real change, it will have to work its way from the bottom up, from the people themselves.''
I thought of that as I watched the coverage of the ecstatic celebrations in the streets of Cairo.

HEADLINE: Semi-Naked Came the Congressman

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
I know that you have been wondering what the story of the shirtless Congressman tells us about the current state of American politics.
A lot. Definitely, a lot.
Representative Chris Lee set a record for swift resolution of a sex scandal this week. It began on Wednesday afternoon, when the Web site Gawker posted e-mail correspondence between Lee and a 34-year-old woman who went on Craigslist searching for a ''financially & emotionally secure man'' who did not resemble a toad.
Did that seem like too much to ask, people? Apparently. After a bit of e-flirting, the woman did a quick online search that revealed that Chris Lee, the 39-year-old divorced lobbyist who answered her ad was actually Chris Lee, a 46-year-old married member of Congress. She forwarded everything to Gawker, including a picture Lee had sent of himself standing half-naked in front of a mirror, flexing his muscles. 
A few hours later, he was history. His office had barely had time to blame the whole thing on hackers before the congressman resigned and went off to do marital damage control.
Popular opinion holds that he was prodded out of office by Speaker John Boehner. Although Boehner refused to say whether he had greased the skids for Lee's departure, he has let it be known that he plans to come down hard on ''inappropriate behavior'' in his caucus.
If Boehner is responsible it would be extremely significant since it would probably be his greatest success to date in the role of speaker of the House.
Really, the rest has been pretty much a mess. So far, the new Republican majority hasn't been able to agree on anything that is not entirely symbolic. In lieu of actual legislation, the House spent the last half of the week debating a measure instructing committees to do oversight on government regulations to see if they're cost-effective.
Which is, actually, their regular job.
''Our committee already convened a hearing on this exact topic yesterday,'' said Representative Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the, um, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform during the ninth hour of debate.
But about Lee. Aficionados of political sex scandals have been wondering whether he was shoved out the door too fast. We've certainly seen politicians survive scandals worse than trying to score a date while married. I am represented by a congressman who was censured by the House for misdeeds that included not paying his taxes while running the tax committee. I would be absolutely thrilled if the worst thing he'd done over the past few years was misrepresented his marital status on a BlackBerry.
However, it's one thing to be a would-be adulterer and another to be an incredibly stupid would-be adulterer. In his re-election campaign, Lee bragged about his work providing students with instruction on the hazards of having personal conversations on the Internet. Yet he was working under the assumption that the best way to conduct an extramarital social life is to pretend to be a different person online, while using one's real name and photograph.
Nobody wants to be represented by a person who has to be reminded of the existence of Google.
Lee comes from the suburbs of Buffalo, and this is the second time in a year that a congressman from upstate New York has had to resign because of a sex scandal. First there was Eric Massa, a Democrat who shared a townhouse with five young, low-paid male staffers and who, when questions arose about groping issues, produced the immortal explanation: ''I tickled him until he couldn't breathe.''
In between Massa and Lee, upstate New York produced the Republican candidate for governor, Carl Paladino, who spent much of the race apologizing for sending pornographic and racist e-mails, interspersed by explanations of why it took him years to tell his wife that he had fathered an out-of-wedlock daughter. His supporters are reported to be urging him to run for Lee's suddenly vacant seat.
Do you think somebody in upstate New York has disturbed the sacred cemetery of a clan of extremely cranky witch doctors? Honestly, when you've got high unemployment, terrible weather and a dwindling population, you should not be stuck with a rapidly revolving cast of horny politicians, too.
Finally, we should be pondering whether it's really such a great thing to have a new generation of legislators that puts a premium on being in good physical shape. Lee, who described himself as a ''fit fun and classy guy,'' apparently couldn't wait to ship his potential hookup a deeply incriminating shot of his well-toned body.
These people are already dangerously self-satisfied. Maybe we were better off with paunchy, aging guys who had to acknowledge, in their deepest heart, that if they were getting any sexual action at all it was only because they were on the Appropriations Committee.

HEADLINE: At Conference, G.O.P. Hopefuls Offer Criticism of All Things Obama

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY; Michael D. Shear contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A series of potential Republican presidential contenders delivered forceful and personal condemnations of President Obama on Friday, criticizing his worldview, domestic agenda and economic proposals, while imploring fractious conservatives to unite around the goal of winning back the White House.
Yet the prospective candidates barely touched on the biggest issue of the day, with the historic uprising in Egypt creating new perils for United States foreign policy. Their silence highlighted the challenges facing all Republicans as they try to prove their presidential timber. 
To an audience of more than 10,000 activists at the Conservative Action Political Conference, a half-dozen aspiring Republicans presented themselves as stark alternatives to the Obama administration. With no clear front-runner, the Republicans began to differentiate their views, but offered unsparing criticism of everything from the president's background to the first lady's organic vegetable garden.
Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts who is poised to make his second presidential bid, said Republican and independent voters should be leery of suggestions that Mr. Obama has become more of a centrist since the midterm elections. He scoffed at the president reaching out to business leaders by inviting them to the White House.
''I'm sorry, Mr. President, but that's not a policy, it's a dinner party,'' Mr. Romney said, speaking over enthusiastic applause from the conservative activists. He added, ''It's going to take more than new rhetoric to put Americans back to work -- it's going to take a new president.''
Tim Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota, drew robust applause as he questioned whether the president has presented a strong hand in representing American interests in the world. He said the United States had undermined allies like Israel and Britain, while trying to appease Iran, Russia and the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.
''Mr. President, with bullies, might makes right,'' Mr. Pawlenty said. ''Strength makes them submit. Get tough on our enemies -- not our friends.''
Senator John Thune of South Dakota, who is considering entering the race but has not done as much to prepare as some of his potential rivals, said conservatives needed to fight back against the expansion of government and become serious about trimming the budget and tackling the hot-button topic of overhauling Social Security and other entitlements. He proposed creating a new Congressional committee dedicated solely to reducing the deficit.
Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana, who has not decided whether he will pursue the presidency, took a different tack at a dinner speech on Friday. He invoked Mr. Obama's name only once as he delivered a high-altitude critique of government expansion and ineffectiveness, which he said could be turned around only by expanding the Republican Party's reach.
''The public is increasingly disgusted with a steady diet of defamation and prepared to reward those who refrain from it,'' Mr. Daniels said. ''As we ask Americans to join us on such a boldly different course, it would help if they liked us just a bit.''
The presentations on the second day of the conference amounted to a debut by the potential candidates. Newt Gingrich addressed the conference on Thursday, while Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi is scheduled to speak on Saturday. Sarah Palin declined an invitation, but when an impersonator arrived outside the hotel ballroom on Friday, it caused a momentary stir.
While the speeches carried a uniform theme of criticizing the Obama administration, the remarks began highlighting, even subtly, the differences among the Republicans. It was not only what they chose to focus on, but what they decided to omit.
Mr. Romney, for example, did not talk about the president's signature health care law, which as much as any single issue unified conservatives in opposition to Mr. Obama. Mr. Romney has struggled to explain to conservative voters a similar law that he signed in Massachusetts.
Mr. Thune pointed to the issue as an example of overreach by the Obama administration, saying, ''They jammed through Obamacare -- a two-and-a-half-trillion-dollar entitlement that we don't want and can't afford.'' Yet he did not mention that he voted for the bank bailout bill known as Troubled Asset Relief Program, a point of contention among many conservatives.
While the opening contests of the 2012 campaign are one year away, the White House and Democrats kept an eye on the proceedings Friday. Asked generally about the criticism aimed at the president, the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, seized upon Mr. Romney's health care record.
''It was a tough decision, but it was a series of the right decisions,'' Mr. Gibbs said of the health care law in Massachusetts. ''I'd be interested to see if throughout the next two years the two words 'health care' come out of his mouth.''
Representative Ron Paul of Texas received one of the most enthusiastic receptions of the day from the audience, which is comprised of many activists with libertarian views. He has not said whether he intends to run for president again, but supporters are strongly encouraging him.
He was the only speaker who addressed the topic of Egypt head-on during his remarks, saying fiscal conservatives should be troubled by $70 billion in aid that the United States has invested in ''propping up that puppet dictator.'' It was an example, he said, that a drastic change is needed in Washington.
''We don't just need to change political parties,'' Mr. Paul said. ''We need to change the philosophy of what this country is all about.''

HEADLINE: Fears of Wal-Mart Fill a Vacant Lot

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH A. HARRIS

 BODY:
It isn't much to look at, just a big empty lot packed with snow and some struggling cattail plants sandwiched between the Starrett City apartment complex and a shopping mall. But a field in the East New York section of Brooklyn has become one of the most hotly debated spots in New York City. All because it may -- possibly, one day-- be home to the city's first Wal-Mart store.
Details on Wal-Mart's plans to move into the city are scarce, but because this slice of Brooklyn has been mentioned most often, by real estate brokers and in the pages of newspapers, as a leading contender for a store, opponents have directed their fight here. 
''It's a little bit of Kabuki theater on both sides,'' said Richard Lipsky, a lobbyist for small businesses who is helping lead the campaign to keep Wal-Mart out of New York. Not having a specific site to focus on, he explained, ''makes it more difficult to hone in on an organizing strategy.''
''But in spite of that,'' Mr. Lipsky said, ''the organizing is going forward.''
Lining up against the retail giant are a wide range of people who say the expansion will hurt small businesses and their employees, including elected officials like Councilman Charles Barron, who represents East New York; the public advocate, Bill de Blasio; immigrant groups; clergy members; unions representing retail workers; and small-business owners.
Wal-Mart, however, has drawn its own group of supporters, including community leaders and members of the real estate community, who argue that a store would create jobs and provide a bigger variety of goods with lower prices in a neighborhood that could use both. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has said the company has a right to be in the city. But even many of the supporters say they do not know where the company hopes to open up shop. (Neither Wal-Mart nor the site's developer, the Related Companies, has said if they are in negotiations.)
Some of the mystery stems from Wal-Mart's real estate strategy. It is focusing on sites that require no special approval, as opposed to those that would need a green light from the City Council, which at a recent hearing made clear that it was no fan of Wal-Mart.
In East New York, all that Wal-Mart would need to do is sign a lease. A store there would become part of a huge project that has already been approved by the Council and includes several thousand units of housing and an expansion of the existing Gateway Center shopping mall.
Wal-Mart's opponents are crying foul, saying the plan approved by the Council in 2009 did not include the chain.
''It was a total bait and switch,'' said Bertha Lewis, the former chief executive of the community organizing group Acorn who is helping to organize the opposition throughout the city.
Though company representatives have revealed nothing about specific locations, they say that their strategy for urban areas across the United States focuses on neighborhoods with little access to fresh food and where unemployment runs high. And while East New York has experienced some economic improvements in recent years -- the city's Economic Development Corporation counted a gain of more than 200 businesses from 2000 to 2008 -- it is still one of New York's most distressed neighborhoods and a place where supermarkets, and their fresh fruits and vegetables, are scarce.
East New York's unemployment rate is estimated at 13.9 percent, compared with a 9.4 percent rate citywide, according to the latest data from the Fiscal Policy Institute, a nonprofit research organization.
And while neighborhood crime dropped 30 percent from 2001 to 2010 -- citywide, the figure was 35 percent -- it remains one of the most violent parts of the city, according to the Police Department. The 75th Precinct, which serves the area, recorded 33 killings last year, 9 more than the previous year.
The property being debated is on the southernmost edge of East New York, not far from the Brooklyn waterfront. Though the Belt Parkway is nearby and the site is served by public buses, it is more than a mile to the nearest subway stop and not easily accessible for most of the neighborhood.
It is also in the shadow of an existing mall, and many of Wal-Mart's supporters question why critics are so concerned about the effect Wal-Mart would have on local businesses when other chain stores, like Target and Marshalls, are there already.
Workers at some neighborhood stores are nervous all the same.
''You had to say the 'W' word?'' said Alicia Boake, a department manager at a Pathmark supermarket in East New York and a member of a union that opposes Wal-Mart.
Ms. Boake said she worried that while shoppers go to Target for certain items, they would go to Wal-Mart for just about everything else, including low-priced groceries, putting other stores out of business. ''It could mean the end of a lot of things for a lot of people,'' she said.
But some shoppers say they would welcome more options. Stacey Clement, a local resident who works at Bellevue Hospital Center, smiled broadly when asked if she would like to see a Wal-Mart in her neighborhood.
''They have everything in one place,'' Ms. Clement said, pulling her grocery cart out of the trunk of a livery cab outside of Pathmark. ''I would just go there.'' And a store promising low prices is certainly enticing for the many people who must carefully count their pennies, some local neighborhood advocates said.
''East New York is suffering,'' said Christopher Banks, the executive director of the East New York United Concerned Citizens, an antipoverty group, noting the community's jobless rate. ''And with this economy, people want to get a good bang for their buck. At the end of the day, you have to think with your pocket.''
Online Correction: February 11, 2011, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier headline with this article erroneously referred to Wal-Mart as Mart-Mart.

HEADLINE: 'Hoovervilles' Attack on Obama Offers Preview of Campaign

BYLINE: By MATT BAI

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- While every presidential aspirant who spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday blasted President Obama for his economic program, one applause line seemed to stand out.
''You've seen the heartbreaking photos and videos of the jobs fairs around the country, where thousands show up to stand in line all day just to have a chance to compete for a few job openings that probably aren't as good as the job they held two years ago,'' Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, told the crowd. ''These job fairs and unemployment lines are President Obama's Hoovervilles!''
With this, Mr. Romney previewed what will be one of the central debates of the 2012 campaign, no matter which Republican gets the nomination -- an argument not just over who can reverse the nation's economic collapse, but over who ultimately has to own it. 
Mr. Romney was echoing a popular conservative critique when he sought to haunt Mr. Obama with the specter of the 31st president. But even at a time when flawed historical analogies seem to be part of popular culture -- like Angry Birds or shirtless congressmen -- this one seems especially unconvincing. It would be hard to construct a compelling case, based on any fair reading of political and economic history, for linking Mr. Obama's term thus far to that of the most maligned president of the last century.
Herbert Hoover ran for president in 1928 during a time of what seemed like endless prosperity. The cataclysmic stock market crash of 1929, which brought on the Great Depression, happened on his watch, and conditions worsened steadily throughout his presidency. In 1931 unemployment jumped to 15.9 percent, from 8.7 percent a year earlier. It reached 23.6 percent during his final year in office, when the country's gross domestic product fell by more than 13 percent.
The ''Hoovervilles'' to which Mr. Romney referred were the squalid villages of homeless Americans that came to define the Hoover presidency in the public mind.
Contrast that with Mr. Obama, who ran for president at a time of deepening economic distress, and who hadn't yet been elected when Lehman Brothers imploded in 2008, taking the credit market with it. Politically speaking, his presidency is more analogous to that of Hoover's successor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who also swept into office with historic Democratic majorities, promising bold action to mitigate disaster.
Economically, Mr. Romney's comparison doesn't hold up especially well, either. Unemployment rose more than two percentage points during Mr. Obama's first year in office, but by the end of 2010 it had improved slightly, falling to 9.4 percent from 9.9. The gross domestic product also improved modestly last year, rising 2.9 percent.
What's really going on here, though, has little to do with economic data or cycles of history. By recasting the recession as one of Mr. Obama's making, rather than as the legacy of George W. Bush, Mr. Romney, who is as close to a front-runner as the nascent Republican field can claim, is trying to pre-emptively parry what could be a significant threat to his party in 2012.
Most Americans, after all, still think of the Bush years as somewhat ruinous. In a poll conducted by CNN and the Opinion Research Corporation last month, just 40 percent of respondents approved of Mr. Bush's performance as president. That's 13 points better than he did in a New York Times/CBS News poll in 2009, but at least 9 points lower than Mr. Obama's latest approval ratings (and a good 22 points lower than the approval rating for Mr. Bush's father).
Democrats have long contended that George W. Bush is the true Hoover of our time, another Republican president unable to foresee or address the country's abrupt economic reversal. So no matter whom Republicans nominate next year, you can expect to see Mr. Obama constantly reminding voters of where the last Republican administration led us. It's a theme that may well resonate more in a presidential campaign than it did in last year's Congressional races, when most voters seemed to be rendering a verdict on the status quo in Washington, rather than focusing on a choice between competing philosophies.
There is risk for Mr. Obama too, though, in having the Hoover debate. The more the president hammers Mr. Bush and his party for having created the mess he is trying to clean up, the more Mr. Obama might seem to be making excuses for the recession and its impact, casting blame rather than creating jobs.
Mr. Obama likes to talk about Washington as if it were a strange and exotic land that he had only just happened upon, as if the machinations of the place were somehow beyond his control.
But presidents running for re-election don't normally get the luxury of campaigning as outsiders (even if they move their headquarters to Chicago), and unless economic indicators improve sharply in the next year, the president will probably need some answer for the languid pace of the recovery that goes beyond a recitation of the nightmares he inherited.
What all this means is that one way or the other, you will probably hear a lot more historical comparisons as the campaign intensifies against a backdrop of lingering recession and stubborn unemployment. ''Mister, we could use a man like Herbert Hoover again,'' is how the old song went, and both parties are singing it now. They just can't agree on which man should have the honor.

HEADLINE: Limiting U.S. Effort to Aid Home Buyers

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM; Sewell Chan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration's much-anticipated report on redesigning the government's role in housing finance, published Friday, is not solely a proposal to dissolve the unpopular finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
It is also a more audacious call for the federal government to cut back its broadly popular, long-running campaign to help Americans own homes. The three ideas that the report outlines for replacing Fannie and Freddie all would raise the cost of mortgage loans and push homeownership beyond the reach of some families. 
That fact is already generating opposition in Congress and among groups like community banks and consumer advocates.
But administration officials said they had concluded the country could no longer afford to sustain its commitment to minting homeowners. Better to help some people rent.
Federal programs subsidized nine in 10 mortgage loans made last year. If the Obama administration succeeds, that could plummet to a mere one in 10 loans by the end of the decade.
The government ''must help to ensure that all Americans have access to quality housing that they can afford,'' the report said. ''This does not mean our goal is for all Americans to be homeowners.''
In announcing its blueprint, the administration offered a series of options for lawmakers to consider. But as a starting point its ideas pleased and surprised business interests and advocates of smaller government that have long opposed the government's presence in the mortgage market.
''I'm encouraged to see the administration included a number of reform ideas that track closely with my own,'' said Representative Scott Garrett, the New Jersey Republican who heads the subcommittee that oversees Fannie and Freddie.
Some of the White House's usual allies, meanwhile, reacted with anger. ''Gutting Fannie and Freddie is the most irresponsible housing proposal yet from this administration,'' said Representative Dennis Cardoza, a Democrat from the Central Valley in California. ''How is Joe Six-Pack ever going to be able to afford a home?''
The government built Fannie and Freddie as giant magnets to gather money for mortgage loans, part of an effort that dates to the Great Depression to foster homeownership.
The companies attract investors by promising repayment, even if borrowers default. In exchange, investors accept relatively low interest rates. That lets Fannie and Freddie provide money to mortgage lenders at relatively low cost, which lets borrowers pay relatively low interest rates.
A long line of presidents have celebrated the success of the two companies in increasing the share of American families that own their homes.
But the system works only because taxpayers ultimately are liable. In 2008, the government seized the companies. It has since spent more than $135 billion honoring their guarantees.
The Obama administration plans to put the companies out of business by gradually reducing the value of loans they can guarantee and raising the prices they charge lenders. It also plans to require larger down payments from borrowers.
The Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, said Friday at the Brookings Institution that the health of the housing market would dictate the rate of the agencies' closing. He estimated the process could take five to seven years.
''We are going to start the process of reform now, but we are going to do it responsibly and carefully so that we support the recovery and the process of repair of the housing market,'' he said in a separate statement.
If the companies disappear, investors will demand that borrowers pay higher interest rates. But there is wide-ranging disagreement about how much higher. Estimates range from less than half a percentage point to several percentage points.
Investors also may be reluctant to provide money for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, a product that has never existed without government support.
The effect on borrowers depends in part on what the government does instead.
The report sketches three options without offering specifics or picking a favorite. The administration took a similar approach to health care legislation, adopting the role of moderator as Congress worked out the particulars.
The first option would eliminate any government guarantee for middle-class mortgages.
Under the second option, the government would offer guarantees to investors mostly in times of financial distress, preserving a steady supply of loans but not reducing interest rates in good times.
The third option comes nearest to the current system. The government still would guarantee a broad range of mortgages, but only if lenders first purchased a guarantee from a private insurer. That would limit the government's exposure -- but also the effect on interest rates.
The report rejects calls from some conservatives to eliminate federal programs that guarantee mortgages for lower-income families, veterans and farmers. However, it said it would like those programs -- the largest of which is the Federal Housing Administration -- to guarantee no more than 15 percent of mortgages, down from a current level of about 30 percent.
''We do take the view that it would be fundamentally untenable for the country to adopt a model where the government plays no role,'' Mr. Geithner said.
The report, prepared by Treasury and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, also notes that policies like allowing homeowners to deduct mortgage interest payments from taxable income -- an expensive pillar of the government's housing campaign -- encourage people to invest in housing rather than other parts of the economy, and deserve to be reconsidered.
The role that federal home ownership policies played in the housing crisis, and particularly the role of Fannie and Freddie, is deeply controversial.
Some conservative scholars say that the companies fueled the crisis by financing vast numbers of unaffordable loans. A larger number of scholars say that Fannie and Freddie chased after the bad behavior of other lenders to reclaim market share, and that their acquisition of bad loans -- while saddling taxpayers with huge losses -- was not a primary cause of the crisis.
Many advocates for affordable housing say they cannot understand why the administration has concluded that those errors in judgment are more important than the long-term success of the two companies in making homeownership more affordable.
''Instead of cleaning up where Fannie and Freddie went wrong, we're eradicating a proven system that worked very well for most of its history,'' said John Taylor, president of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition. ''For those who are working their way up the economic ladder, there is going to be a narrower opportunity for them to enter homeownership.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade Deficit Expands Even as Exports Accelerate

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The United States trade deficit widened in December to its highest level in four months, the government said on Friday, and the annual trade gap expanded nearly 33 percent in 2010 as imports from China hit record levels. 
The December trade deficit grew nearly 6 percent from the previous month, to $40.6 billion, higher than a consensus estimate of Wall Street analysts. The average price for imported oil rose to its highest level since October 2008.
Overall imports of goods and services were also their highest since October 2008, in a sign that consumers and businesses were spending more as the economy picked up steam.
Exports of goods and services were the highest since July 2008, the month they hit their peak before beginning a precipitous drop caused by the global financial crisis.
In another report, consumer sentiment rose to an eight-month high in early February, helped by recent tax cuts and optimism about the labor market, but consumers were still concerned about the economy in the longer term.
That report, the latest from Thomson Reuters and the University of Michigan, said that consumers expected improvement in the economy and job market this year, but that the recovery was still anticipated to fall short. It also found that worries about inflation and its effect on wages weighed on sentiment.
Consumer confidence was helped by the recent package of tax cuts and improved personal finances.
The preliminary February reading for the overall index on consumer sentiment came in at 75.1, up from 74.2 in January.
It was the highest level since June 2010 and was roughly in line with the median forecast of 75 expected by economists polled by Reuters.
In the report on the nation's trade balance, exports to China rose to a record $10.1 billion in December and were a record $91.9 billion for the year.
But record imports from China, of $364.9 billion for the entire year, pushed the closely watched trade gap with that country to a record $273.1 billion.
Rising oil prices also helped widen the trade deficit in 2010. The average price for imported oil jumped to $74.66 a barrel, from $56.93 in 2009.
Imports of consumer goods and foods, feeds and beverages also set records in 2010.
Over all, American imports of goods and services grew 19.7 percent in 2010, to $2.33 trillion.
Exports grew 16.6 percent, to $1.83 trillion, a pace that if maintained would allow the United States to reach President Obama's goal of doubling exports by 2013.
Exports of services, industrial supplies, consumer goods and petroleum all set records.
The strong services performance pushed the United States trade surplus for services to a record $148.7 billion in 2010.

HEADLINE: When Love Outgrows Gift-Giving

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER

 BODY:
As if we needed another sign that Valentine's Day is getting awfully expensive, the coupon Web sites have now gotten into the game.
LivingSocial offered deeply discounted candy to New York City residents on Tuesday. Two days later, Groupon offered $40 worth of flowers from FTD for $20.
These group buying sites may be trying to strike decent bargains for users. But now that so many people subscribe to their e-mails, gift givers have to be playing a weird psychic game with themselves. Will he know I used a Groupon? Will she think less of me for doing so? Cut-rate romance feels somehow wrong, so plenty of people simply pay up. It's a special day, after all.
Once you head down that road, however, it's hard not to feel like a sucker, swept up in the frenzy of an occasion that might not have endured were it not for the Hallmark crowd. After all, there is something kind of pathetic about having to designate a day to be good to your mate. Still, we dutifully participate in this mass ritual of public devotion, paying extra for the prix fixe while packed elbow to elbow with others when it would be way more romantic to have a great restaurant mostly to ourselves the next night. 
It all seems wrong somehow. So I set out to prove that successful couples have gotten wise to all the fuss and spend less on gifts for one another as time passes. No such luck, alas. The data does not seem to exist. What I did discover, however, was that many of us were probably taking the wrong approach to quantifying our generosity in the first place. Long-term relationships do not survive without gifts, to be sure. But they are not the gifts you may think.
Allen M. Parkman has been married 37 years, though his parents divorced in 1944, when he was just 4 years old. Figuring out why marriages fail has driven part of his research as an economist and (now emeritus) professor of management at the University of New Mexico.
His 2004 article in the journal Economic Inquiry, ''The Importance of Gifts in Marriage,'' went a long way toward cracking the code, he says. It began by noting, as other researchers had, that unlike people in his parents' generation, those marrying more recently were seeking increases in psychological welfare in addition to material gains. To his mind, many gains come from gifts, which he defined as an offering where you incur a cost but receive no direct or immediate benefit.
That certainly encompasses all of the usual trinkets and baubles. While we don't know how total spending on these things changes over time, Thomas Bradbury, a psychology professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies marriage, noted that the grand totals were not the right metric. He suggested considering the proportion of income that people spent instead.
This makes a lot of sense. After all, there is a display of plumage that goes on during many courtships, a wooing based in part on establishing one's credentials as an exceedingly generous soul. A lot of disposable income goes toward this sort of thing. The De Beers people seized on the metric in a brilliant and insidious way, suggesting that no price was too high for an engagement ring -- simply pile up two months' worth of salary.
But this is only half the story, Mr. Parkman says. Many gifts are of the psychological and intangible sort. They range from simple empathy, affection and a catch-all category called ''understanding,'' to complex actions like sacrificing your career so your family can move to a city where a spouse or partner has a new and better job.
This is a useful construct during tough economic times. Worrying about the gift-giving ritual is a high-class problem, after all. But if you count yourselves among the working (or nonworking) class and can't afford to buy many gifts, it sure seems as if there are still plenty of gifts you can give.
Generosity on this front, however, is a harder thing to test for during courtship. And you can't just go out and buy these psychic gifts as a partnership matures, even if you make a lot more money than when you first met. So it's no wonder that failure here tends to sink lots of marriages, according to Mr. Parkman's research.
Regularly scheduled giving, then, is not necessarily a mark of successful marriages. Charlie Turpin and his wife, Jewell, of Minneapolis have been married 56 years. Mr. Turpin describes traditional gift-giving as something they have outgrown.
''It really is liberating,'' he said, noting the stress that came from needing to read one another's mind on command because of a mark on the calendar. ''Early in life, presents and occasions are important, but as you get older, you have everything you want.'' Now, he and his wife channel much of their generosity toward their family.
''We gave away a lot of money, but it wasn't tied to an occasion, and it was not required,'' he said. ''You know you are doing the right thing. It's not stressful at all.''
A gift can also be as subtle as granting implicit permission for a spouse to pursue a passion that is somewhat pricey, even if you're not a spender by nature. Bob and Mary Kuhn of Glen Mill, Pa., decided to call a halt to traditional gift-giving on state occasions at least 15 years ago. The couple, both 68, have been married for 43 years.
Ms. Kuhn laughed as she recalled her husband's radio-controlled airplane habit. ''Those things crash,'' she said. ''So that can be a gift until someone is no longer interested in that sort of hobby.''
Shelly Lundberg, an economics professor at the University of Washington who has studied bargaining within marriages, likes this example for the signals it sends. ''It shows not only that I know what you like, but that I value an aspect of you that you consider important,'' she said, say a mechanical mind or a tinkering spirit.
The other nice thing about Ms. Kuhn's offering was that there was no occasion she was observing when she made it. Ike and Mae Mosher, who have been married for 70 years, never established much of a traditional gift-giving ritual between them because they stretched their finances early on in their relationship to support his mother and sister when his father died. Ms. Mosher's sacrifices early on were her own gift to Mr. Mosher and his family.
Over time, their giving to one another became more spontaneous. ''He would give me gifts just for the sake of giving me a gift,'' said Ms. Mosher, who lives with her husband in the Classic Residence community in Chevy Chase, Md., ''not necessarily because it was a day you have to give a gift.''
This maps exactly, it turns out, to some of the findings of Terri Orbuch, a professor at the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan who leads a continuing study of married couples that dates to the mid-1980s. ''Romance and passion is all about using the elements of surprise and the elements of newness,'' she said. ''That's what couples say, and that's what I've found in the research.''
So practice random acts of generosity, whether it's with traditional gifts or more psychic ones. And if you and your better half want to partake in this national ritual of devotion, it certainly can't hurt.
But it probably isn't necessary, either. ''It is very sweet and nice when you are 20 or 25,'' said Ms. Mosher, 92. ''But we are so safe and secure in our love for each other, there is no need for that kind of thing.''

HEADLINE: Recruiting in China Pays Off for U.S. Colleges

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

 BODY:
GRINNELL, Iowa -- The glossy color brochures, each crammed with photos depicting a Chinese student's high-achieving life from birth to young adulthood, pile up in the admissions office at Grinnell College here.
''Hi Professors!'' one young woman announced in her bound booklet, sometimes known in China as a ''brag sheet,'' which included a photo of herself as a baby. She characterized her childhood as ''naive and curious,'' and described herself now as ''sincere, kind and tough.''
The brochures, though they are almost never read by admissions officers, are a sign of Grinnell's success marketing itself in China -- a plan that has paid off in important ways, like diversifying the student body and attracting students who can sometimes pay full tuition.
At rural Grinnell, nearly one of every 10 applicants being considered for the class of 2015 is from China. 
Dozens of other American colleges and universities are seeing a surge in applications (and similar brochures) from students in China, where a booming economy means that more families can pursue the dream of an American higher education.
But that success -- following a 30 percent increase last year in the number of Chinese studying in the United States -- has created a problem for admissions officers. At Grinnell, for example, how do they choose perhaps 15 students from the more than 200 applicants from China? After all, the 11-member admissions committee cannot necessarily rely on the rubrics it applies to American applications (which are challenging enough to sort through).
Consider, for example, that half of Grinnell's applicants from China this year have perfect scores of 800 on the math portion of the SAT, making the performance of one largely indistinguishable from another.
But the most accomplished applicants will have grades in the 70s or 80s, because Chinese schools tend to grade on a far less generous curve than American high schools. Few will have had the opportunity to take honors or Advanced Placement courses to demonstrate their ability to do college work, since such courses are rare in China.
Then there is the challenge of assessing an applicant's command of English, since some Chinese families have been known to hire ''agents'' to write the application essay. These are the same advisers who counsel families to spend money on the fancy brochures. ''They should save their money,'' Seth Allen, the dean of admission and financial aid at Grinnell, said as he glanced at the full-color brag sheets stacked on a nearby desk.
Mr. Allen said that few would actually be read by the overworked admissions officers as they plowed through nearly 3,000 applications over all. In fact, the next stop for the brochures, said Jonathan C. Edwards, Grinnell's coordinator of international admission, would be the recycling bin.
Mr. Allen, Mr. Edwards and their colleagues said they spend most of their time on Chinese applications trying to parse the essays -- paying particular attention, as they might with an American candidate, to whether they detect the authentic voice and sensibility.
A young woman from Shanghai, for example, who had scored 800 on the math portion of the SAT, and nearly 600 on the main verbal section, impressed Mr. Edwards with an essay that described her volunteering at a rehabilitation center, where a young autistic boy captured her heart.
''Such a hopeless boy evoked my strong feeling to help him and love him,'' she wrote. ''As time passed by, I found he was interested in hearing the special sound of the piano and was gifted in playing piano.''
The applicant was admitted to Grinnell in its early decision round last fall.
Another Chinese applicant who wrote about her community service made a less favorable impression, at least with her essay, by writing about her own hardship while helping others after the earthquake in 2008 in Sichuan Province. ''Every day, I showered and brushed my teeth using cold water,'' she wrote. ''It was unbearable.''
The admissions officers sometimes reach out to teachers and counselors at the applicants' high schools -- especially those that have emerged as ''feeders'' to Grinnell and other American colleges.
Such relationships have been further cemented during each of the last two summers, when Mr. Allen barnstormed China -- stopping in Beijing, Zhengzhou, Changsha and Shanghai -- on a recruiting tour with representatives from a handful of other liberal arts colleges, including Franklin & Marshall and Williams. (Grinnell's applications from China were down slightly this year, as were its applications over all, but still greater than they were five years ago.)
For the colleges, such tours are motivated at least partly by money.
Grinnell, for example, is ''need-blind'' when considering American students -- who are evaluated regardless of their ability to pay -- but its process for admitting international students is ''need-aware.''
So an applicant from China or another country could have an edge if he or she can pay full tuition.
And yet, in the name of socioeconomic diversity, Grinnell also has a dozen full scholarships set aside for international applicants, including those from China, who need help paying tuition.
''I realize what regional differences there are in China,'' Mr. Allen said. ''Lumping students into this amorphous Chinese applicant pool really isn't doing them justice.''
Grinnell started seeing a steady stream of Chinese applications in the early 2000s, and says it can point to strong academic accomplishments among those applicants it has accepted.
Their graduation rate has been comparable to the 1,600-member Grinnell student body over all -- about 84 percent of those who enroll graduate in four years -- and most Chinese students at Grinnell do ''very well'' in economics, math or science, the subjects in which they are most likely to major (and usually double-major), Mr. Allen said. Help with writing English papers is also available in a writers' workshop.
''Chinese students are required to devote significantly more time to their studies than American students, and this generally carries through when they come to college in the U.S.,'' he said.
Chinese applicants have also been learning about Grinnell and other American colleges and universities through a popular Chinese Web site, cuus.cn -- which stands for Chinese Undergraduates in the United States, but the letters are also meant to be shorthand for ''See You in the U.S.''
''Grinnell in My Eyes,'' an article written in Chinese and posted on the site by a recent graduate, is a big bouquet to the school; the writer pays tribute to Grinnell's flexibility (''if you don't like the current major, you may also choose independent major'') and the dining hall (''glorious French windows.'')
If there is an attribute that American and Chinese applicants share, it may be the ardor they often demonstrate toward Grinnell and the other highly selective colleges they hope will find a place for them.
''A girl from China called the other day after lunch, which was 2 or 3 in the morning for her,'' Mr. Edwards said. ''She said she was calling to make sure everything in her application was complete.''
''I had to tell her to go to bed,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Investors Are Encouraged by a Change in Egypt

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Stocks rose for a second week as Hosni Mubarak's resignation in Egypt and a jump in American consumers' confidence bolstered optimism in the global economic recovery.
Caterpillar, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America rose at least 2 percent to lead the Dow Jones industrial average higher. ConocoPhillips added 2.1 percent on plans to raise its dividend and buy back as much as $10 billion in stock. Kraft Foods dropped 1.5 percent after lowering its forecast because of rising commodity costs. An exchange-traded fund tracking Egyptian equities rallied 4.5 percent.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 7.28 points, or 0.55 percent, to 1,329.15, its highest level since June 2008. The benchmark gauge rose 1.4 percent this week. 
The Dow gained 43.97 points, or 0.36 percent, to 12,273.26. The Nasdaq rose 18.99 points, or 0.68 percent, to 2,809.44.
''As some of the uncertainty clears in Egypt, people can focus on fundamentals,'' said Peter Sorrentino, an investment manager at Huntington Asset Advisors in Cincinnati. ''We've had a fair amount of pretty good economic reports, including consumer confidence. Unfortunately, the optimism was recently disrupted by geopolitical concern. We'll see how that plays out. There's enough momentum in the U.S. economy right now.''
The S.& P. 500 has risen 5.7 percent this year as better-than-forecast economic data and company earnings raised confidence in the economic recovery. Benchmark indexes began erasing an early slide Friday after the Thomson Reuters-University of Michigan preliminary index of consumer sentiment for the month climbed to 75.1. Stocks extended gains as Mr. Mubarak bowed to the demands of protesters that have occupied central Cairo for the last three weeks demanding an end to his 30-year rule. He handed power to the nation's military.
The Market Vectors Egypt index, an exchange-traded fund that holds Egyptian shares, climbed 4.5 percent, to $18.60.
Caterpillar rose 2.9 percent, to $103.54, while JPMorgan Chase gained 2.3 percent, to $46.57, and Bank of America advanced 2 percent, to $14.77.
ConocoPhillips rose 2.1 percent, to $71.58, after it said it was increasing its quarterly dividend to 66 cents a share from 55 cents, and has authorized the repurchase of as much as $10 billion in shares.
MGIC Investment and the Radian Group led mortgage insurers higher after the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, called for limiting the role of government-backed competitors. MGIC, the nation's largest private mortgage insurer, rose 9.6 percent, to $10.05. The No. 2 insurer, Radian, surged 13 percent, to $8.03.
''The bottom line is that the market has support,'' said Joseph Keating, chief investment officer at CenterState Bank in Birmingham, Ala. ''Even if we see a pullback on global concerns, there are better measures in the U.S. The outlook for stocks comes down to earnings. The outlook for earnings comes down to the economy. There's both consumer and business confidence. That shows me the recovery is sustainable.''
Kraft dropped 1.5 percent to $30.66. The company lowered its full-year earnings forecasts because of rising commodity costs. Profit excluding certain items like integration costs is to increase 11 to 13 percent. That's down from the company's November projection of a rise in the ''mid-teens.''
Expedia fell 17 percent, to $21.31. The online travel company reported fourth-quarter earnings, excluding some items, of 32 cents a share, missing the average analyst estimate of 36 cents.
Interest rates were lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 18/32, to 99 31/32, and the yield fell to 3.63 percent, from 3.69 percent late Thursday.

HEADLINE: U.S. Treasury Takes Steps To Buy Time on Debt Limit

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- At the Treasury Department, a team of officials is trying to keep Uncle Sam a few steps ahead of the bill collectors.
With the government likely to bump up against its $14.3 trillion borrowing limit sometime between April 5 and May 31, and a difficult drama about to play out in Congress, Treasury officials are trying to buy as much time as they can to avoid a default. 
In essence, they have opened a box of tools marked ''Use Only in Case of Emergency,'' which could, in theory, push back the projected date for hitting the debt limit by as much as eight weeks, possibly into July.
They are conserving cash, declining to roll over some specialized debt or even holding off selling some securities in an effort to shave Washington's debt and increase it as little as possible. On Feb. 3, the Treasury began withdrawing cash from an account at the Federal Reserve to pay off billions of dollars in bills.
The Treasury can also trim its debt by suspending sales of special-purpose Treasury securities that state and local entities can buy. It can stop reinvesting in foreign currencies. And it can stop investments in two retirement funds for federal workers.
One thing not now on the list is a fire sale of assets like the mortgage-backed securities that the Treasury bought during the crisis.
''We have not talked about asset sales as an extraordinary measure,'' Mary J. Miller, the assistant secretary for financial markets, told reporters last week, obviously sensitive to the fact that a sell-off by the Treasury could trigger a plunge in bond prices and a spurt in interest rates. ''We think that any situation where we would be forced in an accelerated manner to liquidate assets would not be beneficial to the taxpayers.''
The debt ceiling was last raised a year ago. Three times under President George W. Bush -- in 2002, 2003 and 2004 -- the Treasury resorted to extraordinary steps before the limit was raised, according to the Congressional Research Service.
''Looking at it from a political point of view, it's kind of a game of chicken -- part of the polarization that is getting really excessive right now -- in which you get points for making the other branch dodge,'' said Kenneth W. Dam, who was deputy Treasury secretary from 2001 to 2003.

HEADLINE: Tiptoeing Out of One's Comfort Zone (and of Course, Back In)

BYLINE: By ALINA TUGEND

 BODY:
LAST week, I moved out of my comfort zone, psychologically and literally. And it didn't feel so good.
First, I spoke to a group of middle-school students about journalism. It was a day when parents were supposed to come and talk about their work and discuss why what you learned in middle school was actually important in real life.
I am fairly self-confident about talking to a roomful of adults. But 12- and 13-year-old children made me sweat. Some looked at me intently, but others stared out the window, played with their pencils or poked their neighbors. Suddenly, I was pulled back to my middle-school years, trying to entertain the ''popular'' kids. I was most uncomfortable.
A few days later, we had some workers in to paint a few rooms in the house. No big deal, I thought. Except that as more rooms were draped in drop cloths and living room furniture crowded the dining room, our entire family -- and two befuddled cats -- retreated upstairs. 
No one could find anything. Everyone was out of sorts. We were feeling decidedly uncomfortable.
Moving out of our comfort zones is supposed to be a good thing. We challenge ourselves, we grow and take on new risks. But is this always true? After all, over the last few years, many of us have been pushed out of our comfort zones, forced to seek new jobs, even careers.
First of all, I wondered, how did the term originate? In my research, I came across one theory that comfort zone was the temperature range -- about 67 to 78 degrees, depending on the season -- at which people were neither too hot nor too cold.
All right. I can't test that with snow on the ground. But if we transfer that to a psychological comfort zone, it makes sense -- it's where we're completely at home. Or as Judith M. Bardwick, author of ''Danger in the Comfort Zone'' (American Management Association, 1991), writes, ''The comfort zone is a behavioral state within which a person operates in an anxiety-neutral position.''
She cites a famous experiment conducted by the psychologists Robert M. Yerkes and John D. Dodson, way back in 1908. Using mice, they found that stimulation improved performance, up to a certain level -- what is now known as optimal anxiety. When that level is passed, and we're under too much stress, performance deteriorates.
''We need a place of productive discomfort,'' said Daniel H. Pink, author of ''Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us'' (Riverhead, 2009). ''If you're too comfortable, you're not productive. And if you're too uncomfortable, you're not productive. Like Goldilocks, we can't be too hot or too cold.''
Everyone's reaction to stress is different, of course -- your comfort zone is not mine.
The objective is to reach that optimal level so that our skills increase and we become comfortable with that new level of anxiety -- then we're in an expanded comfort zone. And ideally, we will get more used to those feelings of ''productive discomfort'' and won't be so scared to try new things in the future.
Brene Brown, a research professor at the University of Houston Graduate College of Social Work and author of ''The Gifts of Imperfection'' (Hazelden, 2010), has another definition of comfort zone: ''Where our uncertainty, scarcity and vulnerability are minimized -- where we believe we'll have access to enough love, food, talent, time, admiration. Where we feel we have some control.''
The trouble is, Ms. Brown said, ''When we get into times of social, political or financial instability, our comfort zones get smaller.'' The more afraid we are, she said, ''the more impenetrable our comfort zones buffers become.''
There was a huge shift after 9/11, she said, in just how vulnerable people were willing to be in their personal and work lives. When we feel vulnerable, she added, we often feel fear and shame.
And, ''since those are some of our most difficult emotions, we want to avoid them,'' she said.
A friend, a family man in his mid-40s who asked that he not be identified, recently took a huge stride outside his comfort zone. He quit his job as a partner at a corporate law firm -- although he will still maintain informal ties for a year -- to write a novel. He has no publisher or agent at this point. He just decided to pursue something he always wanted to do.
The interesting thing, my friend discovered, is that his leap out of his comfort zone made other people uncomfortable.
''Because it was not an expected choice, it caused people to step outside the usual assumptions,'' he said. ''It's like the Wizard of Oz drawing back a curtain -- they realize, 'If he's making an active choice, then I'm making an active choice on my part to stay. And I can choose to do something completely different myself.' ''
Ms. Brown isn't surprised by some of the reactions to my friend's choice.
''Any time we open ourselves up to vulnerability, it's a very uncomfortable mirror,'' she said.
Choosing to leave our comfort zones is hard enough. But being forced out is even more difficult. And that is happening all too frequently, with jobs and entire professions disappearing.
How do we cope with that? A. J. Schuler, a business consultant who has written about resistance to change, advised finding a core group of people -- just two or three was enough -- who would listen and understand how difficult this was.
''I call that a personal life board, like a board of directors,'' he said. ''You need to obtain prior permission to just talk.''
The advice on accepting change is pretty obvious, but difficult to carry out, he said, so ''you can get down on yourself because you see yourself as stagnant. You need people who won't get frustrated with that.''
Ms. Brown, who as part of her research interviewed a large number of men affected by the recession in 2009, agreed. ''I think the biggest mistake people make is not acknowledging fear and uncertainty.''
Second, realize that you need to give yourself time and space to mourn your loss, Mr. Schuler said.
Finally, he said, create a plan to find new opportunities regularly and keep working that plan. ''That way you take some control back in an environment that feels out of control.''
As parents, we can help our children grow into adults who feel more secure about leaving their comfort zones, Mr. Pink said, by resisting the urge to always shield them from uncertainty and discomfort. ''If we do that, they can't be productive,'' he said.
An interesting point Ms. Brown brings up is that while the term comfort zone sounds pleasant, being the complicated human beings we are, we can sometimes feel the most comfortable when we are worried or depressed.
''It's outside my comfort zone to experience joy,'' she said. ''I fear that it's inviting disaster.'' And many of us may feel that way. Ms. Brown gives the example of watching your child sleep and feeling overwhelming love -- and then quickly imagining some catastrophe befalling that child.
''It's an uncomfortable feeling imagining how much we love someone,'' she said.
We all know people who seem to feel most happy being unhappy -- always complaining or worrying about something. That's their comfort zone.
So being slightly uncomfortable, whether or not by choice, can push us to achieve goals we never thought we could. But it's important to remember that we don't need to challenge ourselves and be productive all the time. It's good to step out of our comfort zone. But it's also good to be able to go back in.

HEADLINE: As U.S. Exports Soar, It's Not All Soybeans

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy in his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
AMERICAN exports of goods rose 21 percent in 2010 to $1.28 trillion, as the world trading system shook off the effects of the financial crisis, according to figures released on Friday. 
It was the sharpest rise in American exports since 1988, and it enabled the United States to pass Germany and again become the world's second-largest exporter, behind China. The margin between the United States and Germany was only $16 million, a difference of just 1.2 percent, and could vanish as preliminary figures are revised.
But assuming the difference holds, it was the first time since 2002 that United States exports exceeded those of Germany when both were measured in dollars. A major reason for that was the weakness of the euro during the year as Europe was forced to bail out first Greece and then Ireland. Germany's exports rose 18 percent when measured in euros, but just 13 percent in dollars.
Both countries fell further behind China, whose export volume rose 31 percent, to $1.58 trillion.
The increase in American exports came as manufacturing employment in the United States rose by 0.9 percent in 2010, the first annual increase since 1997. But the level of exports remained slightly below the amount recorded in 2008, before the financial crisis took hold.
The accompanying charts show the trends over the last decade in overall exports and within the manufacturing sector, whose importance has slipped but which still provided 74 percent of the country's exports in 2010.
The sharpest decline in exports came in the category of computers and electronic products. In 2000, that sector accounted for a quarter of all manufactured exports. By 2010, its share was barely more than one-eighth.
To some extent that may reflect the decline in prices for computers. Since the figures are in current dollars, a constant volume would show up as a decline in prices. But it also probably reflects a trend toward moving computer assembly operations overseas, particularly to China.
Exports of chemical products rose particularly rapidly during the decade. In the charts, the chemical products are combined with products based on petroleum, coal, plastics and rubber. That sector's exports rose at a compound annual rate of 9.5 percent during the decade.
The textile industry has been in decline for decades, but exports of fabric and clothing still amounted to $15.9 billion in 2010.
The export of agricultural products, including fish and lumber, rose 18 percent during the year to $65.7 billion. Exports of processed food, beverages and cigarettes, which are included in the manufacturing industry, were up 17 percent to $56.2 billion.
The figures belie a popular image of the United States as no longer making products, and being largely dependent on food exports. The total of agriculture-related exports in 2010, $122 billion, is less than the value of exports of either chemical or transportation products.

HEADLINE: Galloping Growth, and Hunger

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
BAMNOD, India -- The 50-year-old farmer knew from experience that his onion crop was doomed when torrential rains pounded his fields throughout September, a month when the Indian monsoon normally peters out.
For lack of modern agricultural systems in this part of rural India, his land does not have adequate drainage trenches, and he has no safe, dry place to store onions. The farmer, Arun Namder Talele, said he lost 70 percent of his onion crop on his five-acre farm here, about 70 miles north of the western city of Aurangabad.
''There are no limits to my losses,'' Mr. Talele said.
Mr. Talele's misfortune, and that of many other farmers here, is a grim reminder of a persistent fact: India, despite its ambitions as an emerging economic giant, still struggles to feed its 1.1 billion people. 
Four decades after the Green Revolution seemed to be solving India's food problems, nearly half of Indian children age 5 or younger are malnourished. And soaring food prices, a problem around the world, are especially acute in India.
Globally, floods in Australia and drought in China have helped send food prices everywhere soaring -- on fears the world will see a repeat of shortages in 2007 and 2008 that caused food riots in some poor countries, including Egypt.
While India's agricultural problems are part of this bigger global puzzle, in many ways India's food challenges are more entrenched and systemic than those faced elsewhere.
Western investors may take eager note of India's economic growth rate of nearly 9 percent a year. But that statistic rings hollow in India's vast rural areas. Agriculture employs more than half the population, but it accounts for only 15 percent of the economy -- and it has grown an average of only about 3 percent in recent years.
Critics say Indian policy makers have failed to follow up on the country's investments in agricultural technology of the 1960s and '70s, as they focused on more glamorous, urban industries like information technology, financial services and construction.
There is no agribusiness of the type known in the United States, with highly mechanized farms growing thousands of acres of food crops, because Indian laws and customs bar corporations from farming land directly for food crops. The laws also make it difficult to assemble large land holdings.
Yet even as India's farming still depends on manual labor and the age-old vicissitudes of nature, demand for food has continued to rise -- because of a growing population and rising incomes, especially in the middle and upper classes. As a result, India is importing ever greater amounts of some staples like beans and lentils (up 157 percent from 2004 to 2009) and cooking oil (up 68 percent in the same period).
Food prices are rising faster in India than in almost any other major economy -- and faster than they did during the 2007-8 surge.
In December 2010, India's food prices jumped 13.7 from the year earlier, while inflation for all commodities, heavily weighted by the food number, stood at 8.4 percent.
A snapshot number released in mid-January showed Indian food prices rising even faster -- more than 17 percent over the same period in 2009 -- as the cost of onions, fruit, eggs, milk and other commodities rose.
Food inflation hits especially hard here because Indians -- most of whom live on less than $2 a day -- spend a bigger portion of their disposable incomes on food than people in other big, developing economies like China and Brazil.
''This is the worst form of taxation on the poorest of the poor,'' said Ashok Gulati, Asia director for the International Food Policy Research Institute.
Indian government officials have scrambled to make up the shortage of vegetables like onions by importing them. These short-term efforts have helped; onions are now available at 20 rupees a kilo (about 20 cents a pound) in Mumbai, down more than 70 percent from their recent highs.
But experts say the widening gap between agriculture's anemic supply and the rising demand for food calls for fundamental changes in farming policies.
During the Green Revolution the government invested heavily in rural agriculture, with an emphasis on hybrid seeds, fertilizers and irrigation canals.
More recent policy makers have not built on that early success. Most Indian farmers still do not have irrigation systems, and waste and inefficiency have severely depleted precious ground water.
Although many farmers have access to free or subsidized electricity that can be used to pump water, few receive power for more than a few hours a day. Mr. Talele, the farmer in Bamnod, gets only four hours of electricity during the day and four hours at night. During those periods he pumps well water that he then floods into his fields because he cannot afford the sprinklers or drip irrigation that would more efficiently and effectively water his crops.
And rural India has far too few temperature-controlled warehouses that could help farmers and the nation build up reserves as a hedge against poor growing seasons.
When Mr. Talele's vegetables are ready for harvest he immediately takes them to wholesale markets, which are controlled by committees of local traders. ''Whatever the market decides, that's the price we get,'' he said.
Indian officials acknowledge that the country needs to increase investment in irrigation, encourage competition in wholesale and retail markets, and provide targeted food subsidies to the poor. And they also have to provide more education and jobs to villagers, so fewer people are forced to live off the land.
Experts say India needs to make changes like some of the ones China made, beginning in the late 1970s, when it started investing heavily in agriculture and eased regulations on farming.
As recently as 1977, Chinese and Indian farmers harvested roughly the same amount of wheat for each acre that they planted. But by 2009, United Nations data shows that wheat yields were 1.7 times higher in China than in India.
Kaushik Basu, a Cornell University professor who is also the chief economic adviser to India's finance minister, says he now sees more willingness by Indian officials to reform agriculture policies.
But outside experts like Mr. Gulati are skeptical that real change will come from the government. The ruling coalition has been hobbled by corruption scandals, and an energized opposition last year effectively blocked proceedings in Parliament.
Some Indian farmers are investing on their own, finding ways to circumvent the government when necessary and using subsidies when they are available.
About 10 miles from Mr. Talele's farm in the village of Pahur, Sandeep Ram Karshanbakr's farming income has jumped to 200,000 rupees ($4,400) a year, from 80,000 rupees ($1,800) three years ago. He credits the improvement to a drip irrigation system he bought from an Indian company, Jain Irrigation.
The government paid half the 128,000 rupees ($2,800) cost of the system. That has cut the amount of water and electricity Mr. Karshanbakr uses by about half on his three acres, while improving yields twofold to fivefold on his crops of chilis, cauliflower, eggplants, tomatoes and cotton.
Mr. Karshanbakr says he is now considering buying or leasing more land. But many farmers, like Mr. Talele, say they simply cannot afford such irrigation equipment -- even with government subsidies as high as 50 percent of the sticker price. ''It's still too expensive,'' he said.
Anil Jain, managing director at Jain Irrigation, said India needs to help farmers like Mr. Talele invest. ''Agriculture can grow at 6 to 8 percent,'' he said. ''But we have to create opportunity and income in rural areas.''

While the field did contain coriander, the plants shown in the foreground were another leaf vegetable -- not coriander, which was planted between the rows and not visible. (A plant being tossed in the air by a worker was coriander.)

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Accuses 3 Former IndyMac Executives of Fraud

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS and SUSANNE CRAIG

 BODY:
8:36 p.m. Updated
The Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday accused three former top IndyMac executives of fraud, saying they painted a rosy picture of the California lender's health even as it was collapsing in 2008.
By announcing civil fraud charges against senior executives of what was once one of the country's largest mortgage lenders, the S.E.C. has injected new life into its investigations into the financial crisis. The IndyMac charges are shaping up to be among the agency's biggest cases stemming from the crisis. 
''Truthful and accurate disclosure to investors is particularly critical during a time of crisis, and the federal securities laws do not become optional when the news is negative,'' Lorin L. Reisner, the S.E.C.'s deputy director of enforcement, said in a statement.
IndyMac's former chief executive and two former chief financial officers are accused of filing ''false and misleading'' documents with regulators. The executives, the S.E.C. said, led shareholders to believe that the bank could rebound from months of hefty losses, causing its shareholders to be defrauded in July 2008, when IndyMac's stock price plummeted and the bank shut its doors. IndyMac's failure sent shock waves through Wall Street. At the time, it was the second-largest bank failure in United States history.
S. Blair Abernathy, one of the bank's chief financial officers, settled with the S.E.C. without admitting or denying any wrongdoing. He agreed to pay a $100,000 penalty and forfeit $25,000 in earnings. Mr. Abernathy replaced A. Scott Keys as chief financial officer in April 2008.
Mr. Keys and the former chief executive, Michael W. Perry, are fighting the charges.
''The allegations are extraordinarily flimsy,'' said Mr. Keys's lawyer, Gregory S. Bruch, a partner at Willkie Farr & Gallagher. ''He didn't defraud anybody.''
Jean Veta, a partner at Covington & Burling who is representing Mr. Perry, said her client invested millions of dollars of his own money in IndyMac stock, thinking the company would survive.
''The S.E.C.'s case makes no sense,'' Ms. Veta said, adding that it is ''completely meritless.'' The case, she said, ''represents the worst kind of Monday-morning quarterbacking of business decisions. Mr. Perry did nothing wrong, and he looks forward to proving it in court.''
After suffering losses on souring loans, IndyMac, based in Pasadena, Calif., closed branches and laid off employees in 2008. The bank had specialized in offering so-called Alt-A loans, a risky type of mortgage given to borrowers who decline to prove their incomes or net worth.
The bank drew scrutiny from Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, who said in June 2008 that IndyMac could collapse. After the senator's comments, customers rushed to pull out millions of dollars in deposits.
Shortly thereafter, regulators seized IndyMac. A group of private investors later reopened the bank under the name OneWest.
''As we said at the time, the leaders of IndyMac played fast and loose with their lending practices, hurting both their shareholders and accountholders,'' Mr. Schumer said on Friday. ''Justice is finally getting done.''
The S.E.C.'s case centers on supposed ''material omissions and misstatements'' in IndyMac's regulatory filings. It does not scrutinize its lending.
The S.E.C.'s complaint, filed in the United States District Court in Los Angeles, accused the three former executives of failing to notify investors of IndyMac's failing health as the bank readied a sale of $100 million in new stock. The executives should have known that the bank was suffering, the S.E.C. said in its complaint, because they ''regularly received updated forecasts'' about its deteriorating capital and liquidity.
In its annual report for 2007, IndyMac had acknowledged that it had a ''terrible'' year, having lost $615 million. But according to the S.E.C.'s complaint, the bank also ''assured investors that IndyMac had finished the fourth quarter in a ''solid overall financial position'' and had a ''game plan'' that gave it a ''realistic shot'' at a profit in 2008.
The case comes after the S.E.C has been criticized by lawmakers and others for filing only a handful of crisis-related charges. In its most prominent case, Angelo Mozilo, the founder of Countrywide Financial, another troubled lender, agreed to pay $22.5 million last year to settle S.E.C. charges that he misled investors.
But the S.E.C. has sued no senior executive at Lehman Brothers, the American International Group or Bear Stearns. Nor has the Justice Department brought any charges against a major financial executive.
In 2008, federal prosecutors subpoenaed several Wall Street firms seeking information about whether their analysts had been misled by Lehman about its financial health, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
Specifically, prosecutors have asked questions about certain statements Lehman executives made in June 2008, when it sought to raise capital to bolster its balance sheet, and its final days, when it assured analysts that it did not need new capital.
According to news reports, a federal grand jury in 2008 was investigating potential wrongdoing at IndyMac. No charges were ever filed.

HEADLINE: Both Sides Are Braced For Debt-Limit Debate

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With a showdown approaching over the need to raise the federal debt limit, White House officials feel they have the upper hand over Congressional Republicans who want to use the debate on the measure to force deep spending cuts, people familiar with the administration's thinking say.
While Republican leaders say they hope to avoid a market-shaking crisis, many conservatives in the party are insisting on using the issue as leverage to extract big if unspecified concessions from President Obama, leaving Wall Street concerned and even some Democrats wondering if the White House is in for a more dangerous fight than it anticipates.
If Congress does not act to increase the Treasury Department's legal borrowing limit, which could be reached as soon as the first week of April, the government would face problems refinancing its debt and raising money for its operations, and, at worst, would risk default. 
Some Democrats say the White House's hopes of getting Congress to approve a ''clean'' increase in the government's borrowing authority -- without any additional measures to cut the budget deficit -- are unrealistic with the House in Republican hands. Republican leaders' ability to rein in their members, however, is in question after the past week, which saw turmoil within the party over issues like a Tea Party-backed demand for deeper spending cuts this year.
Further complicating the outlook, a small group of senators from both parties is mobilizing to step into any impasse to try to compel two-party talks for a long-term deficit reduction plan like the one recommended in December by a bipartisan majority of Mr. Obama's fiscal commission.
''The crux of the issue is whether there will or won't be a clean debt-limit bill, and that's going to be difficult,'' said Roger Altman, an investment banker and former Treasury deputy in the Clinton administration.
Soon, Mr. Altman added, ''this will be the central focus in Washington, and that of course may spill over into the business community and the financial community.''
Given the fiscal, financial and political stakes in a still-weak economy, the coming confrontation is more widely anticipated than the release on Monday of Mr. Obama's budget for the 2012 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, 2011.
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner has notified Congress that sometime from April 5 to May 31, the government will exceed what it can now legally borrow to cover obligations ranging from Social Security benefits and war expenses to interest payments for Chinese creditors. Treasury can extend the deadline several weeks through ''extraordinary measures,'' he wrote Congressional leaders, but even a short-term default ''would have catastrophic economic consequences.''
In Washington on Wednesday, Mr. Geithner sounded optimistic, saying markets should understand that ''Congress will act as it always has to make sure we meet those obligations.''
''There's always a little political theater around this,'' he added.
The situation presents a particular challenge to Speaker John A. Boehner, who has to navigate between the insistent demands of his Tea Party-backed members and the responsibility that comes with power. Although partisan brinkmanship over the issue has occurred in the past, Congresses under the control of both parties have always agreed to debt-limit increases to avoid undercutting the creditworthiness of the United States government and thereby igniting a crisis in the global markets.
''I hope they aren't sleeping at night, because we really are playing with fire,'' said Robert D. Reischauer, president of the Urban Institute, a Washington-based research group, and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, speaking of both parties.
The administration has left it to Congress to decide how much to raise the limit. The level will determine how soon the ceiling would need to be lifted again. There is much speculation that Republicans could force a series of short-term extensions to keep pressure on the White House to give ground.
Exactly what House Republicans want is unclear. They are split over how much and specifically what to cut from so-called discretionary spending for nonsecurity programs, which make up just over one-tenth of the federal budget. (Most of the rest covers the military, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and interest on the debt.)
''We want to bank real spending cuts and spending controls going forward,'' said Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, chairman of the House Budget Committee. ''Exactly how you do that -- and there's a lot of different ways of doing that -- is going to be in the details of negotiations.''
Yet any compromise is likely to upset many Tea Party activists and the scores of Republican lawmakers they helped elect in November. ''We're telling them not to raise the debt limit,'' said Mark Meckler, the co-founder and national coordinator for the Tea Party Patriots. ''When your credit card is maxed out, you don't go to the credit-card company and say, 'Hey, if you would just give us more debt, it would be O.K.' ''
Further constricting House leaders' room to maneuver are calls from Republican presidential aspirants not to raise the debt limit, or to force the Treasury Department to delay until Mr. Obama concedes to Republican demands -- admonitions that harden conservative lawmakers' opposition.
Democrats say the White House believes it is well positioned for the debate, at least initially, because of the Republican fissures, polls suggesting the unpopularity of domestic cuts that would be required, and, not least, the House Republicans' shared responsibility for governing. But polls also show that Americans have a dim view of Mr. Obama's overall handling of the deficit and the economy.
The White House will try to enlist Republican luminaries to echo its call for a clean bill given the economic dangers of political brinkmanship, officials say. Unbidden, the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, implored Congress in a recent speech not to use the debt limit as a ''bargaining chip.''
Such pleas are expected to go unheeded.
By all accounts, Mr. Boehner could not pass a clean bill if he wanted to. Yet anything he adds to secure Republican votes is expected to cost support from Democrats, already eager to vote no to force Republicans to take responsibility for passing a bill.
Whatever the House does attach to a debt limit is expected to hit a wall in the Senate, where Democrats retain a narrow majority. But Senate Democrats are also split on how to handle a debt- limit bill; their differences were aired at a party retreat this week.
Most, including the majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, favor a clean measure. But a faction of mostly moderate Democrats wants some bipartisan commitment to negotiate a multiyear deficit reduction plan, and has been meeting with a few Senate Republicans to plan their strategy.
''I don't agree with the approach the House is taking, but I think it's important that we show progress'' against the deficit, said Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia. ''Let's take the year's worth of work that was the president's deficit commission. Let's use that as a starting point.''
Besides Mr. Warner, the group includes Senator Saxby Chambliss, Republican of Georgia, and four senators who were on the fiscal commission -- the Democrats Kent Conrad of North Dakota, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, and Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Democrat in the Senate, and the Republicans Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and Michael D. Crapo of Idaho.
Even if the Senate approved some step toward budget talks as a condition for increasing the debt limit, House Republicans would most likely balk, people in both parties say. All three House leaders who were on the fiscal commission, including Mr. Ryan, opposed the recommendations made in the majority report, saying they would not cut health spending enough and would force tax increases.
However the debt debate unfolds, Republicans are sure to turn Mr. Obama's own words against him. As a senator in 2006, with Republicans controlling the White House and Congress, Mr. Obama voted against the Bush administration's request to raise the debt limit. It passed with Republican votes only, 52 to 48.
''The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure,'' Mr. Obama said then. He added, ''Leadership means that the buck stops here.''

HEADLINE: Obama Hails Outcome in Egypt, but Sets Out Benchmarks for the Military

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama heaped praise on the peaceful protesters who deposed Hosni Mubarak on Friday, declaring, ''Egypt will never be the same,'' even as his national security team acknowledged that the swift uprising would almost certainly upend American strategy in the Middle East.
Standing in the foyer of the White House, where just a week before he had started to press Mr. Mubarak for immediate reforms without calling for his resignation, Mr. Obama described the Egyptian uprising as a model of nonviolence and moral force ''that bent the arc of history.'' While comparing the 18-day protests to Gandhi's peaceful resistance to British rule, the fall of the Berlin Wall and the student protests that brought down a dictator in Indonesia, he also set out a series of benchmarks that he said he expected the Egyptian military to follow, warning that ''nothing less than genuine democracy will carry the day.''
''That means protecting the rights of Egypt's citizens, lifting the emergency law, revising the Constitution and other laws to make this change irreversible, and laying out a clear path to elections that are fair and free,'' he said. ''Above all, this transition must bring all of Egypt's voices to the table.'' 
Mr. Obama's tone was optimistic, and he promised the crowd in Cairo's Tahrir Square -- which was listening to his brief broadcast live via Egyptian state television -- continued American support for Egypt. That support, however, is likely to take new forms: Administration officials agreed that the $250 million in economic aid was a pittance compared with the $1.3 billion in annual military aid, and the White House and the State Department were already discussing setting aside new funds to bolster the rise of secular political parties. Under Egypt's current Constitution, alternatives to Mr. Mubarak's National Democratic Party are all but banned.
In his remarks, Mr. Obama promised ''whatever assistance is necessary'' to pursue a ''credible transition to a democracy.''
But as he spoke, White House officials were assessing the longer-term impact of street revolutions that have deposed two dictators in less than a month, starting with the ouster of Tunisia's leader, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali. Middle East leaders from Saudi Arabia to Jordan to Yemen have moved to pre-empt similar uprisings.
In Israel and Saudi Arabia, both of which depended heavily on Mr. Mubarak, officials were blistering in their criticism of Washington, arguing that the United States abandoned a long-time ally without first building in guarantees that Egypt's revolution could not be hijacked by religious extremists.
In his final press briefing at the White House on Friday, Robert Gibbs, Mr. Obama's press secretary, told reporters, ''I think it's important that the next government of Egypt, as we've said in here many times, recognize the accords that have been signed with the government of Israel.'' But other officials have acknowledged privately that if Egypt turns into a noisy democracy that includes the Muslim Brotherhood, there will undoubtedly be political debate in Egypt about whether the 1979 peace accord with Israel should remain in force.
''We don't think that there is any real chance the Egyptian military would have any interest in seeing the peace accord walked back,'' one of Mr. Obama's senior aides said this week. ''But it's a warning we must issue.''
The Saudis, like Mr. Mubarak himself, portrayed the uprising as the creation of ''foreign powers,'' which was widely interpreted as code words for Washington and other Western powers.
''We are astonished however at what we see as interference in the internal affairs of Egypt by some countries,'' Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, said Thursday, as Mr. Mubarak was still clinging to power. In an unusually direct shot at the White House, he said, ''We are shocked to see that there are countries pre-empting even the will of the Egyptian people,'' never addressing the fact that the protests in Egypt seemed both widespread and homegrown.
While there are few signs yet of protests gathering steam in Saudi Arabia, the government there has taken steps to raise wages and try to keep the contagion from spreading across its own desert.
Yemen and Syria, according to an analysis circulating in the White House, could be more vulnerable. But even as administration officials worried about how the protests could spread, they seemed to be all but inviting it in Iran.
White House officials were clearly relishing the discomfort the uprising has created for Iran's leaders.
On Friday, White House officials noted that the Iranians, who initially greeted the protests in Egypt because they were aimed at a secular leader who had helped isolate Tehran, had changed their minds. They were blocking broadcasts by the BBC, and putting some opposition leaders under house arrest.
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. all but urged Iranians to go out onto Tehran's streets, in a repeat of the June 2009 demonstrations: ''I say to our Iranian friends, Let your people march. Let your people speak. Release your people from jail. Let them have a voice.''
Just a week ago, trying to coax Mr. Mubarak to transfer his powers or leave office, Mr. Obama called the Egyptian leader a ''patriot'' who cared deeply about his country. On Friday, after Mr. Mubarak slipped out of Cairo, Mr. Obama mentioned him only once.
Instead, he focused his comments on the young people in the streets, and a military that ''would not fire bullets'' into the crowds that gathered in Tahrir Square, also known as Liberation Square. He struck a decidedly optimistic tone about Egypt's future, repeating lines from his own presidential campaign in 2008, saying that Egyptians could now create a government that ''represented their hopes and not their fears.''
Even some outsiders who have been critical of the administration's mixed messages during the Egyptian crisis -- from its early declarations to Egypt as ''stable'' to its wavering on whether reform could happen with Mr. Mubarak still in office -- said Mr. Obama struck the right tone on Friday. ''He has done better than his government has done,'' said Robert Kagan, a conservative scholar and essayist at the Brookings Institution.
But there are widespread concerns in Washington about the weeks ahead, starting with the worry that once Tahrir Square clears, the military might try to recreate a state it would dominate. ''It is going to be critical to make sure the military remains true to the transition,'' Senator John Kerry, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations committee, said in an interview. ''If that is secured quickly, then I believe the process can flow quite smoothly.''
Mr. Kagan said he thought the risks were relatively small.
''Once the military decided they were not going to kill people in the streets, I don't know what leverage they have. If they tried to re-establish the military dictatorship that Egypt has had for years, it would be pretty difficult.''

HEADLINE: Adam Smith, Marriage Counselor

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON. 
Jenny Anderson's book, ''Spousonomics,'' written with Paula Szuchman, was just published by Random House.

 BODY:
WHEN my husband offered this one up -- ''I'm sorry I didn't finish Ella's preschool applications'' -- as we slogged through traffic somewhere between Exits 7 and 8 of the New Jersey Turnpike, I didn't miss a beat. ''Seriously?'' I said. ''I asked you to do that a month ago.''
Then, and I'm not proud of this, I proceeded to up the ante from specific misdemeanor to global offenses. Why couldn't he be better organized, listen more, learn to multitask and -- getting back to local issues again -- finally build those shelves for the children's toys so we wouldn't risk catastrophic injury every time we tried to walk across the living room at night to go to the bathroom?
My outburst was met with a long pause. When the silence had settled over our car, my husband said, quietly, ''Perhaps when someone apologizes to you, you should accept the apology rather than document the transgressions.'' 
And then: ''Didn't you write a chapter on that?''
Touche. I had just spent two years writing a book about how to have a better marriage. One secret, my co-author and I concluded, was to think like an economist: apply the rational laws of Adam Smith, as well as recent findings about why we do some of the weird things we do -- mining the field of behavioral economics -- to increase marital happiness.
Not two weeks earlier I'd written an entire chapter on incentives, exploring which ones worked when trying to motivate a spouse to, say, finish preschool applications, and which ones didn't. Nagging (as I had written myself): inevitably a bad incentive. Trust, praise, a gentle tone of voice: far more useful.
It was hardly the first time there was a chasm between my (rational) research and my (often irrational) married life.
Listening to experts discuss the corrosive effects contempt can have on a spouse, I would instantly replay the hideous tone I employed, that very morning, when I asked my husband whether he actually knew how to hang up a towel. Snippets of advice from a weekend spent with John Gottman, the marriage guru who says he can predict whether a couple will divorce by watching them for five minutes, replayed in my mind like bad '80s music (''less sarcasm, more humor''; ''less complaining, more complimenting'').
But there were also perks to life in the marriage lab. As I dug through piles of economic texts and interviewed hundreds of men and women about the thorniest issues they faced in their marriages, I started acquiring tools to help me through everyday conflicts.
Both Paula Szuchman, my co-author, and I were newly married and sought answers to confounding questions like, What was the perfect balance of individual pursuits and joint undertakings (or, the optimal allocation of resources in our marriages)? We hit on economics because a touchy-feely approach wasn't our style. I was a reporter who had covered finance for more than a decade and was more comfortable talking to Timothy Geithner about derivatives than I was about keeping a ''feelings journal.'' Paula, a Wall Street Journal editor, was immersed every day in financial news.
No sooner had we started interviewing couples, polling strangers and diving into the research than our marriages became petri dishes for testing our theories (or having them tested on us).
Week No. 8 of writing, week No. 2 of my first daughter's life: My husband promises he'll be home at 7 p.m. He walks in at 9. I combust. Why can't he ever be on time, I ask in an acid-laced tone (a tone I would never use with a friend or colleague). Lehman Brothers has collapsed, he responds (he's also an editor at The Wall Street Journal).
Did I accept that as a reasonable explanation? No, I did not. I kept fighting, despite knowing that I was wrong. About inadequate heating. And light bulbs. And breast-feeding, a topic surely he should know lots about.
At the time, I was knee-deep in research about a concept called loss aversion. Economists have documented this phenomenon: in a nutshell, we have to win $200 to make up for the pain of losing $100. And this fear makes us behave irrationally, like betting more money when we're already losing it hand over fist. Or entering a bidding war for an early 20th-century American flag that we will tuck away in the attic just because we don't want to lose to the guy in the back with the bad khakis. Or escalating a fight with a spouse when we sort of know we've already lost.
My husband, who had been reading my manuscript, suggested that the next time I wanted to get all Lucy Ricardo on him, I try sleeping on it instead. '''Go to bed angry' is the phrase I think you use in the book,'' he said. Of course, he had a point. A few nights later, when I was agitated about some unpaid bills, I forced myself to swallow the anger and go to sleep. I woke up thinking about coffee. The bills got paid.
Paula, meanwhile, was living in a petri dish of her own. Known for an impressive ability to talk, she sometimes lamented that her husband, Nivi, tuned her out. One day we were on the phone when she started complaining.
''So Nivi and I were trying to figure out who would walk the dog, but I also needed to sort out what we were going to do about child care'' -- she was going back to work after maternity leave -- ''and there's also the issue of picking which week we go on vacation, but he can't take his eyes off the Yankee game.''
Not long after, we were sitting in a San Francisco bungalow interviewing a group of women. One told a similar story. It was like the laws of the firmament, she said. The more she talked, the less her husband listened.
Paula framed the problem as an economic one. ''Think about it: too much information can paralyze us. There's even a name for it: it's called high information processing costs.'' Blank stares abounded. ''It's like when you're in the cereal aisle at the grocery store,'' she went on. ''The choices are overwhelming. You stare at 14 variations of corn-type flakes, and it's too much. But let's say you only had two choices: Weetabix and Frosted Flakes. You would grab the flakes and check out.''
''Paula's working on that in her marriage, too,'' I said.
The work did pay off. Case in point: I used to take the fairness temperature of my relationship every day. Were we splitting the chores? Were our careers progressing equitably or was I being shortchanged because I relieved the nanny more? If I picked up his socks today, would he expect me to pick them up forever?
I don't do that anymore. Economics says overweighting fairness can lead to inefficient outcomes. Which sounded as unromantic as it did anti-everything we achieved in the sexual revolution.
But then I started hearing stories like this one: Two high-powered lawyers were considering divorce after five years of marriage. They had two children, and she had done nearly all the work of feeding, clothing and generally preventing catastrophe from befalling them since birth. She was fed up.
''He didn't really 'get' toddlers or seem to want to try,'' she told me. But they did not divorce. And as the children grow older, her husband is somehow in his element: he spends days on end playing catch with the boys, obsessing over science projects and jetting around to all manner of sporting events. Stuff she hates. ''Over a lifetime, the fairness temperature fluctuates,'' she said.
Economics might not be romantic. But using economics to understand your partner and anticipate his or her needs? That's another story.
Take game theory, the study of strategizing and negotiation. If my husband tries to anticipate my reaction to something (say, his travel for business, leaving me with small and sick children for a week) and takes my reaction into account when thinking about how to present the idea, he will get a better outcome for both of us. (He makes the trip, he acknowledges how hard it will be for me, and we have a serious discussion about how I need solo travel time, too.) In my book, that's pretty romantic.

HEADLINE: The Closing of the American Erotic

BYLINE: By MANOHLA DARGIS

 BODY:
Lenny Bruce used to ask why it was obscene to show sex in American movies but not violence. Fifty years later, our screens remain washed in red, with severed if not necessarily naked body parts. More than half of the mostly American titles that received R ratings last year contained some kind of violence (as in strong, bloody and ''grisly bloody violence and torture'') while only a third had sexual content. No NC-17 ratings were handed out, which bar youngsters, the viewers the studios most lust after.
One film did receive an NC-17 last year, if only fleetingly: ''Blue Valentine,'' a bruising independent drama about a marriage that goes south starring Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams. The scarlet letters were for what was vaguely described as ''explicit sexual content,'' words interpreted to mean that the ratings board had freaked out at the realism or perhaps intimacy of the sex, including an instance of oral sex and another scene in which the unhappy couple make uncomfortable, crushingly sad love. The movie's combative distributor, Harvey Weinstein, successfully appealed the NC-17, and the rating was changed, without cuts, to an R (for its ''strong graphic sexual content, language and a beating.'') 
When I saw the original version of ''Blue Valentine'' at the Sundance Film Festival last year (the film was subsequently trimmed before it was rated), I wasn't shocked by the sex -- after all, it's about two lovely young people who can't keep their hands off each other -- but I was startled. American characters -- heterosexuals! -- were having sex in a movie. Even at this pre-eminent independent festival, American filmmakers shy away from sex, especially the hot, sweaty kind. The old production code might have crumbled in the 1960s and couples can now share a bed, but the demure fade to black and the prudish pan -- coitus interruptus via a crackling fire and underwear strewn across the floor -- endures.
The recent deaths of the actresses Lena Nyman and Maria Schneider were poignant, useful reminders that there was a time when Americans used to troop in droves to go watch serious or serious-enough movies, domestic and imported, in which sex mattered as much if not more than violence. Ms. Nyman, a theater student turned screen siren, starred in the notorious 1969 Swedish film ''I Am Curious (Yellow)'' and its less popular sequel released three years later, ''I Am Curious (Blue).'' Ms. Schneider remains best known for holding her own, sometimes naked, against a more coy Marlon Brando in ''Last Tango in Paris,'' the Bernardo Bertolucci landmark (and French-Italian coproduction) that forced audiences to regard butter in a new light much as Hitchcock's ''Psycho'' had forced them to reconsider the shower.
After being banned and then cleared, ''I Am Curious (Yellow)'' opened to long lines and blockbuster business, reaping $5 million in six months. (Adjusted for inflation, that figure translates roughly into $35 million in today's dollars.) The critics, professional and otherwise, staked out their turf: Writing for the defense in The New York Times, Vincent Canby called it a ''wise, serious, sometimes deadpannedly funny movie about the politics of life.'' Opposed, Rex Reed fumed that ''this genuinely vile and disgusting Swedish meatball is pseudo-pornography at its ugliest and least titillating.'' Norman Mailer said it was ''one of the most important pictures I have ever seen in my life.'' Judith Crist just found it ''pretentious.''
''I Am Curious (Yellow),'' about a young woman (Ms. Nyman) investigating Swedish social and political mores, sometimes by pushing boundaries and making love al fresco, wasn't the first sexually explicit movie to shake up American screens. In the 1950s and into the 1960s foreign-language stars like Brigitte Bardot, Hollywood directors like Otto Preminger and avant-garde filmmakers like Jack Smith did their part to ready the audience for the imminent sex-screen revolution. By the time ''Last Tango in Paris'' first played in New York in 1972, naked breasts and butts if not always penises had jiggled across screens and ''porno chic'' had turned Linda Lovelace into a household name. Forbidden topics, deeds and blue words had entered the mainstream: ''Monkey nipples,'' Richard Burton had announced in 1966 in ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?''
Seen now, ''Last Tango in Paris'' -- which centers on strangers who become something else after having sex every which way in an empty apartment -- scarcely seems the landmark it was heralded as, including by a breathless Pauline Kael: ''This must be the most powerfully erotic movie ever made.'' What's striking about the film, beyond that it was an American (X-rated and then R) hit, beyond Brando's beauty and Ms. Schneider's too-tender youth, is its blissfully unselfconscious sexism, its celebration of maudlin masculinity and warmed-over crazy chick cliches. If Ms. Schneider holds her own against Brando it's largely because she's at times full-frontal naked. This cinematic revolution was, like so much of art, built on the bared backs -- among other fetishized body parts -- of women.
The movies still exploit female bodies, though today American actresses working in the commercial mainstream rarely strip down past their undies. If they tend not to bare it all it isn't because of feminist progress. Neo-Puritanism and the mainstreaming of pornography have played a role, as have corporate blockbusters aimed at teenage boys, with their sexless superheroes and disposable pretty women smiling on the sidelines. Mind you, there isn't much for women to smile about when it comes to American film, where for the past few decades, the biggest hits have starred men in stories about and for men. Though every so often there is something for us too; after all, women helped make a success of ''Brokeback Mountain'' a few years ago. At last, a film with sex and romance, pretty boys and no Jennifer Aniston.

HEADLINE: Counsel for Foreclosures

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''For the Foreclosed, Themselves'' (Business Day, Feb. 3): 
A Brennan Center report found that homeowners around the country face foreclosure overwhelmingly without counsel. In Stark County, Ohio, for example, data suggest that 86 percent of foreclosure defendants did so in 2008.
These families risk losing their homes only because they may not know their legal rights, how to defend themselves or how to negotiate with lenders. Justice is in doubt when our courts order foreclosures that may be based on inaccurate documents, as the robo-signing scandal revealed.
Congress should increase financing for the Legal Services Corporation, through which nonprofits provide lawyers for low-income families nationwide. A newly authorized Department of Housing and Urban Development assistance program also needs financing to get off the ground. With families facing displacement, foreclosures killing property values and the court dockets overwhelmed, the money would be well spent.

HEADLINE: Molly Cramer, David Tipps

BYLINE: By VINCENT M. MALLOZZI

 BODY:
Mary Egan Cramer and David Foster Tipps were married Saturday evening at the Washington National Cathedral in Washington. The Rev. Stacy Williams Duncan, an Episcopal priest, performed the ceremony, with the Rev. Elizabeth Matthews Duffin, a United Methodist minister, taking part. 
The bride, 30, is known as Molly. She works from Houston as an executive adviser for the Corporate Executive Board, a company in Arlington, Va., that provides executives with education and advice on finance and other corporate matters. She graduated from the University of Pennsylvania.
She is the daughter of Audrey Zale Cramer and Jerome P. Cramer, both of Washington. The bride's father is an adjunct professor of English at Northern Virginia Community College. Her mother works in Washington as a vice chairwoman of Cushman & Wakefield, the commercial real estate company based in New York.
The bridegroom, 28, is a Houston-based senior consultant for UMT Consulting, a company in New York that provides portfolio management consulting. He graduated from Sewanee: The University of the South and received an M.B.A. from Rice.
He is a son of Pamalah Conger Tipps and Stephen Gillham Tipps of Houston. The bridegroom's mother is an educational diagnostician for St. John's School, an elementary and high school in Houston. His father is a partner in the Houston law firm Baker & Botts.
The couple met in August 2006 on their way to a Counting Crows concert in Bristow, Va.
Mr. Tipps had purchased two tickets to the concert, one for himself and the other for a former baseball teammate at Sewanee. The person could not make the concert and sold the ticket to a co-worker, who happened to be Ms. Cramer.
She and Mr. Tipps were introduced over a conference call, and plans were made for him to pick her up at the train station in Arlington, Va., and drive her about an hour away to the concert.
''I was a little hesitant,'' said Ms. Cramer, who initially thought she was attending the concert with a large group of people. ''But at that point, I had already said I would do it.''
Mr. Tipps arrived in his yellow Mustang.
''I was like, 'Who is this guy?' '' Ms. Cramer said. ''A yellow Mustang? I was a little horrified, to be honest with you.''
But within minutes, she was at ease. ''He was kind and easy to talk to and made me feel really comfortable,'' she said. ''I liked him right away.''
At the end of the concert, Mr. Tipps was concerned about losing Ms. Cramer in the large crowd and gently placed his hand on the back of her neck to help steer her back toward the car.
''I really loved that he did that,'' Ms. Cramer said. ''It was a very masculine thing to do. He took charge of the situation in a very gracious and affectionate way, and I was very touched.''
At the end of the ride, Mr. Tipps returned Ms. Cramer's concert ticket money to her. ''The whole night was well worth the price of her admission,'' he said. VINCENT M. MALLOZZI

HEADLINE: MAYOR OF RUST

BYLINE: By SUE HALPERN. 
Sue Halpern is a scholar in residence at Middlebury. Her most recent book is ''Can't Remember What I Forgot: Your Memory, Your Mind, Your Future.''

 BODY:
At the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado last July, John Fetterman, the mayor of Braddock, a small Pennsylvania town 10 miles upriver from Pittsburgh, was introduced by Dana Gioia, former chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, as a man who demonstrates ''how ideas can change the world.'' It was four days into the weeklong festival, and Fetterman, a 41-year-old, 6-foot-8 white man with a shaved head, a fibrous black beard and tattoos up one arm and down the other, was presenting a slideshow about how art could bring social change to a town where one-third of its 2,671 residents, a majority of whom are African-American and female, live in poverty. Fetterman projected pictures of old, bustling Braddock, which steel made until the middle of the 20th century and unmade throughout the rest. Its main street was packed with shoppers, its storefronts filled with wares. Then he turned to Braddock as it is today. 
''We've lost 90 percent of our population and 90 percent of our buildings,'' he said. ''Ninety percent of our town is in a landfill. So we took a two-pronged approach. We created the first art gallery in the four-town region, with artists' studios. We did public art installations. And, I don't know if you consider it arts, exactly, but I consider growing organic vegetables in the shadow of a steel mill an art, and that has attracted homesteading.''
Fetterman displayed a picture of a furniture store, which the nonprofit he founded bought in 2009 for $15,000, and an abandoned church, which is being turned into a community center, and former building lots that are now green spaces, and an outdoor pizza oven, made with bricks from a demolished building, and a house belonging to two of the homesteaders who have moved to Braddock from ''all over the country.''
''They bought this house for $4,300,'' Fetterman told the crowd, ''and put in a lot of sweat equity, and now it looks like something you'd see in a magazine.''
The audience was enchanted. Here was a guy in biker boots bringing the Park Slope (Aspen, Marin, Portland, Santa Fe) ethos -- organic produce, art installations, an outdoor bread oven -- to the disenfranchised. ''What was Braddock like before we took office? Braddock was a notorious community that was steeped in violence. But as of -- knock on wood -- today, we are now 27 months without a homicide.'' The audience began to clap and didn't stop for a long time.
As the event wound down, Gioia asked Fetterman to explain the numbers tattooed on his arms. ''This one,'' the mayor said, holding out his right forearm, ''is the Braddock ZIP code, 15104. And this one,'' he said, switching arms, ''are the dates of the five people we lost to senseless violence in Braddock since I took office.'' The audience clapped again. When the applause died out, people swarmed the mayor. A woman from a foundation in Dallas wanted to make a grant. ''Whatever you're interested in, we have projects up the wazoo,'' he said. A sculptor offered one of her pieces/. ''We use art to combat the dark side of capitalism,'' Fetterman replied. A man asked how many people had made the move to Braddock. ''It's the same as 4,000 people moving into Pittsburgh,'' Fetterman said, not offering a real number. Then Lynn Goldsmith, a photographer known for her portraits of rock stars, asked if she could take his picture, and in the shade of the building, the mayor struck a pose, unsmiling, arms out.
With appearances this past year or so on ''The Colbert Report,'' CBS News Sunday Morning, PBS and CNN, John Fetterman has become the face of Rust Belt renewal. He was dubbed America's ''coolest mayor'' by The Guardian and the Mayor of Hell by Rolling Stone. The Atlantic put him in its ''Brave New Thinkers'' issue of 2009. In contrast to urban planners caught up in political wrangling, budget constraints and bureaucratic shambling, Fetterman embraces a do-it-yourself aesthetic and a tendency to put up his own money to move things along. He has turned a 13-block town into a sampling of urban renewal trends: land-banking (replacing vacant buildings with green space, as in Cleveland); urban agriculture (Detroit); championing the creative class to bring new energy to old places (an approach popularized by Richard Florida); ''greening'' the economy as a path out of poverty (as Majora Carter has worked to do in the South Bronx); embracing depopulation (like nearby Pittsburgh). Thrust into the national spotlight, Fetterman has become something of a folk hero, a Paul Bunyan of hipster urban revival, with his own Shepard Fairey block print -- the Fetterman mien with the word ''mayor'' underneath. This, the poster suggests, is what a mayor should be.
I met Mayor John, as he likes to be called, for the first time on a warm summer day. We sat on the porch of a former convent, across the street from Andrew Carnegie's first American steel mill, the Edgar Thomson Steel Works, which now employs fewer than one-tenth of the workers it used to and was sending a steady cloud of steam and particulates into a perfect blue sky. Next door, at a school-turned-gallery, two New York artists were taking down a show. Nearby, on a parcel of land called Braddock Farms run by the Pittsburgh nonprofit Grow Pittsburgh, a lone young man pulled weeds. Behind the convent, students from a charter school a couple of towns over were tending a bee colony. Mayor John, who wore low-hanging jeans and a black T-shirt, said the bees were found in one of the town's many abandoned buildings and ''repurposed.''
Had I sat there all day, as the beekeepers and artists and farmer wandered in and out of view, listening to Fetterman explain how the population of Braddock had gone from 20,000 people crammed into houses built fast and cheap in 1920, to less than 2,700 now, and how, as the population dwindled, the stores all closed, too, and how he paid a guy out of his own pocket to drive around town giving out ice cream to poor kids because their town was ''a food desert,'' and taken in his explanation that Braddock was gentrification-proof because ''even if housing prices tripled, which they'd never do, a house would still only cost $15,000,'' I might have been so convinced of the answer that I would have forgotten to ask the question: Is Braddock a model for bringing a Rust Belt town back to life?
Urban decline has been around just about as long as there have been cities, but the degeneration of America's industrial heartland, because it cuts across a wide swath of the country and is as much about jobs as it is about habitation, has seemed both intractable and inevitable. Earlier efforts to address it involved razing whole neighborhoods and erecting Robert Moses-inspired projects. But in places like Youngstown, Detroit and Pittsburgh, as well as satellites like Braddock, where urban blight was not just a matter of run-down neighborhoods but of manufacturing plants packing up and moving away, even such radical solutions offered little hope. It's one thing to replace substandard housing stock, quite another to reinvent an economy.
Typically, when John Fetterman talks about his town, he starts with the long list of businesses that once lined its main street. ''In 2010,'' Fetterman then invariably says, ''those numbers have dropped to zero.'' It is a stunning, almost unfathomable decline, and it suggests why Braddock has become a favorite media stand-in for Rust Belt devastation, even if what Fetterman says is not precisely true. A medical clinic, auto garages, a florist, an optometrist, three markets, a preschool, a parochial school, a dollar store and Carnegie's first public library continue to do business alongside empty buildings wrapped in barbed wire.
John Fetterman showed up in Braddock in 2001. He had tried the family business, insurance, but it didn't take, and he ended up joining AmeriCorps and moving to Pittsburgh in the late '90s. After a two-year interlude at Harvard's Kennedy School studying education and social policy, Fetterman was hired to start a program for at-risk youth in Braddock, a town beset by violence. Two years later, Fetterman bought the church that was part of his Aspen slideshow, which he planned to turn into a community center. He squatted in the church for a while, then, entranced by the town's ''malignant beauty,'' bought the warehouse next door and turned it into a Dwell-worthy loft, topped by two remodeled shipping containers for additional living space. Four years after arriving in town, he ran for mayor.
In Braddock, executive decisions are made by an elected six-person borough council, and day-to-day municipal affairs are run by a nonelected borough manager. The mayor, who works for a salary of $150 a month, has two main functions: to break a tie and to oversee the police (he has veto power but can be overruled by a majority council vote). Fetterman knew this, of course, but he thought being mayor would give him a ''bully pulpit.'' Fetterman made no attempt to hide his belief that most of the borough council members had little interest in furthering the fortunes of the town and were using their positions mainly to benefit themselves. The borough manager, Ella B. Jones (who was later charged with forgery and theft of $178,000 of the town's money, a charge to which she pleaded not guilty), considered Fetterman to be a wealthy interloper, the ''great white hope'' of Braddock, as Jones put it. ''Council makes the laws,'' Jones said in 2006. ''They do it all. They have the vote. They make the rules. And he doesn't.''
So Fetterman built a back door -- he started a nonprofit organization called Braddock Redux, financed until recently primarily by family money. (His father is its largest individual donor.) Because Fetterman is the head of a nonprofit that uses Fetterman money, and because for the longest time it had only two other members, Jeb Feldman, a friend, and Helen Wachter, the head of the countywide KEYS-AmeriCorps program (which supplied volunteers to the nonprofit, including an assistant for Fetterman), Braddock Redux is known around town as John's Nonprofit. Before it became part of Braddock Redux, the Fettermans put up the money for the church next to the mayor's house, which is popularly called John's Church. Braddock Redux owns the convent across the street from the steel mill, which is known as John's Convent. Feldman has the title to the convent school, which is known as Jeb's School. The church houses the county's summer program, the Braddock Youth Project, among other things. The convent sometimes serves as a hostel for potential ''urban pioneers,'' and the middle school as a gallery and studio space. By heading a nonprofit that is a major property owner, the mayor was able to advance what he calls his ''social-justice agenda'' without having much political power, or the burden of it, either.
In 2009, when the Levi's jeans company wanted to use Braddock to promote a line of work clothes, it approached Fetterman, not the borough council. The million and a half dollars Levi's offered in exchange went to John's Nonprofit, for John's Church and community center, rather than the town's coffers. It was a closed loop that didn't sit well with some of the mayor's constituents, even those who voted for him in the last election, in 2009, which he won, 294 to 103.
''I came back to Braddock because I was interested in what John was doing,'' Pat Morgan, a church musician told me one evening after a borough council meeting. ''But he doesn't play well with others. He decides we need a youth center, and he's going to put it here, but I never hear him come to one of these council meetings and say, 'You know what, I've got some money, what should we do with it?' If you're casting yourself as the mayor who speaks for Braddock, we want him to at least pretend that we have a say in any of this.''
It was a sentiment I would hear numerous times, from longtime residents like the filmmaker Tony Buba (''John's idea of grass roots is Astroturf'') as well as from transplants. Because he ran a nonprofit, Fetterman operated with limited public accountability. It was efficient -- Braddock Redux could buy a building and get the H. J. Heinz Company Foundation to donate $100,000 to put a green roof on it and bypass the pesky part where people debate the pros and cons. But as a consequence, no matter how sincere Fetterman's ''social justice agenda,'' it is, in the end, often perceived as his.
''The key to urban reclamation is citizen participation,'' David Lewis told me when I visited him in Homestead, another struggling Mon Valley borough across the river from Braddock. An architect and urban planner known for his emphasis on community participation, Lewis was instrumental in a massive redevelopment project there called the Waterfront. ''You start with the people,'' Lewis said.
Fetterman, who did convene a group of residents to plan the community center, likes to say that he won the last election 2 to 1. ''The election was a referendum on the things I've done,'' he said.
Levi's Braddock ad campaign had its debut in movie theaters across the country on July 4 weekend. ''We were taught how the pioneers went into the West. They opened their eyes and made up what things could be,'' a girl intoned. ''A long time ago, things got broken here. People got sad and left. Maybe the world breaks on purpose so we can have work to do. People think there aren't frontiers anymore. They can't see how frontiers are all around us.''
That same weekend, billboards with Braddock, Pa., along the bottom appeared in Times Square and across the country. They featured portraits of some of the finer-looking denizens of the town, like Dave Rosenstraus, whose company, Fossil Free Fuel, was the one new business in town (which recently spawned another, still with the same partners); Jack Samuel, a member of a straight-edge-vegan-punk-rock collective; and Deanne Dupree, whose boyfriend was the last homicide in town. They carried the affirming slogan ''Everybody's Work Is Equally Important,'' which had a touch of irony in a place where so many people cannot find jobs.
The urban-pioneer motif in the Levi's ads was part of the Braddock revival story from the beginning. One of the first things Fetterman did when he took office was offer free studio space to artists. ''It's hard to appreciate how big a leap of faith it was,'' the mayor told me. ''No way artists are going to come out to Braddock'' from Pittsburgh ''at nine at night for studio space. The perception was that it was too dangerous.'' It was easy to segue from there to offering -- or at least pointing to the availability of -- cheap housing to anyone willing to make up what could be. Still, according to Fetterman, ''we have never tried to bring people in. It's just like media interest. They've just found us.''
That media interest was itself an invitation, and it began with a colorful spread in 2007 in the magazine ReadyMade. In the accompanying article, the mayor declared: ''We need to get people excited about living in Braddock again. For D.I.Y.-ers, this town is a dream.'' The article, which highlighted Fetterman's own rugged homesteading experience, flew around the Internet and was picked up by the mainstream media. The Daily Beast did a ''live chat.'' The New York Times published three separate articles. Japanese and Swiss television crews showed up. So did the curious, the adventurous, the idealistic. ''Braddock would not be possible if it were not for the Internet,'' Fetterman said. ''To be able to type in 'Braddock' and pull up this wealth of information and you can draw your own beliefs on it -- it's impossible to overstate that.''
In Aspen, when Fetterman was asked how many ''modern pioneers'' had moved to Braddock, he framed his answer as an equivalence: it was like 4,000 people moving to Pittsburgh, he said, which sounded like a lot. The actual number is currently 23, in 10 households. Modern pioneering turns out to be harder than just fixing a wrecked house, which turns out to be hard enough. Gutting and renovating a structure that wasn't built well the first time can easily compete with having a regular job. In Braddock, a successful modern pioneer typically requires family money, savings or another outside means of support, and even then it's often a stretch.
And, for ''urban pioneers'' and longtime residents, it can be challenging to live in a place that is getting so much attention. They resent their town being cast as a wasteland. They resent hearing that it ''broke on purpose.'' They resent that some of the good things done by groups not affiliated with the mayor, like a new, state-of-the-art senior housing complex, or the 36 new homes and rental units built by the Mon Valley Initiative, which house 89 people and have brought an influx of working families to Braddock (most headed by women employed in a range of jobs in the area), rarely find their way into the prevailing narrative. And they resent that one man's vision is represented as their collective vision, even while acknowledging that some of his actions, like planting fruit trees in abandoned lots, using Levi's money to finance a children's librarian and helping to get a new playground donated to the town make Braddock a more appealing, and most likely safer, place.
''I get jealous reading those stories because I want to live in that place,'' Jodi Morrison said. Morrison grew up a few towns over and moved to Braddock from Brooklyn in 2008 after learning about its progressive mayor. Morrison, who is 33, was showing me the colossal bank building she bought almost three years ago for $125,000. At the time, Morrison wasn't sure what she was going to do with it but figured it didn't matter. She'd come to Braddock, and the spirit of the place would move her. Not long after that, the roof sprang a massive leak. ''My life here has become reactionary,'' Morrison said. ''It's whatever crisis has come up that week that I have to fix. I'm way overwhelmed. I don't know how I am going to do this alone.''
A few blocks away, Morrison's friends Jenny and Kevin Fremlin are not just overwhelmed; they're angry. The couple, who are in their 30s, moved here from Juneau, Alaska, after an exploratory visit. They liked what they saw: arts groups working with kids, a potluck at a neighbor's house and the 17,000-square-foot former Chevy dealership that Fetterman's sister, Kristin, and her partner, Joel Rice, were converting (for about $250,000) into a magnificent furniture workshop, loft, greenhouse and textile studio. The Fremlins were eager to buy a $5,000 house but agreed to manage John's Convent in exchange for free housing on its third floor. By the time they arrived from Alaska, dog and possessions in tow, it had been declared uninhabitable.
Paradoxically, it can be difficult to find a home in Braddock. Many buildings are slated for demolition, and there is a relatively profitable Section 8 rental market for those that aren't. Eventually, with the mayor's help, the Fremlins found a house on one of the more crime-ridden streets.
That was more than two years ago. Their $5,000 house has now cost them nearly $60,000, and they are broke. There was drive-by shooting out front. They own a shotgun because it is more intimidating than a handgun.''Most people come here because of the hype that you can get houses cheap and fulfill your dreams,'' said Jenny, who runs an online communications design business. ''We came here so we could work less and do the projects we wanted, and we're working more than we ever did.''
Kevin, her husband, agreed. ''We've spent every dime we had and then some,'' he said.''It's a hard pill to swallow when you realize you have squandered your nest egg. Squandered. It's gone.''
Scale is a tricky variable when it pertains to turning around a city, especially one as small as Braddock. From 2000 to 2009, the population has declined by 241; about 600 jobs were lost last year alone when the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center closed the local hospital. Those are big numbers in a small place, and they represent a tide that even a personality as large as Fetterman's is unable to hold back. Nonetheless, tearing down a single abandoned building and returning the lot to green space, or renovating a dilapidated house, has its own significance: it suggests something else is possible.
''We have made our lives here, started a family and support local events and fund-raisers, even if we aren't always happy about living here and hope to move out,'' Jenny Fremlin wrote in a recent e-mail. On their own, she and Jodi Morrison are starting a ''friends of the library group'' and hope someday to open a used bookstore in an unused part of the library.
For the mayor, though, fostering civic engagement is not a necessary corollary to urban homesteading. ''If someone wants to buy a house and live their life and pay their taxes, that's fine,'' Fetterman said. ''Ninety percent of old Braddock walked away. That left a lot of chaos in town.''
Which raises the question: Is urban renewal just a matter of showing up?
On Wood Street, Jack Samuel, the 25-year-old straight-edge vegan punk rocker and Levi's model, was hanging out in one of the two houses/ he and the six other members of the Some Ideas Collective bought last year. The group wanted an inexpensive ''live-work'' space where they could play music, write and work on bikes. They bought a house for $6,000 from a filmmaker who was moving on. It was run-down, but for kids whose goal was to ''make life cheap enough'' so they could ''binge work and then be free,'' it was just fine.
''My goal is to build for myself a life that meets my needs most effectively,'' Samuel explained last summer. ''So that means the lowest possible overhead costs day to day. If you qualify for food stamps, that's that much less money you have to make. I've been on food stamps for the last few months.''
Samuel and his collective did not move to Braddock with the intent of ''fixing it.'' That idea, he said, ''is potentially very colonial or paternalistic.''
''I got a little blinded by the image of Braddock that has been portrayed by the media, that all this place is is an artist's compound. And then getting here, it's like, 'Oh, there are just people who live here.' This is home for a lot of people, a lot of low-income people in particular.''
James Smith, a 32-year-old Braddock native, often hangs out in the dollar-store parking lot with a group of friends. A graduate of the local high school, Smith can find only temp work, like cleaning Heinz Stadium after Steelers games. The weekly farmers' market in Braddock is O.K., Smith says, but even if he wanted to shop there, he couldn't afford it. Jobs and public transportation to get to them remain in short supply. Nothing that was happening in Braddock -- not the green roof on the old furniture store, not the screen printing studio run by members of a socially-conscious arts collective, not beehives, not the Shepard Fairey art installation on a nearby wall, not the Levi's ad campaign -- has changed the most essential facts of his life: he is poor and without prospects. ''The mayor is doing good things for the kids, and that does matter most, the future,'' he told me. ''But what about the future that was neglected? Our generation, the generation before us. There is nothing for us.''
One afternoon at the mayor's house, the former warehouse he shares with his wife and young son, I asked him how having seven underemployed 20-somethings move to town was a strategy for change.
''What's better, having a group of kids like Jack buy a house, or waiting another six years till the buildings fall in on themselves?'' the mayor asked.
A few weeks later I got an e-mail from Fetterman. ''I know I am not Braddock's savior, never felt that way, and never will,'' he wrote. ''There's no 'Rudy' style ending waiting for me where I get carried off the field and everything turns out O.K. for me or for Braddock,'' he continued, referring to the Notre Dame football legend.
I'd heard the mayor use that analogy a number of times before; it had seemed like a throwaway line. Reading it now, though, I realized that it went some way toward explaining why the mayor of such a small town had got so much attention. The Braddock story has the appeal of an inspirational sports movie: we want this guy to win the game against all odds. We want to believe that all it takes to fix a town is -- to borrow a phrase from Samuel and his friends --''some ideas.''

HEADLINE: Focused Past Fashion

BYLINE: By CATHY HORYN

 BODY:
ON Thursday night, at the start of Fashion Week, several hundred people went to the David Zwirner Gallery on West 19th Street to see an exhibition of Philip-Lorca diCorcia's photographs. Originally published in W magazine from 1997 to 2008, the images are a remarkable record of a free-spirited period in publishing that seemed to end with the recession. They speak directly to the eye of Mr. diCorcia, with its capacity to excite and disturb, and to seek truth about human behavior in the most banal of scenes. The images were also a result of a fortuitous collaboration between Mr. diCorcia and Dennis Freedman, then the art director of W, who gave the artist carte blanche to shoot fashion stories in places like Havana, Cairo and New York. They have collected all 11 shoots in a new book, ''Eleven.'' 
Are they fashion stories? In a way, yes, though you rarely notice the clothes. They are really about a vacuum in the middle of contemporary life, of which fashion has been a key element. That is one interpretation anyway. I spoke to Mr. diCorcia (or P. L., as he is known) about the work then and now. Young artists should feel gratified when he says of the creative process: ''It's exactly what it's always been. It's just hard work.''
In the '90s, your pictures of hustlers in Los Angeles influenced a number of fashion photographers. Yet you weren't necessarily interested in working for fashion magazines. You lived for a while with your family in Naples, Italy. Then you got a call from Dennis Freedman of W.
It was in 1997. I didn't know Dennis at all. I never had an agent and I didn't really need one. When I got back from Italy there were suddenly a bunch of demands on me, so I went to Leslie Simitch, a friend since college, who was working as an agent. Without Leslie I'm not sure I would have talked to Dennis, or would have even known what was going on. I wasn't actually doing anything at the time, but there was this competition to get me to do something, and Dennis stepped into that. One of W's virtues was its size and the degree to which they would give the photographer full license. Dennis had the capability to assure you that your pictures were not going to be cropped. That was not something that you could get from anyone else.
Still, did you have concerns?
I had always worked for magazines, but fashion magazines were kind of a different thing. They were asking you to make photographs that looked as much as possible like your other work. And I really didn't know if I was going to be biting my own tail. And I was still trying to establish myself in the art world. I had only had a gallery since 1993, and I had had some success but I don't think people really realize how much momentum you need to overcome professional inertia in the art world. It's not like a person gives you a show and you're on a roll. It just doesn't work that way.
In the pictures, the clothes never seemed the point. You were telling stories about these places and the people. Wealth. Class. A happiness that wasn't. You have cityscapes that look at once perfect and empty.
It's strange that the cover of the book is of the World Trade Center and the first image in the book is Cairo on fire. All that we're hearing now about what has been happening in Egypt under Mubarak was happening then. If I was absolving my conscience of something, it was to suggest that not everything is perfect, and fashion isn't just about clothes and beautiful people.

HEADLINE: Pressures Build to Slash Costs of City Employees

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH LESLY STEVENS. 
estevens@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Shortly after the November elections, an unusual band of labor leaders, along with Ben Rosenfield, the city controller, and Sean Elsbernd, the most fiscally conservative city supervisor, met in the posh offices of Warren Hellman, a San Francisco investor and philanthropist, with one goal in mind: Cutting a deal to slash the ballooning public employee costs weighing heavily on the city's financial crisis.
Mr. Hellman (who is the chairman of The Bay Citizen but plays no role in editorial operations) became a hero to the city's labor unions last year when he disavowed his earlier support for the ballot measure that would have forced city employees to contribute more toward their benefit and pension costs.
A few weeks before the election, two labor leaders, accompanied by Joseph D. Driscoll, an old friend of Mr. Hellman's who is also a fire captain and a member of the city's pension fund board, persuaded Mr. Hellman that the city's unions could come up with a better plan to slash the city's pension and benefits costs, rather than have one foisted upon them. 
The ballot measure, Proposition B, which had been promoted by Jeff Adachi, the city's public defender, lost by a wide margin. And the emboldened unions and the City Hall politicians who had lobbied against it had won the tough task of coming up with an alternative solution.
Three months later, the pressure is building. Deadlines are looming to ready new initiatives for the November ballot. Control of the group -- and hosting honors -- has been claimed by the new mayor, Edwin M. Lee.
Stakes are high: The city's annual budget is $6.6 billion, and it anticipates a $380 million deficit in the coming year. Widespread layoffs and continued deep cuts in services may be inevitable.
But interviews reveal that some members of the group are growing impatient, even exasperated, at the pace of the conversations, and old rivalries and grudges among the different unions and city officials now crowding the table are beginning to become apparent. Meanwhile the city's pension and health care liabilities continue to grow.
Mr. Hellman says that if nothing is done, San Francisco will be bankrupt in five years.
Michael Moritz, a venture capitalist and San Francisco resident who was the most significant backer of Proposition B, does not believe the working group can succeed.
''This group was supposed to have produced a solution months ago,'' Mr. Moritz said in an e-mail.
If the group can pull it off, however, it would be a notable, perhaps precedent-setting, achievement as governments across the country grapple with many of the same issues.
''This is the public labor movement's Nixon-to-China moment,'' said David Crane, a Proposition B backer who served as Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's special economic adviser and who now lectures on public policy at Stanford University. ''They are the ones who should propose and make it all happen.''
Thomas P. O'Connor, president of the San Francisco firefighters union, said, ''Everything is on the table, everything. We cannot put our heads in the sand anymore.''
In an interview Thursday afternoon, Mr. Hellman said the group must come up with annual savings of $300 million to $400 million. (Proposition B was to have saved the city $120 million.)
''I hate that it comes out of the hide'' of city workers, particularly those making modest salaries, Mr. Hellman said. ''It is going to be really painful.''
The city's pension and health care costs for active and retired employees total $820 million this year, on top of a city payroll of $2.4 billion, Mr. Rosenfield said. Next year, those costs will swell to an estimated $914 million, and may reach $1.4 billion by 2014. A decade ago, the city's health and benefits costs were just $176 million.
The pressure to hammer out a viable plan is intense. ''If we give up, then we are giving up on our city,'' said Steve Kawa, the mayor's chief of staff. ''We are not going to give up on San Francisco.''
But more than three months after Proposition B's defeat, the group is still fact-finding, and has not even set up parameters for the financial savings it is working toward. Mr. Hellman was the only one of 11 participants interviewed who would or could articulate what amount of savings needed to be achieved.
The group's ranks have grown in recent weeks and now include the city attorney, Dennis Herrera; the Board of Supervisors president, David Chiu; and Mayor Lee, among many others.
The issues are complicated. The laundry list of possible pension fixes the group is contemplating, for example, includes such bold measures as essentially capping pension payouts at $100,000 a year, stripping some retirees of their supplemental cost-of-living raises, and greatly increasing the amount that existing employees must contribute to the pension fund.
A list of eight possible reforms was completed at a meeting Wednesday, and it will take the controller's office several weeks to estimate savings for each idea.
The group has not yet begun to tackle changes to the health care system, which is considerably more complicated than the pension system.
Because any proposal would almost certainly require a measure on the November ballot, crucial deadlines are on the horizon. Within two weeks, the city must meet and confer with its unions to discuss the changes, even though no one yet knows what will actually be proposed.
Over the past three weeks, City Hall moved to dominate the group. Mr. Lee asked that participants now come to City Hall instead of meeting in Mr. Hellman's offices as they had been doing.
''Warren Hellman had helped us put the group together,'' said Mr. Lee, who skipped the meeting last Wednesday and sent aides instead. ''I have a very unique opportunity'' to finish the job.
In a complicating move Friday, Mr. Lee met with Mr. Adachi. The public defender has become a political pariah for his Proposition B efforts, but has vowed to introduce another ballot measure addressing the same issues. The unions are adamant that Mr. Adachi not be allowed into the working group. But there is widespread fear that competing ballot proposals could create political chaos, and delay any reform.
''Inviting Jeff Adachi to our talks would be like inviting Sarah Palin to speak at the Democratic convention,'' said Nathan Ballard, a Democratic strategist who has been involved in the working group since its inception.
Mr. Moritz, the venture capitalist, continues to agitate for steep financial reforms. ''It puzzles me that they have to engage in fact-finding when the facts are staring them in the face,'' he wrote in an e-mail.
Mr. Hellman had ''promised to swing back in support of Proposition B if he was unable to negotiate a plausible solution prior to election day last year,'' Mr. Moritz continued.
That didn't happen, and Mr. Hellman has devoted considerable time and support to the working group.
But that might change. Mr. Hellman said that ''if we don't get anyplace'' in the working group, he will re-join Mr. Moritz's effort.
Such a re-reversal would come as a shock to the labor leaders who now count Mr. Hellman as a treasured ally, even presenting him with a personalized antique fire helmet at the first of their meetings as a token of gratitude for his ''moral stand,'' Mr. O'Connor of the firefighters union said.
It is also possible that Supervisor Elsbernd, who has worked on pension issues for years, may eventually support Mr. Adachi's nascent alternate plan if the working group does not produce enough significant changes.
Mr. Hellman is sanguine that will not be necessary. ''I hope I'm not the only optimist in the city,'' he said.

HEADLINE: To Cut or Not to Cut: That Is the Budget Question

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''The Easy Cuts Are Behind Us'' (Op-Ed, Feb. 6), Jacob Lew, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, spoke of the need to make difficult budget decisions, saying the federal budget is ''an expression of our values and aspirations.''
We agree. We do, however, take exception to Mr. Lew's proposal to significantly cut the Community Development Block Grant program, the most important federal investment to job creation and neighborhood revitalization in our communities. 
Local officials understand fiscal discipline; we make tough decisions to balance budgets every year. Cities and counties have already been forced to cut services drastically, and by the end of this year, more than 100 metropolitan areas are projected to still have double-digit unemployment. This is the worst time to cut C.D.B.G. financing.
C.D.B.G. creates jobs, leverages private economic development, builds infrastructure, promotes homeownership, supports energy-efficient improvements, and provides social services to local governments.
Recently, Shaun Donovan, the secretary of housing and urban development, said that C.D.B.G. is a ''critical catalyst for economic growth,'' and had created about twice as many jobs per dollar as other H.U.D. Recovery Act programs.
The administration and Congress must maintain programs that work.

To the Editor:
Does the Obama administration realize that cuts to community action programs will leave America far poorer -- in human and fiscal terms?
Jacob Lew's Op-Ed article points to the administration's intention -- through a 50 percent cut and redistribution of remaining funds -- to wipe out the nation's network of 1,100 vigorous, cost-effective antipoverty agencies.
Community action agencies last year provided employment, education, housing and other key supports to 20.7 million disadvantaged Americans. We get people working and paying taxes. We give families in poverty a second chance at the American dream. Inspired by the president's Recovery Act, in the last two years community action agencies created and retained 18,432 jobs, ranking 8th out of the 200 Recovery Act federal programs.
Data show that every community-services block-grant dollar is multiplied 20 times over in public and private money raised to support community needs.
We hope that a careful look at the record will convince the administration and Congress that America needs community action now more than ever.
John J. Drew President and Chief Executive Action for Boston Community Development Boston, Feb. 9, 2011
To the Editor:
''Values and aspirations'' stand out as goals in the Op-Ed article by Jacob Lew, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget.
How refreshing! Our federal budget does display our nation's priorities for the entire world to see. The deficit chatter makes us all know to expect cuts and lower expectations on services.
Sadly, Mr. Lew repeatedly takes military spending off the table in any meaningful form. So-called defense spending hovers around 58 percent of discretionary spending.
If this demonstrates our values, then let's be honest. We spend almost as much as every other nation combined on national security; we should admit that we are the supercop of the planet and care less about unmet human and environmental needs.
That's not where I want my tax dollars going, and recent polls show that American citizens agree. What's wrong with this picture?
Susan Shaer Arlington, Mass., Feb. 7, 2011
The writer is executive director of the national women's peace and security organization WAND, Women's Action for New Directions, whose mission is to redirect excessive military spending to human and environmental needs.
To the Editor:
The White House faces tough budget choices ''to avoid indiscriminate cuts in areas critical to long-term growth.'' But we respectfully disagree that cutting the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative by $125 billion -- 42 percent -- meets that standard.
It doesn't make sense to cut federal conservation programs that most efficiently use taxpayer dollars by leveraging matching grants from regional, state, local, public and/or private partners to solve environmental crises.
If the Great Lakes region of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin were a nation, it would be the largest economy second only to the United States', according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
Unfortunately, the region faces major environmental challenges that threaten its economy. They include toxic substances, invasive species, habitat loss, algae blooms, nutrient runoff and the need for better decision-making information.
The best way to address these challenges is by employing federal-regional-state-local conservation partnerships like the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative.

HEADLINE: Mets Should Go Public

 BODY:
To the Sports Editor:
Re ''Wilpon's Ownership of Mets Is Threatened,'' Feb. 5: If the Wilpons need help to get through their current financial crisis, give New Yorkers the chance to help them. Stop looking for an individual partner and take the Mets public. The Boston Celtics did so in 1986, when the team was worth only $120 million. The Florida Panthers followed suit in 1996, as did the Cleveland Indians in 1998. 
Each of these teams was eventually sold back into private hands, but the owners who took them public raised much-needed capital while retaining control of their teams (as the Wilpons want to do). What better to spur much-needed fan support?

HEADLINE: Keeping Twitter Here Presents a Rare Chance

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEBER. 
Jonathan Weber is the editor in chief of The Bay Citizen. jweber@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Jonathan Weber writes a column for The Bay Citizen.
San Francisco did something last week that most economists say cities should never do, but that most do all the time, anyway: it offered a special tax deal to keep an important local business, in this case Twitter, from leaving town.
The effectiveness of such tax breaks has always been in doubt. And new scrutiny of development subsidies statewide, spurred by Gov. Jerry Brown's attempt to eliminate redevelopment agencies and enterprise zones, suggests they are largely ineffective -- and costly. In many cases, subsidies don't ultimately affect a company's location or investment decisions. Moreover, local incentives are by nature beggar-thy-neighbor games that funnel public funds to private companies. 
Yet it may make good sense to bring Twitter to the forever-down-on-its-heels Mid-Market district of San Francisco. Frankly, I suspect the company wants to stay in the city anyway, for the obvious cultural reasons. But if it can be persuaded to go to Ninth and Market, it might be a catalyst for the revival of a desperate neighborhood. And such catalysts don't come along very often.
Mid-Market, which runs roughly from Fifth Street to 10th Street along the main promenade and bleeds into the Tenderloin and South of Market, was once the hub of the city's entertainment district. But it is now a derelict stretch of boarded-up stores and porn emporiums that has defied many efforts at redevelopment. The latest plan, unveiled last year by Gavin Newsom, when he was mayor, provides development incentives aimed at creating a vibrant new arts district. A plan for a new shopping mall is also moving forward, albeit slowly. But neither effort by itself looks likely to turn around the neighborhood. Something big needs to happen.
In the early 1990s, when I was covering the long-stalled efforts to revitalize Times Square in New York, the plans seemed to be going nowhere until the Walt Disney Company stepped up to take over the historic New Amsterdam Theater and committed to rebuilding it to house elaborate Disney stage productions. There was grumbling about subsidies, but the revival of Times Square can be traced directly to Disney's actions and the local government assistance that made it happen.
Twitter could have a similar impact on Mid-Market. The company would be exempted from paying city payroll taxes on newly hired workers for six years and receive tax benefits associated with being in an enterprise zone. (It already does at its current location, like many businesses in downtown San Francisco.)
As with its efforts to lure the America's Cup to San Francisco, the city is aiming to walk the line between giving away the store and losing out on something that would bring significant economic benefits.
Critics of the Twitter deal say the city shouldn't do favors for big businesses. ''The break for Twitter sets a bad precedent for the city,'' John Avalos, a San Francisco supervisor, said in an e-mail. ''What if the Gap, Wells Fargo and Charles Schwab all wanted to pack up and leave? Would we cut them a break too?''
In an editorial opposing the tax break, The San Francisco Bay Guardian does some back-of-the-envelope math suggesting that the savings to Twitter would be trivial relative to its other expenses, meaning the tax break won't color its decision-making.
Probably. Among Bay Area cities, only San Francisco has a broad local payroll tax. But while any company would look at that as an additional cost of doing business here, the tax rate is only 1.5 percent. Even if Twitter grows very dramatically, The Bay Guardian figures, the payroll tax bill is going to be very small compared with other costs.
And that points up the difficulties of getting this kind of thing right. An incentive -- which would also be available to any other company locating in the designated area of Mid-Market and parts of the Tenderloin -- so small that it doesn't affect a company's decision ends up being pointless. If the company stays, it's a giveaway, because the employer would have stayed anyway. If it leaves? Well, the subsidy didn't work.
Would anything other than an indefensibly large incentive package be enough to influence Twitter? Hard to know. But given the potential impact of a move by Twitter to mid-Market, this is a case where one can question whether the city is doing too much -- but might also ask whether it's doing enough.

HEADLINE: OBAMA'S BUDGET SEEKS DEEP CUTS IN U.S. SPENDING

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama, who is proposing his third annual budget on Monday, will say that it can reduce projected deficits by $1.1 trillion over the next decade, enough to stabilize the nation's fiscal health and buy time to address its longer-term problems, according to a senior administration official.
Two-thirds of the reductions that Mr. Obama will claim are from cuts in spending, including in many domestic programs that he supports. Among the reductions for just the next fiscal year, 2012, which starts Oct. 1, are more than $1 billion from airport grants and nearly $1 billion from grants to states for water treatment plants and similar projects. Public health and forestry programs would also be cut.
Home energy assistance to low-income families and community service block grants would be cut in half, and an initiative to restore the Great Lakes' environmental health would be reduced by one-quarter. 
The administration readily concedes, even boasts, that the president will not win any race to outcut Republicans. In the House, Republicans are trying to slash up to $100 billion in the current fiscal year alone before they begin writing their own proposed budget for 2012 and beyond.
But the administration contends that its plan would leave the country in better overall fiscal health than the path Republicans envision. Even as they seek to downsize domestic programs, they would exempt the Pentagon from budget reductions, make permanent all the Bush-era tax cuts that are to expire at the end of 2012 and repeal cost-saving provisions of the health care law.
Mr. Obama would also extend the Bush tax cuts, but not for people whose taxable income is more than $250,000 a year. His budget does not count that proposed change as a savings; in fact, the huge revenue loss from extending the tax cuts for all income below that amount is included in his deficit projections for the remainder of the decade.
By 2015, the senior administration official said, Mr. Obama's budget would show a deficit of just over 3 percent of the gross domestic product, down from three times that level, and at roughly the point that economists consider stable; it would hover around that point through 2021. But beyond 2021, an aging population and rising health care costs are forecast to drive annual deficits higher again.
With Republicans in charge of the House, Mr. Obama's budget is more a statement of his priorities and philosophy than an actual template for federal spending and tax policy. Long-term budget projections -- and especially deficit forecasts -- are frequently unreliable because they are subject to so many political and economic variables. The point of Mr. Obama's forecast is less to promise a specific result than to signal to voters and financial markets that he is serious about reducing annual deficits.
Mr. Obama's budget will also serve as his frame for the debate with Republicans over the highly political act of writing next year's budget -- even as he tests Republicans' willingness to compromise on the more divisive solutions to the nation's long-range imbalances. ''This is the opening bid in a long process,'' said Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois and the second-ranking Senate leader.
Previewing his budget message, Mr. Obama has argued for weeks that cuts deeper than he is seeking could threaten the fragile economic recovery and that America's future growth and competitiveness demand increases in programs for education, infrastructure, innovation and research.
Mr. Obama would reduce military spending and some health program costs, but neither party is tackling the unsustainable long-term growth of entitlement programs like Medicare or proposing to raise revenues significantly to close the budget gap.
''This is a budget that's at that pivot point where we're saying we now have to move from making sure the recovery takes hold, while being careful not to undermine it, to start to move in the direction of putting policies in place that deal with the deficit,'' said the administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to preview budget details, ''because if we don't deal with the deficit, it becomes the potential next substantial economic challenge.''
The $1.1 trillion in total deficit reduction that the administration will claim through the 2021 fiscal year is measured from spending levels enacted by Congress and the president for the 2010 fiscal year. Comparisons of the impact of Mr. Obama's new budget and House Republicans' proposals on deficits and the size of government are difficult to make until both budgets are available.
House Republicans will begin work on a 2012 budget after they finish trying to shrink current spending. But their proposed $100 billion cut for this fiscal year, already four months old, would translate over a decade into more than $1 trillion in deficit reductions, budget analysts say.
Yet even if House Republicans can resolve internal fights over the cuts and pass them, such reductions will not survive opposition from Mr. Obama and the Democratic-controlled Senate. The Republicans' zeal for spending cuts, however, suggests that Mr. Obama ultimately could be forced to accept bigger reductions in overall nonsecurity spending than he now supports.
The president has proposed a five-year freeze of such spending, through 2015, which the administration estimates would save $400 billion in the next 10 years.
Decades of budget history would suggest, however, that neither party can sustain the levels of cuts they are proposing for nonsecurity discretionary spending, which while just over a tenth of the federal budget covers most government programs, like air traffic control, national parks and cancer research.
Typically, such spending has grown faster than inflation, but not nearly as fast as that for much bigger items whose costs are driving projections of a dangerously mounting debt -- the military, the entitlement programs Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, and interest on that debt.
While the Pentagon would not be subject to his freeze, Mr. Obama proposes reducing its previous spending plans by $78 billion over five years and cutting several weapons programs, including a Joint Strike Fighter engine and Marine expeditionary vehicle.
Together with ''a pretty big reduction'' in war costs from troop withdrawals in Iraq, the overall military budget would be smaller in real terms than it currently is, the administration official said. ''We're going from an environment where, if something was for defense, it was outside of normal budgetary discipline,'' the official said, ''and we're saying that can't be anymore.''
Mr. Obama's budget assumes new revenues, mostly from tax changes he has already proposed that would affect multinational corporations and upper-income individuals, and savings from reduced interest payments on what he calculates as a lower federal debt.
The president will also challenge Congress to offset the high costs of two actions repeatedly approved by lawmakers and presidents -- one prevents the alternative minimum tax from annually hitting many middle-class households rather than only the affluent taxpayers it was intended for, and the other blocks a law that would slash payments to doctors who treat Medicare patients. In past years, the costs of those remedies have often simply been added to deficits.
To pay for adjusting the alternative minimum tax for three years, through 2014, Mr. Obama again will propose a limit on the tax deductions that people in the top brackets can claim. Congress has rejected that idea, which would raise roughly $300 billion over 10 years.
To offset the cost of protecting physicians' reimbursements for two years, he will propose $62 billion in savings through changes that squeeze Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals and doctors and expand the use of generic drugs in federal health programs.
The budget confirms that Mr. Obama is not taking the lead in embracing the kind of far-reaching deficit-reduction plan recommended in December by a bipartisan majority of his fiscal commission. It proposed saving $4 trillion over a decade through specific cuts in spending for domestic, military and entitlement programs and new revenues from overhauling the tax code.
Instead, he has called on Republicans to negotiate with him to reach that goal.
While that disappoints deficit hawks in both parties, many say they are sympathetic or even supportive of his caution because neither party seems ready to compromise.
Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee and a Democratic member of the fiscal commission, said: ''In this highly partisan environment, if the president proposes something, there is automatically some group that is opposed. It may be better for him to play the role of referee.''
Mr. Conrad added: ''To get a result, the president has got to be part of a larger process that involves Republicans and Democrats, the House and Senate. How one gets to the table is not just one move, it's a series of moves. And it's very, very difficult.''

HEADLINE: The Law and Politics of Health Reform

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''On Health Care, Justice Will Prevail'' (Op-Ed, Feb. 8):
I wish I shared Laurence H. Tribe's optimism that the Roberts-Alito-Scalia-Thomas wing of the Supreme Court (except for Justice Clarence Thomas) will almost certainly vote to uphold the health care legislation that squeaked through Congress last year.
Maybe his hope is that by characterizing them as principled judges, bound to honor the court's own precedent on the broad reach of the commerce clause, he can flatter them, or shame them (or at least one of them), into deciding the case on solid constitutional principles. 
From his mouth to their ears! I wouldn't want to wager much on the prospect, though. An honest review of the record of these four in the Roberts court's decisions and in their public pronouncements shows just how political they are, in or out of their robes.
If that were not the case, then predicting how these justices would vote on any issue would be a daunting challenge. Unfortunately, it's usually much too easy.

To the Editor:
Laurence H. Tribe is a great scholar, but his analysis of the individual mandate's constitutionality is flawed.
First, this is indeed a ''novel'' issue for the Supreme Court: Never before has the federal government asserted the power to require people to engage in economic activity under the guise of regulating commerce.
Second, those challenging the law do not question Congress's power to regulate the ''multitrillion-dollar health insurance industry,'' but rather distinguish such regulation from a command for individuals to purchase that industry's products.
Third, the difference between activity and inactivity is anything but ''illusory''; if Congress can regulate mere decisions, then it can tell me, for example, that I shouldn't spend time writing letters to the editor.
And finally, imagining that Justice Antonin Scalia would support the government here because he previously ratified prohibitions on the production and consumption of marijuana is to remove the very activity-inactivity distinction that he recognized in that earlier opinion.
Ilya Shapiro Washington, Feb. 8, 2011
The writer is senior fellow in constitutional studies at the Cato Institute and editor in chief of the Cato Supreme Court Review.
To the Editor:
Because he is a law professor and a constitutional scholar, Laurence H. Tribe needs to and can believe that the Supreme Court's judgment of the new health care act will be based on the law.
Bush v. Gore proved once and for all that the modern court is but a super-legislature divided along hard partisan lines. Faction not legal fact determines how the court rules.
The health care law ruling, no matter the arguments, no matter the precedents, rests solely with Justice Anthony M. Kennedy. It will be struck down by a 5-to-4 vote unless Justice Kennedy understands that he has a greater responsibility to the health and well-being of the American people than to artful judicial dodges on behalf of allegiance to reactionary politics.
Carl Zeitz Bordentown, N.J., Feb. 8, 2011
To the Editor:
When my son, now 18, was in grade school, he wanted to retain for as long as possible his belief that Santa Claus, the Easter bunny and the tooth fairy were real.
Likewise, Laurence H. Tribe is trying to retain for as long as possible his belief that John G. Roberts Jr., Antonin Scalia, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Clarence Thomas are nonpartisan justices who will do their constitutional duty when considering the health care law.
Sadly, Professor Tribe is likely to be as disappointed as my son.
Ken Martin New York, Feb. 8, 2011
To the Editor:
Laurence H. Tribe argues that President Obama's new health care law ''would be undermined if healthy or risk-prone individuals could opt out of insurance, which could lead to unacceptably high premiums for those remaining in the pool.''
Legal points aside, requiring everyone to buy health insurance to subsidize those who can't afford it will work only for so long. What happens as costs continue to go up? Who will provide the next subsidy when there is no additional pool of nonparticipants to tap?
In that case, the subsidy will come, as it already does to some extent, from the next generation of taxpayers.
Premiums are already unacceptably high. Better to fix the cost spiral itself than to merely force more payers into the system.
Mark R. Godburn North Canaan, Conn., Feb. 8, 2011
To the Editor:
Laurence H. Tribe, citing a 1982 Supreme Court ruling, says that ''it would be 'difficult, if not impossible' to maintain the financial soundness of a Social Security system from which people could opt out.'' If something is so important to society that it is universally required, then it should be part of the tax system rather than being left to the private market. That is the critical issue with the health insurance mandate.
Social Security is a tax-based program. Universal health care for Americans should be, too.

IN AUSTRALIA, A FIGHT
Over Aboriginal Lands
Australia is experiencing a natural resources boom, and as resource companies push ever deeper into the country's remotest areas, Aboriginal leaders are leveraging their rights as traditional landowners to negotiate deals with companies and governments that are seeking to develop their holdings. Now a plan to build a liquefied natural gas plant on a site of spiritual significance has caused standoff between two Aboriginal groups, and the state government has moved to seize the land. PAGE 5

HEADLINE: Policy Rift Muddled U.S. Signals About the Departure of Mubarak

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER, MARK LANDLER and DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Last Saturday afternoon, President Obama got a jarring update from his national security team: With restive crowds of young Egyptians demanding President Hosni Mubarak's immediate resignation, Frank G. Wisner, Mr. Obama's envoy to Cairo, had just told a Munich conference that Mr. Mubarak was indispensable to Egypt's democratic transition.
Mr. Obama was furious, and it did not help that his secretary of state, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Mr. Wisner's key backer, was publicly warning that any credible transition would take time -- even as Mr. Obama was demanding that change in Egypt begin right away.
Seething about coverage that made it look as if the administration were protecting a dictator and ignoring the pleas of the youths of Cairo, the president ''made it clear that this was not the message we should be delivering,'' said one official who was present. He told Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to take a hard line with his Egyptian counterpart, and he pushed Senator John Kerry to counter the message from Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Wisner when he appeared on a Sunday talk show the next day. 
The trouble in sending a clear message was another example of how divided Mr. Obama's foreign policy team remains. A president who himself is often torn between idealism and pragmatism was navigating the counsel of a traditional foreign policy establishment led by Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Biden and Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, against that of a next-generation White House staff who worried that the American preoccupation with stability could put a historic president on the wrong side of history.
In interviews, participants described those tensions, as well as offering the first descriptions of Mr. Obama's two difficult phone calls imploring Mr. Mubarak to take the protesters' demands seriously. In those conversations, as Mr. Obama pressed Mr. Mubarak without demanding that he resign, the embattled Egyptian leader pushed back hard, arguing that the protests were the work of the Muslim Brotherhood and agents of Iran, a contention the Americans dismissed.
The officials said the hardest of those conversations came on Tuesday, Feb. 1, barely an hour after Mr. Mubarak announced he would not run for president again. In Mr. Obama's view, Mr. Mubarak still had not gone far enough. Describing the conversation, one senior official quoted Mr. Obama as telling the Egyptian president, ''It is time to present to the people of Egypt its next government.'' He added, ''The future of your country is at stake.''
Mr. Mubarak replied, ''Let's talk in the next three or four days.'' He added, ''And when we talk, you will find that I was right.'' The two men never talked again.
However direct the conversations between the presidents, the public stance taken by the United States fed the perception that there was confusion on the Potomac. Time and again, the administration appeared to tack back and forth, alternately describing Mr. Mubarak as a stalwart ally and then a foe of meaningful political change. Twelve days ago, Mr. Obama was announcing that Mr. Mubarak had to begin the transition ''now''; last weekend his chief diplomat was telling reporters that removing Mr. Mubarak too hastily could undermine Egypt's transition to democracy.
Inside the White House, the same aides who during his campaign pushed Mr. Obama to challenge the assumptions of the foreign policy establishment were now arguing that his failure to side with the protesters could be remembered with bitterness by a rising generation.
Those onetime campaign aides included Denis McDonough, the sharp-tongued deputy national security adviser; Benjamin J. Rhodes, who wrote the president's seminal address to the Islamic world in Cairo in June 2009; and Samantha Power, the outspoken Pulitzer Prize winner and human rights advocate who was once drummed out of the campaign for describing Mrs. Clinton as a monster.
All agreed that Egypt, facing a historic popular revolt, needed to begin a genuine transition to democracy. The debate was how to deploy American influence on a volatile and fast-changing situation.
Despite the fervor on the streets of Cairo, and Mr. Obama's occasional tough language, the president always took a pragmatic view of how to use America's limited influence over change in Egypt. He was not in disagreement with the positions of Mr. Wisner and Mrs. Clinton about how long transition would take. But he apparently feared that saying so openly would reveal that the United States was not in total sync with the protesters, and was indeed putting its strategic interests first. Making that too clear would not only anger the crowds, it could give Mr. Mubarak a reason to cling to power and a pretext to crush the revolution.
It was not only Mr. Wisner's and Mrs. Clinton's comments that threw the administration off message. Mr. Biden told an interviewer that he did not believe Mr. Mubarak was a dictator -- words he quickly regretted, officials say.
As the administration struggled to craft a message, it was playing to multiple audiences -- the crowds in Tahrir Square, neighboring allies who feared the instability would spread, and home audiences on the left and the right.
Mrs. Clinton and some of her State Department subordinates wanted to move cautiously, and reassure allies they were not being abandoned, in part influenced by daily calls from Israel, Saudi Arabia and others who feared an Egypt without Mr. Mubarak would destabilize the entire region. Some were nervous because they perceived that the United States had been a cheerleader for the Tunisia protesters.
In fact, some of the differences in approach stemmed from the institutional biases of the State Department versus those of the White House. The diplomats at the State Department view the Egyptian crisis through the lens of American strategic interests in the region, its threat to the 1979 peace accord between Egypt and Israel, and its effects on the Middle East peace process.
The White House shared those concerns, officials said, but workers in the West Wing also worried that if Mr. Obama did not encourage the young people in the streets with forceful, even inspiring language, he would be accused of abandoning the ideals he expressed in his 2009 speech in Cairo.
For her part, Mrs. Clinton, too, has called for radical change in the Arab world. In January, on a trip to Qatar, she issued a scathing critique of Arab leaders, saying their countries risked ''sinking into the sand'' if they did not undertake swift political reforms. She said that stagnant economies and the bulge in the youth population was a recipe for the kind of unrest that later convulsed Tunisia and Egypt. And during a meeting at the White House on Jan. 29, officials said, Mrs. Clinton pushed for the administration to adopt language that would clearly lay the groundwork for Mr. Mubarak's departure.
But she also expressed concern later that a hasty exit of Mr. Mubarak could complicate Egypt's transition to democracy given the lack of a political culture there. Added to that, many foreign policy experts still worry that Egyptians are ultimately faced with a choice between the military on one side and the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group, on the other.
For Mr. Obama, the turning point came on Feb. 1, when he watched Mr. Mubarak give a defiant speech on television and then called him to make the point that if the Egyptian leader thought he could avoid reform, he was mistaken. The next morning, he instructed his press secretary, Robert Gibbs, to not to shy away from his demand that day that meaningful reform must begin ''now.''
''I want you to be clear that I meant what I said when I said 'now,' '' Mr. Obama told his aides, according to a senior administration official. The result was Mr. Gibbs' line that ''now started yesterday,'' which appeared to harden the administration's position even more.
But it also angered the administration's allies, who made their displeasure clear in a flood of calls. It was in that tense atmosphere that Mrs. Clinton left on Feb. 4 for a security conference in Munich without Thomas E. Donilon, the national security adviser, who was initially supposed to attend, too.
The surprise speaker was Mr. Wisner, who addressed the group by video link just days after returning from Cairo, where he had gone to deliver Mr. Obama's message in person to Mr. Mubarak.
Mr. Wisner, a former ambassador to Egypt, comes from the old school of nurturing American relationships. And he warned the audience in Munich that ''you need to get a national consensus around the preconditions of the next step forward,'' and that, in the remarks that so angered Mr. Obama, Mr. Mubarak ''must stay in office in order to steer those changes through.''
In Munich, Mrs. Clinton and other Western officials put their emphasis on the ''orderly'' part of an ''orderly transition'' in Egypt. Mrs. Clinton ticked off the list of hurdles that had to be surmounted: Political parties had to be created, leaders had to emerge from an opposition that had been suppressed for 30 years, the Constitution needed to be amended and voter rolls assembled. That process, she added, ''takes time.''
Mrs. Clinton's message, officials said, was conflated later with Mr. Wisner's. Administration officials insist that Mr. Obama was angered by Mr. Wisner's remarks, not by Mrs. Clinton's. But speaking to reporters on the flight home from Munich, Mrs. Clinton echoed at least part of Mr. Wisner's argument, warning that Mr. Mubarak's abrupt resignation could prompt a chain of events, stipulated by the Egyptian Constitution, which would lead to elections in two months -- far too short a time.
A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, Philippe Reines, said, ''The secretary sees the need for profound transformation in the Middle East -- and sees it as consistent with both our values and long-term interests.'' But, he added, ''She is also very mindful of the challenges and seeks to ensure it proceeds in a way where people's aspirations are realized and not thwarted, where lives are valued and not lost.''
Back in Washington, though, Mr. Obama was moving quickly to counteract the comments in Munich.
The White House recruited Senator Kerry, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, who appeared on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press'' and declared that Mr. Wisner's comments ''just don't reflect where the administration has been from day one.''
In an interview on Friday, Mr. Kerry played down the administration's mixed messages. ''A little confusion came out of Munich,'' he said. ''Apart from that, they calibrated it appropriately, to try to give the process room without making it an American process.''

HEADLINE: Indomitable Russell Values One Accolade Above the Rest

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY

 BODY:
Personal honors never meant much to Bill Russell, one of America's most successful athletes, with 2 college titles, 1 Olympic gold medal and 11 -- count 'em, 11 -- N.B.A. championships with the Boston Celtics.
He has never visited the Basketball Hall of Fame, where he was the first black N.B.A. player enshrined, in 1975. He has his reasons; he always does.
Given his blast-from-the-past '60s positions on race and just about anything, Russell is often asked about his reaction to the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which he will receive from President Obama on Tuesday, as will former President George H. W. Bush, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, Stan Musial and 11 others.
Is this the greatest personal honor in his life? 
''A close second,'' Russell replied.
Umm, what's first? The tentativeness of the question elicited the familiar whooping roar of laughter occasionally emitted by this publicly serious man.
''When he was about 77, my father and I were talking,'' Russell answered. ''And he said: 'You know, you're all grown up now, and I want to tell you something. You know, I am very proud of the way you turned out as my son, and I'm proud of you as a father.'
''My father is my hero, O.K., and I cannot perceive of anything topping that,'' Russell continued, his voice becoming husky. This being the mature Bill Russell, born on Lincoln's birthday in 1934, he saw fit to add, ''While I am very, very flattered by this honor.''
Russell will take along much of his family, along with Jim Brown and Joe Morgan, whom he regards as allies, great African-American athletes who spoke their minds.
''I said, 'You were part of this team, like John Lewis and Maya Angelou, some of the medal winners,' '' said his daughter, Karen Kenyatta Russell, a lawyer, almost as if she needed to talk her father into accepting the honor.
''Weren't they the predicate in a way for Obama?'' she said. ''Before Oprah. He was the first black coach in major sports; people saw someone like him.''
When he was flicking away opponents' shots, Russell intimidated the world not only with his long arms, but also with his silent stares and strong opinions. For many decades, Russell refused to visit Fenway Park, until new management convinced him it had exorcised vestiges of racism.
He has stayed away from the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass., he said, because he represented team play, not individual accomplishment -- and besides, he recalled, he was denied an individual honor while in college.
In a telephone conversation recently, Russell just happened to recall the spring of 1966, when he was named the first black coach in a major professional sport in the United States.
''I remember at the press conference,'' he said, ''probably the second or third question one of the Boston reporters asked me, 'Can you coach the white guys without being prejudiced?' Now, I didn't recall anybody asking a white coach if he could coach the black guys without being prejudiced. All I said was, 'Yeah.' ''
New generations have no idea what it was like back then. Russell was born in West Monroe, La.; his parents knew people who had been born slaves. Once his mother made a handsome suit for herself, and police officers told her not to wear ''white women's clothes,'' Karen Russell said.
''Black people had to wait in line at a drugstore or gas station, and white people went first,'' she continued. ''One day, my grandfather tried to pull away from a gas line, and the owner pulled a shotgun and said, 'Boy, you're going to buy your gas from me.' ''
In a telephone interview, she described Russell as the personification of Isabel Wilkerson's new book, ''The Warmth of Other Suns,'' about the black journey to northern cities.
''My father says it was not a migration but an immigration,'' she said, meaning to another country. Russell told her that if his father had stayed in Louisiana, ''He said he either would have killed or been killed.''
Charlie and Katie Russell moved with their two sons to Oakland, Calif., where she died at 32, but not before telling him to make sure the boys got an education. The older son, Charlie L. Russell, became a playwright. A scout spotted the gangly William Russell in a high school game and directed him to Coach Phil Woolpert at the University of San Francisco.
''I was an innovator,'' Russell said. ''I started blocking shots although I had never seen a shots blocked before that. The first time I did that in a game, my coach called timeout and said, 'No good defensive player ever leaves his feet.' ''
Russell did it anyway, and the Dons won 55 straight games and national titles in 1955 and 1956. Then Russell led the United States to a gold medal at the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne, Australia, and joined the Celtics, who had never won a championship.
He has always given credit to the team's white owner, Walter Brown, and its white coach, the irascible, pragmatic Red Auerbach. The Celtics began to win, and they kept adding great players, most of them black. When Tom Heinsohn was hurt, Auerbach started Willie Naulls in his place, and days later, Russell said, they were told they were the first N.B.A. team to start five blacks.
Russell dominated everybody -- economically blocking shots toward his teammates, changing the flow of his sport. Tom Meschery, an opponent, wrote a poem about him, calling him an ''eagle with a beard.''
When Auerbach retired as coach after the 1965-66 title, the team agreed Russell should become the playing coach.
''My allegiance was to the Boston Celtics,'' Russell said. ''I took the job not as a social statement, but for what I thought was the right reason. I would be the best guy for that job at that time.''
The Celtics won titles in two of three seasons with him as player-coach, then he gave up playing, with 11 N.B.A. titles in 13 seasons, in a time when it was not exactly clear if the center would hold.
Russell's journey continued, with jazz and politics and poetry in the house. Angelou, who will also receive a medal Tuesday, visited one time and later wrote a poem, ''Little Girl Speakings,'' about a little girl who worships her daddy and her mommy. Yet the Russell marriage broke up. Karen, 11 at the time, chose to stay with her father, and her two brothers, William Jr. and Jacob, went with their mother. Russell told Karen he knew nothing about raising girls; years later, he told her he had tried to make her be like Billie Jean King, a recipient of the presidential medal last year.
Karen Russell went to Georgetown and Harvard Law School -- ''brought me out of retirement three times,'' Russell said with that whoop, referring to coaching and broadcasting gigs, to pay the tuition. She is now a corporate diversity and employment lawyer at Davis Wright Tremaine in Seattle.
When Russell first met Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, years apart, they both began the conversations by saying: ''I know you. You're Karen Russell's father.'' She said, ''Very canny of both of them.''
Russell's third marriage, to Marilyn Nault, was a love affair. They drove across the country; they laughed a lot; she told him to get out more. This most private of humans recently shared one of the most intimate moments in any life.
He and Marilyn were invited to the Obama inauguration in January 2009, but she was dying of cancer in Seattle. She urged him to go, but when he landed in Washington, he heard she had taken a downward turn, and he got back on a plane.
''We held hands and watched the inauguration,'' he said. ''We sat there all night, and then I said, 'Listen, I'm going to take a shower, now wait for me, I'll be right back,' and she said she'd wait. Well, as soon as I left she died. So I said to the nurse, 'She promised she would wait,' and the nurse said this happens quite commonly. A lot of people don't want their loved ones to see them die. And so it was like we shared this moment together and she did not want me to see her die.''
When he was notified about the medal, he said, ''I went down to the grave and shared it with her, and I do that now and then.''
Russell will carry her rosary with him to the White House.
And what does he, the country's first black professional coach, think about receiving a medal from its first black president? He has kept up with Obama, attending a private birthday game last August with many current and former stars.
''Well, you know, I know him for a while, long before he was president,'' Russell said. ''And the last time I talked to him, I said, I am very proud of him, not because he is the first black president, but 'because you're an intelligent, competent politician and you arrived at the top of your profession, and so, I'm proud of you for your accomplishments as a man.' ''
He sounded just like his father, Charlie Russell, at 77.

HEADLINE: Hollywood's Whiteout Year: Few Blacks on Silver Screen

BYLINE: By MANOHLA DARGIS and A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
CRAMMED into this year's field of 10 best picture Oscar nominees are British aristocrats, Volvo-driving Los Angeles lesbians, a flock of swans, a gaggle of Harvard computer geeks, clans of Massachusetts fighters and Missouri meth dealers, as well as 19th-century bounty hunters, dream detectives and animated toys. It's a fairly diverse selection in terms of genre, topic, sensibility, style and ambition. But it's also more racially homogenous -- more white -- than the 10 films that were up for best picture in 1940, when Hattie McDaniel became the first black American to win an Oscar for her role as Mammy in ''Gone With the Wind.'' In view of recent history the whiteness of the 2011 Academy Awards is a little blinding.
Nine years ago, when Denzel Washington and Halle Berry won his and her Oscars -- he was only the second African-American man to win best actor, and she was the first African-American woman to win best actress -- each took a moment to look back at the performers from earlier generations who had struggled against prejudice and fought to claim the recognition too often denied them. 
''This moment is so much bigger than me,'' Ms. Berry said, before convulsing with sobs. ''This moment is for Dorothy Dandridge, Lena Horne, Diahann Carroll.'' When Mr. Washington took the stage, he praised God and then recognized another higher power, Sidney Poitier, who received an honorary Academy Award earlier that evening for helping to dismantle the color line in film.'' ''I'll always be chasing you, Sidney,'' Mr. Washington said, holding his Oscar toward Mr. Poitier, who had won his own best actor prize in 1964 for ''The Lilies of the Field.'' ''I'll always be following in your footsteps.''
Real change seemed to have come to movies or at least the Academy, which had given statuettes to a total of seven black actors in the previous 73 years. After Mr. Washington and Ms. Berry, there would be Jamie Foxx and Forest Whitaker (both best actors); Morgan Freeman (best supporting actor); Jennifer Hudson and Mo'Nique (best supporting actresses). The consolidation of a black presence in the movies and television did not signal the arrival of a postracial Hollywood any more than the election of Barack Obama in 2008 spelled the end of America's 400-year-old racial drama. But it was possible, over much of the past decade, to believe that a few of the old demons of suspicion and exclusion might finally be laid to rest.
Are the coming Oscars an anomaly, or an unsettling sign of the times? The Academy, in any case, does not work in a vacuum. A look back at the American films of 2010 reveals fewer of the kinds of movies -- biographies like ''Ray'' and urban dramas like ''Training Day'' -- that have propelled black actors, screenwriters and directors into contention in the recent past. With a few exceptions, like the romance ''Just Wright'' and the ghetto farce ''Lottery Ticket,'' it was perhaps the whitest year for Hollywood since the post-Richard Pryor, pre-Spike Lee 1980s. The superhero, fantasy and action genres were drained of color. The urban dramas were set in Irish-American New England neighborhoods. Even the male-male buddy picture, a staple of interracial bonding since 1958, when Mr. Poitier and Tony Curtis were chained together in ''The Defiant Ones,'' has become a largely white-on-white affair.
The possibility that a new black independent film movement -- or even a genuinely crossover cinema -- would emerge in the wake of ''Precious: Based on the Novel 'Push' by Sapphire,'' now seems as remote as it did before this art-house phenomenon made its way, assisted by Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry, from the Sundance Film Festival to the Oscars. But while Ms. Winfrey and Mr. Perry, as executive producers, brought attention to this story of an abused black teenage girl, ''Precious'' now looks more like a one-off than a harbinger of change, much like another of last year's nominees, ''The Princess and the Frog,'' the first Disney movie with a black princess. (The latest Disney princess, Rapunzel in ''Tangled,'' is as blond as Sleeping Beauty back in 1959.)
What happened? Is 2010 an exception to a general rule of growing diversity? Or has Hollywood, a supposed bastion of liberalism so eager in 2008 to help Mr. Obama make it to the White House, slid back into its old, timid ways? Can it be that the president's status as the most visible and powerful African-American man in the world has inaugurated a new era of racial confusion -- or perhaps a crisis in representation? Mr. Obama's complex, seemingly contradictory identity as both a man (black, white, mixed) and a politician (right, left, center) have inspired puzzlement among his supporters who want him to be one thing and detractors who fear that he might be something else.
In their modest way American movies helped pave the way for the Obama presidency by popularizing and normalizing positive images of black masculinity. Actors like Mr. Poitier and Harry Belafonte made the leap, allowing black men to move beyond porters and pimps to play detectives, judges, the guy next door, the God upstairs and the decider in the Oval Office. At the same time, while the variety of roles increased, the commercially circumscribed representational conservatism of American cinema -- with its genre prerogatives and appetite for uplift, its insistence on archetypes and stereotypes, villains and heroes -- meant that these images tended to fit rather than break or bend the mold. Certainly this isn't a cinema that jibes with what, in his 1995 memoir ''Dreams From My Father,'' Mr. Obama called ''the fluid state of identity.''
The recognition of that fluidity, and the exploitation of it for creative and commercial ends, has, from the swing era through hip-hop, been much more the province of America's popular music than its movies. Partly because movies remain a top-down, capital-intensive art form, they have been more cautious and apt to cater to rather than to subvert the perceived prejudices of the audience. In Hollywood race has often been a social problem to be earnestly addressed (and then set aside), or a marketing challenge. In the 1960s the studios congratulated themselves for making sober, correct-thinking dramas that often starred Mr. Poitier in films like ''In the Heat of the Night'' and ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,'' both released in 1967 and which together reaped 17 Oscar nominations.
A few years later, when a new generation of actors and filmmakers emerged from the rubble of the old studio system, Mr. Poitier was no longer alone as African-Americans began to appear on screen and behind the camera to an unprecedented extent. Faces and voices that had once been found only in ''race movies'' or art-house films by the likes of Shirley Clarke (''The Cool World'') filtered into the mainstream. There were blaxploitation hits like ''Shaft,'' as well as crossover dramas (''Sounder'') and popular comedies, including the trilogy ''Uptown Saturday Night,''''Let's Do It Again'' and ''A Piece of the Action,'' directed by Mr. Poitier and starring him and Bill Cosby. The independent world saw the emergence of off-Hollywood directors like Charles Burnett, Haile Gerima, Billy Woodberry and Julie Dash.
Race in American cinema has rarely been a matter of simple step-by-step progress. It has more often proceeded in fits and starts, with backlashes coming on the heels of breakthroughs, and periods of intense argument followed by uncomfortable silence. To that end, the 1980s were, with a few exceptions -- or maybe just the exception of Eddie Murphy in ''48 Hours,'' Trading Places'' and ''Beverly Hills Cop'' -- marked as much by racial retrenchment as by the consolidation of the blockbuster mentality. More hopefully, the end of that decade ushered in a new generation of do-it-yourself black filmmakers, most famously and outspokenly Spike Lee, who tried to beat the system and then joined it.
Mr. Murphy, Mr. Lee and the African-American stars who ascended in the 1990s and the decade that followed -- notably Will Smith, Morgan Freeman, Jamie Foxx and of course Mr. Washington -- often had to shoulder the burden of representing their race even as they pursued their individual ambitions. For the most part, these stars rode to the top of the box office in stories that did not engage or address race, while the films that did take the subject on more directly -- like ''Ali'' and ''Dreamgirls'' -- often did so at a historical safe distance. It was almost as if, with the ascendancy of individual black movie stars, Hollywood no longer felt the need to tell stories about black people as a group.
This retreat from race by the big studios partly explains the emergence of a newly separate black cinema with its own stars (Morris Chestnut, Vivica A. Fox), auteurs (Ice Cube, Tyler Perry) and genres (including tales of buppie courtship like ''Two Can Play That Game'' and of neighborhood striving like the ''Barbershop'' franchise). Emerging from outside the mainstream and indie world, the prolific Mr. Perry has become one of the most successful directors and producers of any color. Last year he directed a much-maligned adaptation of Ntozake Shange's ''For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf.'' Some complained that Mr. Perry had bowdlerized that's famous feminist work, but he had made it his own, complete with melodramatic flourishes and divas like Janet Jackson.
Mr. Lee has been among Mr. Perry's critics. ''We've got a black president, and we're going back,'' Mr. Lee said in 2009. ''The image is troubling, and it harkens back to Amos 'n' Andy.'' The philosopher Cornel West has been more charitable (''Brother Tyler can mature'') and last year he put a larger frame around the issue of race and the movies in America, noting that with ''all the richness in black life right now,'' that ''the only thing Hollywood gives us is black pathology. Look at the Oscars. Even 'Precious,' with my dear sister Mo'Nique, what is it? Rape, violation, the marginalized. Or else you get white missionary attitudes toward black folk. 'The Blind Side?' Oh my God! In 2010? I respect Sandra Bullock's work, but that is not art.''
''The Blind Side'' might not have been art, but along with three other best picture nominees -- ''Precious,'' ''District 9'' and ''Avatar'' -- it did take on questions of black and white relations. At the center of ''The Hurt Locker,'' which won best picture, was the volatile friendship between two soldiers, a hot-headed white bomb-disposal specialist played by Jeremy Renner and his cautious black sergeant, played by Anthony Mackie. Race in that movie was not a theme or a problem to be solved, but rather a subtle, complex fact of life. These nominees suggested a range of approaches to a volatile subject, from allegory to melodrama to various kinds of realism.
Did filmmakers somehow exhaust the subject? Or has the cultural ground shifted and, with the economic crisis, made other kinds of stories feel more urgent? While it might be a stretch to yoke together the differently privileged milieus of ''The King's Speech,'' ''The Kids Are All Right'' and ''The Social Network,'' it is hard to escape the impression that class made something of a comeback in 2010. ''The Fighter'' relates the story of working-class, boxing brothers from a former Massachusetts mill town. Set in the Ozarks, ''Winter's Bone'' involves the violent, clannish world of crystal meth producers whose grandfathers likely ran moonshine. ''The Town,'' which brought Mr. Renner his second nomination in two years, depicts a similar milieu, but with Boston bank robbers.
So is class the new race? It may be tempting to think so, given the state of the economy and the political discourse, but the two have never really stood apart in American life. And the racial complexity of American life seems, at least at the moment, to have stymied the collective imagination of the movie industry. Perhaps this next year will bring more change we can believe in. For now, though, looking down the roster of the most popular movies released in 2010, only one seems capable of acknowledging, and making a story of the perfectly ordinary reality of a black man with a blue-collar job. That was Tony Scott's ''Unstoppable,'' starring none other than Denzel Washington. The rest of Hollywood, it seems, will always be chasing him.
Correction: February 20, 2011, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A picture credit last Sunday with a photograph of the actress Mo'Nique -- appearing with a column about black actors and the Oscars -- misstated the name of the agency that provided the photo. It is European Pressphoto Agency, not European Photopress Agency.
Correction: March 20, 2011, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A column on Feb. 13 about black actors and the Oscars erroneously stated the year that President Obama's memoir ''Dreams From My Father,'' briefly mentioned in the piece, was first published. It was in 1995, not 2007.

HEADLINE: A Separate Peace

BYLINE: By BERNARD AVISHAI. 
Bernard Avishai is author of ''The Hebrew Republic: How Secular Democracy and Global Enterprise Will Bring Israel Peace at Last.''

 BODY:
The street -- demonstrations roiling the Arab world have riveted and moved many Americans, who have visions of democracy sweeping through northern Africa and the Middle East. As I write this, Hosni Mubarak, Egypt's president, has announced he will not stand for re-election, as has Yemen's longtime ruler, Ali Abdullah Saleh. Tunisia's ruler fled, and the nation has a new government; King Abdullah of Jordan replaced his own cabinet and now has a prime minister who promises reform. There are even stirrings in Syria. President Obama has signaled his determination to support democratization in the region, as promised in his 2009 Cairo speech, and not to remain tied to authoritarian regimes. 
In Israel, by contrast, there is fear. Whatever their doubts about how Egypt and Jordan were ruled, most Israelis counted on the Mubarak and Hashemite regimes, if not as true allies then at least as stable neighbors committed to the peace treaties they signed. Israelis understand that their occupation of the West Bank and siege of Gaza are sources of rage in the Arab street, but many have come to believe that the peace process is futile -- especially since President Obama seems to have despaired of achieving meaningful negotiations -- and they fear democracy will bring Islamists to power, or at least encourage anti-Israeli politicians. They feel a strategic pillar has been kicked from under them, and the regional unrest only strengthens their sense that they must defend themselves against, rather than make peace with, the Palestinians.
Yet amid this turmoil are opportunities, not the least of which is precisely the chance to end the Israeli occupation and found a Palestinian state. A viable plan exists: it is waiting to be forged from the far-reaching proposals that Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority made to each other in 2008. We had a glimpse in mid-January of these negotiations -- the ''Palestine Papers,'' leaked by Al Jazeera; and then excerpts from Ehud Olmert's memoir, published in Israel. But the picture emerging from these accounts was unfocused and confusing, and the achievements of the negotiators were lost in the excitement generated in the streets of Tunis and Cairo. Yet the Israeli-Palestinian talks in 2007 and 2008 provide an invaluable template for a new, Obama-led push for peace. As unlikely as it might sound, now is the time. Obama's hand in Israel has been strengthened by events in Tunisia, Egypt and Jordan. At the same time, the U.S. is paying a growing price for the current impasse between Israel and Palestine and the continuing occupation of Palestinian lands, for which Americans receive much of the blame. A settlement in Palestine will not put bread on Egyptian tables, but it will transform American status in the region. And it might rescue the fortunes of Israel.
OVER THE COURSE of almost two years, from December 2006 to mid-September 2008, Olmert and Abbas met 36 times. Lower-level talks were also going on, led by Israel's foreign minister at the time, Tzipi Livni, and one of the Palestinian Authority's longtime negotiators, Ahmed Qurei. These talks were the source for the ''Palestine Papers'' published by Al Jazeera just last month: notes from the Palestinian side on how negotiations were going. The top-level talks were considerably more important. The leaders never consummated a deal. But both had gone far enough to tee up new American ''bridging proposals'' that Abbas, in particular, was counting on. I spoke with Olmert this year in Jerusalem on the morning of Jan. 21, and that same evening with Abbas in Amman, Jordan. The leaders revealed in detail what was proposed, what was implicitly agreed, what the gaps were and what they suggested was susceptible to compromise.
Each told me that if new violence breaks out in Palestine, as seems quite likely, historians will look back with a sense of pathos on how narrow and, in some key areas, trivial the gaps were. ''We were very close,'' Olmert told me, ''more than ever in the past, to complete an agreement on principles that would have led to the end of the conflict between us and the Palestinians.'' Abbas said the talks produced more ''creative ideas'' than any in the past. He took pains to assure me that he had been most flexible on Israel's security demands. Olmert, in retrospect, agrees, saying that Abbas ''had never said no.'' Olmert insisted that he had conceded to Abbas every major demand Palestinians had made for decades: a border based scrupulously on the 1967 lines, a Palestinian capital in Jerusalem and ''recognition of the problem'' of refugees. ''I was ready to take complete responsibility and move forward forcefully,'' Olmert told me. ''I believed, I still believe, that I would have broken through all the barriers and won over public opinion in this country and the world.''
THE ISSUES THAT were supposed to be intractable -- demilitarization of the Palestinian state, the status of Jerusalem and the right of return of Palestinian refugees -- proved susceptible to creative thinking. Even on borders, Olmert and Abbas were able to agree on fundamentals: a desire to disrupt as few lives as possible and to maximize the contiguity (and therefore the economic possibility) of Palestinian cities. ''We didn't waste a minute during our months of negotiation,'' Abbas said.
Where bridging proposals seemed most called for was over the extent and nature of land to be swapped -- in effect, the fate of specific large Israeli settlements. The Israeli position, where it diverged from the Palestinian, was not about principle but focused primarily on the practical matter of how many (often violent) settlers the Israeli government would have to force back behind the Green Line. The most important discussions were on security, borders, Jerusalem and the Palestinian ''right of return.''
The Question of Security In his pivotal Bar Ilan University speech of June 14, 2009, Olmert's successor, Benjamin Netanyahu, finally promised to work toward a Palestinian state and made much of his demand that Palestine be demilitarized. But he must have known he was pushing on an open door: Olmert and Abbas had already come up with a series of principles that would leave Palestine demilitarized (''I agreed to the term 'nonmilitarized,' '' Olmert told me) while preserving its sovereignty.
Olmert's security principles were the following: Palestine would have a strong police force, ''everything needed for law enforcement.'' It would have no army or air force. The Palestinian border with Jordan, through which missiles and heavy armaments might be smuggled, would be patrolled by international forces, probably from NATO. There would be a procedural guarantee that no foreign army would be able to enter Palestine, and its government would not be permitted to enter into any military agreement with a country that does not recognize Israel. Israel, for its part, would have the right to defend itself beyond the borders of a Palestinian state -- say, against land forces massing on the eastern side of the Jordan River. Israel expected to reserve the right to pursue terrorists across the new borders. Israel would be allowed access to airspace over Palestine, and the Israel Defense Forces would have rights to disproportionate use of telecommunications spectrum (though commercial rights would be equalized under international law). When I spoke with Abbas in Amman, I did not have to refresh his memory about these overarching principles. ''We don't need a Palestinian army,'' he said emphatically. ''We don't want an air force or tanks or rockets.'' He insisted that the whole matter had been worked out with Gen. James Jones, who eventually became Obama's national security adviser. Abbas confirmed that Israel could indeed negotiate special permits regarding Palestinian airspace.
Abbas further offered Olmert his choice of international forces to patrol the border with Jordan, and he even said that he had consulted the Americans, who agreed to participating in a NATO force as long as it was under American command. Jordan and Egypt, whose borders were implicated, made some conditions of their own: no Jordanian or Egyptian would participate in the force, and it would be based only on Palestine's side. ''The file on security was closed,'' Abbas told me. ''We do not claim it was an agreement, but the file was finalized.''
REWRITING THE BORDERS Abbas opened the negotiations over land with a map showing how Israel could annex 1.9 percent of Palestine in return for tracts of land equal in size and quality; Olmert produced a map of 6.3 percent, suggesting that for the percentage of Palestine Israel would annex, it would compensate Palestine with 5.8 percent, plus a 25-mile tunnel that would run under Israel from the South Hebron Hills to Gaza. ''The built-up area of all the settlements was 1.1 percent,'' Abbas said, ''so when I offered them 1.9, it was more than enough.'' Olmert's bid was somewhat less firm from the start: ''I gave him reason to believe that I would go down to 5.9, but that would be final.'' Notionally, the leaders would then be looking to the United States to help them split the difference; this was what Abbas, at least, expected. (Since the talks ended, various compromises in the 4 percent range have been floated by teams working at the James Baker institute at Rice University.)
But so much talk of percentages can be misleadingly abstract. There could never have been an exchange of maps had there not been a mutual agreement on the definition of the ''occupied territory.'' And here American diplomacy proved decisive in advance of any possible compromise.
Historically, Israel has tried to exclude the territories of expanded Jerusalem, about 25 square miles, from the territory to be divided. Israel passed a law in 1967, shortly after the Six-Day War, claiming this entire territory as its own. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice made it clear, however, even as Olmert and Abbas were negotiating, that this Israeli claim was counter to U.S. policy. Occupied territory, she said, would be defined as the Gaza Strip, the West Bank (including East Jerusalem), the Dead Sea, Jordan Valley and ''no man's land'' -- the last being small areas neither Israel nor Jordanian forces patrolled before 1967. (These areas are still crucial, since the no man's land around the monastery in Latrun is now paved over by the major highway connecting Jerusalem to Tel Aviv.)
So when Olmert finally showed Abbas his map on Sept. 16, it was an established principle of these negotiations that any territory Israel sought to annex in Greater Jerusalem would have to be compensated like any other occupied territory. This was unprecedented. Olmert held that the no man's land also be divided 50-50, with Israel understandably taking more around its highway and ceding more in other areas, but this slight divergence from Rice's definition was of no great consequence. ''I told Abbas this land had never been used, so the only reasonable thing was to divide it,'' Olmert said. ''He seemed quite happy with it.''
The real issue in contention, however, was which Israeli settlements would be permitted to stay, and which would have to be removed. When Abbas alluded to ''built-up settlements,'' he was conceding that, yes, it would make no sense to move the Jewish suburbs of Jerusalem -- except Har Homa, begun by the first Netanyahu government after the Oslo process had started -- or the settlements of Gush Etzion and Alfei Menahse, towns by now adjacent to the Israeli border. Under Abbas's offer, more than 60 percent of settlers would stay in place.
Olmert, for his part, was presenting a plan in which the most sparsely populated settlements would be evacuated, but Efrat (extending from Gush Etzion), Maale Adummim (a town just east of Jerusalem) and Ariel, a town of 18,000 between Ramallah and Nablus, should be permitted to stay. From Olmert's point of view, the problem was not helping settlers fulfill their dream of redeeming promised land but helping the Israeli military avoid the pain of removing them. Many settlers are fanatical, armed and contemptuous of Israeli democracy; some even like to call themselves Judeans. Israelis, Olmert implied, are loath to fight Judeans for the sake of Palestinians; and his map already called for removing the ultrafanatical town of Kiryat Arba, abutting the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron.
Not that Abbas was willing to make Olmert's problem his own. ''We have criteria for which settlements must be removed,'' Samih Al-Abid, a former minister in the Palestinian Authority and a negotiator, reasoned. ''We cannot tolerate settlements that disrupt our territorial contiguity, disrupt the economic development of Palestinian cities or leave people in place who are bound to become security threats'' -- either because they are fanatics or because their very presence will be provocative to the towns around them. By these criteria, Ariel is the most blatant problem. Olmert told me that Abbas ''kept coming back to it.''
Ariel, after all, was plunked down in the hills between Nablus and Ramallah precisely to make a statement that the historic Land of Israel was being claimed as indivisibly Jewish. Its residents, many of whom were Russian immigrants taken directly from the airport to Ariel and given cheap apartments by Ariel Sharon, have no local industry to speak of. When the Baker Institute teams suggest compromises of between 3 and 4 percent, Ariel is almost always removed. One possibility raised by Al-Abid was ''space for time.'' If Israel agreed to vacate a large settlement like Ariel, a complex task, Palestine would agree to give it considerable time to do so.
Olmert and Abbas both acknowledged that reciprocal relations would be necessary, not some hermetic separation. They also acknowledged the need to share a single business ecosystem, while cooperating intensively on water, security, bandwidth, banking, tourism and much more.
The negotiations on borders ended here, with Olmert telling Abbas among other things that no Israeli prime minister could ever remove Ariel, and Abbas telling Olmert that no Palestinian president could ever accept it. ''I told him, 'Sign,' '' Olmert said. '' 'You will never get a better proposal from any Israeli government for the next 50 years.' '' Abbas would not sign. He asked for Olmert's map, which Olmert refused to give him unless he signed off on it. Olmert told me he thought Abbas delayed partly because he hoped to get a better deal on the map from an Obama administration. Removing Ariel, in any case, remained perhaps the most freighted border dispute, since this settlement would be the most disruptive to Palestinian development.
WHO GETS JERUSALEM? Olmert and Abbas departed from transcendental claims to holy space and decided to base a solution on the practical challenge of governing the holy sites -- so as to maximize access for all pilgrims from the three Abrahamic religions -- and adherence to the principle that sovereignty derives from the consent of the governed.
The leaders agreed that Jewish neighborhoods should remain under Israeli sovereignty, while Arab neighborhoods would revert to Palestinian sovereignty. (Olmert even showed me an architectural sketch for a symbolic Palestinian checkpoint leading to the American Colony Hotel in Sheik Jarrah.) At the same time, Abbas suggested that East Jerusalem and West Jerusalem would be municipalities, but the city as a whole would not be divided. ''There would be an overall body to coordinate between them,'' he said.
The really creative ideas were about the disposition of the Old City and holy places -- the Islamic sites of the Haram Al-Sharif (or Temple Mount), the Western Wall, the Church of the Holy Sepulcher and so forth, which both sides agreed were indeed part of the ''holy basin.'' Olmert suggested that it be governed by a kind of custodial committee, made up of five countries: Palestine, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the U.S. and Israel. (Abbas was under the impression that as many as seven trustees might be involved, including Egypt and the Vatican.)
The trusteeship would maintain the holy sites and guarantee access for all religions; some kind of international force would administer it. Abbas accepted Olmert's proposal in principle, as long as the two could agree on precisely what the holy basin was. And there was the rub.
Olmert wanted the holy basin to include not only the Old City but also the Mount of Olives, the so-called City of David (an archaeological site) and a considerable part of the Arab neighborhood of Silwan. Abbas was willing to define the holy basin as the Old City only, since the Mount of Olives includes the Palestinian neighborhood of A-Tur, and he was unwilling to exclude residents of A-Tur and Silwan from a future Palestinian state. He implied, but did not say, that these neighborhoods had been inflamed by Jewish settlers. The extremist Ateret Cohanim, a settlement organization, has moved into expropriated apartment blocks there.
Olmert knew his offer was an important concession, one that redeemed in its way the U.N. partition plan of 1947, which envisioned ancient Jerusalem as an international city. ''You cannot come away from negotiations without a scar that will bleed for a long time,'' Olmert reflected. ''I, the mayor of Jerusalem, the man who stood in the front line advocating how the city was the one, undivided, eternal capital of the Jewish people, was the first to propose unambiguously not only the division of the city, which [Prime Minister Ehud] Barak did in a way, but to give up sovereignty over the entire holy basin. This is not something I did with joy; this is something I did with a broken heart.''
Abbas told me (as Olmert had) that he assumed the status quo regarding the governance of Islamic sites by a Palestinian religious authority would be preserved, and that he would try to get an endorsement for this plan from the Arab League.
And so the putatively impossible problem of Jerusalem now boiled down to the question of whether A-Tur and parts of Silwan would be excluded from Palestine and whether the Har Homa suburb would be excluded from Israel. I checked back with Olmert about the question of the holy basin, and he replied, ''The exact lines were not drawn, but I believe it could easily be agreed.''
THE RIGHT OF RETURN Olmert is a lawyer and appreciates, he told me, the usefulness of ''constructive ambiguity.'' With regard to Palestinian refugees -- as many as five million people descended mainly from those 750,000 who lost their homes in the 1948-49 war -- it was crucial, he said, ''to come up with a formula that allowed each side its own interpretation.'' Olmert agreed to allow 5,000 Palestinians to return to Israel proper, 1,000 a year for five years -- each applicant to be reviewed by Israel, and each accepted ''for humanitarian reasons.'' As ''an integral part'' of this offer, Olmert said, there would be a signing statement that strongly emphasized how repatriation of any refugees would be carried out ''in the spirit of the Arab League peace initiative of 2002.'' That initiative stipulates ''a just solution to the Palestinian refugee problem to be agreed upon in accordance with the U.N. General Assembly Resolution 194.'' And U.N. 194 resolves that ''the refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbors should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date, and that compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing not to return and for loss of or damage to property.''
Olmert suggested in addition that the peace plan include strong wording to the effect that ''Israel is sensitive and is not indifferent to the suffering of Palestinians who lived in what became Israel and were forced out of their homes as a result of the conflict and then lived in misery for years.'' He added that there should be some wording recognizing also the suffering of Jews from Arab countries who were forced out of their homes after 1948. Equally important, Olmert proposed that all sides work with international bodies and financial institutions to establish an international fund to ''generously compensate'' refugees for their loss of property. He made it clear that Israel would help organize this fund. ''In return for this,'' Olmert said, ''I expected a written commitment that this was the end of all claims and the end of the conflict.''
So Olmert did not specifically recognize the Palestinian right of return but agreed to do everything that someone who did recognize it would do, suggesting 5,000 returnees but leaving the exact number subject to further negotiation. (Olmert said the final number would be only ''symbolic'' and not more than 15,000.) Abbas, in this context, welcomed the principles but not the number: ''I told Olmert that I have five million refugees, all of them expelled from Israeli territories -- all of them. If I ask you to accept that all five million should return to Israel, you will tell me, and you are right, that I would destroy Israel. I said, O.K., let us talk about how to find a solution. But don't tell me that no single Palestinian can return to Israel'' -- by which he implied that 5,000 was a negligible number.
Palestinian negotiators have mostly accepted ''the modalities for compensation'' that were negotiated during the round of talks held in Taba, Egypt, and later made public: refugees could immigrate to Palestine or stay in the states in which they now lived (especially Jordan), or go to a third country. In exceptional cases, refugees could go to Israel. In all events, they would be compensated and their relocation paid for.
In other words, both leaders agreed on the principle that a certain number of Palestinians should return, but that the governing question should be how to limit that number in a way that preserves Israel's distinction as a state with a Jewish majority but that does not prejudice the rights of the Arab minority. As with the land question, the leaders agreed on the principle but disagreed about a number.
Abbas did not tell me what number of returnees he had in mind. The Geneva Initiative, in which people close to him participated, stipulated in 2009 that Israel should ''consider the average of the total numbers submitted'' by other nations that would accept Palestinian refugees. But this gave only vague guidance.
OLMERT KNEW THAT if he and Abbas -- with an American thumb on the scale -- produced a deal, he would then be facing something of a hard sell. That is why, he said, he made his comprehensive offer in September. He knew that the annual General Assembly of the United Nations was coming up. He wanted to prepare a world-historical diplomatic drama.
''My idea was that, before presenting it to our own peoples, we first would go to the U.N. Security Council and get a unanimous vote for support,'' Olmert told me. ''Then we would ask the General Assembly to support us, and you can imagine that if we both would ask, only Iran or Syria might say no. Then we would go to a joint session of Congress, then to the European Parliament, then a big ceremony on the White House lawn with 25,000 people, with all the leaders of the region where we would initial it.''
Olmert and Abbas would then return to the region, he said, and invite all the leaders of the world: ''No one would be missing, I suppose. The Chinese, the Russians, the Japanese, the Europeans, all the Americans, Canada, Australia -- you name it. And they would stand at that point connecting the west side of Jerusalem to the east side and declare their commitment to support the agreement in all its aspects. And then we would go to elections, with the accumulated impact of this process at our backs.''
Olmert made his most comprehensive offer to Abbas on Sept. 16, 2008, the opening day of the General Assembly in New York. Abbas then ''went silent'' (as Olmert puts it), weighing a response as the Gaza border was heating up, not sure which American presidency the Palestinian leadership would confront -- and also questioning the point of continuing negotiations with a lame-duck prime minister. (Olmert was under investigation for corruption and announced in late July that he would be stepping aside once his Kadima Party chose a new leader.) Yet negotiations were not formally suspended until January, after Israel attacked in Gaza. Rice had invited the sides to meet in Washington. Olmert, facing political exile and preoccupied with the war, failed to send his chief diplomatic aide, Shalom Turgeman, to the meeting. But Abbas was still determined that American diplomacy could bridge the gaps and was ready to risk the embarrassment of sending Saeb Erakat, the Palestinians' longtime chief negotiator, to meet Israeli representatives while Gazans were under Israeli fire. ''I had promised Bush,'' Abbas explained. ''I thought: There would be fruit from this meeting. Let us seize this opportunity.''
To this day, Abbas still expects America to put the deal over. The gaps appear so pitifully small: Ariel and a couple of other settlements, the question of whether parts of Silwan would be a part of the holy basin, a compromise number on refugees? ''We still want bridging proposals,'' Abbas told me, adding, ''we want America to be a strong broker.''
Without a deal, Jerusalem and the West Bank will almost certainly explode again, this time perhaps igniting the kind of local war we saw in Bosnia: violence spreading to Israeli Arab towns and drawing in both Syrian-backed Hezbollah from Lebanon and Hamas from Gaza, each armed with thousands of missiles. ''Jerusalem is becoming a tinderbox; it could explode any minute,'' the Palestinian pollster Khalil Shikaki told me recently. ''We now see the collapse of the nonviolent vision but not the replacement. . . . Any unilateral Palestinian step [to statehood] will be meaningless -- no one is fooled by this. There is fatigue. They don't want to go back to the days of bloodshed. I think when they reach the conclusion, 'The hell with it,' we'll go back to that dark period, then all hell will break loose.''
But Abbas could anyway soon be gone. He told me he expects America to act to bring about a plan by this fall. That is what the Obama administration once promised, that it would work to secure a deal on a Palestinian state by September 2011. ''If nothing happens, I will take a very, very painful decision,'' Abbas said. ''Don't ask me about it.'' He grew wistful. ''We have to live with each other. We have to talk with each other. We have to know each other. Many have criticized me since the 1970s, but until now I am committed to peace. But not forever. I don't mean I will return back to violence -- never! In my life, I will never do it. But I cannot stay in my office forever doing nothing.''
OLMERT AND ABBAS conveyed the details of what they had achieved to both Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and George Mitchell, the Middle East envoy. Condoleezza Rice, Olmert said, prepared a confidential memo for the incoming administration. He could not understand why Obama ''did not adopt these achievements as policy.'' Abbas told me he is still waiting for an American initiative: ''America is the broker; we cannot replace it.'' Did he want the understandings he reached with Olmert to become the basis of new American-sponsored talks with Netanyahu? ''I demanded this,'' he said.
Olmert made his offer as a sitting prime minister familiar with the views of the Israeli general staff and military intelligence. Now, with a new regime taking shape in Egypt and serious changes under way in Jordan, Israel will be more dependent on American diplomacy and military support than ever. It is hard to imagine Netanyahu resisting an Obama initiative should the president fully commit to an American package based on these talks and rally the E.U., Russia and the United Nations.
Abbas, for his part, still leads the P.L.O. and governs the West Bank. Hamas controls Gaza but has committed to honoring any deal Abbas negotiated for the 1967 borders as long as its terms would be submitted to a referendum, which Abbas has solemnly promised to call.
''There is a danger that the events in Egypt will mislead some to lose hope in peace,'' Olmert told me pointedly in an e-mail. ''I think the opposite, that there can be another way to challenge the events near us. This is the time to move forward, fast, take my peace initiative with the Palestinians and make a deal. This will be my advice to Prime Minister Netanyahu. Don't wait. Move, lead and make history. This is the time. There will not be a better one.''

HEADLINE: A Block of Swells With a Thing Against the Zoo

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY. 
E-mail: streetscapes@nytimes.com

 BODY:
YOU can barely see it now, the little 1871 brownstone at 815 Fifth Avenue, concealed by construction netting. Indeed, all its peers have vanished, too, although those were lost to the wrecker's ball. This block of Fifth, between 62nd and 63rd Streets, had the earliest town house on Fifth Avenue opposite Central Park, and its thumbnail biography paints a picture of Fifth as a street of single, not multiple, dwellings.
Much of Central Park was completed by the mid-1860s. The pioneer town house builder on Fifth opposite the park was Runyon Martin, who had been living on lower Seventh Avenue. Mr. Martin does not present much of a target for the researcher, although he did once sue Jay Gould over a financial matter. Mr. Martin's architect, Jacob Wrey Mould, gave him No. 816, a violent, High Victorian Gothic sneeze of color, daring contrasts in stripes and blocks. A sales brochure for an adjacent property in 1869 promised that ''as a future center of elegant buildings and high values, this is not to be surpassed.'' 
Others agreed, and the block filled in almost completely in the 1870s, including a pair of Italianate brownstones at 814 and 815 Fifth in 1871. The residents were rich, like Thomas Rutter of No. 814, at one time the president of the New York Central Railroad, and William Belden of No. 810, a partner of Jay Gould. Mr. Belden later sold to Catherine Wolfe Bruce, a patron of astronomy after whom an asteroid was named ''323 Brucia'' in 1891.
But life in a Fifth Avenue town house was not without its concerns. In 1883 Mr. Belden, worried about the heat, went to the basement and found his boilerman, Thomas Sullivan, apparently drunk, and the steam pressure at twice the safe level. Mr. Sullivan popped him in the face. In 1885 the owners of 811, 813, 814, 815, 816, and 817 Fifth Avenue tried to persuade the Board of Estimate to remove the zoo from Central Park, saying the animals ''pollute the soil, thus rendering it offensive and unwholesome.'' The zoo won the argument.
The paradigm of the urban mansion started crumbling in the 1910s, when the apartment house for the upper classes was perfected. There followed a flood of new tall-building construction, and the midblock mansions were bookended by the present 810 Fifth on the south and 817 Fifth to the north.
These buildings had full-floor apartments, and No. 810 offered a drawing room with 28 feet of exposure on Fifth Avenue; this would not have fit inside any of the old town houses.
The ''servant problem'' (really, an employer problem) is often cited for the move to apartment houses, although a quantitative study remains to be done. The 1900 census of the entire row reported a total of 15 employers and 28 servants. But the 1930 census of the two apartment buildings found the master/servant ratio pretty much unchanged, 29/53.
Some people held on to their single-family town houses, like No. 815, the residence of Verna Cushman, noted for her philanthropy, and her husband, James Stewart Cushman, who had started the Allerton chain of women's hotel residences. Mr. Cushman, a Mayflower descendant, was active in Newport society.
Mrs. Cushman altered the front of the building, in 1923 hiring Murgatroyd & Ogden -- who did many of the Allerton hotels -- to simplify it. The Cushmans' neighbor at 814 Fifth was the investment banker and art collector Jules S. Bache. Like many rich men, he wanted his house to survive him as a museum, his Raphael, Rembrandts and other works on the wall just as he had enjoyed them, but his collection wound up at the Metropolitan Museum.
The controversial financier Serge Rubinstein bought the Bache house in 1944. He had angered various governments with his currency manipulations and shady accounting. But it was a conviction for draft evasion that resulted in different living quarters -- two years at Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary.
In 1955 he was found in the town house dead in his silk pajamas, his hands bound. The murder was never solved. Mr. Rubinstein had many enemies; Time magazine quoted a reporter as saying, ''They've narrowed the list of suspects down to 10,000.''
In 1961 the houses at 812, 813 and 814 were on their last legs, economically, when the developer Sarah Korein bought them. Alice Snow Lucey, who lived at 813 with a female servant and an Airedale, was the last to leave, and her house was razed with the others for what became the bare-bones modern apartment house at 812 Fifth Avenue.
By that time, 815 Fifth had been almost completely stripped, cut up into small apartments, of which one -- on the back -- is now for rent for $3,300 a month.
Only the rusticated stonework on the ground floor survives, and that is covered by layers of brown paint. It is probable that the 19th-century residents of 815 Fifth, now hemmed in by tall apartment buildings, would not recognize their own house -- or even their own block.

HEADLINE: For Groups That Sell Goods Abroad, Help From U.S. Taxpayers

BYLINE: By RON NIXON; Barclay Walsh contributed reporting from Washington, and Vikas Bajaj from Mumbai, India.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In India, one of the most-talked-about television programs is the reality show ''Let's Design.''
Aspiring designers create fashionable outfits using cotton, and this year India's leading fashion house will showcase the winner's clothing in its store; the winner will also be profiled in the fashion magazine Verve and win a trip to Paris to meet international designers.
And the American taxpayer helps foot the bill.
The show, now in its third season, is the creation of the Cotton Council International, a trade association representing the United States cotton industry. The council received $20.3 million in matching funds last year under a United States Agriculture Department program to promote and advertise products abroad. 
The money given out under the Market Access Program is used by agricultural trade associations like the cotton council to pay for advertising, consumer promotions, market research, technical assistance and travel.
''This program plays a role in keeping the demand for cotton strong,'' said Allen A. Terhaar, executive director of the council.
Over the last decade, the program has provided nearly $2 billion in taxpayer money to agriculture trade associations and farmer cooperatives. The promotions are as varied as a manual for pet owners in Japan and a class at a Mexican culinary school to teach aspiring chefs how to cook rice for Mexican consumers. Money also went to large farmer-owned cooperatives like Sunkist, Welch's and Blue Diamond, which grows and sells almonds. Combined, the three companies had over $2 billion in sales in 2009.
But as the country wrestles with a still-shaky economy and a rising deficit, the program faces new calls for its demise. It has long been a target of criticism from both sides of the political spectrum, including liberal groups like the U.S. Public Interest Research Group and the conservative National Taxpayers Union.
The Republican Study Committee, a conservative bloc of House lawmakers, also identified the program as one of 100 that should be eliminated to help reduce the deficit. And even the Obama administration, which generally supports the program, wants to reduce it by 20 percent, saying it ''overlaps with other Department of Agriculture trade promotion programs, and its economic impact is unclear.''
Supporters say the program has helped American farmers and growers expand or create markets for their products around the world.
''We think it's well justified,'' said Jay Howell, a lobbyist who coordinates the Coalition to Promote U.S. Agricultural Exports, the industry's effort to keep the program financed. ''It has helped lots of people around the country in small towns and rural communities.''
Mr. Howell and other supporters point to a 2010 study by the Agriculture Department showing that for every dollar that government and industry spend on promotion, agricultural exports increase by $35
Supporters say the program has been changed from earlier incarnations that allowed billion-dollar companies like McDonald's, Tyson Foods and Seagram to get money to advertise abroad. Now the money can go only to a trade association or a nonprofit cooperative, rather than directly to big companies.
''The issues that most critics have with the program relates to what happened in the '80s and early '90s, and those issues have largely been resolved,'' said Michael Wootton, senior vice president for corporate relations at Sunkist.
That argument has not convinced people like Ryan Alexander, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a Washington budget watchdog group.
''If you want to compete overseas, you should produce excellent products, not ads,'' Ms. Alexander said. ''Besides, companies like Sunkist have enough to do their own advertising.''
The Obama administration says it wants to revise the program so it focuses more on small businesses and generic products and not name brands like Sunkist. It also wants to make sure big companies do not indirectly benefit as members of trade associations.
Although companies like Cargill, Tyson Foods, Archer Daniels Midland and Monsanto cannot directly receive money, they do benefit from advertising and promotions as members of trade associations.
Sunkist, Welch's and Blue Diamond are cooperatives owned by farmers and are eligible for government funds for their promotions abroad. The companies received more than $6 million last year, with about $4 million going to Sunkist alone.
But promotions like the ''Let's Design'' show have drawn the most ire.
India is the second-largest cotton producer in the world, behind China; last year it produced nearly twice as much cotton as the United States. India is also the No. 2 exporter of cotton, behind the United States. The Cotton Council International says the ''Let's Design'' show was created to promote the use of cotton in general, not necessarily cotton from the United States.
So why spend money promoting cotton in a country where production of the crop consistently outpaces domestic demand?
One reason, according to Mr. Terhaar of the Cotton Council, is to help keep the price of cotton high and to promote cotton over synthetic materials. The second reason is to create a future market for American exports.
''Right now, India produces enough cotton for its domestic consumption,'' Mr. Terhaar said. ''But as the textile industry there grows and as the middle class expands, there's going to be a demand for more cotton, and it will be more than they are able to produce. We want to keep cotton in front of the India consumers, and the Market Access Program helps us do that.''
So far, arguments like that have won over a number of lawmakers from both parties, including Representative Doc Hastings, Republican of Washington. Last year, Mr. Hastings, an outspoken critic of wasteful government spending, was one of 65 legislators who signed a letter to the Department of Agriculture urging it to keep the program. In 2001, he sponsored legislation that increased the annual financing for the Market Access Program to $200 million from $90 million.
Mr. Hastings's chief of staff, Jessica Gleason, said: ''In Washington State, trade equals economic growth and jobs. Representative Hastings totally supports the Market Access Program.''
The industry is counting on such support. The trade associations that received money from the Market Access Program spent nearly $100 million lobbying the federal government over the last 10 years, records show. The trade associations and their members gave $84 million in campaign contributions over the same time, mostly to Republicans.
Repeatedly, the Market Access Program has defied presidential and Congressional budget-cutting efforts as the industry has rallied lawmakers from agricultural states.
Still, budget hawks like Citizens Against Government Waste are cautiously optimistic that the new crop of anti-spending Republicans in Congress will be less supportive of projects like the Market Access Program.
''Most of these people were elected by promising to cut wasteful spending,'' said Leslie Paige, a spokeswoman for Citizens Against Government Waste. ''It's going to be really hard for them to go back home to people who've lost their jobs or have had a reduction in pay and tell them that they should be paying for the advertising of some of the largest companies in the country.''

HEADLINE: Andrew Mann

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
Mr. Mann, 55, is the managing director of the United States operations of Gardiner & Theobald, a project management and construction consultant with offices worldwide.
He is overseeing several projects, including the Brooklyn Bridge Park and the United Nations. His firm represented Proskauer Rose in its recent relocation to 11 Times Square.
Q What do you do at Gardiner & Theobald? 
A G & T is over 900 people around the world in 25 countries. I'm responsible for the U.S. offices, which is basically New York, Los Angeles and Washington, along with one lone fellow down in Anguilla in our Caribbean group. Actually I'll be visiting him in a couple of weeks. But I center on New York City.
Q What services does the company provide?
A The project manager controls the cost, the quality and the schedule. If you lose control of any of those things, you've lost control of the project. The client should see us as an extension of his organization. A construction project is a complicated process; you're working with a team.
Q How's business these days?
A What we've seen over the last three to four months is an increase in activity. There are more larger projects and larger assignments out there.
We have gone through a very bad recession, but we haven't been as hard hit as other firms, because we're so diversified. Another thing, which is important, is that 80 percent of our business is repeat client business.
Q Tell me about current projects.
A We're doing numerous projects around the city: the Whitney Museum; Brooklyn Bridge Park; the United Nations; the Police Academy for the city at College Point. For the Whitney, we're building a new museum to anchor the base of the High Line. And we just finished the Proskauer project at 11 Times Square.
Q Are you working with any other clients at 11 Times Square?
A No.
Q How's the United Nations project coming along?
A You have to move off that particular project. We're very proud to be the project manager for the United Nations, but I am held by confidentiality agreements.
Q Is the public sector the primary source of your clientele?
A I would say it's about 30 percent public governmental and 70 percent private, spread across several fields like hospitality, commercial interiors, landlord work, repositioning of buildings.
Q Would you say that you work mostly with customers for whom construction is a foreign language?
A Yes, but we also did the renovation of 1095 Avenue of the Americas for Equity Office. Equity Office had a great deal of experience in development obviously, but they were based in Chicago and needed somebody they could trust to run the project in New York. Also, you get other development groups that have a relatively small development team and for major projects want to increase, and we support them.
Q Are you involved with many distressed properties?
A We have a service for major investors, banks or funders of construction projects. We go in and assess these buildings and see what's left to be done. Normally they're half finished or they haven't started their renovation projects We make sure the lender's interests are looked after.
Q How's your on-time record for the projects you oversee?
A As long as they don't change in scope, 95 to 98 percent of our projects are on time. The ones that aren't are usually because of an issue that nobody knew about, like soil contamination.
Q And for staying on budget?
A The vast majority of the time, about 90 percent. Again, the times when the budgets change are when the scope changes.
Q Have there been delays because of the inclement weather?
A Most of our projects currently are interior, and interior projects are not normally susceptible to the weather. But the snowstorm after Christmas was pretty unique in that it stopped us from getting trucks and materials in. At 11 Times Square it was down to the wire, but we got there. We had shifts of people working. I couldn't get the trucks in. You have to think out of the box.
Q You must travel a lot.
A I've worked in London, Dublin, Paris, Atlanta and now New York. For anybody in my business, doing a tower in New York is something you aim to do. We did The New York Times's new headquarters, we're now doing Brooklyn Bridge Park -- the largest park being built in 100 years, since Prospect Park. That's the type of thing that we like to do. No, you're not getting rid of me!

HEADLINE: It May Make Them Think Twice

 BODY:
Financial regulators certainly took their time, but proposed new rules to curb bankers' bonuses are a welcome step toward changing a compensation culture that encouraged irresponsible risk-taking and helped set off the financial crisis. 
The new rules, outlined by the F.D.I.C. last week, would require banks with more than $50 billion in assets to defer at least half of their top executives' bonuses for at least three years. If the banks' bets went bad, the executives would lose the unpaid portions. The same criteria would apply to the bonuses of traders and other employees whose activities could put their banks at risk.
The sound idea is that bankers' remuneration should match the risks they take on. That should help discourage them from doing deals that produce big short-term profits (and up until now big immediate bonuses) only to fall apart a few years down the line.
Banks would have to file annual reports on their incentive compensation, and regulators could demand changes to pay structures. Smaller banks would not have to meet specific targets on deferred bonuses, but they would have to ensure that incentive compensation aligned pay with risk, and report to regulators yearly.
The rules are good, but they could be better. The European Union agreed to new rules last year that require European banks to defer 40 to 60 percent of top bankers' bonuses for three to five years and pay as much as 80 percent of their remuneration in equity rather than cash.
Since the meltdown, most big American banks have adjusted their compensation structure and already meet the new criteria. The good news here is that regulators are finally acknowledging that their laissez faire approach to bankers' compensation helped drive the crisis. The regulations also mean that banks and bankers cannot as easily slip back into their bad habits once the good economic times return.
For the new rules to take effect, they must be formally approved by all the regulators involved in their making, including the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Then the public has 45 days to comment before final rules are published. Bonuses for 2010 have already been decided. We urge regulators to get the rules in place long before the 2011 bonus season gets under way.

HEADLINE: Cabin Fever: Finding Cruise Deals

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
WITH cruise bookings on the upswing, bargains are tougher to find this year. But it's still possible to nab a deal, if you act quickly.
To secure the best rates, travelers must act soon as seasonal promotions designed to spur early bookings are drying up. Expedia's Winter Getaways Cruise Sale, for example, which offers savings of up to 75 percent off certain sailings, ends Feb. 28. So does MSC Cruises' Summer Sail Abration, which offers rates from $899 a person on a variety of seven-night cruises in Northern Europe.
Some of the best deals also have limited availability or are offered for just a few sailing dates. Avalon Waterways, a river cruise operator, is offering up to $500 off per person on roughly a dozen European sailings, bringing the rate for its four-day Taste of the Danube cruise, May 7 or June 25, to $449 a person. It is also waiving the single supplement fee on certain cruises booked by March 1 -- but only for five rooms per departure. 
While it's possible that cruise lines will cut rates at the last minute, procrastinators risk being closed out if ships fill up. ''Clients are again tending to book early, often a year out, particularly for popular destinations like the Mediterranean and Northern Europe,'' said Jim Work, an owner of Cruise Holidays in Alexandria, Va. More exotic itineraries like Africa and Southeast Asia are also filling up sooner, he said.
Below, a guide on how to cut your cruise costs.
Use an Agent
Unlike the airlines, which have been severing ties with travel agents and online agencies in recent years, cruise lines still rely on outside travel sellers. In some cases they offer special promotions through agencies. In others, the agencies buy up blocks of rooms in advance to secure the best rates for their clients.
CruiseDeals.com, based in Charlotte, N.C., bought up blocks of rooms on popular sailings six months to a year ago to lock in the lowest rates and perks like onboard credits for things like spa treatments or specialty restaurants. For example, a seven-night Alaska cruise on the Celebrity Infinity departing from Seattle on Sept. 2 is $929 a person, with tax, for an inside cabin with a $125 onboard credit, per room, through CruiseDeals.com's call center. Celebrity's rate for the same cabin and sailing is $1,179 a person without the credit. A couple booking through CruiseDeals.com saves $625.
Another site, CruiseCompete.com, allows you to select the cruise you want to take, and independent travel agents compete to offer you the best deal. You compare the offers in your account, then contact the agent with the best rates directly by phone or e-mail to book.
Consider an Older Ship
Not surprisingly, the newest vessels command the highest prices. But as cruise lines continue to build new ships with bigger and better pools, spas and other features in an effort to outdo one another, booking an older ship doesn't necessarily mean less comfort or fewer amenities.
Travelers aren't ''sacrificing something crucial by skipping over the latest, greatest vessel,'' said Evan Eggers, president of SureCruise.com, a cruise search site. Opting for a ship one generation older than the newest can save travelers 12 to 27 percent on average for a seven-day Caribbean vacation, according to SureCruise.com. In the case of Royal Caribbean, this would mean choosing Freedom Class instead of Oasis Class. Or in the case of Norwegian, booking a Jewel Class ship instead of Epic. Choosing a ship two classes back like Norwegian's Star can save up to 40 percent. A seven-night Caribbean cruise departing from Miami early next year starts at $649 a person on the Norwegian Epic, the line's newest ship, while a seven-night Caribbean cruise on Norwegian's Pearl, a Jewel Class ship launched in 2006, starts at $449 a person. On the Star, which made its debut in 2001 and was refurbished in 2004, the price drops to $379 a person.
''All of these ships,'' Mr. Eggers said, ''deliver a modern vacation experience with the amenities to keep everybody in the family entertained.''
Time It Right
Cayole.com, a new clutter-free cruise search site, offers price predictions based on seven months or more of data to give cruisers an idea of whether they should buy now or wait for a possible price drop. For example, by clicking ''get more details'' for Celebrity Century's April 2 departure from Miami for a western Caribbean cruise, the site recommended that travelers booking suites -- the top level cabins -- buy ''as soon as possible, because prices are likely to increase.'' For interior, ocean view or balcony cabins it said, ''prices may go down.''
But consider your risk tolerance before making a decision on whether to wait for a better rate. The site doesn't list every cruise in its search and points out that ''no model can predict with 100 percent accuracy what the future prices of cruises are going to be.''
In general, the cheapest rates for a given sailing tend to be at the very beginning or end of a cruising season, according to CruiseCritic.com. Prices often drop on Alaska cruises in May and September, for example, when the weather is cooler. Caribbean and Mexico cruises usually cost less in early fall. But be prepared for a shift in itinerary if a hurricane threatens a port of call. While storms are easily avoided by cruise ships, they may require a significant change in course.
Being flexible with your travel dates may also result in savings. A seven-night Alaska cruise on Holland America's Westerdam, departing from Seattle on June 25, was $1,799 a person for a balcony cabin at Cayole.com. Departing on the same ship with the same itinerary one week earlier was $200 less a person. A large inside cabin was $300 less a person.
Go Upscale
Luxury cruise rates fell the most amid the recession. Though prices are recovering, their steep drop means that they have farther to go to catch up.
Silversea Cruises is offering a $1,000 spending credit per couple on 25 new voyages in Northern Europe and the Mediterranean and a $500 credit per couple on nearly 40 other voyages for bookings made by June 30. That's on top of Silver Savings fares, which offer up to 60 percent off many of its cruises, normally $8,000 a person on average. And Crystal Cruises' fall voyages are now on sale with reduced fares from $2,400 a person (down from $5,300) for a balcony room on a Mexican cruise, $5,420 a person (from $6,170) for a 14-day Panama Canal cruise and $6,050 a person (from $7,050) for an 11-day trip from Barcelona to Athens.
On top of those rate cuts, passengers also receive up to $2,000 a couple in shipboard credits and free airfare, depending on the cruise, with Crystal's ''All Inclusive. As You Wish'' promotion.

HEADLINE: Will All Flight Paths Lead to Dubai?

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates
BEYOND the artificial archipelagoes shaped like palm trees, not far from the tallest skyscraper in the world, stands another monument to this city-state's stubborn ambition.
Even in this oasis of extravagance, Terminal 3 at the Dubai International Airport startles. It is not merely the world's largest air terminal. It is the world's largest building, period. And all 370 acres of it -- all 82 moving walkways, 97 escalators, 157 elevators, 180 check-in counters and 2,600 parking spaces -- were built with one very well-connected company in mind: Emirates, Dubai's fast-growing flagship airline.
Emirates is pressing ahead with an ambitious expansion, despite the city's financial near-collapse in 2009. Its executives, with the help of Dubai's rulers, want to place this Persian Gulf city at the center of a transportation network linking vibrant economies like India and China to Europe and the United States. 
It might sound like bravado from the bubble years, another case of overreach in this sandy fantasyland. This is, after all, Dubai, where exuberant developers planned not one but three palm-shaped island chains and erected the glass-clad Burj Khalifa -- more than twice the height of the Empire State Building -- alongside an indoor ski resort. What is more, the recent political upheaval in Egypt provides a potent reminder that Dubai, for all its air-conditioned ease and stability, lives in a dangerous neighborhood.
But here inside Terminal 3, the rise of Emirates hardly seems a mirage. Since its founding in 1985, Emirates, which is fully owned by the government, has grown into the world's largest airline by passenger miles flown. By 6:30 a.m., Terminal 3 is teeming with travelers. Russians bound for Durban, Chinese headed for Khartoum and Indians traveling to San Francisco weave through the restaurants and duty-free shops. Families snooze on the white marble floors. It feels like a giant bazaar, devoted to a new era of air travel: crowded, animated, cosmopolitan.
Tim Clark, the president of Emirates, says his airline represents the future of mass air travel. In an era when many international carriers are struggling to sustain themselves, Emirates has filled its planes, raised fares and consistently turned a profit. It earned $925 million in the six months ended last Sept. 30, up from $205 million in the year-earlier period.
To win over customers, its executives want to bring a bit of glamour back to air travel. On the double-decker Airbus A380s, full bars are standard in business class, and the first-class cabin includes showers. No one pays for food or drinks, of course, on any Emirates flight.
So far, Emirates' success is partly an accident of geography. Roughly four billion people live within an eight-hour flight from here. But to the consternation of rivals, Emirates also enjoys the patronage of Dubai's rulers, in particular, Sheik Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum, who is its chairman. While home-grown airlines in places like Singapore and Hong Kong have also turned those cities into global hubs, Emirates stands apart for the scale of its ambitions.
COMPETITORS are fighting back. SkyTeam, the global alliance that includes Delta Air Lines and Air France/KLM, said recently that it would add two airlines -- Middle East Airlines, from Lebanon, and Saudi Airlines -- to counter Emirates' dominance in the region.
''There is a reason that airlines around the world are afraid of the success of Emirates,'' says John Leahy, chief operating officer of Airbus, the European plane maker, referring to Emirates' mix of quality service, operating efficiency and low costs. ''That should strike fear in the hearts of airlines around the world.'' Emirates is one of Airbus's top customers.
Over the next two decades, air travel in the Middle East is expected to grow by more than 7 percent a year, outpacing every other region, according to a forecast from Boeing in 2010. Much of that growth will be spurred by Emirates and two other fast-expanding airlines based in the Persian Gulf area: Etihad Airlines, based in Abu Dhabi, and Qatar Airways.
Emirates is by far the most ambitious of the three. Its greatest strides have come from building routes to developing countries long neglected by traditional carriers and providing an alternative to local airlines. Instead of connecting through European hubs like London or Frankfurt, all of these new routes run through Dubai.
''The legacy carriers still see us as the monster of the Middle East, the bete noir of civil aviation in the 21st century,'' says Mr. Clark, 61. ''But they won't accept that the business we are carrying wasn't theirs anyway. The 21st century is very different from the 20th century.''
Emirates, for instance, offers 184 flights a week from Dubai to India, to cities like Ahmedabad, the commercial hub in the state of Gujarat. It flies to 17 cities in Africa and, in China, to Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Guangzhou. It runs two daily flights to Bangkok and nine to Australia.
The strategy has prompted a strong reaction from airlines like Air France and Lufthansa of Germany. These carriers hope to persuade their governments to limit Emirates' access to French and German airports.
''Emirates' strategy is aggressive,'' says Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, the chief executive of Air France, who complains that Emirates is siphoning off passengers from Europe's traditional hubs. ''Europe is at the center of the global aviation world. It's the result of aviation history.''
Wolfgang Mayrhuber, the C.E.O. of Lufthansa, notes that it took 40 years for Lufthansa to build up its fleet of 30 Boeing 747s in Germany, one of the world's largest economies. Emirates already flies 15 A380s, the world's largest passenger airliners, and has ordered 75 more for delivery by 2018. (Air France, Lufthansa and British Airways have ordered a total of 39 A380s and, among them, have only eight flying.)
In Canada, discussions to expand Emirates' landing rights took a particularly bitter turn. After the Canadian government turned down Emirates' request to fly to Calgary and Vancouver and to increase the frequency of flights to Toronto, the United Arab Emirates scrapped a military agreement that allowed Canadian forces to use a logistical base near Dubai.
Craig Jenks, an airline consultant based in New York, says Emirates threatens established carriers in the one market where these airlines are making money: long-haul international trips. ''There's nothing better than a highly motivated cowboy airline in a small country,'' he says.
LIKE so much in Dubai, Emirates started out small but dreamed big. It was established after Gulf Air, a regional airline then owned by Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and the United Arab Emirates, reduced its service to Dubai in the early 1980s. Feeling shunned, Dubai's rulers created their own carrier.
The government provided $10 million in capital. Emirates began flying with two planes, a Boeing 737 and an Airbus A300, both leased from Pakistan International Airlines. The new carrier was run by a band of British aviation executives, including Mr. Clark, who had been at Gulf Air, and Maurice Flanagan, a former top executive at British Airways.
Much of Emirates' early traffic connected Dubai with cities throughout the Indian subcontinent and a few European destinations, including London.
By the 1990s, however, new airplanes with longer reach, like Boeing 777s, enabled Emirates to establish Dubai as a world hub. Sheikh Ahmed, the company's chairman, boldly proclaimed that Dubai would be ''at the center of the new Silk Road between East and West.''
Rivals express grudging admiration for Emirates. ''Emirates recognized the value of a global hub,'' says British Airways' chairman, Willie Walsh.
And Mr. Clark says: ''If you want to go from Africa to Asia, or from South America to China, the straight line is through the Middle East.''
But geography is only one element in the Emirates formula. Government support has also been essential. From the start, Emirates was seen as integral to the government's ambitions of building Dubai into a commercial, financial and tourism center in the Persian Gulf.
Sheik Ahmed plays a role in almost every aspect of air travel into and out of Dubai. Indeed, he is known as ''Mr. Aviation.'' He is the chairman of FlyDubai, the city-state's budget airline, and of Dnata, the airport's ground handling company. He is also the president of the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority, which oversees the industry. And he happens to be the uncle of Dubai's current ruler, Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum.
Critics say this tight relationship among Emirates, airport authorities and regulators gives the airline an unfair advantage. Emirates, these critics say, essentially receives government subsidies, in the form of low tax rates and shiny new facilities like Terminal 3, where another expansion is under way to accommodate Emirates' growing fleet of A380s.
Emirates disputes this characterization. The airline publishes audited financial reports, and its executives say Emirates gets no government subsidies.
''Emirates works like a corporation,'' says Ram C. Menen, who runs the company's global cargo operations. ''We're a business unit of Dubai Inc. And it's a happy relationship.''
The airline, however, does have undeniable advantages over competitors, including lower labor costs. While Emirates pays its pilots international wages, it hires inexpensive workers, usually from the Indian subcontinent, for tasks like handling baggage or working in catering services.
Nathan Zielke, a transportation specialist at the consulting company Arthur D. Little, estimates that Emirates' overall costs, including those for labor, are 30 percent lower than those of its rivals.
''It's extremely difficult for other airlines to close that gap,'' Mr. Zielke says. ''Because their costs are so much lower, Middle East carriers will be the most profitable carriers with the lowest prices in the market.''
ON the road to Abu Dhabi, about an hour's drive from downtown Dubai, city planners want to build the world's biggest airport. It would have five parallel runways and be able to accommodate 160 million passengers a year. (Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport now handles 90 million passengers a year, more than any other airport in the world.) The estimated cost of this giant is more than $34 billion.
Although Dubai has shaken off the worst of its financial crisis, the shock has nonetheless stalled this grand plan for now.
Yet Emirates has proved remarkably resilient to recent financial shocks -- the economic slowdown did not hamper its growth. The question now is whether Emirates can sustain its momentum without jeopardizing quality and service.
Each week, as many as 90 new trainees file through the company's training academy, a modern building near the Tennis Club, a popular Dubai spot among the expatriate community, close to the historical center of the city.
Its growing fleet of A380s means that the airline will need to hire an additional 11,000 flight attendants in coming years, nearly doubling its current roster of 12,000. Over eight weeks of training, the new employees -- most in their early 20s and speaking some English -- learn all the ropes of the job. Life-size mock-ups of airline cabins mounted on hydraulic legs are used to simulate safety drills. Elsewhere, the trainees are taught how to serve meals or use the first-aid kits.
Emirates executives say they recognize the challenges ahead. ''We don't forget who we are, and what we do,'' says Mr. Clark, the president. ''We're a bus company. We have seats, we have people, and we recognize what it is that makes life more comfortable. If we hit the spot, passengers come back.''
Emirates has emerged as a formidable player on the international travel scene. Its innovations, including private suites in first class and individual entertainment screens in the coach cabin, have been copied by many other airlines; its emphasis on quality has forced traditional legacy carriers to pay more attention to their own products.
So far, Emirates has benefited from the weakness of some airlines in China, India and African nations as it establishes its presence in those and other developing countries.
But that advantage may one day come to an end. In India, the advent of a new generation of quality carriers, including Kingfisher Airlines and Jet Airways, now offers some appealing domestic alternatives for India's vast expatriate population, long one of Emirates' growth engines.
The recent tensions in Egypt, Yemen and Jordan have also hurt Emirates. Mr. Clark said last week that traffic to many of these destinations had a ''pretty resounding'' drop as tourists postponed holiday plans.
Another threat is on the horizon. As more airlines start using long-range planes now in development, like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus A350, they will be able to fly more people nonstop to most any other place in the world. That could pose a problem for the Emirates business model: its reliance on the Dubai hub.
''One survey that is consistent is that people simply do not like to change planes,'' says Richard L. Aboulafia, an aviation consultant at the Teal Group, a consulting firm in Fairfax, Va. But, he added, ''Underestimating the competition is a time-honored feature of the airline business. Is it confidence or is it hubris? It is only hubris if you lose.''

HEADLINE: Huff and Puff and Blow Your House Down

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
Under the weight of record snows, roofs across the Northeast have been buckling this winter, raining debris on children skating in ice rinks, crushing cows and tractors in farmers' barns and even flattening a garage full of antique cars. In December, nearly 18 inches of new heavy snow brought down the roof of the Metrodome in Minneapolis, forcing the Vikings to temporarily relocate to Detroit.
And it was not just American infrastructure that appeared to be under the weather, so to speak. In Brisbane, Australia, January storms ripped apart a riverside boardwalk -- turning a concrete section 150 yards long into a waterborne torpedo that threatened downstream bridges. The wall of a Hungarian reservoir holding toxic red sludge crumbled in October after weeks of downpours, sending the waste into nearby villages. The litany of extreme weather events has often left local officials scrambling to respond to each new crisis, looking -- by turns pathetic and heroic -- like the little Dutch boy with his finger in the dike, trying to fend off nature's monumental forces. 
Global warming is most likely responsible, at least in part, for the rising frequency and severity of extreme weather events -- like floods, storms and droughts -- since warmer surface temperatures tend to produce more violent weather patterns, scientists say. And the damage these events have caused is a sign that the safety factors that engineers, architects and planners have previously built into structures are becoming inadequate for the changing climate.
Dikes, buildings and bridges are often built to withstand a ''hundred-year storm'' -- an event so epic that there is a 1 percent chance it will happen in a given year. But what happens when 100-year storms are seen every 10 years, and 10-year storms become regular events? How many structures will reach their limits?
Engineers and insurers are already facing these questions. Munich Re, one of the world's largest insurance companies, says climate-related events serious enough to cause property damage have risen significantly since 1980: extreme floods tripled and extreme windstorms nearly so. (The number of damaging earthquakes -- which are not thought to be influenced by climate change -- have remained stable.) Statistics show that the frequency of days with heavy precipitation is up in South America, North America and parts of Europe.
''Your own perception that there are more storms and more flooding causing damage -- that is extremely well documented,'' said Peter Hoeppe, a meteorologist who is the head of Munich Re's Corporate Climate Center. ''There is definitely a plausible link to climate change.''
For insurers, the challenge has been how to insure structures against the vicissitudes of increasingly extreme and severe weather. For engineers, new weather raises difficult questions about what kinds of safety factors should be built into designs and whether old structures need retrofitting or reinforcing.
''As we get more extreme events, that absolutely changes how we design,'' said D. Wayne Klotz, president of the American Society of Civil Engineers, who has raised the topic repeatedly at the society's meetings. ''We could stick our heads in the ground and say nothing is changing. But it is.''
Mr. Klotz, a water engineer in Houston, said his professional colleagues look carefully at the changing statistics about factors like weather, and over time alter building methods and plans accordingly. Engineers design for the biggest flood or highest winds that seem plausible at a given time. The drainage systems Mr. Klotz builds now are different from those he engineered 20 years ago, because he knows that the Gulf Coast now has much heavier storms.
Unfortunately, he said, the municipal building codes that govern minimum standards for many structures often lag behind ''what is happening in the real world,'' because of the slow pace of lawmaking. At the same time, a bad economy makes countries, companies and individuals disinclined to invest in higher levels of protection.
Individual engineers are ''really aware of the predictions'' about climate and might, for example, suggest altering a design to accommodate a future sea level rise, he said. But raising foundations or building higher dikes has a cost, and owners often have a short-term view.
''I'd like to tell you there is a vigorous forum where we've locked arms and are trying to scientifically figure out how to respond to the predictions,'' said Mr. Klotz. ''But there is not yet a concerted effort to change design codes to accommodate them.''
Widely varying predictions about climate change make it especially hard for engineers to build for the future -- or for insurers to guard against weather-related losses. Indeed, scientists do not entirely understand the complex ways in which warmer temperatures influence weather.
Last month, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said 2010 had tied for the warmest year on record in terms of land and sea surface temperatures. At the simplest level, a warmer ocean surface means more evaporation into the atmosphere -- and all that extra water has to come down somewhere, probably accounting for more frequent and severe storms. But it is not easy to predict which places will suffer snow or rain and which will experience drought.
Munich Re is already tailoring its offerings to a world of more extreme weather. It is a matter of financial survival: In 2008, heavy snows in China resulted in the collapse of 223,000 homes, according to Chinese government statistics, including $1 billion in insured losses, Dr. Hoeppe said.
Homes built to resist higher winds will qualify for lower premiums. Floodplains need to be wider than in the past, and Munich Re will not cover structures built in overly risk-prone areas.
In most parts of the developed world, people will probably make the necessary adjustments. This winter, travelers were stranded for days at airports in parts of Europe and the United States, as severe snowstorms interrupted flights. But, Dr. Hoeppe noted, air traffic continued almost normally in places like Helsinki, Finland, which is used to heavy snows. ''Perhaps we'll have to learn to deal with more snowfall -- extreme snowfall,'' he said. ''We'll have to get used to that.''
But as engineers and architects sit down at their drafting tables to design structures for the next 100 years, they want to know how extreme is extreme when it comes to weather. ''There's not enough money to design for every eventuality,'' said Mr. Klotz. ''You try to design for the worst-case scenario. But the question now is, what you can expect?''

HEADLINE: A Year in the Slow Lane in a '30 Ford

BYLINE: By MARY M. CHAPMAN

 BODY:
BACKING out of the garage before work on a mild day last fall, Jonathan Klinger heard a loud backfire from his 1930 Model A Ford.
The engine died. When Mr. Klinger restarted it, he heard a loud hiss and immediately feared the worst: a blown head gasket. But it was not so dire. The top had blown off the vacuum fitting for an accessory whistle, leaving a dime-size, but potentially disabling, hole.
Mulling a solution in his kitchen, Mr. Klinger spotted a cork. He pulled out his pocket knife, whittled the cork to fit and jammed it into the hole. Crisis averted. 
''The wolf whistle was the weak point and couldn't stand the backfire pressure,'' Mr. Klinger, 29, said. ''I was relieved because I was on my way to a meeting. My goal was to never miss or be late because of it.''
When your daily car is an octogenarian, you must be prepared to improvise.
He is ready -- a good thing, too, because he is committed to driving the Model A for a year as his regular transportation. He is some four months and 5,000 miles into his endeavor.
''There's this myth that a car like this can't be driven every day, that they're not really practical or reliable,'' said Mr. Klinger, the public relations manager for Hagerty Insurance, a Traverse City, Mich., company specializing in coverage for collector cars and classic boats.
''People associate them with parades, car shows and museums,'' he added. ''So this is my way of saying that these cars can be driven.''
Aside from that incident with the vacuum leak, Mr. Klinger reported no major problems with his blue Tudor, which has a 3-speed transmission and a 4-cylinder engine rated at 40 horsepower. Its fuel economy works out to about 15 miles per gallon.
Well, there was the time he had to slide under the car on a snowy highway to disconnect the drive cable for the speedometer when the instrument began making a worrisome noise.
His blog, 365DaysofA.com, reveals that he has also had to install a quieter muffler and run an extra ground wire from the headlights to the engine block.
But over all, he said, the car has done well, even tracking nicely in snow, something all too familiar to residents of northern Michigan. So far he has made it through a six-inch drop that lay atop another foot of packed snow below.
Because the Model A's brakes need a longer distance to stop the car, the trick, he said, is to avoid tailgating. ''The car is actually safer because it forces you to be more aware of conditions, of what's going on around you,'' Mr. Klinger said.
There have been pleasant surprises. Because the car's windows are vertical -- almost perfectly upright -- snow does not usually stick to the glass, he discovered. ''Guess that's why you've never seen a vintage scraper.''
The Model A was in good shape when he bought it, for $11,000, last July -- specifically for this adventure, he said. He did correct the straw-yellow pinstriping that had been applied with modern tape, and he touched up the car's paint. He rebuilt the brakes, added seat belts, turn signals, brighter tail lights and an electric windshield-wiper motor.
Some things he cannot do much about, like the single six-inch front wiper, which, alas, is not help much in the rain.
''As far as snow, it works great, except the passenger can't see,'' said Mr. Klinger, whose modern vehicles -- a 1993 Honda Accord and a 1999 Ford Explorer -- have been stored away to keep him honest.
Mr. Klinger's blog readers offer lots of suggestions, some of them eyebrow-raising. To compensate for the lack of a defroster, for example, one reader advised wiping the inside of the windshield with a potato half. Other remedies involved shaving cream or even chewing tobacco.
Staying warm can be an issue. Mr. Klinger installed a vintage accessory heater, but it is not so effective on short trips; he keeps a blanket on the back seat. Although the car starts fine in cold weather, Mr. Klinger said he let it idle for a few minutes in the morning to ward off mechanical coughs.
Starting with the antique tractors of his youth in Winnebago, Ill., about two hours west of Chicago, Mr. Klinger has always favored older vehicles. He has restored a 1919 Model T Ford pickup and he owns a 1941 Ford Super Deluxe. He has a bachelor's degree in automotive restoration from McPherson College in McPherson, Kan., so he knows a thing about upkeep.
He keeps spare oil, coolant, a starter gear and a tuneup kit in the car. Other repair parts can be ordered from a variety of sources. An abundance of reproduction parts is one of the reasons he chose the Model A.
There are practical concerns, like parallel parking without the aid of power steering, Mr. Klinger said. But because the car is narrower than most newer vehicles, it can fit into spaces other cars will not.
The A's top cruising speed is only about 50 miles per hour, so he avoids Interstates. He's also less casual about planning his days than he once was.
''The car has some limitations, so I think ahead more,'' Mr. Klinger said. ''I've become more efficient in mapping out my day.''
He has already taken a couple of long trips, including one to Detroit last month for the North American International Auto Show, and another to Illinois. It was during the auto show that he offered to share his passion for the A's driving experience.
Behind the wheel, I was struck by the snug interior, at least for someone over six feet tall. At his instruction, I clicked the ignition and turned on the gas valve, pulled back on the spark lever, pulled the choke and stepped on the floorboard starter button. We rumbled off to the slight squeaks and groans of an 80-year-old car. Leaving stoplights, the Model A was relatively slow to regain speed, and the mushy four-wheel mechanical brakes required cautious driving.
In October, Mr. Klinger will end his project with a drive to Hershey, Pa., for a car show and swap meet. Until then, he anticipates a warm-weather date with his girlfriend at a nearby drive-in movie.
''People love seeing the car,'' he said. ''Hey, these cars deserve to be driven,'' he added. ''They really deserve to be on the road.''

HEADLINE: The Tall, Small Wagon Plans Its Comeback

BYLINE: By JOHN PEARLEY HUFFMAN

 BODY:
WHETHER it's called a small minivan or a tall wagon or a people mover or a multipurpose vehicle, the basic idea behind the redesigned 2012 Mazda 5 is one that has long been popular with manufacturers. But in North America at least, it hasn't been all that popular among actual customers.
Still, Ford will take its own shot at this hazily defined product niche later this year with its C-Max, and other manufacturers are likely to follow. 
''The timing on the older products wasn't good,'' said Finbarr O'Neill, president of J. D. Power & Associates, the market research firm that tracks the auto market, referring to tall wagons offered in the United States in the 1980s and '90s. ''At that time S.U.V.'s were getting bigger and bigger.
''But downsizing is a trend now, and we see potential for these products'' as federal fuel economy rules tighten and fuel prices rise.
Mr. O'Neill added, ''We expect the mini-minivan market to grow.''
The tall wagon is an elegant and economical concept. Instead of stretching out an existing vehicle to accommodate more people and more cargo, redesigning vehicles to make them taller lets passengers ride more upright and allows cargo to be stacked higher.
Beyond that, adding an inch to the wheelbase can mean lengthening everything from the driveshaft, exhaust system and fuel and brake lines to the expensive floorpan stamping. But adding an inch of height requires only a bit more glass, stretched roof pillars and a longer power wire to the dome light. Additional height maximizes interior room on a short wheelbase without adding much weight. Existing drivetrains and chassis components are usually carried over.
The utility of tall boxes isn't a recent revelation. The Model T Ford of 1909 was, after all, a tall car on a fairly compact 100-inch wheelbase. And the original 1949 Volkswagen Transporter microbus was a tall box mounted atop the Beetle's 94.5-inch wheelbase and rear-mounted, air-cooled engine.
The last great burst of tall wagon production began after Honda put its awkwardly boxy 1984 Civic wagon on sale. Nissan brought over the awkward 1986 Stanza Wagon, and Toyota used the concept with both its Corolla and Tercel wagons. Most faded away as their manufacturers developed small crossover-type S.U.V.'s like the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4.
Chrysler built a tall box over its K-Car chassis to create the original 1984 minivans. But while the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager started off on a 112-inch wheelbase and were powered solely by 4-cylinder engines, the minivan species soon grew. Today's Dodge Grand Caravan rides on a 121.2-inch wheelbase and has V-6 engines to haul its bulk. Competing vans are about the same size.
Mazda may be happy with annual 5 sales of some 20,000 a year, but Ford's ambitions for the C-Max, which has a 109.7-inch wheelbase, are grander.
Riding on the same basic front-drive C-platform chassis as the new Focus, the seven-seat C-Max will be offered with either a standard 168-horsepower 2.5-liter 4 or a new turbocharged, direct-injection EcoBoost 4 that makes 180 horsepower when burning premium fuel. (It, too, is rated at 168 horsepower on regular.)
Ford is aiming the C-Max straight at the family-friendliest part of the market, where vehicles are expected to be built and sold in large volumes -- 100,000 units or more. Ford, it seems, thinks the tall wagon is going to stick around this time.

HEADLINE: Suspect in Four Killings Is Captured in Subway

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN and AL BAKER; Reporting was contributed by C. J. Hughes, Tim Stelloh, Rebecca White and Ethan Wilensky-Lanford.

 BODY:
A fugitive with a knife, who the police said had left behind a calamity of murders and broken lives in Brooklyn, was captured by officers at Times Square on Saturday morning after stabbing another victim on a subway train, investigators said.
It was the culmination of a roller-coaster of violence that included three fatal stabbings; a hit-and-run homicide; four other stabbings; four auto thefts, including two carjackings; death threats against several others who got in the way; a dangerous manhunt by hundreds of police officers; and for millions of New Yorkers a round-the-clock ordeal of a killer on the loose in the city.
The all-night manhunt led to several sightings in Brooklyn and Manhattan and to a cat-and-mouse chase through dark subway tunnels that ended shortly before 9 a.m. when the suspect, Maksim Gelman, 23, climbed up from the tracks, boarded a northbound No. 3 train and confronted a 40-year-old passenger, Joseph Lozito.
''You are going to die,'' Mr. Gelman said, according to Mr. Lozito's sister, then slashed Mr. Lozito in the back of the head. 
The police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, said that moments later, Mr. Gelman pounded on the door of the motorman's compartment, identifying himself as a police officer and demanding entry. Two transit officers were in the compartment with the motorman, scanning the tracks ahead for Mr. Gelman.
They opened the door, saw the fugitive with his knife and a man bleeding on the floor, and leapt out. In the ensuing fight, Officers Terrance Howell and Tamara Taylor subdued, disarmed and handcuffed Mr. Gelman, with help from an off-duty detective, Marcelo Razzo. Mr. Lozito was taken from the train at 40th Street and Seventh Avenue to Bellevue Hospital Center, where he was reported in stable condition.
Mr. Kelly said he had never encountered a crime spree like Mr. Gelman's. ''It's so horrendous and bizarre,'' he said at an afternoon news conference. ''Obviously, if he wasn't apprehended this morning, he could have injured, killed, many more people.''
The commissioner said Mr. Gelman had a record of 10 arrests dating to 2003, mostly for graffiti-writing but also for robbery and possession of crack cocaine. It was unclear if he had any history of mental illness. Asked if the suspect had made any statements, the commissioner cited only one -- ''She has to die,'' an apparent reference to his former girlfriend, one of his victims.
Witnesses on the train said it had pulled out of Pennsylvania Station and rolled north, but had stopped suddenly as it approached the Times Square station. They told of panic as the power went off and officers with flashlights and drawn guns ran toward the front, while riders ran back, fleeing the violence.
''At first I thought it was just a mechanical problem, and then we heard all these people saying there'd been a stabbing in one of the cars,'' said Danielle Nugent, 23, a graduate student at Quinnipiac University who was in town to run a race in Riverside Park.
The arrest was the climax of a 28-hour drama in which, the police said, Mr. Gelman killed his mother's companion as well as his former girlfriend and her mother in knife attacks at two apartments in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, then seized a car, stabbed the driver, fatally struck a pedestrian and sped away.
The swirl of violence stunned the Russian and Ukrainian communities in Sheepshead Bay, where Mr. Gelman had lived for years and was known to neighbors as a troubled, unemployed man with a drug habit and a hair-trigger temper. Investigators said his last rage may have been touched off by the refusal of his mother's companion, Aleksandr Kuznetsov, 54, a private-ambulette driver, to let him use the family Lexus.
In the apartment on East 27th Street, near Emmons Avenue, where they lived with Mr. Gelman's mother, Svetlana Gelman, 48, the two-minute argument ended at about 5:10 a.m. on Friday, when, the police said, the young man stabbed Mr. Kuznetsov with a kitchen knife 11 or 12 times. Mrs. Gelman, who was not injured, called the police, but by the time they arrived, Mr. Gelman had driven away in the gray 2004 Lexus. The police released a picture of the 6-foot, 170-pound fugitive that was posted on news Web sites and blogs.
About 10 a.m., the police said, he entered the apartment of his former girlfriend, Yelena Bulchenko, 20, and her mother, Anna Bulchenko, 56, on East 24th Street, near Avenue Y. The younger woman was not there, but an argument with her mother followed. Mr. Gelman killed the older woman, stabbing her a dozen times, investigators said.
Investigators said he then waited for more than six hours until Yelena Bulchenko arrived home, about 4:15 p.m. He attacked her inside and outside the apartment. She, too, was stabbed to death, the victim of a dozen wounds.
''She was a sweet girl,'' said Phil Kiernan, 36. ''I knew her since she was young.'' He recalled seeing Yelena Bulchenko's body lying on the ground, with Mr. Gelman standing over her.
Mr. Gelman again sped away in the Lexus, the police said, but was apparently blocked by a dark green Pontiac Bonneville at East 24th Street and Avenue U. The police said he rammed the Bonneville, then got out and pulled out the driver, Arthur DiCrescento, 60, and stabbed him in the chest. (Mr. DiCrescento was taken to Lutheran Medical Center, where he was reported in stable condition.) Four knives were found in the abandoned Lexus.
Mr. Gelman then took the Bonneville and drove north on Ocean Avenue. He struck a 62-year-old man, Stephen Tannenbaum, crossing Avenue R. The victim was taken to Kings County Hospital, where he died overnight. As hundreds of officers joined the manhunt, at 8 p.m. Friday the search centered on East 18th Street near Avenue R, where Mr. Gelman was reported hiding in a garage. He was not found. At 9:15 p.m., the Bonneville was found in Midwood, the engine running.
Mr. Gelman was next seen at 12:50 a.m. Saturday at Rochester Avenue and St. Johns Place in Crown Heights, where, the police said, he hailed the livery cab of Fitz Fullerton, 55. Trying to commandeer the car, Mr. Gelman stabbed Mr. Fullerton in the shoulder and neck, and the cab struck another vehicle.
Mr. Gelman jumped out and fled. Minutes later, the police said, he attacked another motorist, Sheldon Pottinger, 25, on Eastern Parkway near Rockaway Avenue. ''I was just waiting for my wife and this guy ran up, pulled out a knife and said, 'I'm gonna kill you -- get out of the car' and started stabbing,'' Mr. Pottinger recalled.
The police said Mr. Pottinger was slashed across the hand and jumped out of his car during a struggle. The attacker drove off in the black 2001 Nissan, which was found abandoned in Queens near a subway station.
Mr. Gelman may have entered the subway system there, investigators said. Following reports of a man seen in the tunnels, apparently walking along tracks and third-rail coverings, the police began scouring the Nos. 1, 2 and 3 lines, walking the tracks and riding in slow-moving trains.
The breakthrough occurred about 8:30 a.m., when two witnesses reported seeing Mr. Gelman on a southbound No. 1 train between 137th and 96th Streets in Manhattan. One called 911. The other, a woman, was reading a newspaper when a man, apparently Mr. Gelman, moved close.
Mr. Kelly related, ''He knocks the paper out of her hand and says, 'Do you believe what they're writing about me?' ''
Frightened, the woman got off at 96th Street, told a police officer what had happened and the word was passed to officers who had set up a check-point at Penn Station, at 34th Street. Mr. Kelly said Mr. Gelman left the No. 1 train at 34th Street, and, avoiding platforms and stairways, walked across the tracks to a northbound No. 3 train that was just pulling out, heading for Times Square.
Mr. Gelman climbed from the tracks into the train between the first and second cars. Mr. Lozito was slashed in the first car as the train rumbled through the tunnel. Mr. Gelman then attempted to get into the motorman's compartment, which covered the front end of the train. ''We assume that he wanted to injure the motorman or take control of the train, something along those lines,'' Mr. Kelly said. He said none of the officers were injured in the confrontation with Mr. Gelman.
The commissioner said Mr. Gelman had apparently not changed clothes overnight and was believed to have passed the early morning hours wandering the tracks of a Long Island Rail Road freight line that traverses Queens and Brooklyn. Mr. Kelly said Mr. Gelman had often scrawled graffiti along the line. Charges against Mr. Gelman were pending.
Andre Lev, 35, of Nyack, N.Y., who identified himself as the brother of Yelena Bulchenko, said in an interview at his sister's home that he had never heard of Mr. Gelman and did not believe that his sister had any romantic ties to him. Acquaintances of the family agreed, saying Mr. Gelman had sought a relationship with her but had been rebuffed.

HEADLINE: Turning Your Company Into a Social Animal

BYLINE: By EILENE ZIMMERMAN. 
E-mail: ccouch@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Q. You are considering whether to start a social networking effort on behalf of your company. Can that kind of exposure be beneficial?
A. In many cases, it can be. As an employee, you are an extension of your company and can enhance its brand by connecting with current and potential customers on sites like Facebook and Twitter, as well as through blogs.
Social media can be a powerful tool for listening to customers and building a reputation for responsive service, says David Nour, chief executive of the Nour Group, a business development consultancy in Atlanta, and author of ''Relationship Economics.'' ''You get real-time feedback and can engage with customers quickly to answer questions or help them solve problems.'' 
If your company is about to release a new product or service, for example, social media can spread the word and increase your reach exponentially, he says.
Q.Does that mean it's O.K. to start tweeting and blogging immediately?
A. No. If you are going to speak publicly on behalf of your company, you first need to discuss it with your boss. Many companies don't have formal social media policies yet, so talk to human resources or the legal department about what you plan to do, says Douglas Karr, founder of the digital marketing firm DK New Media in Indianapolis and author of ''Corporate Blogging for Dummies.''
You may not receive management's support -- and perhaps rightly so, because not every company should use social media, Mr. Karr says. ''Some companies don't have a culture that fits with it, like financial or law firms. There might be too many legal ramifications.''
If you start using social media for customer service, you run the risk that your company will not be able to respond quickly to complaints or problems.
Try making a business case for your plan by outlining your goals and how they align with the company's, says Josh Bernoff, a senior vice president at Forrester Research and co-author of ''Empowered: Unleash Your Employees, Energize Your Customers, Transform Your Business.''
Q.What are some ways to use social media effectively?
A. Be specific about your objective -- for example, to have customers make one more purchase each year -- says Adam Metz, who works from San Francisco as director of social business for the Pedowitz Group, a marketing firm, and wrote ''The Social Customer,'' to be published in July.
Work with the marketing department on a strategy to achieve your goal and a way to track the results of your campaign, Mr. Karr says. ''Let's say your company releases a new product and you want to tell people about it,'' he says. ''The marketing department can give you a link people can use to find out more about the product, and it enables them to track who is responding.''
Although it's common for companies to use Twitter and Facebook, posting comments to industry blogs is another way to enhance your business's reputation. ''Follow the leaders in your industry and comment on their blogs'' in the appropriate area, Mr. Karr says. ''This is a place to add insight and alternative views, not write about your company.''
In fact, Mr. Metz suggests a four-to-one engagement. ''Every time you write a post about your company, you should also write a comment on four other people's blogs in your industry,'' he says. ''Don't just pump out content about your company.''
Q. Although your intentions are good, you don't want the company to get into trouble because of your tweeting and blogging. Are there rules you can follow to avoid that?
A. Never disclose proprietary or confidential information belonging to the company or its clients, says Sara A. Begley, a partner in the employment practice at the law firm Reed Smith in Philadelphia who advises clients about social media use in the workplace. Disparaging your competition publicly by making untrue statements could be seen as an unfair trade practice or defamation, she says. ''You could also write something that is viewed as discriminatory, harassing or threatening and be fired for that.''
If you have a question about something you want to post, ask the human resources department. Have it send an e-mail approving your post so you have a written record, she says.
Don't comment on blogs anonymously. If you are discovered and your identity revealed, you risk an embarrassing response from those who believe that your company is having employees post positive comments on blogs, says Mr. Bernoff of Forrester. Identifying yourself as an employee allows those comments to be evaluated properly.
One common-sense guideline for using social media is to obey the same rules you would with any other communications channel. ''In the same way you can't stand up at a conference and tell everyone what your company's financial results will be for next quarter,'' Mr. Bernoff says, ''you also can't tweet about it.''

HEADLINE: The True Cost of a Loan

BYLINE: By LYNNLEY BROWNING

 BODY:
THE lending industry has tried to make it easier for borrowers to understand the true cost of a mortgage by disclosing both its interest rate and its annual percentage rate, or A.P.R. But consumers may often wonder which figure they should focus on when buying or refinancing a property.
The answer, many mortgage experts say, may seem counterintuitive: while the A.P.R. is popularly seen as providing a more complete picture of what you are actually paying each month, it often omits some costs. 
''When someone calls for a quote, we always give the interest rate, not the A.P.R.,'' said Melissa Cohn, the president of the Manhattan Mortgage Company, a brokerage firm. ''The A.P.R. is not all-inclusive.''
The A.P.R., which is often half a percentage point or more higher than the interest rate, or the cost of the loan itself, factors in other major costs, like the origination and loan processing fees. And it typically factors in the cost of ''points,'' or money that the consumer pays to buy down the interest rate. (One point is equal to one one-hundredth of the loan amount.) The higher these costs, known as upfront finance charges, the higher your A.P.R. will be.
The key thing to know is that the A.P.R. typically does not factor in third-party costs like those for a credit check, appraisal, survey, inspection or title insurance. For buyers of New York condominiums or co-ops, it typically does not include the mortgage recording tax of 1.8 percent to 1.925 percent of the loan amount, or the ''mansion tax,'' of 1 percent of the purchase price on all homes sold for $1 million or more. ''The A.P.R. isn't a measure of the true cost of credit,'' said Carolyn Carter, a staff lawyer at the National Consumer Law Center, a consumer advocacy group.
Lenders have flexibility in deciding what to include in the A.P.R. Ms. Carter says that ''gives the lender an incentive to use more third-party providers,'' like those for document preparation, ''because then it doesn't have to include those costs in the A.P.R.''
''Expecting consumers to understand and adjust for the missing parts of the cost of credit,'' she said, ''is way unrealistic.''
The new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is to address a 2009 Federal Reserve proposal to adopt an ''all-in'' definition of mortgage finance charges when computing an A.P.R.
But the proposal would not apply to home-equity loans -- open-ended lines of credit whose A.P.R.'s as quoted today are exactly the same as their interest rates.
The Truth in Lending Act requires lenders to disclose both the interest rate and the A.P.R. on Good Faith Estimate forms. But A.P.R.'s are ineffective at capturing total costs for adjustable-rate mortgages, whose interest rates fluctuate, said Barry Zigas, the director of housing policy at the Consumer Federation of America, an advocacy group. HSH Associates, a loan-data publisher, has an A.P.R. calculator for adjustable mortgages on its site to provide approximations.
And if you are thinking about selling or refinancing your property within five to seven years, choosing a loan based on the lowest A.P.R. may not be the best move. The A.P.R. quoted for a 30-year loan spreads out finance charges over 360 months, but selling within, say, five years effectively spreads out those charges over only 60 months, thereby raising the A.P.R.
Jack Guttentag, an emeritus finance professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, offers one example of a borrower who chooses between 30-year fixed-rate mortgages -- one at 5.125 percent and zero points, the other at 4.25 percent and 4.4 points.
The first loan has an A.P.R. of 5.125 percent, and the second, 4.64 percent, suggesting that the lower-rate mortgage is a better option. But if the borrower expects to sell the property in five years, the actual A.P.R. on the low-rate mortgage will be 5.31 percent, and that makes the higher-rate mortgage better.

HEADLINE: How Rising Rates Could Choke the Rally

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com

 BODY:
LAST year, the health of the global recovery was very much in doubt, and many investors worried about the possibility of a double-dip recession in the United States.
The climate has already changed radically. The economy has improved enough that many people are bracing for an entirely different threat: the risk that interest rates will soon rise too much to keep the stock market rally going.
At nearly 3.7 percent, the yield on 10-year Treasury securities is already nearly one and a half percentage points higher that is was in October. While rising rates can be viewed as a positive sign -- they are a natural outgrowth of a recovering economy -- rates that climb too high and too fast could potentially slam the brakes on this rally, which has nearly doubled stock prices since March 2009. 
At the very least, the fear of rising rates is likely to alter the nature of this bull run. ''Some effects are already being felt in the stock market,'' says Jeffrey N. Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial in Boston.
Consider the stocks that performed best in 2010 -- and those that are doing well so far this year.
Last year, shares of risky but fast-growing small companies trounced big blue-chip stocks. That is typically what happens at the start of an economic recovery. But since the end of December, the Russell 2000 index of small stocks has risen 3.8 percent, versus a gain of 5.3 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500 index of large stocks.
One possible explanation, Mr. Kleintop says, is that small companies tend to rely more on debt to finance operations, while many giant corporations are flush with cash. So, in periods of rising rates, small companies are vulnerable to the threat of increased borrowing costs that can cut into profits.
Small stocks aren't the only ones that have slowed down. Sectors that are traditionally hurt by rising rates, like capital-intensive businesses that require substantial debt financing, are also lagging. The utility sector is an example: so far this year, the average mutual fund that invests in utility shares has returned a modest 3.1 percent, versus a 5 percent gain for the average domestic equity fund.
But industries that aren't as capital-intensive -- and therefore require less borrowing -- have been thriving. The technology sector, which has the least amount of debt of any segment of the S.& P. 500, has been the best-performing stock category of 2011. The average tech fund has returned more than 8 percent, according to Morningstar.
This change in market leadership is also playing out globally. Last year, when investors were yearning for growth, shares of companies based in fast-growing emerging markets like those of India and Latin America were among the world's best performers. In 2010, the average diversified emerging-market stock fund gained nearly 20 percent. Yet so far this year, it has lost more than 5 percent.
Why? Partly, it goes back to interest rates. Central banks in many emerging economies have already begun to raise short-term rates as they try to fight the threat of inflation overseas.
Just last week, the People's Bank of China raised a key lending rate by a quarter-point, in an effort to slow the economy and combat consumer prices that have been rising at an annual clip of more than 5 percent. It was China's third such rate increase in four months. Not surprisingly, Chinese equities are down 5 percent, on average, so far this year.
In the United States the situation is different. Fund managers in a Merrill Lynch survey said they thought the Federal Reserve wouldn't raise short-term rates until at least the first quarter of 2012.
That should give American stocks some room to run, several strategists say. In fact, accommodative monetary policies at home, combined with a tightening stance abroad, could renew global interest in the domestic stock market.
But even if the Fed keeps a lid on short rates, long-term rates have been rising. And the resulting jump in borrowing costs could, in theory, stave off any near-term recovery in the housing and labor markets.
Still, as long as the yield on 10-year Treasuries doesn't rise much above 5 percent, stocks are likely to thrive, says Jack A. Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago. If yields on Treasuries climb much higher than that, some investors may be more tempted to hold them instead of stocks.
EVEN if the overall stock market keeps climbing, investors may want to be careful about the kinds of bets they make on stocks in this environment.
Tim Hayes, chief investment strategist at Ned Davis Research in Venice, Fla., notes that beyond utilities, other rate-sensitive sectors include telecommunications and financials. ''They could be expected to underperform after rates start weighing down the market,'' he says.
Conversely, history shows that the least sensitive sectors of the economy include technology, materials and energy. All three are often beneficiaries of an improving economy.

BYLINE: By SAM TANENHAUS. 
Sam Tanenhaus is the editor of the Book Review.

 BODY:
With the death last month of Daniel Bell, America lost its last great 20th-century big thinker, though this is not necessarily the impression many now have of him. One reason is that Bell was most prolific during a period, 1950-80, bounded by the cold war, that has receded into the half-forgotten past. Another is that for most of his career, Bell was seen less as a singular figure than as one of a club of intellectuals whose pedigrees were so similar they seemed interchangeable -- New York City-reared Jews trained in factional combat at City College and groomed as journalists in the pages of small-circulation magazines (The New Leader, Commentary, Partisan Review, Encounter, The Public Interest), with detours into the Luce empire (Bell was for a time the labor editor of Fortune) and university perches (in Bell's case Columbia and Harvard). 
The aura of collective identity gains credence from Peter Steinfels's book ''The Neoconservatives,'' in which Bell is grouped with Irving Kristol, Nathan Glazer, Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Robert Nisbet, among others, as a member of ''the powerful party of intellectuals'' who banded together to challenge liberal orthodoxy in the 1970s. And in ''Arguing the World,'' Joseph Dorman's documentary film, released in 1998, Bell, Kristol, Glazer and Irving Howe are depicted as grizzled city boys dispersed along the ideological spectrum but still spiritual brothers.
All this is accurate as far as it goes. But to submerge Bell's career into a generational or ideological subculture is to obscure the breadth of his ambition, which verged on the Faustian in its quest for totalizing knowledge. Others might formulate more novel arguments, or present them with more elan. But no one read so much and so diligently recorded it all. Bell's major books -- ''The End of Ideology,'' ''The Coming of Post-Industrial Society,'' ''The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism,'' each with its cosmological title -- contain whole libraries of thought, ancient and modern, on philosophy, sociology and psychology, economics and technology, history and law, with excursions into literary theory and computer science.
In this sense Bell was heir to the vanishing tradition of systematizers or master builders -- Hegel and Marx, Durkheim and Weber, Freud and Nietzsche, Dewey and Veblen. All were required reading for the mid-20th-/century intellectual. But Bell seemed to regard them as rivals. He had digested even their most obscure writings and was not afraid to anatomize and correct them, fussily at times. His footnotes betray a hint of George Eliot's pedant Casaubon: ''Quotations have been transposed to compress and strengthen Schumpeter's description. The actual sequence of quotations is: pp. 137, 147, 151, 147, 145, 154.''
But Bell's wide gaze was also fastened on the large picture. ''In the Soviet view, I was attacked as an anti-Marxist,'' Bell wrote in 1999, when he was 80. ''If anything, I am a post-Marxist, and as I said, Marx's analysis remains as one of the most acute about Western capitalist society for the period from 1750 to 1970. The question is, Where did Marx go wrong?'' Bell himself supplied the answer. It lay in ''a crucial intellectual and political confusion.'' For Marx, ''all social structure was class structure,'' and so ''he failed in his sociology.''
It was an error Bell was determined to avoid . As early as 1955, impatient with intellectuals who had retreated behind ''such large-scale abstractions as 'the mass society,' '' he cataloged the underlying causes of postwar dislocation in interlocking terms that resonate today: ''the change from a society once geared to frugal saving and now impelled to spend dizzily; the breakup of family capitalism, with the consequent impact on corporate structure and political power; the centralization of /decision-making, politically, in the state and, economically, in a group of large corporate bodies; the rise of status and symbol groups replacing specific interest groups.''
Some of these interpretations could be found piecemeal in other writers -- in John Kenneth Galbraith (the rise of corporations), in Seymour Martin Lipset and Richard Hofstadter (status politics). But it was Bell, wielding ''sociology as a 'perspective,' '' who brought it together in a unified description.
In another prescient essay, on the rise of the ''radical right,'' written in 1962, Bell linked ''the deep structural changes that have been taking place in American life in the past quarter of a century'' to an insurgency politics that had united an array of people and groups, some with strong establishment ties, who were pulled into the extremist orbit of the John Birch Society. The coalition of respectable fellow travelers ranged from ''dispossessed'' military men, who in the nuclear age had been displaced by scientists and ''military intellectuals,'' to ''fundamentalist groups'' frustrated because the nation's governing elite had no intention of ''dismantling much of the social-security program, eliminating the income tax, reducing the role of the federal government in economic life, and giving back to the states and local government the major responsibilities for welfare, labor, and similar legislation.''
In these analyses and others, Bell's approach was not so much to argue the world as to explain it. This was why, when his good friend Irving Kristol -- they founded The Public Interest together in 1965 -- rejected the entire body of leftist doctrine the two had absorbed as undergraduates, Bell, even though he had grown more conservative in some respects, continued to consult the cherished texts. As he once observed, ''Conceptual schemes are neither true nor false but are useful or not.''
But useful to whom, exactly, and to what purpose? In one sense Kristol remained truer to at least one Marxist precept, the belief that theories should be wielded as weapons in the continuing ideological war. Then again, Bell too, for all his scholarly detachment, held firm political positions. He would be taunted, in later years, for his summary declaration, in 1960, that ''there is today a rough consensus among intellectuals on political issues: the acceptance of a Welfare State; the desirability of decentralized power; a system of mixed economy and of political pluralism'' and for concluding, ''the ideological age has ended.''
In fact, articulate thinkers both right and left dissented from this ''rough consensus.'' Bell's response was punitive, especially when assessing ''conceptual schemes'' that competed with his own, whether it was James Burnham's ''Managerial Revolution'' (''a vulgarization of the work of two European syndicalists, Waclaw Machajski and Bruno Rizzi'') or the ''simplisms'' in C. Wright Mills's ''Power Elite'' (''While the debts to Veblen and Weber are conscious, that to Pareto is probably not so.'')
Not that Bell was wrong in either case. But his intellectual one-upmanship overlooked what he knew all too well, that every fresh idea is usually rooted in an older one. It was certainly the case with Bell's own writings. His brilliant dissection of ''the cultural contradictions of capitalism,'' with its assertion that the ''very structure of the business enterprises,'' far from upholding conservative ideals, instead peddled hedonistic and ''antinomian'' excess to eager consumers, owed much to Schumpeter's theories of the market economy and its ''creative /destruction.''
It's not surprising that Bell's critiques of thinkers like Burnham and Mills -- the first a philosopher-king on the right, the second a hero to the left -- were tinged with animus. In this, once again, he followed the example of his 19th-century forebears. Like them he closely guarded his big thinker's turf. Like them, too, he had earned the right to do so.

TRIUMPH OF THE CITY
How Our Greatest Invention Makes Us Richer, Smarter, /Greener, Healthier, and Happier
By Edward Glaeser
Illustrated. 338 pp. The Penguin Press. $29.95.
Edward Glaeser, a Harvard professor of economics, has spent several decades investigating the role cities play in fostering human achievement. In ''Triumph of the City,'' he has embedded his findings in a book that is at once polymathic and vibrant.
Glaeser's essential contention is that ''cities magnify humanity's strengths.'' They spur innovation by facilitating face-to-face interaction, they attract talent and sharpen it through competition, they encourage entrepreneurship, and they allow for social and economic mobility. Glaeser takes us on a world tour of urban economics, collecting passport stamps in Athens, London, Tokyo, Bangalore, Kinshasa, Houston, Boston, Singapore and Vancouver. Along the way, he explains how urban density contributed to the birth of restaurants, why supermarket check-out clerks demonstrate the competitive advantage such density confers and how the birth of Def Jam Records illustrates the way cities spur artistic innovation. Here, his enthusiasm for cities is refreshing. 
Glaeser's got some tough words for poorly reasoned public policies that feed suburban living: federal highway programs, the mortgage tax deduction, low gas prices. While he understands the lure of big houses and lush lawns, he's against subsidizing them. And he chastises city planners in Paris and Mumbai, making a passionate argument for building up -- and up and up.
Though he admires Jane Jacobs's insights into the virtues of mixing residential and retail together, he thinks her prescription for small-scale neighborhoods is wrongheaded. He'd much rather see neighborhoods of skyscrapers than acres of suburban developments. Greater density is the goal: more people means more possibility. Even when writing about the developing world, Glaeser is unfazed by threats of overwhelmed sanitation systems, unsafe housing or impossible congestion. These, he suggests, are problems more readily solved than the environmental consequences of sprawling suburban life.
Glaeser is scathing in denouncing local conservationists for their devotion to ''leafy suburbs,'' which he sees as being at odds with true environmentalism. Reminding us that even Thoreau benefited from association with a circle of urban intellectuals, he insists that suburbanization is producing an ecological disaster. Growth that's restricted in temperate areas like coastal California is pushed into intemperate ones like Las Vegas, where air-conditioning is leading to a carbon emissions nightmare. What will happen, he asks, if China and India emulate us? Paradoxically, fighting for local green space in the Bay Area undermines our ability to be global environmental activists.
Clearly, Glaeser loves an argument, and he's a wonderful guide into one. ''Triumph of the City'' is bursting with insights and policy proposals to debate. Sometimes that's a bit of a problem: there's a lot of policy in this book, but not a lot of politics. It's about ideas, not implementation. Some of those ideas may strike you as problematic: the increasing density he credits Atlanta with has been accompanied by an explosion of suburban sprawl. Others, like tilting the benefits of the tax system away from suburbanites and toward city residents, may sound absolutely unrealizable. And still others, like his advice to cities in decline to ''shrink to greatness,'' seem a little tone deaf, especially since those cities are steadily losing the skills and talent to find that greatness.
No matter though. If separating ideas from implementation can leave you a little lightheaded, you'll still walk away dazzled by the greatness of cities and fascinated by this writer's nimble mind.

HEADLINE: Take the Stairs

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY

 BODY:
OF all the must-have items for a New York City apartment, stairs generally don't figure very high on the list.
Stairs create separation. Stairs take up space. Stairs mean work.
There are buyers out there, though, who seek a duplex. They like the separation of public and private rooms. They don't mind losing a little space, and a bit of exercise isn't a bad thing, either.
Developers in recent years have added duplexes to their apartment mix, some creating buildings made up entirely of duplexes. Brokers and developers say that duplexes attract certain buyers, and that if anything, their popularity seems to be on the rise.
''There always are going to be people who prefer a larger single-floor unit,'' said Samantha Sax, the director of Douglas Elliman Developments, ''but you're also always going to have people who only want a duplex.'' Having both options gives any new development a competitive advantage, she said, adding that duplex buyers ''want the comfort, security and amenities of a condo, but they also want something that feels like a town home within a condo.'' 
The number of duplexes sold in Manhattan last year was 453, down from a peak of 648 in 2007, but up from 357 in 2009. Duplexes accounted for 4.1 percent of total sales in 2010, up from 3.6 percent in 2009 and the highest market share in the last five years, according to data provided by Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel and a market analyst for Prudential Douglas Elliman.
At the lower end of the market, duplexes typically have tight spiral staircases, and property values aren't necessarily increased beyond the sum of the two parts. But at the high end, in penthouses and apartments with three or more bedrooms, Mr. Miller said, ''there's a definite premium on duplexes, because it's more like a house, with a real set of stairs.''
A housing analysis that Mr. Miller conducted in 2003 with New York University's Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy found a slight price penalty of 1.5 percent for duplexes. But Mr. Miller said that appraisers generally attach a 5 percent premium to high-end duplexes, whose staircases are generally wide.
Especially in duplexes whose lower levels are partially or entirely below grade, and can't legally house bedrooms, the apartments often provide more space than a buyer could otherwise afford, he said.
''But,'' Mr. Miller said, ''the lower level is worth less per square foot. And if it has a tight, narrow staircase, that can be a consideration for older people or families with young kids.''
In Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Anton Rivera and his fiancee, Jordan Woodard, recently bought a duplex at Warehouse 11, a condo stalled by financial problems in 2009 but reintroduced in early 2010. Mr. Rivera said they looked at two dozen two-bedroom condos in the area before buying the duplex for about $600,000. It has a large, open room on the basement level that connects to a garden, and an upper floor with living space, a bedroom and a balcony.
''I grew up in a house,'' Mr. Rivera said, ''so I'm used to stairs, and this had a lot of space to spread out in.'' He and Ms. Woodard also looked at a two-bedroom on a higher floor with great views of McCarren Park, but passed it by ''because it didn't have the coziness that this space does,'' he said. With a duplex, he added, ''if one of us wants to get away and watch TV in a different area, it's kind of nice that we can do that.''
A look at duplexes recently on the market showed a range in both price and design.
There were ground-floor duplexes in Brooklyn that sold for as little as $500,000; prewar apartments with double-height living rooms and grand sweeping staircases for $6.5 million; duplexes created by combining adjoining units; and apartments designed as duplexes in which the stairs were the centerpiece.
The Spiral
A duplex at 69 Fifth Avenue in the Union Square area, listed for $925,000 by Dan Danielli, a senior vice president of Halstead Property, has a large spiral staircase. The unit is a combination: the owners, Beth and Michael Pollak, united their fourth-floor studio with the fifth-floor studio overhead in 2004.
There wasn't room for anything but a spiral staircase, and Ms. Pollak said it was a challenge finding something sturdy that didn't look like ''it was just a means to crawl upstairs.'' She liked a stairway with a double helix design, but they would have had to use a crane to get it through a window, ''because it wouldn't have made the turn through the door.'' Instead the Pollaks installed a wider-than-usual spiral, with wooden treads and metal railings, that she feels ''almost becomes an architectural element in the space.''
Mr. Danielli says selling a duplex is no harder than selling a simplex, although he admits that the pool of potential buyers is smaller. Dog owners, for example, generally won't consider one. Several years ago, he said, a prospective buyer showed a duplex he was interested in to his dog. ''The dog took one look at the spiral stairs, just stood there and shook its head,'' he said. ''And I lost the deal.''
The Sweeping Staircase
Multimillion-dollar duplexes often have staircases that take a step beyond utility with elegant curves and decorative flourishes.
The owners of a $3.9 million two-bedroom duplex with spectacular views from the 49th and 50th floors of 3 Lincoln Center, 160 West 66th Street, recently renovated the apartment and installed new stairs. Their broker, Norah Burden, a vice president of Brown Harris Stevens, said the original stairs ''had a boring Sheetrock wall'' that made them ''very pedestrian.'' The stairs now have an eye-catching curved banister made of wood, and steel rails with a contemporary geometric design.
Potential buyers have remarked on how beautiful the stairs are, she said, ''because a lot of times, stairs are just functional and almost an afterthought.''
Maria Torresy, a senior vice president of Brown Harris, is listing her own seven-room duplex at 322 East 57th Street for $6.5 million. She says a duplex ''is not necessarily comfortable to live in; it's up and down and up and down all the time.''
The sweeping staircase that connects her kitchen and dining gallery to the rest of the apartment has a gracious brass and wrought-iron banister. She says that other owners in the prewar building, which consists entirely of duplexes, have moved the kitchen to the lower floor and turned the upstairs space into an additional bedroom.
The Ground-Floor Duplex
In many new Brooklyn buildings, a first-floor duplex is almost standard, with either a first-floor or a below-grade level leading to a yard. ''These can be very good deals for people who need square footage,'' said David Maundrell, the president of aptsandlofts.com, ''because the lower floor is usually a big open space.'' These apartments often don't have great views and may not get much light, but often cost less per square foot than units on higher floors.
The entrance to a two-bedroom duplex at 214 Green Street, a new 10-unit building in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, is on the second floor.
Living space, a bedroom and a balcony are on this level, and a much larger bedroom is on the lower level, which opens onto a private garden.
The apartment, which overlooks a gas station, has just under 1,000 square feet of space and is listed with aptsandlofts.com for $515,000.
The Feel of a House
Brokers say that many duplex buyers grew up in the suburbs and like the way a duplex can replicate the feel of a two-story house.
Mark Levine, a senior vice president of the Corcoran Group, says two other types of buyer undaunted by stairs are empty nesters and Europeans. Both groups appreciate the division of space that stairs provide, because they expect to have frequent visitors.
That has been the case at Mr. Levine's $899,000 listing at 423 West 22nd Street, a one-bedroom duplex with a traditional staircase on the fourth and fifth floors of a converted town house. ''People seem to like the fact that it's not a wobbly, how-am-I-going-to-get-my-luggage-up spiral staircase,'' Mr. Levine said.
Phyllis and Jeff Altman live in a duplex on the 19th and 20th floors of 137 East 36th Street. While house-hunting five years ago, Mrs. Altman said, the luggage question came up: ''We saw an apartment with spiral stairs, but it was just not for me. I equate it to a canopy bed: it looks good initially, but it's not functional. I thought, 'What would we do with our suitcases?' ''
The Altmans had moved from a house in Boston. They liked the way the new duplex had zones for entertaining and for sleeping.
The stairs in the apartment also helped ease their transition to New York City, Mrs. Altman said.
''The two levels reminded me of being in a house and made it homey for me,'' she said.
Come to think of it, she added, even though she could take the elevator to the 20th floor and use the upstairs entrance for luggage after a trip, ''I use this apartment like a house; I carry my suitcases up the stairs.''
They have recently listed the apartment for $1.55 million with Julie Perlin, a senior vice president of Stribling & Associates.

HEADLINE: Still Single? Odds Are You're a Woman

BYLINE: By PATRICIA PARK. 
Patricia Park, a native of Douglaston, Queens, is spending the semester in Seoul, South Korea, where she is teaching English literature and dating an American who is not from New York; she blogs at newyorkerinseoul.com.

 BODY:
I was in the cafe at Borders last month when a homeless man asked to sit next to me. He cast several glances my way before offering me two sandwiches from his plastic Conway bag. If I hadn't already had dinner plans, I might have taken him up on his tuna fish.
After an exhausting decade of dating in New York, I was grateful for any offer that came my way. My once lofty list of must-haves had been whittled down to: ''clean; ability to hold conversation a plus.'' Once I realized the man was hitting on me (either that, or he thought I was also homeless, which, being between apartments, I technically was), I, too, sized him up. He had a good frame under the layers of coats, and after a shave, a shower and some laundered clothes, he could pass for a handsomer Quentin Tarantino. I found myself lamenting the man's unrealized potential as well as the rigidity of my two-item list. 
It is hard for single women to hack it in this city. According to the 2009 American Community Survey (pdf), there are 131,548 more unmarried and divorced women than men in greater New York (and if you include the widowed, that figure jumps to more than 700,000). So those of us in the struggling majority are forced to revise our desires to accommodate the existing supply of men, even though evolution scripted it to be the other way around.
Take a brief survey of the single ladies you know in New York: so many attractive, smart and successful women are unattached not by choice, but by lack of options. We compete with one another in the dating race, and in so doing unwittingly raise the aesthetic standards for women. Which means we have to log many miles on the treadmill before shoving our tired feet into sky-high stilettos, just to maintain the market average. Therein lies the prisoner's dilemma.
But is it really unsolvable? I may have a simple solution to this predicament - a kind of Valentine's gift to all the women of New York who suffer from heartache and hammertoes.
Last year, I was on a Fulbright grant in Seoul, South Korea, a country with such a shortage of women that the men import brides from Thailand and Vietnam and, more recently, matchmaking agencies pair South Korean men with North Korean female defectors. My experience there gave me a new appreciation for the barter system.
While some dating and marital arrangements may border on human trafficking, a less murky option for New York would be an incentives program for both single women leaving the city and incoming single men. For the women, ''departure packages'' would include a moving bonus, a Lonely Planet guidebook and a one-way ticket to Incheon, South Korea, or maybe Moose Pass, Alaska. For the men: rent cuts, which landlords could write off as tax abatements, and coupons to bars and bistros, where they could wine and dine potential romantic partners, chosen from the women who decided to stay put. Think of the boon to our flailing economy, not to mention workplace productivity.
So to all the single ladies: There's a whole world of men out there waiting to put a ring on it. They're just not in New York (yet).
Patricia Park, a native of Douglaston, Queens, is spending the semester in Seoul, South Korea, where she is teaching English literature and dating an American who is not from New York; she blogs at newyorkerinseoul.com.

HEADLINE: Those Disappearing Breaks

BYLINE: By JAN M. ROSEN

 BODY:
MANY taxpayers may be in for an unpleasant surprise this filing season: despite the extension of Bush-era tax rates, some of the breaks they enjoyed on their 2009 returns are not available for 2010.
As a result of the tax changes that President Obama signed into law on Dec. 17, taxpayers should also make sure they have the most up-to-date information, as many tax publications were printed before then.
Barbara Weltman, a tax lawyer in Millwood, N.Y., who helped edit ''J. K. Lasser's Your Income Tax 2011: For Preparing Your 2010 Tax Return,'' and has written several specialized Lasser tax books, advised taxpayers to visit publishers' Web sites for updates to any 2011 tax books they have bought. 
Several 2009 tax breaks, instituted to deal with the wavering economy, will disappear this filing season, Ms. Weltman said. These include the exclusion from income of up to $2,400 in unemployment compensation; for 2010, all unemployment payments are generally subject to taxation.
The following have also disappeared: add-ons to the standard deduction for net disaster losses and real estate taxes; a government retiree credit; and an itemized deduction or increased standard deduction for state or local sales or excise taxes on new vehicle purchases -- unless a vehicle was bought in 2009 after Feb. 16 but the tax was paid in 2010.
Mark Luscombe, a lawyer and principal federal tax analyst at CCH, a tax information service, said that on 2009 returns many people were able to claim a generous first-time homebuyer's credit, but for 2010 it is generally available only to people who signed a contract before May 1 and closed before Oct. 1.
Couples who are considered first-time homebuyers may be able to claim a credit of up to $8,000, while long-term homeowners may be able to claim up to $6,500, subject to certain limits.
In 2009, the requirement that people over age 70 1/2 take annual minimum distributions from I.R.A.'s and other retirement accounts was suspended. But that was not the case in 2010.
Some tax professionals said clients had forgotten to take minimum distributions last year and now face a 50 percent tax penalty. In some cases it may be possible to file for a waiver of the penalty.
Discussing an I.R.A. change that took effect in 2010, Sidney Kess, a C.P.A. and tax lawyer at the law firm Kostelanetz & Fink in New York, said people who converted regular I.R.A.'s to Roth I.R.A.'s last year would have to pay income taxes on the money from the regular I.R.A.'s. (A change in the law permitted people to make this conversion without being subject to income limits.)
Even if the conversion was made in 2010, the law allows the tax to be recognized and split between 2011 and 2012 returns, he said. But taxpayers may choose to recognize the income on their 2010 returns.
Because of Congressional efforts to stimulate the economy, ''this has been the year for business tax relief,'' Ms. Weltman said. People who own their own businesses may be able to benefit from tax breaks, including bonus depreciation for property purchased, small-business credits and deductible start-up expenses.
Julian Block, a tax lawyer in Larchmont, N.Y., pointed out a new break for the self-employed, for 2010 only. Thanks to the Small Business Jobs Act, enacted last September, those who pay for health insurance, whether only for themselves or also for a spouse and any dependents, may deduct the premiums paid from income tax or self-employment tax.
Among other tips from the tax professionals were these:
ADJUST YOUR WITHHOLDING The I.R.S. has reported that more than three-quarters of the 142 million individual tax returns filed last year were due a refund, and the average refund was $3,003. Mr. Block notes, however, that tax refunds amount to an interest-free loan to the Treasury.
Rather than claim a refund a year from now, you can file a new Form W-4 with your employer to reduce the money withheld from your salary and have your money available all year, he advised.
CONSIDER FREE FILING If you're eligible to use it, Form 1040EZ takes about five minutes to fill out online -- and at no cost -- at the I.R.S. Web site. So there is no need, Mr. Block said, to pay $15 for a smartphone app to do something similar. The I.R.S. site also gives information on ''Free File,'' a program involving software companies and available to people whose income is less than $58,000, and on free e-filing for anyone who fills out the I.R.S.'s new online forms.
BE CAREFUL WITH STATE RETURNS Taxpayers shouldn't treat their state obligations as a mere afterthought to their federal returns, or worse, ignore them altogether, says Mark A. Plostok, a C.P.A.
''All the states are so desperate for money,'' and many are stepping up their collection efforts, Mr. Plostok said at a December conference sponsored by the New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants.
New York City, too, is aggressively demanding its share, said Alan E. Weiner, a partner emeritus in the accounting firm Holtz Rubenstein Reminick in Melville, N.Y. There is a new line on the New York return asking people who maintain a pied-a-terre in the city how many days they spent in the city last year. Some filers may find to their surprise that they are liable for city income tax, even if they think of themselves as suburbanites or residents of another state.
DON'T FORGET USE TAXES Levied in lieu of sales taxes on items purchased out of state -- whether online, by mail or overseas -- use taxes are another focal point for many states, including California and New York, Mr. Weiner said, so taxpayers should not ignore them.
.
Feel that you have a lot of tax work ahead of you? Keep in mind that you have a bit more time than usual to file your federal taxes this year. The normal filing date this year is April 18 because Emancipation Day is observed in Washington on April 15. If you need more time, file Form 4868 for an automatic extension. Then your due date is Oct. 17.

HEADLINE: Health Care and Taxes: A Pause Before Impact

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
THE vastly expanded benefits of the new health care law have been well advertised, but the taxes imposed to provide insurance coverage for tens of millions of additional Americans and their pre-existing conditions have received much less public attention.
Not only were these various levies -- and credits for small business -- determined more quietly in the process of enacting the law, but most are two years or more from taking effect.
''They don't get a lot of attention when they're not applicable until 2013,'' said Melissa Labant, a tax manager at the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants here.
But far-reaching these measures are, like a 10 percent tax for visiting a tanning salon (it took effect last July) and a first-time Medicare bite on investment income (coming in two years). A 40 percent tax on high-value health coverage begins in 2018. 
Financial planners are already ruminating about how the changes may affect clients' strategies. Besides using the traditional technique of accelerating income into the current year when higher tax rates loom, taxpayers may want to consider municipal over taxable corporate bonds -- and try harder to bunch optional health care expenses to reach the new threshold for deducting them.
Beginning in 2013, that threshold for taking medical deductions rises to 10 percent of adjusted gross income, from 7.5 percent. Also in 2013, a new $2,500 limit kicks in for flexible spending accounts, which can be used for health costs.
''It's something people are starting to fret about,'' said Claire E. Toth, a planner and tax specialist at Point View Financial Services in Summit, N.J.
Broadly speaking, the revenue measures reflect the Obama administration's efforts to confine tax increases to those in the upper income bracket. Still in some cases, the less well-off will pay more, too, if perhaps indirectly.
One of the biggest items is an increase in the Medicare payroll tax, which has been expanded to apply to investment income for the first time. This includes capital gains, dividends, interest, annuities, rents and royalties, but not distributions from retirement plans or interest from municipal bonds.
When it takes effect in 2013, this tax will be 3.8 percent of net investment income, or the amount by which modified adjusted gross income exceeds the threshold, whichever is less. The threshold is $250,000 for a jointly filing married couple or $200,000 for single filers. A taxpayer with no investment income is not affected, nor is one whose entire income is from investments, so long as its total is below the threshold.
Capital gains include profits on home sales, but the existing exclusion of $500,000 ($250,000 for single filers) still applies. This means a home-selling couple would owe nothing unless thes profit was more than $500,000 and their income was more than $250,000.
But those who have such hefty gains and are thinking of a move may want to consider selling before the end of 2012, tax specialists suggest. It may also be a good idea to collect documents showing home improvements, which raise the home's cost basis and thus lower capital gains.
They also say the investment tax raises the so-called marriage penalty, because two cohabiting singles can earn $400,000 before hitting the threshold.
A second major element in the new law is an increase in the levy on employees for the Medicare hospital insurance tax, to 2.35 percent from 1.45 percent, with the same income thresholds and effective date as the investment tax. Those with both high wages and high investment income would pay both taxes. The self-employed will pay an additional 0.5 percent on income above the threshold, starting in 2013.
Two items of tax reporting in the new law are of more immediate focus. One is a roundly criticized requirement that businesses send Form 1099's to other businesses for every transaction, on goods as well as services, of $600 or more, beginning in 2012.
Opponents see this as a serious paperwork burden and a disadvantage to small companies, and it is widely expected to be repealed. (The Senate has voted to do so, and a House committee is to take up the issue this week.)
The other requires employers to list on Form W-2 the value of sponsored health care benefits, which are not to be taxed. This disclosure was to take effect for 2011, but the Internal Revenue Service has made it optional this year, with application now scheduled for 2012 taxes.
Another important provision of the health law is a 40 percent tax, indexed for inflation, on insurers providing so-called Cadillac coverage for 50 or more employees and applying to portions of premiums above $27,500 a year for a family or $10,200 for an individual. Such plans are typically enjoyed by many members of unions, which won a delay in the effective date until 2018.
There is another element that, while not a tax, may seem like one. It is an annual fee imposed on health care companies in proportion to their market share. In total, it amounts to $8 billion in 2014 and rises in future years. Some, and perhaps all, of this is expected to be passed on to consumers as higher premiums.
In addition, an excise tax of 2.3 percent is to begin in 2013 on manufacturers and importers of specified medical devices.
OF course, the most hotly disputed part of the law is its ''mandate'' provision. In 2014, the I.R.S. will start imposing a penalty -- though not a tax -- on individuals who do not buy insurance. Initially, it will be $95 or 1 percent of income, whichever is greater. The penalty rises to $695 or 2.5 percent of income by 2016. A host of state suits are challenging the constitutionality of this crucial element.
Businesses with more than 50 employees that do not provide health coverage must pay a tax of $2,000 per employee, beginning in 2014. As for smaller companies, a 35 percent tax credit against insurance costs will be provided for up to six years, to encourage them to offer coverage. The credit starts to phase out as the number of workers rises above 10 and average pay rises above $25,000. For example, a company with 17 employees and an average wage of $38,000 gets nothing.
''It's so confusing and time-consuming that a lot of C.P.A.'s and clients think the cost of calculation exceeds the potential benefits,'' Ms. Labant said. The National Federation of Independent Business estimates that fewer than half the eligible four million small businesses will actually receive the credit.
Ms. Toth, the planner, said the credit might work well ''in some parts of the country, but not in the New York area,'' because its wages are relatively high.

HEADLINE: When Factories Vanish, So Can Innovators

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
SPOONS and forks, the metal flatware that everyone uses, are no longer made in the United States. The last factory in an industry stretching back to colonial times closed eight months ago in Sherrill, N.Y., a small community in the foothills of the Adirondacks, and 80 employees lost their jobs.
No one paid much attention beyond the people in the town itself, even though the closing represented the demise of an industry that had flourished in this country for generations. Paul Revere, in fact, was a flatware craftsman. 
Sherrill Manufacturing, which owned the factory, said in a statement that production had succumbed to less expensive Chinese imports. Robert A. Comis, the Sherrill city manager, said, ''It is too common a situation.''
Losing an industry or ceasing to manufacture a particular product, in this case stainless steel flatware, has indeed become a fairly frequent event. Just in the last few years, the last sardine cannery, in Maine, closed its doors. Stainless steel rebars, the sturdy rods that reinforce concrete in all kinds of construction, are now no longer made in America. Neither are vending machines or incandescent light bulbs or cellphones or laptop computers.
Less noticeably, American manufacturers are importing more of the components that go into their products. The imported portion has risen to more than 25 percent from 17 percent in 1997, according to Susan Houseman, a senior economist at the W.E. Upjohn Institute in Kalamazoo, Mich. The Boeing Company, to consider one striking example, once bought all of its components from American suppliers, or made them in its factories here. Now the wings of several of its airliners are manufactured by Japanese subcontractors and shipped across the Pacific in giant cargo planes.
Foreign-made parts might also be infiltrating the sleek business jets that the Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation makes at its United States factories. Joseph T. Lombardo, Gulfstream's president, says he isn't sure, although Gulfstream buys components exclusively from American suppliers. ''What I don't know,'' he says, ''is how many of the parts in those components were imported by our American suppliers.''
It is certainly more than we measure, Ms. Houseman says. An accurate count would reduce manufacturing's share of the gross domestic product, or total national output, to less than the 11.2 percent that the Bureau of Economic Analysis has reported through 2009, the latest figure available.
That 11.2 percent would be closer to 10.5 percent, if all of the imported components were counted as imported instead of domestically made. Even the 11.2 percent figure is down sharply from the 14.2 percent share of just a decade earlier, and the nearly 30 percent of the heyday 1950s, when almost every product bought by Americans was also made here.
Concern is increasing that this decline has gone too far. ''I think there is a growing recognition that a diminished manufacturing sector will undermine our economy,'' says Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Analytics.
How did the nation get into this situation? It gambled, in effect, that by importing more from foreign suppliers and from American companies that had set up shop abroad, consumer prices for manufactured products would fall, without any sacrifice in product quality. Low-wage workers abroad would make that happen.
American manufacturers, on the other hand, would be the world's best innovators, developing sophisticated new products here at home and producing them, at least initially, in their domestic factories.
The first part of the arrangement worked very well. Consumer prices did fall as imports flooded in -- from foreign manufacturers, of course, but also from factories newly opened abroad by American multinationals. The flood was so great that President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s placed temporary quotas on Japanese autos and motorcycles, and tariffs on selected electronic devices.
The second part of the arrangement, however, has been more problematic. As it turns out, the United States is not the only path-breaker. The Toyota Prius, the first hybrid, shines as an example of Japanese ingenuity, and more than a decade after that car was developed it is still being exported from Japanese factories, marrying innovation to production and jobs.
The iPad and the iPhone, developed by Apple in the United States, are spectacular technologies. But the devices themselves are made in Asia, not America. And as time passes, the people who make the iPad and the iPhone day after day -- the engineers and factory workers in Asia -- may produce the next innovations. Or so many experts are coming to believe, including Ms. Houseman.
''The big debate today is whether we can continue to be competitive in R&D when we are not making the stuff that we innovate,'' she says. ''I think not; the two can't be separated.''
THE loss of manufacturing capacity, measured in lost workers, is startling. From the high point in the summer of 1979, through last month, employment in manufacturing has fallen by 8.1 million, to 11.6 million, with most of the drop in just the last decade. While consumers have benefited from lower prices, made possible by unrestricted imports, on the other side of the ledger are tens of billion of dollars in lost manufacturing wages.
Something else is gone, too. ''We had a storehouse of knowledge and skill built up in these workers and we can't use it now,'' says James Jordan, president of the Interstate Maglev Project, promoting a high-speed rail technology that uses special magnets to levitate and propel trains. Maglev was invented in the United States, but equipment based on that technology is manufactured and used today in Japan.
Mr. Jordan argues that as manufacturing's presence -- and status -- shrinks in America, the odds of a Henry Ford or a Thomas Edison or a Steve Jobs appearing in the next generation are reduced. Certainly people like Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook are inventors, though not of physical products.
''Young people stop thinking about making things,'' Mr. Jordan says. ''It is no longer in their heads. They have a different mental orientation.''
Correction: February 20, 2011, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Everybody's Business column last Sunday, about the effect of factory closures on innovation, referred incorrectly to the production of minivans in the United States. Although no American automakers now make them here, some foreign companies do produce them in their American plants.

HEADLINE: Emerging Markets as Partners, Not Rivals

BYLINE: By N. GREGORY MANKIW. 
N. Gregory Mankiw is a professor of economics at Harvard. He was an adviser to President George W. Bush.

 BODY:
IN his State of the Union address last month, President Obama set the stage for a coming policy debate and his re-election bid with a catch phrase. Six times, he called on Americans to ''win the future.'' And he used the variant ''winning the future'' three other times. But is this really a good way to frame the economic challenges we face?
No doubt, the phrase appealed to White House political advisers and speechwriters. It is always better for presidents to focus on our future potential than the immutable past. And who doesn't want to win? Americans love rooting for their favorite teams, and no contest seems more vital than that for international economic dominance. 
Yet this catch phrase is also problematic. For one thing, ''Winning the Future'' was the title of a 2005 book by Newt Gingrich. It is almost as if Mr. Gingrich were to run for president in 2012 under the banner ''Audacious Hope.'' And then there is that pesky abbreviated form of the phrase -- WTF -- that does not exactly inspire confidence.
More troublesome to me as an economist, though, is that calling on Americans to ''win the future'' misleads us about the nature of the policy choices ahead. Achieving economic prosperity is not like winning a game, and guiding an economy is not like managing a sports team.
To see why, let's start with a basic economic transaction. You have a driveway covered in snow and would be willing to pay $40 to have it shoveled. The boy next door can do it in two hours, or he can spend that time playing on his Xbox, an activity he values at $20. The solution is obvious: You offer him $30 to shovel your drive, and he happily agrees.
The key here is that everyone gains from trade. By buying something for $30 that you value at $40, you get $10 of what economists call ''consumer surplus.'' Similarly, your young neighbor gets $10 of ''producer surplus,'' because he earns $30 of income by incurring only $20 of cost. Unlike a sports contest, which by necessity has a winner and a loser, a voluntary economic transaction between consenting consumers and producers typically benefits both parties.
This example is not as special as it might seem. The gains from trade would be much the same if your neighbor were manufacturing a good -- knitting you a scarf, for example -- rather than performing a service. And it would be much the same if, instead of living next door, he was several thousand miles away, say, in Shanghai.
Listening to the president, you might think that competition from China and other rapidly growing nations was one of the larger threats facing the United States. But the essence of economic exchange belies that description. Other nations are best viewed not as our competitors but as our trading partners. Partners are to be welcomed, not feared. As a general matter, their prosperity does not come at our expense.
To be sure, there are exceptions to this rule. When China uses our intellectual property such as software without paying for it, we should view that as a form of theft. And when other nations' economic growth has side effects on the global environment, as it does when they emit the greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change, the United States has good reason for concern. But these limited exceptions should not blind us into taking a more generally adversarial approach to international economic relations.
During the address, Mr. Obama lamented the fact that many foreign students attended colleges and universities in the United States and then returned to their countries of origin. ''As soon as they obtain advanced degrees, we send them back home to compete against us,'' he said. ''It makes no sense.''
The president is right that we should encourage a greater number of highly educated foreigners to migrate here. Because skilled workers pay more in taxes than they receive in government benefits, increasing their supply would reduce the fiscal burden on the rest of us. But if these foreign students decide to return home, as many do, we shouldn't worry that they are competing against us.
Instead, we should view higher education in the United States as one of our most successful export industries. The United States has 5 percent of the world's population but most of the best universities. Is it any wonder that students from many nations flock here to learn? And as they do so, they create opportunities for Americans -- from the professors who teach the classes to the grounds crews who maintain the campuses.
When the foreign students head home, they take the human capital acquired here to become productive members of their own communities. They spread up-to-date knowledge, so it can foster prosperity everywhere. Some of this knowledge is technological. Some of it concerns business, legal and medical practices. And some is even more fundamental, such as the values of democracy and individual liberty. Nothing could be better for the United States than these thousands of American-trained ambassadors who have seen at first hand the benefits of a free and open society.
As we confront the many hard policy choices ahead, let's prepare for the future. Let's invest for the future. Let's be willing to make hard sacrifices for a more prosperous future. But let's not presume that the future is a game requiring winners and losers.

HEADLINE: At Last, Bernie Madoff Gives Back

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
WHEN Bernie Madoff was arrested in December 2008, America feasted vicariously on a cautionary tale of greed run amok. But like Rod Blagojevich, the stunt governor of Illinois who had been arrested days earlier, Madoff was something of a sideshow to that dark month's main events. For a nation reeling from an often incomprehensible economic tsunami and unable to identify the culprits, he was, for the moment, the right made-to-order villain at the right time. 
But Madoff was a second-tier player. Some in the upper echelons of New York's financial world, including in the business press, had never heard of him. His firm's accountant operated out of a strip mall and didn't bother with electronic statements. The billions that vaporized in Madoff's Ponzi scheme amounted to a rounding error next to the eye-popping federal bailouts, including those pouring into too-big-to-fail banks wrecked by their own Ponzi schemes of securitization. The suffering he inflicted on his mostly well-heeled dupes was piddling next to the national devastation of an economy in free fall. In a December when a half-million Americans lost their jobs -- a calamitous rate not seen since 1974 -- the video of a voiceless, combative Madoff in a baseball cap, skirmishing with photographers outside his Upper East Side apartment house, soon lost its punch.
A month later Barack Obama would be inaugurated and declare ''a new era of responsibility.'' Now, another two years have passed, and while the economy is no longer in free fall, we're still waiting for that era to arrive. What's extraordinary is that Madoff, unlike such tarnished titans of the bubble as Rubin or Fuld or Prince, is very much at center stage, even as he rots in prison. Perhaps that's because he's the only headline figure of the crash who did go to prison.
His evil deeds, in their afterlife, are now serving as a recurring wave of financial body scans. Each new Madoff revelation sheds light on an entire culture that allowed far loftier flimflams than his to succeed -- though the loftier culprits, unlike him, usually escaped with the proceeds. That financial culture largely remains in place today.
The prime mover in connecting Madoff's low-tech, relatively low-yield scam to the big Wall Street picture is Irving H. Picard, the bankruptcy trustee pursuing loss claims for Madoff's victims. Most Americans haven't heard of Picard. But each day that he accelerates his pursuit of Madoff's collaborators, he steps further into the vacuum of leadership left by others, including the Obama administration's Department of Justice.
Picard has also upstaged the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission that is set to officially close its doors today. The hope had been that the commission, convened by Congress, would be what Ferdinand Pecora's Senate inquisition of 1933 was to the Great Crash -- a no-holds-barred dispensation of blame to tycoons who looted the Wall Street casino and then let ordinary Americans pay the consequences. Pecora's cross-examination of Charles Mitchell, the chairman of National City Bank (the ancestor of Citigroup), caused a national sensation. But in its final report, our own Great Recession's commission essentially found everyone guilty, thereby letting individual miscreants off the hook.
And so Madoff remains the only felon of the whole affair that Americans can identify by name. By taking this single card he's been dealt and exploiting Madoff's trail of crime to the max, Picard may yet prove the Pecora we've been waiting for.
He is pursuing hundreds of lawsuits to retrieve fictitious ''profits'' from the lucky coterie of Madoff investors who cashed out before his arrest. Now Picard has raised the stakes with two suits that reach deep into American institutions -- the New York Mets, whose principal owners, the Wilpon family, seemed to constitute a Madoff financial farm team, and JPMorgan Chase, the main Madoff banker.
As a long-suffering Mets fan, I'll leave the Wilpons to the Yankee vigilantes. JPMorgan is a more consequential target in any case -- the sole big bank that survived the economic crisis with its balance sheet, image and chief executive, Jamie Dimon, more or less unscathed. Dimon, as a Times Magazine cover put it in December, is ''America's Least-Hated Banker,'' an unpretentious guy (and lifelong Democrat) whose self-professed mantra is ''do the right thing.''
Picard's litigation asserts that JPMorgan saw red flags about Madoff's legitimacy yet never bothered to notify either the authorities or its own Madoff-invested customers as long as there was money the bank could scoop off the craps table. In one internal JPMorgan e-mail cited in the lawsuit -- dated June 2007, some 18 months before Madoff's arrest -- a Chase investment officer told colleagues that he had heard of ''a well-known cloud'' over Madoff, including speculation that he was ''part of a Ponzi scheme.'' And yet, according to Picard's brief, Madoff could freely cycle billions of dollars of his clients' money through Chase accounts until the end -- even as the bank itself was busily dumping $241 million of its $276 million in Madoff investments.
Late last month, in the days before the Picard suit was unsealed, Dimon appeared on a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, titled ''The Next Shock, Are We Better Prepared?'' and complained not for the first time -- or the 10th -- about what he considers unfair treatment by the press and the Obama administration. He's just sick, he said, of the ''constant refrain'' of ''bankers, bankers, bankers.'' His arrogance compelled even the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, no socialist, to speak up and chastise American banks for repeatedly defying ''simple common sense'' over the last decade. ''The world has paid with tens of millions of unemployed, who were in no way to blame and who paid for everything,'' Sarkozy said. ''Too much is too much.''
Indeed. As if the Picard charges about the Madoff-JPMorgan nexus weren't enough, last week a Dimon underling had to publicly apologize before Congress to military families for the bank's financial abuse of Americans fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan over the same period. In violation of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, designed to protect those serving overseas during their absences from home, JPMorgan overcharged at least 4,500 soldiers on their mortgages and illegally foreclosed on 18 of them. Many of these victims have been battling JPMorgan for years to get it to obey the law. Let us not forget that this is the one big bank that was considered Wall Street's model citizen.
As for the question posed to Dimon's Davos panel, the answer is No, for the most part, we're not better prepared for the next shock. It's not even clear we want to be prepared. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission was ridiculously under-supported by Congress -- it had less than one-sixth the budget of the musical ''Spider-Man'' to shed light on years of opaque financial maneuvers by huge, lawyered-up institutions. Even its worthy final report's release was drowned out, as bad luck would have it, by the uprising in Egypt. Now the new conservative attack dog of the House, Darrell Issa, is gearing up an inquiry of the financial crisis inquiry. His only conceivable purpose is to ward off any future attempts to pursue the still unanswered questions about the meltdown.
The commission's report, full of fascinating detail, received mixed reviews. One critic, Yves Smith, of the financial blog Naked Capitalism, chastised it for not digging into how the financial industry profited obscenely (and in her view, fraudulently) by deliberately creating ''toxic instruments'' like subprime-mortgage-backed securities just to bet against them. Michael Lewis, author of ''The Big Short,'' was far more favorable about the report but scarcely less fatalistic. ''I feel like we're living in a house built on sand because we didn't reform the system,'' he said on MSNBC's ''Morning Joe.'' Noting that banks have returned to huge profits while helping themselves to zero interest loans, Lewis concluded that we still have ''socialism for capitalists, and capitalism for everybody else.''
But it's not just financial reform that has fallen short. We still don't have cops to catch those who break the law. Which brings us back full circle to Madoff. Not the least of his cautionary tale's subplots was the one starring Harry Markopolos, a private financial investigator and whistle-blower who repeatedly contacted the Securities and Exchange Commission for nearly a decade with evidence of Madoff's fraud -- only to be ignored.
Markopolos was lionized on ''60 Minutes'' and published a book, ''No One Would Listen,'' dramatizing his lonely crusade. And where is the S.E.C. today? Caught in the federal budget freeze -- and bracing for further cuts by the antigovernment, antiregulatory Republican House -- the agency can't hire the employees needed to enforce existing security laws, let alone new ones created by the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul. It must use archaic technology to chase high-tech trading systems that operate ''at the speed of light,'' as Mary Schapiro, the S.E.C. chairwoman, put it. The agency's new whistle-blower office -- created precisely to welcome informants like Markopolos -- has been put on hold.
Determined as Picard, our accidental Pecora, may be, the fact remains that the time couldn't be riper for the next Madoff, whether in a strip mall or in the elite gambling dens of Wall Street, to get in the game.

HEADLINE: The Push To Trim Corporate Tax Rates

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
WHEN President Obama urged in his State of the Union address that corporate taxation be simplified and rates reduced, he joined many others in Washington who have called for an overhaul of the system.
Highlighting the issue so prominently could add momentum to the effort, specialists in tax policy say, but several hurdles -- fiscal and political -- need to be cleared before any change occurs. Even if it does, they add, businesses may not like what they get.
Corporate taxation was moving up on the Congressional agenda even before the president's speech last month, as advocates of change point to other nations that have tackled the issue over the last 20 years 
Data compiled in 2010 by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development show that only Japan, by a few tenths of a percentage point, had higher corporate tax rates than the United States among the 34 economically advanced countries in the group. The rankings are due to change after a law lowering Japanese rates takes effect.
Counting federal and state obligations, ''we have the highest combined corporate tax rate in the industrialized world,'' said J. D. Foster, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative policy group. ''We used to be No. 2, but Japan cut its rates so now we're No. 1 in a very dubious category.''
While many national governments tax corporations only on earnings within their borders, the federal tax rate in the United States, 35 percent on most earnings for large corporations, is applied everywhere that American companies do business, although the bottom line can be reduced substantially by deductions for business expenses taken on the lines above it. There is a deduction for foreign taxes paid, but American companies often face bigger bills than companies based elsewhere that do the same business in the same places.
''Companies can't compete if they have to pay foreign and home taxes,'' Mr. Foster said. ''We can't afford these kinds of policies that load up companies and, in effect, workers with these burdens.''
The actual costs to companies and the economy are hard to gauge.
''It's almost a given that the way the tax code comes in and distorts business decision-making can't be good for the overall economy,'' said Mark Weinberger, global vice chairman of Ernst & Young and head of its Center for Tax Policy.
''Where we see it is at the margin, where companies make decisions based on tax'' rather than ordinary commercial factors, Mr. Weinberger said. That includes one of the biggest decisions of all: where to be incorporated.
''If taxes become greater, it increases the likelihood that companies will move,'' he said. The departure of some large, British multinationals -- the advertising giant WPP and the drugmaker Shire have moved to Ireland in the last three years, for instance -- persuaded the British government to phase in lower rates over several years.
The better shake that some tax systems give to businesses is one reason that the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, the bipartisan panel appointed by President Obama, suggested reducing corporate tax rates and moving toward the locally focused system in place in much of the world.
''Statutory rates in the U.S. are significantly higher than the average for industrialized countries (even as revenue collection is low), and our method of taxing foreign income is outside the norm,'' said the commission's report issued in December. ''The current system puts U.S. corporations at a competitive disadvantage against their foreign competitors. A territorial tax system should be adopted to help put the U.S. system in line with other countries, leveling the playing field.''
The panel recommended a single corporate tax rate as low as 23 percent, counterbalanced by the elimination of many deductions, especially those that benefit individual industries. But some authorities on tax policy have other ideas. Alan J. Auerbach, a professor of economics and law at the University of California, Berkeley, contends that lowering rates is the wrong way to go.
Professor Auerbach would have charges and deductions -- like for borrowing and for spending on plant and equipment -- taken when money is earned or spent, rather than gradually through accounting devices like depreciation schedules. He would also ignore foreign transactions.
''Because the United States now has one of the highest corporate tax rates among the world's leading economies, some argue that it must lower its corporate tax rate to compete,'' he said in a paper published in December by the liberal Center for American Progress. ''A simple reduction in its corporate tax rate is not the answer, though, because it would leave in place all the flaws of the existing system.''
The Congressional Budget Office forecast late last month that the fiscal deficit would hit nearly $1.5 trillion this year. And the ink is projected to remain red at least through 2021.
WHETHER any new corporate tax system is intended to produce more, less or the same revenue is expected to be a big topic of debate. And, depending on what is ultimately proposed, the issue could be a deal-breaker, tax policy specialists say. So is whether to present an overhaul of corporate taxation as a stand-alone issue or to include it in a broader bill that encompasses personal taxation and possibly some new wrinkles, like a nationwide value-added tax.
The drive to change corporate taxation may have friends in high places, but the prevailing view is that there will be more talk on the topic than action. ''The debate will be further along, but I don't think we'll have tax reform done a year from now,'' said Mr. Weinberger at Ernst & Young. ''I think we've got a long process yet. I don't think people realize how hard it is to get the rate down and be revenue-neutral. It will be a real challenge to see how it plays out.''

HEADLINE: Seeking the Path to a Simpler Code

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
AMID deepening concern about the nation's long-term fiscal woes, momentum is building for bipartisan negotiations on a broad overhaul of the nation's labyrinthine tax code.
Americans are now paying less in taxes to the federal government, measured as a percentage of the nation's economic output, than at any point since 1950. Projections show the collective bill dropping further in 2011, thanks to the deal in December between President Obama and Congressional Republicans that continued all the Bush-era tax rates and granted a new payroll tax cut to most workers.
But federal tax policy can defy the basic laws of math for only so long. Even some fierce fiscal conservatives in Washington say that controlling the nation's mounting debt will require tax revenue to rise. That, in turn, may be creating an opportunity for advocates of a more efficient, streamlined system that could increase collections while simultaneously lowering rates.
''The best thing we could do on taxes for all Americans is to simplify the individual tax code,'' President Obama said in his State of the Union address. ''This will be a tough job, but members of both parties have expressed interest in doing this, and I am prepared to join them.'' 
A deadline looms: much of the tax code is to expire at the end of 2012, including the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts enacted under President George W. Bush that were originally supposed to expire on Jan. 1 this year.
Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, a longtime proponent of an overhaul, said he had a straightforward wish for taxpayers.
''I want them to get their springtime back,'' said Mr. Wyden, who along with former Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, is the author of perhaps the leading bipartisan tax proposal under discussion. ''We are going to see millions of Americans try to wade through this insanely complicated system, a system that just got more complicated as a result of the last few months.''
In securing their tax pact, the White House and Republicans settled on a huge package of legislation. It included the preservation of the Bush-era rates at all income levels, the new payroll tax cut for most workers, a continuation of reduced tax rates on dividends and capital gains, and a reinstatement of the federal estate tax but with an exemption for most families. The law also preserved some breaks from the 2009 economic stimulus program.
As a result, many taxpayers will fork over a smaller share to the Treasury in 2011 than ever before. Even with the economy strengthening, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has projected that government revenue in 2011 will be only 14.8 percent of the nation's economic output -- or 2.7 percentage points lower than the budget office had predicted before the December tax accord.
Rather than dispel the questions around federal tax policy, the deal reset the game clock on many provisions for an additional two years, calling for them to expire at the end of 2012 -- just after the next presidential election.
Some provisions are not supposed to last even that long. For instance, the payroll tax cut -- amounting to 2 percent of income up to $106,800, or as much as $2,136 a person -- is intended to be in place only for this year.
Some of the uncertainty was intentional. Mr. Bush and Republican lawmakers had used the 2010 expiration date as a way to blunt the effects of lower revenue on the long-term deficit and to ease passage of tax breaks through Congress. President Obama is using the 2012 expiration date as an opportunity to fulfill his campaign promise of ending tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans. Squeezed by the still-weak economic recovery and by the big Republican victory in the fall elections, Mr. Obama allowed the Bush-era rates to continue on income above $250,000 for couples and $200,000 for individuals.
The White House settled for some short-term economic stimulus -- the new payroll tax cut and the maintenance of extended jobless benefits (up to 99 weeks) for the long-term unemployed. But citing worries about the nation's mounting debt, the president began to beat the drum for a wide-scale tax overhaul for both individuals and corporations -- a point he stressed in his State of the Union address.
''Tonight, I'm asking Democrats and Republicans to simplify the system,'' he said. ''Get rid of the loopholes. Level the playing field. And use the savings to lower the corporate tax rate for the first time in 25 years -- without adding to our deficit.''
Lawmakers and aides on Capitol Hill say that despite all-too-evident conflicts, the political climate for tax restructuring is promising in some respects. Worries about the deficit, the temporary nature of current tax policy and the newly divided government may make a compromise more reachable.
''Congress must get our nation's fiscal house in order,'' Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah said this month upon being named the senior Republican on the tax-writing Finance Committee. ''We have to undertake meaningful tax reform and lower our nation's tax burden, simplifying the tax code and making it more efficient.''
REVAMPING the tax system may be easier than reaching agreement on spending cuts and changes to the big entitlement programs, Social Security and Medicare -- changes that could well be other crucial ingredients in any effort to address the federal government's long-term fiscal problems.
The December agreement set a model for negotiations between the White House and Republicans, with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. acting as envoy to his former colleagues in the Senate, where the Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, became the point man.
The ultimate goal of cleaning up the tax system is often boiled down to six words: ''broaden the base, lower the rates.''
Broadening the base refers to an effort to increase revenue by closing loopholes, by reducing the chances for tax evasion and cheating, and by eliminating or limiting special exceptions, including popular provisions like the home mortgage interest deduction, which are generally known as ''tax expenditures.''
Lowering the rates, of course, means cutting levies such as the 35 percent corporate tax rate, or marginal personal income tax rates. In its final report, the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform suggested that the lowest and highest marginal rates on personal income could be cut to 8 percent and 26 percent, from the current levels of 10 percent and 35 percent, if Congress were willing to eliminate all tax expenditures.
''The tax code is rife with inefficiencies, loopholes, incentives, tax earmarks and baffling complexity,'' the report said. ''We need to lower tax rates, broaden the base, simplify the tax code and bring down the deficit.''
No one disputes that the tax code is too complicated. According to aides to Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and the chairman of the Finance Committee, Congress has made more than 15,000 changes to the code since the last big overhaul in 1986. Critics say that all of those changes add up to a hodgepodge in which individuals and corporations waste precious time and money looking for loopholes and exceptions.
Until Congress and the White House figure out how to carry out a sweeping overhaul, however, individual taxpayers are likely to face relatively stable rules for two years -- allowing them to enjoy what may be the end of an era characterized by an unusually low federal tax burden.
Historically, tax revenue has averaged about 18 percent of the nation's economic output -- more than three percentage points higher than is expected in 2011 -- and virtually all fiscal experts agree that revenue must grow. Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and chairman of the House Budget Committee, has a plan that would take revenue to about 19 percent; the debt commission would push revenue to 21 percent.
But while taxes may be relatively low for the nation as a whole, not everyone is gaining from the changes. More than 50 million taxpayers -- about one-third of the total -- are likely to pay more in 2011 than in 2010 because they benefited more from the ''making work pay'' credit in the economic stimulus than they will from the new payroll tax cut.
The break-even point is approximately $20,000 in income for individuals and $40,000 for couples, according to Joseph Rosenberg of the Tax Policy Center, a research organization in Washington. Above those amounts, the payroll tax cut is a bigger benefit.
While the overall long-term tax burden is likely to increase, it is not clear how that change will come about. Marginal income tax rates could rise, but policy makers could go a different route and adopt a consumption tax, like the value-added tax common in many European countries, shifting emphasis away from income taxes.
And, of course, there is always the possibility that things will stay mostly the same, although the cost of maintaining a semblance of the status quo can be steep, as the December tax deal suggests.
''The sort of ironic thing is that it was basically an $850 billion package that most people won't notice,'' Mr. Rosenberg said. ''You need that much money just to hold things where they were.''

HEADLINE: Inside the Muslim (Journalist's) Mind

 BODY:
THE Pakistani public, long skeptical of American goals in Afghanistan and the Muslim world, is now outraged over Washington's insistence that the authorities release a former United States Special Forces soldier charged with killing two Pakistani men last month. In this instance, as always, Pakistan's tumultuous news media is the prism through which United States policy is reflected to the people, who have found themselves at the center of America's struggle against terrorism. 
So far, the picture has not been pretty: the George W. Bush administration demonized the Muslim news media; Muslim journalists returned the favor. But research shows that the Obama administration has the opportunity to take a more sophisticated approach to those who drive public opinion throughout the Islamic world.
Pakistan is a case in point: last year, we conducted a nationwide survey of 395 Pakistani journalists, supported by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. As the charts below show, our survey provided insight into where their beliefs and priorities intersect with American interests.
Not surprisingly, the overwhelming majority of Pakistani journalists oppose United States military operations in their country and in Afghanistan. Still, as a group, they are not overtly anti-American -- three-quarters have a favorable view of the American people and a majority believe President Obama when he says he wants to withdraw troops from the region.
It may surprise most Americans to know that Afghanistan falls fairly low among issues Pakistani journalists believe are important. Rather, the priorities are education and domestic terrorism, followed by the economy and domestic political change. This overlaps nicely with the American ''stones into schools'' strategy that development is the antidote to militancy. Indeed, as the United States broadens its effort to win the hearts and minds of Muslims, it would do well to look into the heads of the journalists who shape opinions in those societies. -- LAWRENCE PINTAK, dean of the college of communication at Washington State University and author of ''The New Arab Journalist: Mission and Identity in a Time of Turmoil,'' and SYED JAVED NAZIR, a newspaper editor who teaches journalism at Lahore University of Management Sciences

HEADLINE: Could Your Senator Conquer the 1040?

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
WHO is America's funniest politician?
It sounds like a question with a built-in oxymoron, like ''What's the best-ever disco song?'' or ''Do you serve jumbo shrimp?''
Still, there's a comer on the scene: Tim Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota. He shows promise. When, in his speeches, he paraphrases the movie ''Talladega Nights'' and says, ''I want to thank the Lord for my smoking-hot wife,'' how could you not smile?
Lately on the lecture-and-talk-show circuit, Mr. Pawlenty, a Republican, has been trotting out an out-and-out zinger: he says members of Congress should have to do their own taxes. Hilarious, right?
As he recently put it to George Stephanopoulos on ''Good Morning America'' on ABC, they should have to do the job with ''no help of an accountant, a lawyer or a tax specialist.'' 
I called up Mr. Pawlenty to ask how the line goes over with the crowds. ''It kills, right?''
He seemed a bit taken aback. He's as serious as a 1040, he said -- members of Congress should have to fill out their own forms, ''so they can experience the full brunt of the mindless, senseless burden that is our U.S. tax code that they visit on hard-working Americans.''
''I don't mean it as a joke,'' he said.
But, I asked, doesn't the line get a laugh?
''I offer it a little tongue-in-cheek,'' he acknowledged. ''But I mean it seriously. I think it's worth doing.''
By the way, I asked Mr. Pawlenty if he did his own taxes.
''No way!'' he replied, with a tone that suggested he had made his point.
The Pawlenty plan is promising, and not just because I'm particularly pleased with the alliteration. Watching our elected representatives take on the challenge, broken pencils and all, could make for some entertaining moments -- a kind of reality TV meets C-Span.
Some members of Congress, after all, have developed some quite interesting tax issues for themselves. Think for a moment about former Representative Randy Cunningham, and how, pencil in hand and calculator before him, he might have dealt with the income from his many bribes. Did he keep receipts?
And how about the foil-wrapped $90,000 in cash that investigators found in the freezer of former Representative William J. Jefferson ? Would the brick of bills be classified as frozen assets?
Let's face it, even members of Congress without such problems probably have more complicated financial situations than most of us do. Some of them, like Senators John Kerry and John McCain, might have had relatively straightforward personal tax returns, except that they married into big, big money.
Then there's Representative Darrell Issa, the California Republican who is the new chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and who made hundreds of millions of dollars manufacturing car alarms. (By the way, when you hear ''Step away from the car,'' it's often Mr. Issa's voice warning you.)
When I asked Frederick Hill, his spokesman, whether Mr. Issa would be willing to fill out his own forms, he gamely joked, ''You wouldn't believe me if I just told you he did the 1040-EZ?''
Think for a moment about Representative Michele Bachmann, Republican of Minnesota, who has raised 5 children and 23 foster children. If she claimed all of them as dependents, would she have so many deductions that the government would end up owing her money?
I called Noah Kimerling, a retired accountant who used to do my taxes, and asked what he thought of the Pawlenty plan.
''I don't think they have the ability to do it, based on what they say publicly,'' he said. As for Ms. Bachmann, he said, the alternative minimum tax would kick in, no matter how many dependents she could claim.
After a little digging, I discovered that Ms. Bachmann's children are all grown anyway. Besides, she happens to know her way around a tax form, having earned an advanced degree in tax law from the William & Mary Law School. She may be one of the few members of Congress who actually could do her own taxes without breaking a sweat!
I called Paul L. Caron, a visiting professor of law at the Pepperdine University School of Law in California, and he seemed charmed by the Pawlenty plan -- though, he noted, the idea ''has been around for a while.''
In fact, he suggested, why stop at taxes? ''How about requiring members of Congress to go through T.S.A. lines at airports like the rest of us and get body-scanned? Getting their license plates renewed at the Department of Motor Vehicles?''
That's bold, but I've never met a plan that couldn't be made even bolder. Why not send our lawmakers to serve in Iraq and Afghanistan? It would certainly focus their thinking about the wars, and ensure that veterans aren't slighted on health care and benefits when they return home.
Turn it up to 11! What about the space program, which will lose the only American-controlled path to space this year when the shuttle program ends? Members of Congress might gain a sense of what the program is all about if we sent them to the International Space Station.
The only question is whether to bring them home again.
WHICH gets us back to the concept of a reality show. Imagine this: Instead of voting one another off the island, the astro-lawmakers have to earn the right to come home. The losers stick with freeze-dried food and the zero-gravity toilet.
Put this puppy on pay-per-view, and the federal deficit will be paid down in no time.
In fact, let's send these folks on a never-ending, Pawlenty-inspired empathy tour so they can learn what it's like to live with failing schools and emergency-room visits without insurance. They don't seem all that interested in actually fixing our problems, so let's have them try living with them.
They'll spend so much time on Pawlenty-palooza, finding out what it's like to be an average American, that they won't have any time at all to pass legislation.
Many of us may be able to live with that. But I'd like to see them actually try to work together and solve problems instead of just shouting about how the other guy caused them.
If they can't do that, there's one more all-too-common American experience they could learn about: standing in an unemployment line.

HEADLINE: Emergency Fund-Raising For Seattle Theater

BYLINE: By KATE TAYLOR

 BODY:
Seattle's esteemed Intiman Theater, which in recent months has acknowledged financial problems, announced on Friday that it would have to close unless it could raise $500,000 by the end of March and another $250,000 each by June and September.
The Intiman's board president, Kim Anderson, said in an interview that the board only became aware of the dire financial situation after the theater's former managing director, Brian Colburn, abruptly resigned on Nov. 1. At that point, Ms. Anderson said, the board unearthed problems that included unpaid bills, significant unreported cost overruns, and income that had been booked from a co-producing arrangement that had not been finalized. 
''We discovered that basically our finance department appears to have been nonfunctional for a few months,'' Ms. Anderson said. Asked if the board bore any responsibility for not seeing warning signs earlier, Ms. Anderson said no.
''We had regularly scheduled finance committee meetings and board meetings, and at each of these meetings the financial statements that were presented were thoroughly reviewed,'' she said. ''The information that we have discovered was either misrepresented or not included in the financial statements we were receiving, and we had no way to discover that until after Brian left, and we went in and started reconstructing our books and records and reviewing the situation.''
A message left Friday evening at Mr. Colburn's home was not returned. In an interview with The Puget Sound Business Journal in December, Mr. Colburn said he had resigned because he was no longer an effective managing director, but he disputed the charge that he had given inaccurate reports to the board. ''I don't believe that is true, and certainly not intentionally,'' he said. He blamed the theater's financial crisis largely on a decline in ticket sales.
According to a fact sheet provided by the theater, since the crisis came to light the board has raised $874,315 in cash, created a 2011 budget that cuts over $1.4 million from the previous year's budget, established a plan to pay back rent and started an extensive audit. The theater will put its staff on a four-day work week but has not canceled any of this year's productions. Ms. Anderson said that the board currently owes $700,000 in overdue bills and has a debt to the Intiman Theatre Foundation, a separate nonprofit that was set up to raise an endowment fund. She said the board was considering merging the foundation into the theater, a move that she said might require the approval of the state attorney general.
This is the Intiman's first season under the artistic direction of Kate Whoriskey, who took over last year from Bartlett Sher. Mr. Sher, who had run the theater since 2000, was deeply respected by the board, but he was also away from Seattle for long periods during his last years as artistic director, directing productions for Lincoln Center Theater (including ''South Pacific,'' for which he won a Tony) and the Metropolitan Opera.
Ms. Anderson said that despite the challenges, she was confident the theater would be able to meet its fundraising goals and stay open. ''There are donors that we are going back and discussing this with,'' she said. ''We think there is significant support for Intiman in the community.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Yemen Youth In Protests Square Off With Forces

BYLINE: By LAURA KASINOF and J. DAVID GOODMAN; Laura Kasinof reported from Sana, and J. David Goodman from New York.

 BODY:
SANA, Yemen -- Young protesters in Yemen squared off against security forces on Sunday, and some marched on the presidential palace here, witnesses said, as a third day of demonstrations sought to emulate the revolution in Egypt.
The protests, organized largely via text message, were the largest yet by young Yemenis, with more than 1,000 marching. And it appeared to mark a rift with opposition groups who had organized previous demonstrations that wrested significant concessions from President Ali Abdullah Saleh, including the promise that he would relinquish power in 2013.
Those established opposition groups did not join the crowd on Sunday, which was calling for the immediate ouster of the president. After the initial demonstration, a smaller group of young protesters peeled off and marched toward the presidential palace, only to be violently repulsed by armed security forces both uniformed and in plain clothes, some armed with stun guns, witnesses said. There were reports of several injuries, but no deaths. 
''The J.M.P. in our opinion -- the opinion of the students -- is that they move in stages,'' said a 30-year-old protester, Mohamed Mohsin, referring to the Joint Meeting Parties, a coalition of opposition parties. ''But we go to the demonstrations to send the message to the leadership now.''
Unlike the earlier protests in Yemen, which were highly organized and marked by color-coordinated clothing and signs, the spontaneity of the younger demonstrators appeared to have more in common with popular uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt, where opposition groups watched from the sidelines as leaderless revolts grew into revolutions.
The opposition coalition said at a news conference in Sana, the capital, on Sunday that it welcomed the new street protests, but cautioned that the situation could quickly escalate if mass uprisings took hold in Yemen, a country with a well-armed populace. ''If the people on the streets take the lead, we will say thank you for that,'' said Yassin Saeed Noman, a socialist party leader, adding that the opposition ''should deal wisely with this big movement.''
The opposition group said that 120 people had been arrested in protests on Saturday and Sunday in Taiz, a poverty-stricken town about a four-hour drive south of the capital, as waves of youthful unrest spread to new places.
Sheik Hamid al-Ahmar, an opposition leader, said in an interview on Sunday that political leaders had tried to prevent the younger demonstrators from taking to the streets to demand immediate changes to the autocratic rule of Mr. Saleh. But, he said, ''It's not that they aren't cooperating with the new protests,'' only that opposition leaders would like to move more slowly.
Mr. Saleh, an important ally of the United States in the fight against terrorism, has in recent weeks sought to counter a rising tide of opposition and preserve his three-decade rule by raising army salaries, halving income taxes and ordering price controls, among other concessions.
Since Hosni Mubarak resigned as president of Egypt on Friday, police officers, some of them armed, have filled Sana's central square -- which, like its Cairo counterpart, is called Tahrir Square -- blocking access with concertina wire to prevent protesters from gathering. Witnesses reported seeing men in plain clothes with AK-47s on the street.
''This is a revolution across the whole Arab world,'' said Jalal Bakry, an unemployed protester standing in front of the main entrance to Sana University. ''If those in Tahrir Square want to kill me, that's O.K. We will still be peaceful.''
A text message sent around on Sunday called on Yemenis to ''participate in the student and youth revolution in a demonstration to demand the removal of the leader and to celebrate the Egyptian revolution, tomorrow at 9 a.m. in the front of the main gate of Sana University.'' Protesters also posted messages on Facebook to rally supporters on Sunday, but social networking sites remain less of an organizing tool in Yemen than in Tunisia and Egypt because of low Internet penetration.
Even before large-scale protests first began in January, a rebellion in the north and a struggle for secession in the south have threatened the fragile stability of Yemen, one of the poorest countries in the Middle East. The government's precarious hold on control has been a source of concern for the United States, which has received support from Mr. Saleh to fight the Yemeni branch of Al Qaeda.
In a visit to Sana this month, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton urged dialogue between Mr. Saleh and the opposition in the interest of preserving stability.
At its news conference on Sunday, the opposition coalition said it would be willing to restart talks with the ruling party if specific conditions were met, like including members of the southern separatist movement in the dialogue.
While the aims of Yemen's southern secessionist movement are different from the political opposition's in Sana, they too have claimed inspiration from the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions. Demonstrations throughout the southern port city Aden have increased in number over the past two weeks despite high security citywide, and last Friday, thousands protested throughout Yemen's south.
''In Egypt they chanted 'The people want to expel the system,' but we chant 'The people want to cut the ties,' '' said Wagdy al-Shaaby, a secessionist protester who marched on Friday in the southern city of Zinjibar.
It remained unclear to what degree a widening popular uprising could set off renewed armed clashes in the south. Protests across the south have been notably more violent than those in the country's north.
Southern separatists have called for the creation of an independent state and are therefore less committed to reforming or even toppling Mr. Saleh's government. Its leaders are divided over how much they should work with the opposition coalition in Sana.

HEADLINE: Running on Empty

 BODY:
The new financial regulation law gave the Securities and Exchange Commission a big new job to police hedge funds, derivatives dealers and credit agencies -- some of the main culprits in the financial meltdown. It authorized raising the commission's budget to $2.25 billion, over five years. Now Congress is threatening to deny the S.E.C. the necessary financing to carry out its duties. 
What makes this even more absurd is that the S.E.C. doesn't cost taxpayers a dime. Its budget, like that of other financial regulators, is covered by fees assessed on Wall Street firms. While the other regulators decide their own financing needs, Congress sets the S.E.C.'s budget.
The agency's budget was due to rise $200 million this year to $1.3 billion, but hasn't because of the across-the-board freeze in discretionary spending. If House Republicans get their way and roll back spending to 2008 levels, the S.E.C. budget would fall to $906 million.
Mary Schapiro, the chairwoman of the S.E.C., warns that more budget cutting will hamstring its ability to carry out its usual duties of policing increasingly complex securities markets -- let alone discharge its new responsibilities. A group of lawyers representing the financial companies regulated by the S.E.C. sent a letter to lawmakers urging them to increase the commission's budget. Otherwise, they warn, the markets will lose investors' trust. ''The regulator of our capital markets is running almost on empty,'' they wrote.
The S.E.C. needs better technology and more employees. S.E.C. officials have pointed out that it took the commission three months to understand what happened during last May's ''flash crash,'' because it took that long for its computers to handle all the trading data. The number of investment advisers that the S.E.C. must police has grown by half over the past decade and trading volume has doubled. In the years running up to the financial crisis, the commission's staff declined.
Ms. Schapiro planned to hire 800 employees this year to beef up enforcement and meet the agency's new duties. Those plans are on hold. The commission has also started cutting back on investigations and is considering canceling technology upgrades, including new data management systems and a new digital forensics lab.
The S.E.C.'s recent record was tarnished by its failure to uncover Bernard Madoff's gargantuan Ponzi scheme, and it was caught off guard by the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. The Bush administration's lax approach to regulation should bear much of the blame. But a lack of qualified investigators was also a big problem. If the commission is to do its job right, it needs the resources to do it.

HEADLINE: Economy In Japan Fell 0.3% At Year End

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Japan's economy contracted in the fourth quarter when compared with the previous three months, though analysts are optimistic about the country's prospects for the rest of the year.
Japan's gross domestic product fell 0.3 percent in the October-December quarter as the end of generous government incentives on environmentally friendly cars resulted in a temporary decline in spending. At an annualized rate, Japan's economy shrank 1.1 percent from the previous quarter.
The contraction, the first in five quarters, brought Japan's economy for 2010 to $5.47 trillion, the Japanese Cabinet Office said. That compared with a $5.88 trillion economy for fast-growing China. The latest numbers were further evidence of China's rapid ascent as an economic superpower, as China surpassed Japan last summer after the half-year gross domestic product numbers were released. Just five years ago, China's gross domestic product was around $2.3 trillion, about half Japan's. 
Japan's economy has stagnated over the last two decades, reflecting its continued decline in economic and political clout.
The country had the world's second-largest economy after the United States for much of the last four decades. In the 1980s, its rapid growth even led to talk of the Japanese economy's overtaking that of the United States.
But while Japan's economy is now mature and its population quickly aging, China is in the throes of urbanization and industrialization. Still, China's per-capita income is about $3,600, less than one-tenth that of the United States or Japan.
Japan's economy, however, has benefited from China's rapid growth, initially as businesses shifted production there to take advantage of lower costs, and as local incomes rose, by tapping an increasingly lucrative market for Japanese goods.
Though Japan's economy contracted in the fourth quarter, it expanded 3.9 percent over all in 2010 compared with a year earlier, signaling a recovery from a punishing recession in the wake of the global economic crisis.
Last month, the Japanese government said in its economic assessment that its economy could soon rebound, as exports and factory output are helped by strong demand from China and other emerging economies in Asia.
''While weakness will remain for the time being, the Japanese economy is expected to pick up on improvements in overseas economies and effects of government policy steps,'' Kaoru Yosano, economy minister, told reporters after the release of the data.
The outlook has lowered expectations that the Bank of Japan, which is starting a two-day policy meeting on Monday, will take any imminent measures to ease monetary policy.
In the October-December quarter, private consumption in Japan fell 0.7 compared with the previous quarter, dragged lower by the expiration in September of generous government benefits for fuel-efficient cars. A tax increase on tobacco in October also hurt cigarette sales. Net exports were hurt by a surge in the yen to 15-year highs, which has made Japan's exports less competitive. Capital investment rose 0.9 percent from the previous quarter, falling short of the 1.5 percent pace seen in July to September.
The news came just over two weeks after the credit ratings agency Standard & Poor's downgraded Japan's long-term sovereign debt, to AA- from AA, three levels below the highest possible rating. It was the first time S.& P. had downgraded Japanese government debt since 2002.
A rival ratings agency, Moody's, kept its Aa2 rating for Japan, its third-highest rating, though it later warned that the assessment might be downgraded if the nation failed to carry out fiscal reforms.
Japan's liabilities will hit 204 percent of its gross domestic product this year, outstripping the 137 percent for debt-ridden Greece, according to figures from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
When S.& P. downgraded Japan, it said that the Japanese government had no ''coherent strategy'' to address its ballooning deficit, and that its already high debt burden was likely to continue to rise further than it had anticipated before the financial crisis. A rapidly aging population is adding to the country's woes, raising the likelihood of increasing social security and pension obligations in the future.
S.& P. said then that it expected Japan's debt to continue rising until the middle of this decade, and ''We do not forecast the government achieving a primary balance before 2020, unless a significant fiscal consolidation program is implemented beforehand.''
Japan's G.D.P. numbers did not affect the stock market in the country. The benchmark Nikkei stock index was up 0.8 percent at midday on Monday. The market was closed on Friday for a national holiday.

HEADLINE: Wall Street's Dead End

BYLINE: By FELIX SALMON. 
Felix Salmon is the finance blogger at Reuters.

 BODY:
THE stock market has been big news in recent days. Last week's report that Deutsche Borse, a giant German exchange, intends to buy the New York Stock Exchange, creating a company worth some $24 billion, arrived shortly after the Dow broke the 12,000-point barrier for the first time since before the financial crisis.
These developments drew headlines because they seemed to exemplify significant trends in the American economy. But look at America's stock exchanges more closely, and there's less to them than meets the eye. In truth, the stock market is becoming increasingly irrelevant -- a trend that threatens the core principles of American capitalism. 
These days a healthy stock market doesn't mean a healthy economy, as a glance at the high unemployment rate or the low labor-market participation rate will show. The Tea Party is right about one thing: What's good for Wall Street isn't necessarily good for Main Street. And the Germans aren't buying the New York Stock Exchange for its commoditized, highly competitive and ultra-low-margin stock business, but rather for its lucrative derivatives operations.
The stock market is still huge, of course: the companies listed on American exchanges are valued at more than $17 trillion, and they're not going to disappear in the foreseeable future.
But the glory days of publicly traded companies dominating the American business landscape may be over. The number of companies listed on the major domestic exchanges peaked in 1997 at more than 7,000, and it has been falling ever since. It's now down to about 4,000 companies, and given its steep downward trend will surely continue to shrink.
Nor are the remaining stocks an obvious proxy for the health of the American economy. Innovative American companies like Apple and Google may be worth hundreds of billions of dollars, but most of them don't pay dividends or employ many Americans, and their shares are essentially speculative investments for people making a bet on how we're going to live in the future.
Put another way, as the number of initial public offerings steadily declines, the stock market is becoming little more than a place for speculators and algorithms to compete over who can trade his way to the most money.
What the market is not doing so well is its core public function: allocating capital efficiently. Apple, for instance, is hugely profitable and sits on an enormous pile of cash; it is thus very unlikely to use its highly rated stock to pay for any acquisitions. It hasn't used the stock market to raise money since 1981, and there's a good bet it never will again.
Meanwhile, the companies in which people most want to invest, technology stars like Facebook and Twitter, are managing to avoid the public markets entirely by raising hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars privately. You and I can't buy into these companies; only very select institutions and well-connected individuals can. And companies prefer it that way.
A private company's stock isn't affected by the unpredictable waves of the stock market as a whole. Its chief executive can concentrate on running the company rather than answering endless questions from investors, analysts and the press.
There's much less pressure to meet quarterly earnings targets. When the stock does trade, the deals can be negotiated quietly, in private markets, rather than fall victim to short-term speculation from the high-frequency traders who populate public markets. And companies love how private markets allow them to avoid much of the regulatory burden of being public.
That burden comes largely from the Securities and Exchange Commission, which was created in the wake of the 1929 stock-market crash to protect small investors. But if the move to private markets continues, small investors aren't going to need much protection any more: they'll be able to invest in only a relative handful of companies anyway.
Only the biggest and oldest companies are happy being listed on public markets today. As a result, the stock market as a whole increasingly fails to reflect the vibrancy and heterogeneity of the broader economy. To invest in younger, smaller companies, you increasingly need to be a member of the ultra-rich elite.
At risk, then, is the shareholder democracy that America forged, slowly, over the past 50 years. Civilians, rather than plutocrats, controlled corporate America, and that relationship improved standards of living and usually kept the worst of corporate abuses in check. With America Inc. owned by its citizens, the success of American business translated into large gains in the stock portfolios of anybody who put his savings in the market over most of the postwar period.
Today, however, stock markets, once the bedrock of American capitalism, are slowly becoming a noisy sideshow that churns out increasingly meager returns. The show still gets lots of attention, but the real business of the global economy is inexorably leaving the stock market -- and the vast majority of us -- behind.

HEADLINE: Fake Liquors Flow as Demand Soars for China's Fabled Sorghum Spirit

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS; Zhang Jing and Xiyun Yang contributed research.

 BODY:
MAOTAI, China -- If history is indeed written by the victors, then this isolated mountain hamlet in southern Guizhou Province hit the jackpot when Red Army soldiers sought refuge here in the spring of 1935. Exhausted by their long-distance retreat from Nationalist forces, Mao's guerrillas used the town's bracing 144-proof liquor to disinfect wounds, tame diarrhea and take the edge off their jangled nerves.
''The Long March was a success in large part due to Maotai,'' the rebel commander Zhou Enlai later told historians. In 1949, after becoming prime minister of the newly established People's Republic, Mr. Zhou designated the sorghum-based liquor, called Moutai, China's ''national wine,'' giving it an undeniable marketing edge over the other gullet-searing grain spirits, collectively known as baijiu, tossed back at banquet tables across the nation.
But when the retail price hit nearly $200 a bottle last month, a 50 percent increase over two years, Chinese drinkers erupted in outrage, accusing the state-owned distillery of discarding its revolutionary roots to gouge the little guy. It did not help when media reports revealed that the same bottle sold for half that much in the United States and Europe. 
''I hear most of it gets delivered to Zhongnanhai,'' said Wang Yonghui, 32, a bank teller and baijiu aficionado, referring to the Beijing compound that houses the country's top leaders. ''We pay more, and they get it for free.''
Here in Maotai, where the pungent odor of fermenting sorghum is overpowering and almost everyone works for the distillery, spiking prices have become a point of pride.
But the higher prices have increased the ranks of those who traffic in counterfeit Moutai -- the name comes from the town's prerevolutionary spelling -- and they, too, are savoring a surge in business.
Despite a national campaign against fake Moutai, the authorities seem to be losing the battle against counterfeiters, who have perfected the look and taste of the real thing. All across town, stores sell Moutai's distinctive white bottle, and chemical vendors shamelessly hawk additives that can turn run-of-the-mill homemade spirits into liquid gold.
''We can put any label you want on any bottle you want,'' bragged Ren Longmei, a taxi driver whose family operates a backyard distillery, as does nearly everyone here. ''How much do you want to buy?''
Although company officials blame a shortage of sorghum for the price increase, experts said it had more to do with soaring demand, an outgrowth of China's sizzling economy, and the arrival of the Lunar New Year on Feb. 3, a holiday during which gift-giving reaches its frenzied peak.
''Moutai has become China's Louis Vuitton,'' said Liu Yuan, general secretary of the National Association for Liquor and Spirits Circulation, a trade group. ''Given the limited output and steep price, it's a good way for officials to curry favor and for the rich to show off their wealth.''
Last month, a 1959 vintage bottle of Moutai sold for $152,000 at auction and a 30-year-old bottle can set you back more than $3,000. The run on supplies has forced official Moutai outlets to institute a strict two-bottle limit.
Yan Changzhou, who sells bona fide Moutai at a factory outlet in Beijing, said stores like his received only 40 bottles a day from the state-run distributor. Lucky buyers must be there when his shop opens at 9 a.m. Supplies, he said, are often gone in minutes. ''I get a lot of people screaming at me,'' he explained last week as disappointed customers came and quickly left. ''The pressure has never been so intense.''
Moutai fans breathlessly cite its revolutionary pedigree and are quick to compare its refinement to Champagne or Scotch. They point out that good Moutai takes a year to ferment and at least four more years to age. ''The way its flavor dances on your tongue and tickles your senses is something that other kinds of baijiu cannot match,'' said Chen Yu, 38, an insurance company employee and self-described Moutai connoisseur who has already bought six bottles this month, two at a time.
Others, especially Westerners who find themselves trapped at Chinese banquets, might find that charitable: Descriptions like rubbing alcohol and diesel fuel are convenient and common. And the spirit's kick -- its alcohol content tops out at 53 percent -- is so notorious that White House officials warned President Richard Nixon to avoid the stuff during his 1972 visit to China. ''Under no, repeat, no circumstances should the president actually drink from his glass in response to banquet toasts,'' Alexander Haig, then an aide to Henry Kissinger, warned in a cable before Mr. Nixon's arrival.
It is not clear whether the president heeded the warnings as he circled the room vigorously toasting his hosts. But Chinese officials have long attributed the visit's success to the 30-year-old Moutai that was sloshing around the Great Hall of the People. ''As the sweet fragrance of Moutai wafted across the room, the American guests became intrigued, grins appeared on their faces, and they were visibly happy and relaxed'' is how the Communist Party's official account described the evening.
Even as rising incomes and changing tastes fuel increased sales of imported wine and spirits, the Chinese are still extremely fond of their baijiu. Last year, consumers downed 1.8 billion gallons of homegrown baijiu compared with 264 million gallons of wine, both domestic and foreign, according to Mr. Liu of the national liquor association.
Back in Maotai, population 49,000, the entire town seems to be in the throes of baijiu fever. In recent months, 15,000 people have been evicted from the hills overlooking the distillery to make way for an expansion that will nearly double annual production, now at 23,000 tons. In the coming years they will be joined by 16,000 more people, most of whom will be relocated to what officials are calling ''New Town of National Liquor,'' a generic stand of high-rises a few miles down a newly built highway.
Even as the Moutai distillery turns large swaths of the ancient town to rubble, it is rare to hear a disparaging word about the company.
Wang Yi, 25, a warehouse worker who graduated from company-run Moutai High, eagerly welcomed a group of foreigners into his living room recently. His three-story house, newly built and faced in gleaming white tiles, was a testament to the prosperity generated by the distillery. It was also slated to be demolished.
Mr. Wang shrugged when asked how he felt about moving. ''There's nothing we can do about it,'' he said. Then he took out a business card for his family's private baijiu distillery. Asked if it had a name, Mr. Wang demurred. ''We can make any brand you want,'' he said with a smile.

HEADLINE: From Rising Star to Wallflower, the Netbook Tells a Tale

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Remember the Last Big Thing in computing? You'll be forgiven for having forgotten it was the netbook -- a small notebook computer with a slender price tag, about $300.
Today, tablets are all the rage, including the iPad from Apple and a host of new entries starting to come from rivals like Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Research In Motion and Samsung. But less than two years ago, in 2009, netbooks were seen as the earth-shaking force in the industry, potentially changing the economics of the business and undermining the technology leaders, Intel and Microsoft.
Things didn't work out that way. Netbook sales were meteoric in 2009, jumping eightfold in the United States, to 7.5 million devices, and tripling worldwide to 34 million. Yet the torrid growth stalled last year.
The extent of the changed fortunes for the product became truly evident recently, when year-end sales tallies were calculated. In the holiday season, for example, retail sales of netbook computers in America fell 38 percent from a year earlier, according to the market research firm NPD. 
The netbook story, according to industry executives and analysts, offers real-world lessons in technology innovation, business strategy and marketing.
To some degree, the new thing -- the iPad -- supplanted the not-so-new thing -- netbooks. Still, analysts say, the tablet effect is only part of the answer. Sales of netbooks, they note, were slowing even before the iPad went on sale in April. And the products themselves are hardly substitutes for each other; one is all no-frills efficiency, the other more an appealing luxury, priced at $500 and up.
Instead, it is more likely that makers of netbooks oversold a product that underperformed. In the United States, analysts say, early adopters of new technology helped propel the netbook surge, attracted by the new entrant's feather-light weight and low cost. But early adopter buyers, analysts say, tend to be picky consumers. The netbooks they bought were underpowered PCs that performed sluggishly and could not handle many popular software applications.
''The seduction was ultraportable, inexpensive computing, but consumers found there were too many tradeoffs,'' said A. M. Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. ''Ultimately, it just fell short.''
The vision of a very low cost, portable personal computer has been around for decades. But the impetus that prodded the development of today's netbook computers came, as it does so often, from outside the established industry. In this case, it was a nonprofit, One Laptop Per Child, which in 2005 declared its intention to make $100 computers for children in poor countries, without using technology from the industry's dominant chip and software suppliers, Intel and Microsoft. It was a stretch goal, and still is, with the rugged laptops for children costing about $200. But it was an appealing idea that attracted corporate support and a team of scientists, and spurred the industry to rethink its designs and pricing.
Intel and Microsoft first resisted the idea of such very inexpensive computing, for the obvious reason that it would potentially put a dent in their profits. But eventually, they embraced the concept, tailored for a broader commercial market. Intel deftly coined the term ''netbook,'' as a new category of ''companion PCs'' segregated from its more profitable notebook PC business.
Both Intel and Microsoft created lower-cost offerings -- Intel's stripped-down Atom processor, introduced in 2008, and Microsoft's expanded menu of software versions at varying prices.
One result was a sharp drop in the price of notebook computers, also known as laptop computers. In 2005, notebooks on average cost roughly $1,000. Today, the average price is about $465 (that excludes Apple's higher-priced notebooks, which account for about 5 percent of the market worldwide).
''We had an impact across the broader industry by helping drive prices way down,'' said Mary Lou Jepsen, former chief technology officer of One Laptop Per Child. ''We showed that innovation can come up from the bottom.''
For the most part, analysts say, netbooks enlarged the computer market rather than eating into sales of conventional notebooks. And the industry leaders, Intel and Microsoft, succeeded in adapting to the netbook challenge, assimilating it and containing it, preserving their lucrative profits.
The PC powers, said Bob O'Donnell, an analyst at IDC, were ''deathly afraid of the cannibalization of the regular notebook market, but it really didn't happen.''
While sales are slowing, the netbook business is far from dead. The market research firm IDC predicts that worldwide sales will fall in 2011 by about 7 percent, but that would still be 32.9 million netbooks. They account for roughly 10 percent of the total PC market.
But the engine of growth for netbooks, the technology enthusiasts, analysts say, disappeared. Ryan Champlin, vice president for operations at Cook Children's Health Care System in Fort Worth, considered buying a netbook and tried out a few owned by colleagues. But Mr. Champlin, who has a conventional notebook and a smartphone, decided against the purchase, seeing it as an underpowered PC.
Six months ago, though, he did buy an iPad because, he says, it provides a different computing experience. ''I turn on my iPad and my e-mail is just there, no waiting for a PC to boot up,'' said Mr. Champlin, who uses the tablet for e-mail, Web browsing, watching movies and playing the popular game Angry Birds.
Netbooks continue to enjoy brisk sales in cost-conscious markets, including China and Latin America, and in sales to schools, which want an affordable way to equip students with computers.
Companies are pursuing new netbook technology and software support, and industry executives say those advances could reinvigorate the category. The AppUp online store from Intel, which offers software downloads for programs that run on Intel chips, last month added a netbook version of Angry Birds. Intel keeps improving its Atom chips for netbooks. The Fusion chip sets from Advanced Micro Devices, introduced in January, promise to bring sophisticated graphics-processing to the netbook market.
Indeed, A.M.D. executives say the time has come to bury the name ''netbook.'' ''The marketing no longer needs to suggest 'buyer beware,' '' said John Taylor, director of product marketing at A.M.D.
In the future, Mr. Taylor says, most PC sales will be machines costing $200 to $500, notebooks of varied sizes and designs, that deliver impressive performance, low energy consumption and 10 hours or more of battery life.
Does that mean $1,000 notebooks become extinct? Not at all, Mr. Taylor replied. But the more costly machines, he said, will have to move to new horizons of computing. Artificial intelligence features like computers that understand speech, gestures and facial expressions, he said, may become part of everyday computing. You talk to your computer, or direct it with hand gestures, while making coffee in the morning, for example.
''You finally transform the user interface, among other things,'' Mr. Taylor said.

HEADLINE: Housing Market Looks Sickest in Cities That Once Seemed Immune

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
SEATTLE -- Few believed the housing market here would ever collapse. Now they wonder if it will ever stop slumping.
The rolling real estate crash that ravaged Florida and the Southwest is delivering a new wave of distress to communities once thought to be immune -- economically diversified cities where the boom was relatively restrained.
In the last year, home prices in Seattle had a bigger decline than in Las Vegas. Minneapolis dropped more than Miami, and Atlanta fared worse than Phoenix.
The bubble markets, where builders, buyers and banks ran wild, began falling first, economists say, so they are close to the end of the cycle and in some cases on their way back up. Nearly everyone else still has another season of pain. 
''When I go out and talk to people around town, they say, 'Wow, I thought we were going to have a 12 percent correction and call it a day,' '' said Stan Humphries, chief economist for the housing site Zillow, which is based in Seattle. ''But this thing just keeps on going.''
Seattle is down about 31 percent from its mid-2007 peak and, according to Zillow's calculations, still has as much as 10 percent to fall. Mr. Humphries estimates the rest of the country will drop a further 5 and 7 percent as last year's tax credits for home buyers continue to wear off.
''We went into 2010 feeling gangbusters, thanks to Uncle Sam,'' Mr. Humphries said. ''We ended it feeling penniless, with home values tanking.''
The fact that even a fairly prosperous area like Seattle was ensnared in the downturn shows just how much of a national phenomenon the crash has been. The slump began when the low-quality loans that drove the latter stage of the boom began to go bad, but the resulting recession greatly enlarged the crisis. Many people could not get a mortgage, and others simply gave up the hunt.
Now, though the overall economy seems to be mending, housing remains stubbornly weak. That presents a vexing problem for the Obama administration, which has introduced several initiatives intended to help homeowners, with mixed success.
CoreLogic, a data firm, said last week that American home prices fell 5.5 percent in 2010, back to the recession low of March 2009. New home sales are scraping along the bottom. Mortgage applications are near a 15-year low, boding ill for the rest of the winter.
It has been a long, painful slide. At the peak, a downturn in real estate in Seattle was nearly unthinkable. In September 2006, after prices started falling in many parts of the country but were still increasing here, The Seattle Times noted that the last time prices in the city dropped on a quarterly basis was during the severe recession of 1982.
Two local economists were quoted all but guaranteeing that Seattle was immune ''if history is any indication.'' A risk index from PMI Mortgage Insurance gave the odds of Seattle prices dropping at a negligible 11 percent.
These days, the mood here is chastened when not downright fatalistic. If a recovery depends on a belief in better times, that seems a long way off.
Those who must sell close their eyes and hope for the best. Those who hope to buy see lower prices but often have lighter wallets, removing any sense of urgency.
Arne Klubberud and Melissa Lee-Klubberud paid $358,000 for a new, 960-square-foot townhouse on trendy Capitol Hill a few weeks after that Seattle Times article was published. Now, with one child and with hopes for more, they need more space. They just put the townhouse on the market for $300,000.
''Obviously, this is not the ideal situation,'' said Ms. Lee-Klubberud, a 32-year-old lawyer. They are hoping to take advantage of the sour market to buy at a good price, but first, they must sell for an amount that is acceptable. ''Everyone has their limits,'' she said. ''We have ours.''
On a dark, dank Sunday, a handful of people came to look at the three-level unit. One of them was Katherine Davis, who had just sold her house in the far eastern suburbs. It took 14 months, during which she had to drop the price several times. The equity she had accumulated over the decades disappeared quickly.
''At first, I thought it would be nice to come out of this with $200,000, but I adjusted my expectations,'' Ms. Davis said. She ended up with less than half of that. Her goal is to buy a small place in the city, but not yet. ''Selfishly, I'm hoping the market continues to drop,'' she said.
Increasing numbers of sellers are simply surrendering.
Megan and Ryan Dortch tried to sell their one-bedroom Eastlake condo for $325,000 two years ago. They rejected an offer of $295,000 as inadequate. A year later, they relisted it for $289,000, then $279,000, which was less than they paid. Without a sale at that price, they could not afford to buy a place big enough for them and their new baby.
They have given up on real estate. They are renting out their old apartment at a small loss every month, and living in a rented house. ''I don't expect the market to get better,'' said Ms. Dortch, 31, a customer service consultant.
Neither does Gene Burrus, another frustrated seller who became a landlord. ''Rent is so cheap it doesn't make sense to buy now,'' he said. He might reconsider if 10 or 15 percent more comes out of the market.
Redfin, a real estate brokerage firm based in Seattle, says foot traffic began picking up in the last several weeks. Mortgage rates are rising, which could nudge those who need to buy to make a deal now for fear rates will rise even more.
But whenever the market finally does pick up, all those accidental landlords will want to unload, putting another burden on the market. ''So many sellers are waiting in the shadows,'' said Redfin's chief executive, Glenn Kelman. ''The inventory is going to expand and expand and expand. I don't see any basis for significant price increases.''
While almost every economist is expecting another round of price declines for the next few months, many see a leveling off in the second half of the year. Fiserv, the company that produces the monthly Case-Shiller Home Price Indexes, analyzed prices in 375 communities. About three-quarters of them will be stable by December, Fiserv calculates.
''We're at a period near the bottom but with more volatility than we normally see at this point,'' said David Stiff, Fiserv's chief economist. ''This sort of double dip is unprecedented for housing.''
Maybe that is why belief in a bottom is as elusive now as fears of a top were in 2006.
''We would love to have a house,'' said Dan Cunningham, a 41-year-old renter. ''I have more than enough for a down payment. I'm preapproved for a loan. But I have to have confidence it's not going to lose another 20 percent.'' He plans to wait until he sees prices rising before making any offers.

HEADLINE: Closing the Achievement Gap Without Widening a Racial One

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP. 
E-mail: oneducation@nytimes.com

 BODY:
ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- There is no more pressing topic in education today than closing the achievement gap, and there is no one in America who knows more about the gap than Ronald Ferguson.
Although he is a Harvard professor based in Cambridge, Mass., Dr. Ferguson, 60, spends lots of time flying around the country visiting racially mixed public high schools. Part of what he does is academic, measuring the causes of the gap by annually surveying the performance, behaviors and attitudes of up to 100,000 students. And part is serving as a de facto educational social worker, meeting with students, faculty members and parents to explain what steps their schools can take to narrow the gap.
The gap is about race, of course, and it inevitably inflames passions. But there is something about Dr. Ferguson's bearing -- he is both big (6-foot-3) and soft-spoken -- that gets people to listen.
Morton Sherman, the Alexandria school superintendent, watched him defuse the anger at a meeting of 300 people. ''He talks about these things in a professorial way, a kind way,'' Dr. Sherman said. ''It's not about him. He doesn't try to be a rock star, although he is a rock star in this field.'' 
While he has a personal stake in closing the gap as an African-American parent who has raised three boys, Dr. Ferguson does not get emotional in tense situations -- he gets factual.
He is frequently quoted in the news media, and in recent months, he has played a major role in four important educational stories: the Gates study on evaluating teachers (his research shows that when kids say a teacher is good, they usually know what they're talking about); the Council of the Great City Schools study of the widening gap between white and black boys (12 percent of black fourth-grade boys were proficient in reading on a national test, compared with 38 percent of whites); a front-page story in The New York Times last year on the effectiveness of big high schools (at a time when small schools are in vogue); and as a member of the eight-person New York State panel that decided whether Cathleen P. Black should qualify for a waiver to be New York City's chancellor (he won't say how he voted).
Geoffrey Canada, president of the Harlem Children's Zone and star of the documentary ''Waiting for Superman,'' calls him a ''national treasure.'' Michael Casserly, director of the Council of the Great City Schools says, ''He has done more to help us understand the dynamics behind the achievement gap than anyone else in the country.'' Marian Wright Edelman, founder of the Children's Defense Fund, calls him ''thoughtful, careful, fearless.''
And yet, as best he can remember -- and he is a busy man with lots on his mind -- he has never been the subject of a profile in the news media.
One reason may be that his views on the gap are too research-based and nuanced to accommodate in a sound bite.
He is not as famous as John Ogbu, the late African-born Berkeley professor who argued that the gap could be explained by the cultural behavior of African-Americans, like mocking hard-working classmates for ''acting white.''
Nor is he as famous as Charles Murray, co-author of ''The Bell Curve,'' who suggested that the achievement gap is explained by inherited low intelligence.
Unlike Dr. Ogbu, an anthropology professor, and Dr. Murray, a political scientist, Dr. Ferguson has his doctorate in economics from M.I.T.; he has been trained to quantify everything. From his surveys of students in dozens of wealthy, racially mixed suburbs -- including Evanston, Ill.; Maplewood, N.J.; and Shaker Heights, Ohio -- he has calculated that the average grade of black students was C-plus, while white students averaged a B-plus. The gap.
At the high school here, T. C. Williams -- the setting of the movie ''Remember the Titans'' -- he found that 55 percent of white girls reported having an A or A-minus average, compared with less than 20 percent of black girls and boys.
His research indicates that half the gap can be predicted by economics: even in a typical wealthy suburb, blacks are not as well-to-do; 79 percent are in the bottom 50 percent financially, while 73 percent of whites are in the top 50 percent.
The other half of the gap, he has calculated, is that black parents on average are not as academically oriented in raising their children as whites. In a wealthy suburb he surveyed, 40 percent of blacks owned 100 or more books, compared with 80 percent of whites. In first grade, the percentage of black and white parents reading to their children daily was about the same; by fifth grade, 60 percent to 70 percent of whites still read daily to their children, compared with 30 percent to 40 percent of blacks.
He also works with teachers to identify biases, for instance: black children are less likely to complete homework because they are lazy. His research indicates that blacks and whites spend the same amount of time on homework, but blacks are less likely to finish. ''It's not laziness,'' he says. ''It's a difference in skills.''
How these messages get delivered is crucial. ''I don't want to be another one of those people lecturing black parents,'' he says. ''I tell them we in the black community -- we -- need to build stronger intellectual lives at home.''
He recalls speaking to a primarily white group at Georgia State University. Afterward, a black parent came up to him. ''He told me, 'I'm not saying you're wrong, but I'm not comfortable with you saying it in front of this audience,' '' Dr. Ferguson said. ''And I said, 'It's not ideal, but this was an opportunity to get these things to you.' ''
Ronald Franklin Ferguson grew up the eldest of five boys in a blue-collar section of Cleveland. Getting a good education was a top priority for his family. His grandmother and mother were both public school teachers; six of the seven children in his father's family attended college.
Two of his brothers picked careers that give back to the community. One is a rural doctor, the other works with children in the Fergusons' old neighborhood, using karate lessons to instill good values. The two other brothers had drug problems, and one died at age 39. Dr. Ferguson is raising the living brother's son.
Dr. Ferguson was not a typical child. ''When I was 8, I wanted to know what's a good job to help people,'' he said. ''The person I asked said, 'city planner.' So anyone who asked, I said, 'I want to be a city planner when I grow up.' ''
In 1986, he did his first educational study, and by the late 1990s, his work focused on the achievement gap. The first district he worked with was Shaker Heights. After the student newspaper published an article contrasting test scores of white and black students, all hell broke loose. Dr. Ferguson was invited in to help calm the waters.
He is a senior lecturer at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and the Kennedy School of Government. In 2005, he was a founder of the Achievement Gap Initiative at Harvard.
He is often surprised by what the numbers tell him. He was compiling test scores for special-education students when he noticed that the biggest school in Massachusetts, with more than 4,000 students, Brockton High, also had the largest gains in English scores by minority students. ''Just popped out at me,'' he said.
At meetings, he will turn passive-aggressive to move his agenda forward.
Shawn Thorpe, the T. C. Williams academic principal, suggested that teachers be given a list of Dr. Ferguson's suggestions so they could comment on those they liked and didn't like.
''I don't do that,'' Dr. Ferguson said. ''You get so much input, it's like a Tower of Babel.''
''Right,'' Mr. Thorpe said.
''Too many cooks in the kitchen,'' Dr. Ferguson said.
''A lot of pots on the stove,'' Mr. Thorpe said.
Dr. Ferguson offered to aggregate and disaggregate the data. ''Right,'' Mr. Thorpe said, and they moved on to the next thing.

HEADLINE: Uneven but Rapid Rise For Groupon in Japan

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
NIIGATA, Japan -- In this blustery provincial city on Honshu's northwest coast, dotted with rice paddies and pachinko parlors, a popular new service has people buzzing: Groupon.
Recently, a discount for eyelash extensions that a tiny beauty salon here offered through Groupon generated enough business to keep the salon's staff booked through May.
Groupon, which has confidently spurned a $6 billion takeover offer from Google, is not just a phenomenon in America. The deal-sharing service has found fertile ground in Japan, catching on even in places like Niigata that typically go unexplored by foreign corporations.
But if Groupon's rapid rise in this country indicates the universal appeal of a good deal -- 5.6 million people in Japan used Groupon in November -- the young company's performance is also exposing the difficulties of its simultaneous expansion at home and overseas. 
A restaurant based just south of Tokyo botched the execution of a nationwide deal for a New Year's meal sold via Groupon, for example, which became a big media story -- and turned the site's social networking capabilities back on itself, as angry consumers posted pictures of underwhelming deliveries like limp fish in lieu of the advertised caviar.
The debacle prompted Groupon's founder, Andrew Mason, to post a video apology on the Japanese version of the site, acknowledging that ''we really messed up.''
By many measures, the two-year-old company's international introduction has been a resounding success.
Groupon, based in Chicago, now pulls in more than $1 billion in annual revenue in the United States and overseas, and has about 50 million subscribers in 35 countries.
But the controversy stirred by a Super Bowl ad that many found oddly insensitive to hunger in Tibet -- the company has since withdrawn it -- suggested that Groupon still had much to learn about international diplomacy.
And Groupon's experience in Japan highlights another obstacle to its rapid international growth. The company's success in the United States quickly inspired a crowd of copycat sites in many of the foreign markets it had hoped to enter. So Groupon scrambled to snap up overseas upstarts, helping it build an impressive global network in record time, but also giving it only limited quality control over the discount deals being struck with local businesses.
The company entered the Japanese market last summer by buying a start-up, Q:Pod, for an estimated $10 million.
While there have been complaints about Groupon deals in the United States, most recently over an FTD florist deal that customers said overstated the discounts, some of the biggest complaints have been overseas, analysts say.
''Many local competitors were springing up, so Groupon felt the need to set up shop here and dominate very quickly,'' said Keiichi Yoneshima, an Internet analyst in Tokyo at Barclays Capital. ''But rapid growth might have meant it didn't pay enough attention to the details.''
Takuya Watanabe, operating officer at Groupon Japan, said that some merchants' deals were bound to fall through by no fault of Groupon's and that the company was prepared to offer full refunds when necessary.
And he defended Groupon's fast growth. ''Groupon is a global company, but it's also one that's all about small, local communities,'' Mr. Watanabe said. ''That means we don't just stay in the big cities. We get out there.''
Of course, Groupon would not be growing so fast if it were not offering something consumers find appealing: steep discounts, as much as 90 percent, on goods and services.
Promotions become valid only after a certain number of people sign up, with a running tally displayed beside each coupon, lending a social media energy to the deals. The businesses that advertise with Groupon bear no costs if coupons do not sell. When the deals succeed, Groupon takes a share of the coupon proceeds.
It is a particularly alluring business model for Japan. Though relatively rich, Japanese consumers have recently become stingier, bruised by a long-stagnant domestic economy.
Japanese consumers are also accustomed to using coupons, popularized here by Recruit, an advertising and media giant that publishes magazines packed with conventional coupons for restaurants and beauty salons.
Moreover, with shops and restaurants piled on top of each other in Japanese cities, competition is fierce. And so attention-grabbing deals are invaluable to businesses.
''Everything depends on getting noticed, about whether people are talking about you,'' said Yoshitaka Nomoto of Recruit, who leads marketing for Ponpare, its own Groupon-like service. ''Also, Japanese shoppers love being able to see how many other people have bought the same thing.''
It is little wonder, then, that Groupon's success in the United States spurred a flurry of similar upstarts in Japan, led by Piku, which opened for business in late April, and Recruit, which scrambled to open Ponpare in late July. By the end of the year, there were at least 147 similar Web sites in Japan, according to Sheep.jp, a Web services company.
But one of those sites, Q:Pod, which opened in late June, stood out. It not only had a reported 200 million yen ($2.4 million) in financing from the local venture capital firm Infinity Venture Partners, but also logistical support from PakuReserve, a mobile content and broadband company.
From the start, Q:Pod employed a team of 20, and was able to draw on a nationwide sales force of more than 200 at PakuReserve, which helped find companies to offer deals on the site. Q:Pod quickly extended its reach beyond Tokyo to do business in virtually untapped small markets across Japan. It also introduced versions of the site compatible with Japan's advanced cellphones.
Less than two months after its introduction, Q:Pod was snapped up by Groupon, and the growth continued. Flush with cash, it overwhelmed rivals in advertising exposure. It added staff and scoured Japan far and wide for new deals: 80 percent off facials in Hokkaido, 54 percent off horse-riding lessons in Kyoto.
In December, Groupon sold about 1.14 billion yen's worth in coupons, almost twice the amount sold by the Ponpare site. That included the eyelash promotion offered by the tiny Queen's beauty salon here in provincial Niigata.
Wooed by a Groupon salesman, the salon's 36-year-old owner, Yuri Umemoto, offered a 71 percent discount on its eyelash extensions. The promotional price was 1,890 yen ($22.66) for 60 silky synthetic eyelashes, which are painstakingly applied by one of the salon's technicians in a procedure that takes about an hour.
The response was spectacular, Ms. Umemoto said. Queen's sold 123 coupons, enough, combined with existing clients, to keep her five-person staff busy for the next four months. And the deal has helped spread word of her salon's services in a city where many women have been too shy to wear much mascara, let alone lash extensions.
''In Niigata, people are so averse to showing off, so they need a big push,'' Ms. Umemoto said. ''They tend to be obsessed with what other people are doing. And what they saw is lots of people buying our coupons.''
Despite such success stories, Groupon has continued to have well-publicized stumbles in Japan, even since Mr. Mason's apology video.
In January, the Hitoyoshi bistro in Nagoya offered 68 percent off horsemeat dinners. The response, 1,356 coupons sold, was far more than the restaurant could handle. The bistro ultimately canceled the deal.
Despite Groupon's reassurances that it will offer refunds when deals fall through, rivals now worry that Groupon's blunders are starting to make Japanese customers skeptical of the entire deal-sharing business model. According to Sheep.jp, total coupon sales at the 147 Japanese sites it tracks fell 16 percent in January from the previous month, to 1.87 billion yen, while Groupon's coupon sales were down 14 percent, to 983 million yen.
''This is making everybody think that the business model is dodgy,'' said C. Jeffrey Char, who runs Piku, a rival that focuses on fewer quality deals.
''You can show a big discount, but if the customer isn't fully satisfied,'' he said, ''you'd just be paying to lose money.''

HEADLINE: States Aim Ax At Health Cost Of Retirement

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Governors and mayors facing large deficits have set their sights on a relatively new target -- the soaring expense of health benefits for millions of retired state and local workers.
As they contend with growing budget deficits and higher pension costs, some mayors are complaining that their outlays for retiree health benefits are rising by 20 percent a year -- a result of the wave of retirements of baby boomers and longer life expectancies on top of the double-digit rate of health care inflation.
The nation's governors face a daunting $555 billion in unfunded liabilities to finance retiree health coverage. The Pew Center on the States calculated those long-term obligations last year, saying New Jersey had the largest amount, $68.9 billion, with California second, at $62.5 billion.
''Up to now, the action taken to deal with this problem has been gradual, but it's begun to explode,'' said John Thomasian, director of the National Governors Association Center for Best Practices. ''In 14 states, the state pays 100 percent of the health benefits for retirees. That's very generous.'' 
Michigan officials are stunned by the looming challenges of paying retirees' health benefits, along with pension costs. ''It's pretty astronomical,'' said John Nixon, the state's budget director. ''What's happening with post-retirement health care is the biggest piece and biggest surprise.''
''The issue isn't to attack these folks or go after them,'' he continued. ''The main issue is how do we deal with this liability.''
In state after state, the changes are occurring rapidly. For example, New Hampshire has stopped financing health insurance for many future retirees, while North Carolina has begun requiring state employees to work 20 years, up from five years, to qualify for full retiree health benefits. Michigan officials complain that retiree health obligations consume one-seventh of the state's payroll costs, and New York City is slated to pay $2 billion toward retiree health next year.
Over all, the Center for State and Local Government Excellence found that 68 percent of city and county officials surveyed said they were pushing to have retirees assume more of their health costs, while 39 percent said they had eliminated or planned to eliminate retiree health benefits for new hires.
In many cases, states and municipalities are not required to negotiate these changes with retirees, and lawsuits challenging the cutbacks as a breach of contractual promises to retirees have resulted in mixed decisions. Many state or local workers retire before age 60, making them too young to turn to Medicare, prompting them to rely heavily on state and local plans for retirees.
In Omaha, officials are seeking to work with their public-sector labor unions to have future retirees begin contributing toward their premiums.
Omaha officials predict that their retiree health costs will quintuple, to $111 million, by 2020, at that point consuming nearly a third of the city's budget.
Richard O'Gara, Omaha's director of human resources, put the numbers in perspective. ''We're going to reach a point where in five years, retiree health care will cost us more than employee health care,'' he said, adding that was partly because the city was shrinking its work force and partly because retirees used far more medical services than active workers.
Governors and mayors are also tackling the fast-rising health costs for the nation's 19 million state and local workers, often focusing first on the government employees who pay nothing toward their health premiums for individual plans in 14 states. That is a benefit few private-sector workers have.
In Oregon, Gov. John Kitzhaber, a Democrat, is demanding that state employees start paying part of their premiums. Oregon is the only state in which state employees do not contribute to any of their premiums for either family or individual health plans.
''The bill is too big for us to pay,'' Mr. Kitzhaber said. ''Public employees should contribute to the cost of their health care premiums.''
Just last Friday, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, a Republican, proposed that union negotiations should be limited only to wages and that workers pay 12.6 percent of their health care premiums, double the old average.
In Jacksonville, Fla., Mayor John Peyton is insisting that police and firefighters begin paying 5 percent of the premiums toward their individual health plans, and the police union is balking.
''In this budget crisis, taxpayers are becoming more concerned about where their tax payments are going,'' Mr. Peyton said. ''And many see a huge disconnect between what private-sector workers are getting on benefits and what the public sector is getting.''
While some studies show that the public sector benefits are more generous, union officials counter that other studies show that overall compensation -- wages and benefits taken together -- are slightly lower for public workers when education levels and age are factored in.
Unions representing state and city workers often assert that public employees have become a scapegoat. They argue that reckless Wall Street behavior, not public-sector unions, caused the recession, leading to sharp drops in tax revenues that propelled the deficits.
''We're in some of the most difficult negotiations we've ever been in because of the economic environment, and health care is very much on the table,'' said Steven Kreisberg, director of collective bargaining for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. ''Some people have a political agenda to score points on this issue.''
Ken Allen, the executive director of that union's Oregon operation, opposes Mr. Kitzhaber's plans for premiums. ''We've given up wage increases for four of the past eight years in order to keep fully paid health care,'' Mr. Allen said. ''Yes, we have fully paid health care, but we gave up a lot to keep it.''
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, state and local employees pay 11 percent of the cost of individual medical plans on average, compared with 20 percent for private-sector employees, and state and local employees pay 27 percent of the cost of family plans, compared with 30 percent for private-sector employees.
In White Plains, the mayor and City Council, struggling to avoid huge tax increases, began requiring retired city employees to pay 15 percent of their premiums, up from zero. But retired police officers and firefighters sued, and a federal judge granted an injunction suspending the payments after their lawyers argued that the city had breached a longstanding promise to provide fully financed health coverage to retirees.
Some governments are also pushing to raise co-payments and deductibles to discourage overuse of medical services. For instance, in Tucson, where city workers have had a wage freeze for four years, employees pay $20 per doctor visit, up from $10, and face a $500 deductible for inpatient services, up from zero.
Many states and cities have also become creative in holding down health costs. Georgia's insurance plan imposes a $80 monthly surcharge for smokers. In Wauwatosa, Wis., a wellness coach works with every city employee on issues like high blood pressure, and all employees must have a colonoscopy at age 50, to help forestall cancer, and potentially high treatment costs.
Richard Johnson, national public sector health practice director at the Segal consulting firm, said cutting retirees' health coverage raised moral and legal issues. ''It's a tough group to deal with,'' he said. ''You have to remember that state and local governments have routinely catered to them and often promised them being able to retire with full benefits. Those are huge promises.''

HEADLINE: A House Democrat Relishes Role Reversal

BYLINE: By BY JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
Two years ago, Representative Chris Van Hollen and fellow House Democrats were responsible for setting President Obama's legislative agenda in motion. It was heady, historic - and hard.
Today, Mr. Van Hollen, a fifth-term congressman from Maryland, is less player than color commentator. He is the ranking minority member of the House Budget Committee, which will pore over the Obama administration's budget being released Monday morning.
But House rules and tradition give minority lawmakers little influence; the votes that count belong to the majority, Republicans. 
It is an easier, if less fulfilling, assignment that Mr. Van Hollen, below, embraces with gusto. He compares Republicans' zeal for spending cuts - they have called for as much as $100 billion in 2011 alone - to the recklessness of drunken teenagers commandeering the family car for a joy ride.
''They're drag-racing, and they're high on their own ideology,'' he said. By targeting crucial programs for deep cuts, Mr. Van Hollen concluded, the Republican agenda represents an anti-stimulus economic strategy that will ''put jobs and consumer safety at risk.''
After two years of dodging Republican attacks on their ''job-destroying'' policies - unsuccessfully, as midterm elections proved - Democrats find a sense of liberation in lobbing their own rhetorical bombs.
''They got to stand on the sidelines carping for a long time,'' Mr. Van Hollen said of the Republicans during the first half of Mr. Obama's term. In the second half, ''our job is to create a very clear contrast with Republicans. You don't have to figure out where you're going to get that one last vote to pass something.''
The Risk of a Split
Democrats struggled through that vote-marshaling process for several reasons.
In an era of public disaffection with government, it is safer for lawmakers to vote against something than to take responsibility for defending it.
That is especially true when unemployment and deficits are soaring, and the proposals carry price tags in the hundreds of billions, as Mr. Obama's economic stimulus and health care plans did.
Moreover, the liberal base of the Democratic Party is not as large as the conservative base of the Republican Party. That produced a built-in level of internal disagreement with Democratic moderates, while Republicans remained overwhelmingly united against Mr. Obama's objectives.
What Democrats hope now is that Tea Party zeal splits Republicans from one another, and from the independent voters who decided the last three elections. A new nonpartisan poll on attitudes toward government spending that was completed and released last week underscored that risk for Republicans.
According to the survey, by the Pew Research Center roughly half of Republicans support the Tea Party and share its desire for spending reductions in areas like education, environmental protection, Social Security and Medicare.
But ''the spending preferences of Republicans and G.O.P. leaders who do not agree with the Tea Party are far more in sync with Democrats,'' said the Pew Research Center's president, Andrew Kohut.
That fault line was clear in the resistance of House conservatives to their leadership's initial package of 2011 spending cuts. Unexpected defeats on two unrelated floor votes last week hinted at a new level of unpredictability facing the speaker, John A. Boehner.
Debating the Specifics
So far there is little reason to expect that Mr. Boehner will lose control of the House floor on critical budget votes. But it happened to Speaker Tip O'Neill in 1981, when a decisive bloc of conservative Southerners - so-called boll weevil Democrats - sided with President Ronald Reagan and Republicans on spending cuts. Among Mr. O'Neill's aides at the time: Mr. Obama's budget director, Jacob J. Lew.
''Boehner's got a really tough problem,'' said Mr. Van Hollen, who intends to make it as tough as possible.
The Democratic strategy, reminiscent of how President Bill Clinton parried Republican budget-balancing proposals in the mid-1990s, is to concede that cuts are necessary but battle over specific reductions in programs with popular support.
The $100 billion in spending reductions for the 2011 fiscal year, proposed last week by Republicans as what they called the ''largest spending cuts in history,'' provide a target-rich environment. Mr. Van Hollen cited proposed reductions for food safety inspection, Head Start and the hiring of police officers as evidence of Republicans' bent for ''playing with fire.''
He will repeat that argument when Congress considers raising the federal debt limit. As conservative Republicans use that approaching vote to bargain for further spending cuts, Democrats echo a call by the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, for avoiding brinkmanship that could damage investor confidence in the government's creditworthiness.
On both fights, House consideration is only the start. Even if Mr. Boehner holds his caucus together behind the $100 billion in 2011 cuts, the Democratic-controlled Senate is certain to draw a different bottom line.
''It gets really interesting on the rebound,'' Mr. Van Hollen said. If the Senate sends back drastically lower reductions - say, $20 billion - Mr. Boehner could face a choice between gridlock and the need for a bipartisan majority, which would require Democratic support, to offset rebellious Republican conservatives.
That could make Mr. Van Hollen's vote, not just his voice, relevant once again.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Eat The Future

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
On Friday, House Republicans unveiled their proposal for immediate cuts in federal spending. Uncharacteristically, they failed to accompany the release with a catchy slogan. So I'd like to propose one: Eat the Future.
I'll explain in a minute. First, let's talk about the dilemma the G.O.P. faces.
Republican leaders like to claim that the midterms gave them a mandate for sharp cuts in government spending. Some of us believe that the elections were less about spending than they were about persistent high unemployment, but whatever. The key point to understand is that while many voters say that they want lower spending, press the issue a bit further and it turns out that they only want to cut spending on other people. 
That's the lesson from a new survey by the Pew Research Center, in which Americans were asked whether they favored higher or lower spending in a variety of areas. It turns out that they want more, not less, spending on most things, including education and Medicare. They're evenly divided about spending on aid to the unemployed and -- surprise -- defense.
The only thing they clearly want to cut is foreign aid, which most Americans believe, wrongly, accounts for a large share of the federal budget.
Pew also asked people how they would like to see states close their budget deficits. Do they favor cuts in either education or health care, the main expenses states face? No. Do they favor tax increases? No. The only deficit-reduction measure with significant support was cuts in public-employee pensions -- and even there the public was evenly divided.
The moral is clear. Republicans don't have a mandate to cut spending; they have a mandate to repeal the laws of arithmetic.
How can voters be so ill informed? In their defense, bear in mind that they have jobs, children to raise, parents to take care of. They don't have the time or the incentive to study the federal budget, let alone state budgets (which are by and large incomprehensible). So they rely on what they hear from seemingly authoritative figures.
And what they've been hearing ever since Ronald Reagan is that their hard-earned dollars are going to waste, paying for vast armies of useless bureaucrats (payroll is only 5 percent of federal spending) and welfare queens driving Cadillacs. How can we expect voters to appreciate fiscal reality when politicians consistently misrepresent that reality?
Which brings me back to the Republican dilemma. The new House majority promised to deliver $100 billion in spending cuts -- and its members face the prospect of Tea Party primary challenges if they fail to deliver big cuts. Yet the public opposes cuts in programs it likes -- and it likes almost everything. What's a politician to do?
The answer, once you think about it, is obvious: sacrifice the future. Focus the cuts on programs whose benefits aren't immediate; basically, eat America's seed corn. There will be a huge price to pay, eventually -- but for now, you can keep the base happy.
If you didn't understand that logic, you might be puzzled by many items in the House G.O.P. proposal. Why cut a billion dollars from a highly successful program that provides supplemental nutrition to pregnant mothers, infants, and young children? Why cut $648 million from nuclear nonproliferation activities? (One terrorist nuke, assembled from stray ex-Soviet fissile material, can ruin your whole day.) Why cut $578 million from the I.R.S. enforcement budget? (Letting tax cheats run wild doesn't exactly serve the cause of deficit reduction.)
Once you understand the imperatives Republicans face, however, it all makes sense. By slashing future-oriented programs, they can deliver the instant spending cuts Tea Partiers demand, without imposing too much immediate pain on voters. And as for the future costs -- a population damaged by childhood malnutrition, an increased chance of terrorist attacks, a revenue system undermined by widespread tax evasion -- well, tomorrow is another day.
In a better world, politicians would talk to voters as if they were adults. They would explain that discretionary spending has little to do with the long-run imbalance between spending and revenues. They would then explain that solving that long-run problem requires two main things: reining in health-care costs and, realistically, increasing taxes to pay for the programs that Americans really want.
But Republican leaders can't do that, of course: they refuse to admit that taxes ever need to rise, and they spent much of the last two years screaming ''death panels!'' in response to even the most modest, sensible efforts to ensure that Medicare dollars are well spent.
And so they had to produce something like Friday's proposal, a plan that would save remarkably little money but would do a remarkably large amount of harm.

HEADLINE: A Tunisian-Egyptian Link That Shook Arab History

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK and DAVID E. SANGER; David D. Kirkpatrick reported from Cairo, and David E. Sanger from Washington. Kareem Fahim and Mona El-Naggar contributed reporting from Cairo, and Mark Mazzetti from Washington.

 BODY:
CAIRO -- As protesters in Tahrir Square faced off against pro-government forces, they drew a lesson from their counterparts in Tunisia: ''Advice to the youth of Egypt: Put vinegar or onion under your scarf for tear gas.''
The exchange on Facebook was part of a remarkable two-year collaboration that has given birth to a new force in the Arab world -- a pan-Arab youth movement dedicated to spreading democracy in a region without it. Young Egyptian and Tunisian activists brainstormed on the use of technology to evade surveillance, commiserated about torture and traded practical tips on how to stand up to rubber bullets and organize barricades.
They fused their secular expertise in social networks with a discipline culled from religious movements and combined the energy of soccer fans with the sophistication of surgeons. Breaking free from older veterans of the Arab political opposition, they relied on tactics of nonviolent resistance channeled from an American scholar through a Serbian youth brigade -- but also on marketing tactics borrowed from Silicon Valley. 
As their swelling protests shook the Egyptian state, they were locked in a virtual tug of war with a leader with a very different vision -- Gamal Mubarak, the son of President Hosni Mubarak, a wealthy investment banker and ruling-party power broker. Considered the heir apparent to his father until the youth revolt eliminated any thought of dynastic succession, the younger Mubarak pushed his father to hold on to power even after his top generals and the prime minister were urging an exit, according to American officials who tracked Hosni Mubarak's final days.
The defiant tone of the president's speech on Thursday, the officials said, was largely his son's work.
''He was probably more strident than his father was,'' said one American official, who characterized Gamal's role as ''sugarcoating what was for Mubarak a disastrous situation.'' But the speech backfired, prompting Egypt's military to force the president out and assert control of what they promise will be a transition to civilian government.
Now the young leaders are looking beyond Egypt. ''Tunis is the force that pushed Egypt, but what Egypt did will be the force that will push the world,'' said Walid Rachid, one of the members of the April 6 Youth Movement, which helped organize the Jan. 25 protests that set off the uprising. He spoke at a meeting on Sunday night where the members discussed sharing their experiences with similar youth movements in Libya, Algeria, Morocco and Iran.
''If a small group of people in every Arab country went out and persevered as we did, then that would be the end of all the regimes,'' he said, joking that the next Arab summit might be ''a coming-out party'' for all the ascendant youth leaders.
Bloggers Lead the Way
The Egyptian revolt was years in the making. Ahmed Maher, a 30-year-old civil engineer and a leading organizer of the April 6 Youth Movement, first became engaged in a political movement known as Kefaya, or Enough, in about 2005. Mr. Maher and others organized their own brigade, Youth for Change. But they could not muster enough followers; arrests decimated their leadership ranks, and many of those left became mired in the timid, legally recognized opposition parties. ''What destroyed the movement was the old parties,'' said Mr. Maher, who has since been arrested four times.
By 2008, many of the young organizers had retreated to their computer keyboards and turned into bloggers, attempting to raise support for a wave of isolated labor strikes set off by government privatizations and runaway inflation.
After a strike that March in the city of Mahalla, Egypt, Mr. Maher and his friends called for a nationwide general strike for April 6. To promote it, they set up a Facebook group that became the nexus of their movement, which they were determined to keep independent from any of the established political groups. Bad weather turned the strike into a nonevent in most places, but in Mahalla a demonstration by the workers' families led to a violent police crackdown -- the first major labor confrontation in years.
Just a few months later, after a strike in Tunisia, a group of young online organizers followed the same model, setting up what became the Progressive Youth of Tunisia. The organizers in both countries began exchanging their experiences over Facebook. The Tunisians faced a more pervasive police state than the Egyptians, with less latitude for blogging or press freedom, but their trade unions were stronger and more independent. ''We shared our experience with strikes and blogging,'' Mr. Maher recalled.
For their part, Mr. Maher and his colleagues began reading about nonviolent struggles. They were especially drawn to a Serbian youth movement called Otpor, which had helped topple the dictator Slobodan Milosevic by drawing on the ideas of an American political thinker, Gene Sharp. The hallmark of Mr. Sharp's work is well-tailored to Mr. Mubark's Egypt: He argues that nonviolence is a singularly effective way to undermine police states that might cite violent resistance to justify repression in the name of stability.
The April 6 Youth Movement modeled its logo -- a vaguely Soviet looking red and white clenched fist--after Otpor's, and some of its members traveled to Serbia to meet with Otpor activists.
Another influence, several said, was a group of Egyptian expatriates in their 30s who set up an organization in Qatar called the Academy of Change, which promotes ideas drawn in part on Mr. Sharp's work. One of the group's organizers, Hisham Morsy, was arrested during the Cairo protests and remained in detention.
''The Academy of Change is sort of like Karl Marx, and we are like Lenin,'' said Basem Fathy, another organizer who sometimes works with the April 6 Youth Movement and is also the project director at the Egyptian Democratic Academy, which receives grants from the United States and focuses on human rights and election-monitoring. During the protesters' occupation of Tahrir Square, he said, he used his connections to raise about $5,100 from Egyptian businessmen to buy blankets and tents.
'This Is Your Country'
Then, about a year ago, the growing Egyptian youth movement acquired a strategic ally, Wael Ghonim, a 31-year-old Google marketing executive. Like many others, he was introduced into the informal network of young organizers by the movement that came together around Mohamed ElBaradei, the Nobel Prize-winning diplomat who returned to Egypt a year ago to try to jump-start its moribund political opposition.
Mr. Ghonim had little experience in politics but an intense dislike for the abusive Egyptian police, the mainstay of the government's power. He offered his business savvy to the cause. ''I worked in marketing, and I knew that if you build a brand you can get people to trust the brand,'' he said.
The result was a Facebook group Mr. Ghonim set up: We Are All Khalid Said, after a young Egyptian who was beaten to death by police. Mr. Ghonim -- unknown to the public, but working closely with Mr. Maher of the April 6 Youth Movement and a contact from Mr. ElBaradei's group -- said that he used Mr. Said's killing to educate Egyptians about democracy movements.
He filled the site with video clips and newspaper articles about police violence. He repeatedly hammered home a simple message: ''This is your country; a government official is your employee who gets his salary from your tax money, and you have your rights.'' He took special aim at the distortions of the official media, because when the people ''distrust the media then you know you are not going to lose them,'' he said.
He eventually attracted hundreds of thousands of users, building their allegiance through exercises in online democratic participation. When organizers planned a ''day of silence'' in the Cairo streets, for example, he polled users on what color shirts they should all wear -- black or white. (When the revolt exploded, the Mubarak government detained him for 12 days in blindfolded isolation in a belated attempt to stop his work.)
After the Tunisian revolution on Jan. 14, the April 6 Youth Movement saw an opportunity to turn its little-noticed annual protest on Police Day -- the Jan. 25 holiday that celebrates a police revolt that was suppressed by the British -- into a much bigger event. Mr. Ghonim used the Facebook site to mobilize support. If at least 50,000 people committed to turn out that day, the site suggested, the protest could be held. More than 100,000 signed up.
''I have never seen a revolution that was preannounced before,'' Mr. Ghonim said.
By then, the April 6 movement had teamed up with Mr. ElBaradei's supporters, some liberal and leftist parties, and the youth wing of the Muslim Brotherhood to plaster Cairo with eye-catching modernist posters advertising their Tunisia-inspired Police Day protest. But their elders -- even members of the Brotherhood who had long been portrayed as extremists by Mr. Mubarak and the West -- shied away from taking to the streets.
Explaining that Police Day was supposed to honor the fight against British colonialism, Essem Erian, a Brotherhood leader, said, ''On that day we should all be celebrating together.
''All these people are on Facebook, but do we know who they are?'' he asked. ''We cannot tie our parties and entities to a virtual world.''
'This Was It'
When the 25th came, the coalition of young activists, almost all of them affluent, wanted to tap into the widespread frustration with the country's autocracy, and also with the grinding poverty of Egyptian life. They started their day trying to rally poor people with complaints about pocketbook issues: ''They are eating pigeon and chicken, but we eat beans every day.''
By the end of the day, when tens of thousands had marched to Tahrir Square, their chants had become more sweeping. ''The people want to bring down the regime,'' they shouted, a slogan that the organizers said they had read in signs and on Facebook pages from Tunisia. Mr. Maher of the April 6 Youth Movement said the organizers even debated storming Parliament and the state television building -- classic revolutionary moves.
''When I looked around me and I saw all these unfamiliar faces in the protests, and they were more brave than us -- I knew that this was it for the regime,'' Mr. Maher said.
It was then that they began to rely on advice from Tunisia, Serbia and the Academy of Change, which had sent staff members to Cairo a week before to train the protest organizers. After the police used tear gas to break up the protest that Tuesday, the organizers came back better prepared for their next march on Friday, the 28th, the ''Day of Rage.''
This time, they brought lemons, onions and vinegar to sniff for relief from the tear gas, and soda or milk to pour into their eyes. Some had fashioned cardboard or plastic bottles into makeshift armor worn under their clothes to protect against riot police bullets. They brought spray paint to cover the windshields of police cars, and they were ready to stuff the exhaust pipes and jam the wheels to render them useless. By the early afternoon, a few thousand protesters faced off against well over a thousand heavily armed riot police officers on the four-lane Kasr al-Nile Bridge in perhaps the most pivotal battle of the revolution.
''We pulled out all the tricks of the game -- the Pepsi, the onion, the vinegar,'' said Mr. Maher, who wore cardboard and plastic bottles under his sweater, a bike helmet on his head and a barrel-top shield on his arm. ''The strategy was the people who were injured would go to the back and other people would replace them,'' he said. ''We just kept rotating.'' After more than five hours of battle, they had finally won -- and burned down the empty headquarters of the ruling party on their way to occupy Tahrir Square.
Pressuring Mubarak
In Washington that day, President Obama turned up, unexpectedly, at a 3:30 p.m. Situation Room meeting of his ''principals,'' the key members of the national security team, where he displaced Thomas E. Donilon, the national security adviser, from his seat at the head of the table.
The White House had been debating the likelihood of a domino effect since youth-driven revolts had toppled President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali in Tunisia, even though the American intelligence community and Israel's intelligence services had estimated that the risk to President Mubarak was low -- less than 20 percent, some officials said.
According to senior officials who participated in Mr. Obama's policy debates, the president took a different view. He made the point early on, a senior official said, that ''this was a trend'' that could spread to other authoritarian governments in the region, including in Iran. By the end of the 18-day uprising, by a White House count, there were 38 meetings with the president about Egypt. Mr. Obama said that this was a chance to create an alternative to ''the Al Qaeda narrative'' of Western interference.
American officials had seen no evidence of overtly anti-American or anti-Western sentiment. ''When we saw people bringing their children to Tahrir Square, wanting to see history being made, we knew this was something different,'' one official said.
On Jan. 28, the debate quickly turned to how to pressure Mr. Mubarak in private and in public -- and whether Mr. Obama should appear on television urging change. Mr. Obama decided to call Mr. Mubarak, and several aides listened in on the line. Mr. Obama did not suggest that the 82-year-old leader step aside or transfer power. At this point, ''the argument was that he really needed to do the reforms, and do them fast,'' a senior official said. Mr. Mubarak resisted, saying the protests were about outside interference.
According to the official, Mr. Obama told him, ''You have a large portion of your people who are not satisfied, and they won't be until you make concrete political, social and economic reforms.''
The next day, the decision was made to send former Ambassador Frank G. Wisner to Cairo as an envoy. Mr. Obama began placing calls to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and other regional leaders.
The most difficult calls, officials said, were with King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and Mr. Netanyahu, who feared regional instability and urged the United States to stick with Mr. Mubarak. According to American officials, senior members of the government in Saudi Arabia argued that the United States should back Mr. Mubarak even if he used force against the demonstrators. By Feb. 1, when Mr. Mubarak broadcast a speech pledging that he would not run again and that elections would be held in September, Mr. Obama concluded that the Egyptian president still had not gotten the message.
Within an hour, Mr. Obama called Mr. Mubarak again in the toughest, and last, of their conversations. ''He said if this transition process drags out for months, the protests will, too,'' one of Mr. Obama's aides said.
Mr. Mubarak told Mr. Obama that the protests would be over in a few days.
Mr. Obama ended the call, the official said, with these words: ''I respect my elders. And you have been in politics for a very long time, Mr. President. But there are moments in history when just because things were the same way in the past doesn't mean they will be that way in the future.''
The next day, heedless of Mr. Obama's admonitions, Mr. Mubarak launched another attack against the protesters, many of whom had by then spent five nights camped out in Tahrir Square. By about 2:30 p.m., thousands of burly men loyal to Mr. Mubarak and armed with rocks, clubs and, eventually, improvised explosives had come crashing into the square.
The protesters -- trying to stay true to the lessons they had learned from Gandhi, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Gene Sharp -- tried for a time to avoid retaliating. A row of men stood silent as rocks rained down on them. An older man told a younger one to put down his stick.
But by 3:30 p.m., the battle was joined. A rhythmic din of stones on metal rang out as the protesters beat street lamps and fences to rally their troops.
The Muslim Brotherhood, after sitting out the first day, had reversed itself, issuing an order for all able-bodied men to join the occupation of Tahrir Square. They now took the lead. As a secret, illegal organization, the Brotherhood was accustomed to operating in a disciplined hierarchy. The group's members helped the protesters divide into teams to organize their defense, several organizers said. One team broke the pavement into rocks, while another ferried the rocks to makeshift barricades along their perimeter and the third defended the front.
''The youth of the Muslim Brotherhood played a really big role,'' Mr. Maher said. ''But actually so did the soccer fans'' of Egypt's two leading teams. ''These are always used to having confrontations with police at the stadiums,'' he said.
Soldiers of the Egyptian military, evidently under orders to stay neutral, stood watching from behind the iron gates of the Egyptian Museum as the war of stone missiles and improvised bombs continued for 14 hours until about four in the morning.
Then, unable to break the protesters' discipline or determination, the Mubarak forces resorted to guns, shooting 45 and killing 2, according to witnesses and doctors interviewed early that morning. The soldiers -- perhaps following orders to prevent excessive bloodshed, perhaps acting on their own -- finally intervened. They fired their machine guns into the ground and into the air, several witnesses said, scattering the Mubarak forces and leaving the protesters in unmolested control of the square, and by extension, the streets.
Once the military demonstrated it was unwilling to fire on its own citizens, the balance of power shifted. American officials urged the army to preserve its bond with the Egyptian people by sending top officers into the square to reassure the protesters, a step that further isolated Mr. Mubarak. But the Obama administration faltered in delivering its own message: Two days after the worst of the violence, Mr. Wisner publicly suggested that Mr. Mubarak had to be at the center of any change, and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton warned that any transition would take time. Other American officials suggested Mr. Mubarak might formally stay in office until his term ended next September. Then a four-day-long stalemate ensued, in which Mr. Mubarak refused to budge, and the protesters regained momentum.
On Thursday, Mr. Mubarak's vice president, Omar Suleiman, was on the phone with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. at 2 p.m. in Washington, the third time they had spoken in a week. The airwaves were filled with rumors that Mr. Mubarak was stepping down, and Mr. Suleiman told Mr. Biden that he was preparing to assume Mr. Mubarak's powers. But as he spoke to Mr. Biden and other officials, Mr. Suleiman said that ''certain powers'' would remain with Mr. Mubarak, including the power to dissolve the Parliament and fire the cabinet. ''The message from Suleiman was that he would be the de facto president,'' one person involved in the call said.
But while Mr. Mubarak huddled with his son Gamal, the Obama administration was in the dark about how events would unfold, reduced to watching cable television to see what Mr. Mubarak would decide. What they heard on Thursday night was a drastically rewritten speech, delivered in the unbowed tone of the father of the country, with scarcely any mention of a presumably temporary ''delegation'' of his power.
It was that rambling, convoluted address that proved the final straw for the Egyptian military, now fairly certain that it would have Washington's backing if it moved against Mr. Mubarak, American officials said. Mr. Mubarak's generals ramped up the pressure that led him at last, without further comment, to relinquish his power.
''Eighty-five million people live in Egypt, and less than 1,000 people died in this revolution -- most of them killed by the police,'' said Mr. Ghonim, the Google executive. ''It shows how civilized the Egyptian people are.'' He added, ''Now our nightmare is over. Now it is time to dream.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Monday about the collaboration between young Tunisian and Egyptian activists that helped lead to the revolutions in their countries misspelled the name of a city in Egypt where a violent police crackdown in March 2008 proved to be an important event in the evolution of the Egyptian opposition movement. It is Mahalla, not Malhalla.

HEADLINE: The Risk to Bristol Bay

 BODY:
Last year, the Obama administration permanently banned oil drilling in Alaska's Bristol Bay, America's richest salmon fishery and the heart of a $2.2 billion regional fishing industry. One huge threat to this extraordinary ecosystem remains: a proposed gold and copper operation known as the Pebble Mine. If built, it would affect a huge area of clear-running headwater streams and wetlands that feed the bay. 
Responding to urgent requests from nine native tribes that depend on the headwaters for subsistence, the federal Environmental Protection Agency has now announced that it will assess the risks to the bay from mining and commercial projects in general.
This is very good news. The agency obviously cannot prejudge the study's outcome, but its announcement pointedly called attention to Bristol Bay's ''extraordinary importance'' as a salmon fishery and source of food and income for local residents. It also called attention to its obligation under the federal Clean Water Act to block any project that would have an ''unacceptable adverse effect'' on water quality and wildlife.
Anglo American, the London-based multinational powerhouse behind the project, says it can extract the minerals safely. But historically the mining industry has done a sloppy job of protecting the environment. Mining residues, like sulfide-laced rock, are toxic. No matter how hard the company tries to sequester them -- it proposes to build a 740-foot-high dam to contain the waste -- an earthquake or other disturbance can jar them loose.
The people of Alaska came close to blocking the project themselves in a 2008 referendum. Three former governors, including two Republicans, and Senator Ted Stevens spoke out against the mine. Industry, however, spent $12 million on advertising about the mine's economic benefits; that, plus a last-minute pro-mining push by Gov. Sarah Palin and her administration, turned the tide in industry's favor.
The E.P.A. is right to do this study. We are certain it will find that the mine presents unacceptable risks and should not be allowed to proceed.

PERSON: Charles E. Silberman 

HEADLINE: Charles E. Silberman, 86; Wrote About Racism in U.S.

BYLINE: By MARGALIT FOX

 BODY:
Charles E. Silberman, a journalist whose books addressed vast, turbulent social subjects including race, education, crime and the state of American Jewry, died on Feb. 5 in Sarasota, Fla. He was 86 and had lived in Sarasota in recent years. 
The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
A former writer and editor at Fortune magazine, Mr. Silberman was known in particular for three books that took on some of the most highly charged issues of the day: ''Crisis in Black and White'' (1964), ''Crisis in the Classroom: The Remaking of American Education'' (1970) and ''Criminal Violence, Criminal Justice'' (1978).
In ''Crisis in Black and White,'' he explored the nation's long history of racial oppression and its dire effects on the economic, social and educational prospects of 20th-century blacks. The book spent nine weeks on the New York Times best-seller list. Reviewing it, Time magazine wrote that Mr. Silberman ''marches in no-nonsense fashion to a number of hard truths that are not meant to comfort or console.''
In ''Crisis in the Classroom,'' the product of a study underwritten by the Carnegie Foundation, Mr. Silberman turned his attention to the state of American public education, which he indicted as bleak, oppressive and generally in disarray.
''Criminal Violence, Criminal Justice'' examined American crime and punishment through the lens of racism.
Reviewing the book in The New York Times, Roger Wilkins said, ''In a field as beset by emotion, mythology and fear as crime is, honest reporting, earnest analysis and honorable speculation can surely serve the republic well, and that is what this book does -- and more.''
Charles Eliot Silberman was born on Jan. 31, 1925, in Des Moines and grew up in New York City. After Navy service aboard a minesweeper in the Pacific in World War II, he earned a bachelor's degree in economics from Columbia University in 1946 and did graduate work in economics there.
Mr. Silberman taught economics at Columbia and the City College of New York. He joined Fortune in 1953 and was on staff there until the early 1970s.
Mr. Silberman's wife, the former Arlene Propper, whom he married in 1948, died last year. He is survived by four sons, David, Rick, Jeff and Steve, and six grandchildren.
His other books include ''The Myths of Automation'' (1966), written with other Fortune editors, and ''A Certain People: American Jews and Their Lives Today,'' which he described in interviews as his most personal book.
Published in 1985, ''A Certain People'' drew wide attention for its hopeful assertion -- contrary to the hand-wringing by many prominent Jewish writers over intermarriage and assimilation -- that American Jewry was undergoing a renaissance.
Jews could now enjoy success without fear of anti-Semitic reprisals, Mr. Silberman argued, and there was renewed interest among young Jews in keeping the faith.
To critics who took the book to task for naive optimism, Mr. Silberman's response was simple. As he told Newsweek in 1985, ''It takes guts to bring good news to the Jewish community.''

HEADLINE: As Tensions in Egypt Ebb, Optimism for Further Lift in Global Markets

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Investors remain nervous about the longer-term picture in the Middle East, but the easing of tensions in Egypt removes one major worry for global markets and could encourage further gains in the short term, analysts say.
A more stable situation would allow portfolio managers in the United States to focus on some underlying positives this week, including the improving economy and stronger earnings growth, said Byron R. Wien, a veteran market strategist at the Blackstone Group.
''The short-term conclusion is that the upheaval is over, and that's good for stocks,'' said Mr. Wien. ''Exports are good, it looks like the consumer is beginning to spend again, unemployment is coming down and capital spending is strong.'' 
The coming week is set to be a busy one in terms of clues to the economy's direction, with data on retail sales coming out on Tuesday and the government announcing the latest figures on consumer prices on Thursday. Inflation is increasingly a concern in fast-growing emerging markets like China and India, but for now price pressures are expected to remain in check in the United States, with core consumer prices estimated to be up just 0.1 percent.
In addition, new figures for housing starts will be released on Wednesday, while the latest read on leading economic indicators will come on Thursday.
Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of Standard & Poor's Equity Research, said he expected the data to show the economy was strengthening. Economically sensitive sectors like industrials, energy and technology have been among the stock market's strongest performers so far in 2011.
Indeed, estimates for gross domestic product growth in the United States for 2011 have been creeping up from about 3 percent to closer to 4 percent, in part because of the $858 billion in tax cuts and incentives that Congress passed in December. There is also optimism that unemployment could sink below its current level of 9 percent.
Those are among the reasons that American stocks have gotten off to a strong start this year, with the S. & P. 500-stock index rising 5.7 percent, the best annual opening since 1998. In fact, Mr. Wien said, after a long period of outflows from stocks to bonds, mutual fund investors have started putting money into equity funds again.
Mr. Stovall added that with concerns about the Middle East ebbing, the recent flight to safety that has lifted the dollar could reverse, helping the euro regain a bit of ground it had lost on worries about excessive debt.
Oil prices are also expected to be closely watched this week. Though crude fell sharply on Friday after President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt announced his decision to step down, indications that political unrest was reawakening in Yemen and spreading to Algeria are likely to keep energy prices volatile.
Unlike Egypt and Tunisia, both of which have now seen governments topple, Algeria is a major energy producer and member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
''This is a relief rally, but there is a long road ahead,'' said Ann Wyman, head of emerging markets research in Europe for Nomura. ''There is a worry about which country may be next and that this isn't the end of the story.''
Nevertheless, the resolution to the standoff in Egypt provided global markets with a bit of a lift. In Asia on Monday, stock markets broadly rose, with the Nikkei 225 index in Japan up 0.8 percent by midday.
Stocks in the United States rallied on Friday after news of Mr. Mubarak's decision to step down broke, and the upward trend continued on Sunday, as bourses in the Middle East also rose, with shares in Abu Dhabi up 0.6 percent and the QE index in Qatar edging higher by 0.7 percent.
The Egyptian stock market has been closed since Jan. 27 but is set to reopen on Wednesday, and many observers expect it to bounce back as well. In what could also be a bullish indicator, Egypt successfully completed a $1.1 billion bond offering Sunday.

HEADLINE: Coal Outshines Gold for Investors

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER SWANN and AGNES T. CRANE

 BODY:
Coal will never displace gold as jewelry. But it has started to outperform it as an investment.
While gold's steep rally is threatened by a return to normal monetary policy, surging demand from Asia is pushing coal prices skyward. For investors fearing higher inflation, coal may be golden.
Gold enthusiasts have every reason to feel smug. Those looking to it as a haven in troubled times have not been disappointed. As central bankers put to work the monetary printing presses since the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the price of gold has climbed 75 percent, to about $1,350 an ounce. 
Still signs suggest the rally is running out of steam. Gold funds have started to have outflows, and the price is off its peak. The reversal could worsen for gold bugs. As markets anticipate an end to monetary easing, rising interest rates could lure investors away from gold. More buoyant equities also make gold look less alluring.
At first blush, coal looks like an implausible alternative. If storing gold is a hassle, coal is many times more difficult. A short ton of Appalachian coal fetches $75, compared with $43 million for the same weight in gold.
Even so, coal has considerable appeal for investors seeking an inflation hedge and exposure to commodities. Flooding in the coal-rich Queensland, Australia, has been just the latest bullish development. Long after Australian mines recover, demand from India and China will continue to underpin prices. The two countries recently emerged as the greediest importers of coal, buying 10 times more from overseas than in 2003. And India's coal minister contends demand will triple over 20 years.
Of course, coal has drawbacks, too. Futures contracts are less liquid than gold or oil, making them potentially hard to exit. And all listed American coal companies together are worth just $60 billion -- less than a sixth the size of Exxon Mobil.
But despite a modest retreat in January, Australian coal has already slightly outpaced gold this year, up 30 percent, and American coal producers have had more impressive gains. As an investment, coal has been neglected for too long.
Blaming Bernanke
Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, has not turned anyone into a newt. Yet detractors do seem to think his policies have bewitched the world in realms far beyond central banking. Mr. Bernanke is influential, and his policies are open to criticism. But not every global problem can be laid at his door.
The low point came recently when he had to defend the Fed's ultraeasy monetary policy against grumbling that it was causing food prices to spike and therefore fomenting unrest in Tunisia and Egypt. The Fed's extensive bond-buying exercise, called quantitative easing, was unlikely to have been on the lips of protesters in Tahrir Square.
It is even a stretch to argue that quantitative easing has bailed out financially struggling states, as Representative Joe Walsh of Illinois contended at a hearing last week. The Fed may be trying to keep interest rates low, but state and local governments are paying on average almost a percentage point more in interest for debt maturing in 10 years than they were when the most recent quantitative easing exercise began in November.
In fact, to listen to Mr. Bernanke's critics, there are few problems for which he cannot be held responsible. By their logic, lax monetary policy is solely to blame for emerging inflation in Asia, and rising protectionism and asset bubbles in emerging markets.
Despite the Fed's undoubted influence, other powerful forces are surely at work. Mr. Bernanke's Washington neighbors in the White House and in Congress are perpetuating America's fiscal problems. On the other side of the world, the Chinese government is keeping its currency unsustainably weak.
And healthy growth in Asia and Latin America is bound to create demand for energy, food and commodities -- and therefore generate upward pressure on prices -- regardless of monetary policy in the United States. Repression, failed domestic policies and local power struggles are more credible factors in Middle Eastern unrest.
Even so, in the eyes of many, Mr. Bernanke is not helping, and the Fed's untested quantitative easing program could certainly backfire. But by giving him the full pointed hat and broomstick treatment, critics are suggesting other big cracks in the system can magically disappear. That is a dangerous illusion to uphold.

HEADLINE: A Cautious Approach Seeking Bipartisan Appeal

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With the budget he is to unveil Monday, President Obama has not opted for the bold, comprehensive approach to reining in the fast-growing federal debt that his own fiscal commission has said is needed, now.
That decision partly reflects Mr. Obama's characteristic caution, but also a White House calculation: that ''now'' is too soon for the nation's political system. And that boldness could backfire -- wounding not just a president facing re-election next year but also the prospects for bipartisan agreement on the very tax and spending-cut proposals that all sides realize are needed to truly stem the projected red ink in a nation confronting high health care costs and an aging population. 
Plenty of people here in both parties, even deficit hawks among nonpartisan budget analysts, agree with that White House logic.
''What has to be done is that we find a way to come together, and it may well be that it can better happen starting in Congress,'' said Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota and chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. ''People first have to come off of their fixed positions.''
With Republicans newly in control of the House and holding a bigger minority in the Senate, these people argue, the party needs time to at least try to push its own ambitious agenda for reducing government with the deepest spending cuts in memory. To compromise too soon would enrage the Republicans' political base, in particular Tea Party activists who fueled the party's election gains in November.
And, the reasoning goes, were Mr. Obama to propose a drastic debt-reduction plan as an invitation to Republicans to join him at the bargaining table -- a plan with the kind of far-reaching tax changes and spending cuts for the military, Medicare and Social Security that a bipartisan majority of his fiscal commission recommended in December -- he would most likely get an immediate ''no, thanks'' from Republican leaders, perhaps poisoning prospects for bipartisan talks for the foreseeable future. In fact, all three House Republican leaders on that commission opposed its majority report.
But it is not just Republicans who are not ready for budget summitry.
Most liberal House Democrats and many Senate Democrats up for re-election next year oppose changing Social Security just yet to avert a financial crisis still some years away. Mr. Obama had weighed proposing several changes, but party leaders and his own political advisers argued against it.
Also, Democrats in Congress and some in the White House are so sure that House Republicans' anti-spending fervor will alienate independent voters -- much like Congressional Republicans did during the Clinton administration -- that they want to give Republicans as much time as it takes for history to repeat itself. Democrats have been encouraged in that belief by House Republicans' recent infighting and the early public outrage over the Republicans' various proposals to slash money for border security, law enforcement, environmental programs, job training and education.
To be sure, there are those on the left and right who oppose Mr. Obama's decision to bide his time.
''I think it's a mistake,'' said Andy Stern, an Obama campaign ally and former labor leader.
Now at Georgetown University, he was on Mr. Obama's fiscal commission, which was headed by Erskine B. Bowles, a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton, and Alan K. Simpson, a former Senate Republican leader. The commission recommended a $4 trillion reduction in projected debt through 2020 -- four times the 10-year savings Mr. Obama claims for his budget. While Mr. Stern did not endorse the majority's report, he supported much of it.
''Although I appreciate why he would have reasons not to adopt the Bowles-Simpson plan,'' Mr. Stern said, ''I do think it's really important that the president take hold of this issue and lay out a comprehensive plan.''
Senator Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican who was among the commission majority endorsing the recommendation, said: ''The president can either lead with a big, bold agenda and call Republicans' bluff or he can play it safe and nobody gets anything done. He has the opportunity to be one of the greatest presidents that we've had if he'll get out and lead on this.''
''I understand that he doesn't want to have the political exposure,'' Mr. Coburn added, ''but the administration has to say, 'We're the executive here. I'm going to call you guys together -- O.K., how do we solve this problem?' ''
Since Mr. Obama has decided otherwise, both he and Republican leaders in Congress face a big challenge: getting through months of what will likely be some of the most hostile budget debates in years, amid talk of government shutdowns and even defaults on the debt, while working to build the trust that is a prerequisite for bipartisan deal-making.
One question after the past week's upheaval among House Republicans is whether party leaders, under pressure from the Tea Party and some aspiring Republican presidential candidates not to compromise, will ever feel free to do so.
''Some of the things we're hearing out of the House now trouble me when I think about the rest of the year,'' said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Senate leader and another member of the fiscal commission majority.
Even so, after their wars of the past two years, Mr. Obama and House and Senate Republican leaders are doing more to open channels and communicate privately than has been evident in the president's recent public overtures, like lunches and a Super Bowl party. Mr. Obama's new chief of staff, William M. Daley, has been especially active in meeting with Republicans, but Mr. Obama is also working the phones.
''I would like to get something done. I don't want to have two years of nothing,'' said Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and the new chairman of the House Budget Committee. ''It would be nice to get some achievements, if only for the bond markets -- to keep them at bay for the time being.''

HEADLINE: The Experience Economy

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Tyler Cowen's e-book, ''The Great Stagnation,'' has become the most debated nonfiction book so far this year. Cowen's core point is that up until sometime around 1974, the American economy was able to experience awesome growth by harvesting low-hanging fruit. There was cheap land to be exploited. There was the tremendous increase in education levels during the postwar world. There were technological revolutions occasioned by the spread of electricity, plastics and the car.
But that low-hanging fruit is exhausted, Cowen continues, and since 1974, the United States has experienced slower growth, slower increases in median income, slower job creation, slower productivity gains, slower life-expectancy improvements and slower rates of technological change. 
Cowen's data on these slowdowns are compelling and have withstood the scrutiny of the online reviewers. He argues that our society, for the moment, has hit a technological plateau.
But his evidence can also be used to tell a related story. It could be that the nature of technological change isn't causing the slowdown but a shift in values. It could be that in an industrial economy people develop a materialist mind-set and believe that improving their income is the same thing as improving their quality of life. But in an affluent information-driven world, people embrace the postmaterialist mind-set. They realize they can improve their quality of life without actually producing more wealth.
For example, imagine a man we'll call Sam, who was born in 1900 and died in 1974. Sam entered a world of iceboxes, horse-drawn buggies and, commonly, outhouses. He died in a world of air-conditioning, Chevy Camaros and Moon landings. His life was defined by dramatic material changes, and Sam worked feverishly hard to build a company that sold brake systems. Sam wasn't the most refined person, but he understood that if he wanted to create a secure life for his family he had to create wealth.
Sam's grandson, Jared, was born in 1978. Jared wasn't really drawn to the brake-systems business, which was withering in America. He works at a company that organizes conferences. He brings together fascinating speakers for lifelong learning. He writes a blog on modern art and takes his family on vacations that are more daring and exciting than any Sam experienced.
Jared lives a much more intellectually diverse life than Sam. He loves Facebook, YouTube, Wikipedia and his iPhone apps. But many of these things are produced outside the conventional monetized economy. Most of the products are produced by people working for free. They cost nothing to consume.
They don't even create many jobs. As Cowen notes in his book, the automobile industry produced millions of jobs, but Facebook employs about 2,000, Twitter 300 and eBay about 17,000. It takes only 14,000 employees to make and sell iPods, but that device also eliminates jobs for those people who make and distribute CDs, potentially leading to net job losses.
In other words, as Cowen makes clear, many of this era's technological breakthroughs produce enormous happiness gains, but surprisingly little additional economic activity.
Jared's other priorities also produce high quality-of-life gains without huge material and productivity improvements. He practically defines himself by what university he went to. Universities now have nicer dorms, gyms and dining facilities. These improvements have not led to huge increases in educational output.
Jared is very health conscious and part of a generation that has spent much more on health care. This may help Jared lead a vibrant life in retirement. But these investments have had surprisingly little effect on productivity or even longevity.
For Sam, income and living standards were synonymous. But for Jared, wealth and living standards have diverged. He is more interested in the latter than the former. This means that Jared has some rich and meaningful experiences, but it has also led to problems. Every few months, new gizmos come out. Jared feels his life is getting better. Because he doesn't fully grasp the increasingly important distinction between wealth and standard of living, he has the impression that he is also getting richer. As a result, he lives beyond his means. As Cowen notes, many of our recent difficulties stem from the fact that many Americans think they are richer than they are.
Jared is also providing much less opportunity for those down the income scale than his grandfather did. Sam was more hardhearted, yet his feverish materialism created more jobs.
Jared worries about that. He also worries that the Chinese and others have a material drive that he and his cohort lacks. But he's not changing. For the past few decades, Americans have devoted more of their energies to postmaterial arenas and less and less, for better and worse, to the sheer production of wealth.
During these years, commencement speakers have urged students to seek meaning and not money. Many people, it turns out, were listening.

HEADLINE: Police Departments Downsize, From 4 Legs to 2

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
CHARLESTON, S.C. -- He was a 10-year veteran of the Charleston Police Department, specializing in patrolling this city's palmetto-lined streets, improving community relations and keeping big crowds in check -- until his unit was disbanded, a victim of budget cuts.
So this month he was put out to pasture, quite literally.
Napoleon lost his policing job, along with the other five police horses here, as Charleston joined the growing number of cities that have retired their horses and closed their stables to save money. The Great Recession is proving to be the greatest threat to police mounted units since departments embraced the horseless carriage. 
This month, the clip-clop of police hooves was silenced both on the cobblestones here and on the streets of Newark, a much harder-hit city whose department recently laid off 163 officers. The downturn has also claimed the mounted units in San Diego; Tulsa, Okla.; Camden, N.J.; and Boston, whose police horses dated to the 19th century and were regulars at Fenway Park.
''It seems like horses are always among the first to go when it comes to budget cuts,'' said Mitchel P. Roth, a professor of criminology at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Tex., who has studied mounted patrols over the centuries.
When the Police Executive Research Forum released a report recently asking, ''Is the Economic Downturn Fundamentally Changing How We Police?'' it featured a mounted officer on the cover.
Supporters of mounted patrols mourn their loss, and fault overzealous oat-counters at city halls across the nation. Romantics have a nostalgic attachment to police horses, and many police officials value them, saying that when dealing with crowds, one mounted officer is as effective as 7 to 10 officers on foot. They are highly visible, these officials say, and can deter crime, and their popularity with the public is a welcome change from the mistrust that many departments battle.
But others see the horses as a costly bit of sentimentality, and as departments make previously unthinkable cuts, like furloughing and laying off police officers, they are re-evaluating the role of the police horse in the 21st century. In Charleston, officials decided that many of the unit's duties could be carried out at less expense without the horses. It was not a question of getting rid of the department's four-legged members in order to save its two-legged ones: the force here has actually been growing, and violent crime has gone down.
Nor was it a case of reversing someone else's policies. Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr., who has been in office since 1975, established the city's mounted unit early in his tenure, when Charleston -- whose horse-drawn carriages are big draw for tourists -- joined other cities in adding horses to provide a more approachable police presence, to help with crowd control and to deter crime. At its height, the unit had 14 horses. Mr. Riley said that many of those functions could now be handled in other ways, with more officers on the streets and evening summer camps for adolescents and by using technology.
''It was kind of like the times had changed. And the reasons that you found them beneficial, those reasons had been replaced by other good, solid policing techniques,'' he said in an interview.
Charleston's police chief, Gregory Mullen, said that some of the unit's duties would be handled by officers on bicycles or on futuristic electric scooters called T3s, which look like a cross between a Roman chariot and a Segway. He said that he had been working to get more officers on the street by hiring administrative workers for desk duty, and that disbanding the mounted unit would help.
Officers in the mounted unit, by necessity, spent a couple of hours of each shift getting their horses ready, traveling with their mounts to their posts and then getting them bedded down. They rarely spent eight hours on patrol. ''When we started to look at that, it was a lot less expensive for us to operate bicycles and electric vehicles and other things than it was to maintain the housing and feed and care for the animals,'' the chief said.
Closing the unit, he added, will save $250,000 a year. But it was a blow to some in this history-loving city.
''It's just heartbreaking,'' said Alice Forshaw, 68, who was the mounted unit's groom for nearly 20 years before she retired.
A look through her scrapbooks brought back memories: Horses like Royal's Rogue, Heavy Ned, Easy Alibi. A former chief who loved to ride the horses, even after he was thrown from one. The out-of-town jobs that took the unit to the inaugurations of Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton and to the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. And Moonshine, a police horse who was killed by a drunken driver and whose memorial service was held in a church.
Now Ms. Forshaw has a living souvenir. The city let her adopt Napoleon, who is 16 years old. He was walking around the backyard of her home in Cordesville, S.C., about 45 minutes north of the city, tentatively making friends with her other horse and receiving a police pension in hay and feed. ''He likes the freedom,'' Ms. Forshaw said.
In Newark, the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, said he would like to bring back a few horses, and is trying to privately raise money to do it. ''They are a valuable element to policing,'' he said. ''The problem is I just couldn't afford it.''
Mounted units often attract charity: the Baltimore department, which got a donation from the 7-Eleven company, now calls one of its horses Slurpee.
But for many departments, including the one in San Diego, the biggest cost was not the animals or their feed, it was deploying police officers on horseback instead of on other duties. ''We had to balance it against being able to keep officers in the patrol cars, and making sure we had enough officers on hand to answer emergency calls,'' said Assistant Chief Chief Bob Kanaski of San Diego. Officers there now patrol Balboa Park on all-terrain vehicles.
But there are still passionate defenders of mounted police. In New York, Deputy Police Commissioner Paul J. Browne said that the added visibility of the city's mounted officers was helpful last May when two Times Square street vendors wanted to report smoke rising from a crude car bomb on 45th Street, which ultimately failed to explode. ''They looked around,'' he said, ''and the first thing they saw of anyone in authority was two mounted police officers, who responded and cleared the area of bystanders before the bomb squad arrived.''
New York has one of the largest units in the nation, with 79 officers and 60 horses, but it is smaller than it was a decade ago, when there were 130 officers and 125 horses.
Philadelphia closed its unit in 2004 to save money. Now its police commissioner, Charles Ramsey -- who came to value horses for both crowd control and community relations in his previous job as the police chief in Washington -- is trying to raise $2.4 million to revive it. ''One of my officers once said, 'Nobody ever tried to pet my police car, but they line up to pet my horse,' '' he said. ''And it's true.''
He has already received a donation of four trained police horses -- from Newark.

HEADLINE: Helping Small Business

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Despite some political grandstanding, the bipartisan support to repeal the expanded Internal Revenue Service 1099 reporting requirement means that millions of the nation's smallest businesses have one less regulatory burden threatening their ability to survive (''The Health Care Tweak,'' editorial, Feb. 6). 
We encourage Congress to consider this small but essential tweak a teachable moment illustrating the incredible benefit that can result from fixing a bad bit of policy.
Congress should now focus on making the temporary expansion of the health insurance deduction for self-employed business owners permanent. The self-employed have been the only business entities to not enjoy a full tax benefit for buying health insurance, significantly affecting their bottom lines and competitiveness.
Creating a standard home office deduction would also deliver a big benefit to small business. Many small businesses leave a part of their tax refund on the table because calculating the deduction amount is ridiculously complicated.
We don't need more major small-business legislation -- just a few minor fixes to existing law will help our nation's smallest businesses continue to put our economy back on track. After all, they contribute nearly a trillion dollars a year.

HEADLINE: About Liberal 'Bias'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''Social Scientist Sees Bias Within'' (Findings, Feb. 8), John Tierney quotes JonathanHaidt as arguing that his fellow social psychologists are so overwhelmingly liberal they create a hostile climate for nonliberals. But this is more about economics than about the biases of academicians. 
The fundamental idea in conservatism is belief in the market system. Conservatives are not likely to go into a profession that vastly underpays them compared with other jobs they can find in the market.
The solution is not to use affirmative action, as Dr. Haidt suggests, but to make pay scales more competitive. As conservatives would argue, altering market incentives is much more likely to effect change than any social program.
Stefan Ekernas
Missoula, Mont.
To the Editor:
Isn't it remarkable that liberals and Democrats are so overwhelmingly represented on university faculties? Could this be saying something about the validity and value of a liberal philosophy?
Traditionally, schools have been incubators for progress and innovation. ''Education,'' B. F. Skinner said, ''is what survives when what has been learned has been forgotten.'' He might have been referring to this liberal bias, which leads people to be kind and tolerant. This is a bias that should be encouraged.

HEADLINE: Higher Prices Are Looming, Companies Say

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD, MOTOKO RICH and WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
By the fall, people will most likely be paying more for each of them, as rising prices hit most consumer goods, say retailers, food companies and manufacturers of consumer products.
Cotton prices are near their highest level in more than a decade, after adjusting for inflation, and leather and polyester costs are jumping as well. Copper recently hit its highest level in about 40 years, and iron ore, used for steel, is fetching extremely high prices. Prices for corn, sugar, wheat, beef, pork and coffee are soaring. Labor overseas is becoming more expensive, meanwhile, and so are the utility bills to keep a factory running.
''There are cost pressures from virtually everywhere,'' said Wesley R. Card, the chief executive of the Jones Group, whose brands include Nine West and Anne Klein. After trying to keep retail prices flat or even lower during the recession, Jones says prices for its brands will climb 15 to 20 percent by autumn.
When commodity prices started to rise last summer, many manufacturers and retailers absorbed the costs, worried that shoppers would not pay higher prices during the competitive holiday season or while the economy was still fragile. 
Many big companies, including Kraft, Polo Ralph Lauren and Hanes, say they cannot hold off any longer and must raise prices to protect some profits.
Whether shoppers will pay is unclear. ''Consumers are not exactly in the frame of mind or economic circumstances to say 'Oh, pay whatever they ask,' '' said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR Inc. ''There's going to be pushback.''
Economists say the increases may eventually show up as inflation, though they are not yet projecting rates that would set off alarms. Despite some fears, inflation has been extremely low, at a rate of just 1.4 percent annually in December. Data for January will be released Thursday, but economists expect inflation will run about 2.5 percent this year.
Some do see the creeping signs of higher inflation, and warn that the Federal Reserve will need to raise interest rates or at least stop pumping more money into the economy. Others argue that such moves would choke off economic growth sorely needed to get companies hiring again.
For consumers, higher prices in stores means there will be a little less extra cash to spend. For companies, profits may be squeezed, making them a little less likely to invest in equipment or to hire aggressively.
''One has to think about these higher prices not as a reason for economic activity to get derailed,'' said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics, ''but as a reason why the recovery is slower than might otherwise be the case.''
Given that the price of a gallon of gas is now well over $3 on average, Americans may feel that they are already dealing with higher prices.
Adding to the cost of food won't greatly distort most household budgets. Food, gas, clothing, personal care products and cleaning and laundry supplies make up less than a quarter of household spending in the United States, according to government data.
People at the bottom of the income scale struggle more as these prices rise, of course, because a larger share of their spending is on such essentials.
To some, the prospect of modestly higher prices is no reason to worry. In fact, rising prices can indicate improving economic conditions. Greater demand from fast-growing countries like China has helped push up the costs of many raw materials -- though officials there are worried about inflationary pressures, as are some officials in Europe.
In the United States, the willingness of companies to raise prices shows they are feeling better about the domestic recovery.
The sharp rise in commodity prices since last year has not translated into all new records. Food commodity prices are about 8 percent below the high in the summer of 2008, while energy prices are less than half their zenith. Prices of a basket of other commodities are about 4 percent below the heights of mid-2008.
The cost of raw materials accounts for a small portion of the cost of most consumer goods, as labor, processing and packaging tend to make up a larger share of the price at the cash register. Foods like coffee, meat and milk, which are closer to raw materials, will probably show some of the biggest price jumps.
Companies that try to pass on all their costs could meet resistance. Although consumer spending has risen, unemployment remains at 9 percent, and average hourly earnings are up less than 2 percent over the last year.
''These companies are constantly walking a tightrope on how far do I go,'' said Jack Russo, a consumer goods analyst at Edward Jones. ''Do I offset with price or other cost cuts, or do I just take it and have it eat into my profit margins?''
Already, rising raw material costs have cut into corporate profits. Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex tissues and Huggies diapers, said fiber- and oil-based products had contributed to a small dip last quarter. Procter & Gamble said earnings fell slightly in the division that makes Crest toothpaste, as well as in its household brands unit, which makes Tide and Cascade.
Plenty of companies are indicating they will push up retail prices. Kraft, the largest United States food manufacturer with brands like Oscar Mayer, Velveeta and Ritz crackers, said it would raise prices on many products this year without saying which ones or how much.
Soaring prices for coffee have pushed up costs at the coffee shop. Starbucks said last fall that it would raise some prices. Sara Lee, which sells Hillshire Farms meat and Senseo coffee, said that it would, too, on many items.
Restaurants, which resisted raising prices to keep customers coming through the doors last year, are also fretting. They may take other steps too, like lowering thermostats, shrinking packaging or reducing portion sizes to minimize the sticker shock.
Meat prices have surged because of the cost of feed, a decision by farmers to raise fewer cattle and pigs, and strong demand worldwide as living standards rise. An epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease that devastated South Korean hog farms has led to a recent surge in orders for American pork.
This year, ''you're going to have to raise prices to stay in business,'' said Len M. Steiner, owner of the Steiner Consulting Group, which works with restaurant companies on ingredient purchasing.
Whirlpool says consumers can expect to pay 8 to 10 percent more for its products starting April 1. Apparel companies like Polo Ralph Lauren and Brooks Brothers said they would raise prices this year. Hanes Brands, which has already done so, said prices on cotton-heavy products would rise again at the end of summer. If cotton costs stay high, Hanes products could have a cumulative 30 percent increase.
Some companies don't think they can get away with charging more. PepsiCo, which makes soft drinks and snacks, like Fritos, said it would be cautious.
Victoria's Secret is nudging prices ever so slightly, with panties rising from five for $25 to five for $25.50.
John D. Morris, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, said retailers would probably try to manage costs in myriad ways.
Prices rose significantly in the apparel sector from 1972 to 1974, driven by labor costs and commodity prices, he said.
''The retailers went on to have a pretty good year in '73,'' Mr. Morris said. ''Sales were up, gross margins were flat, and profit margins were up a little bit. Retailers found a way.''

HEADLINE: I.R.S. Takes On Tax Abuse By Charity Support Groups

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
In the last five years, the Internal Revenue Service has revoked the tax exemption of 72 groups, known as supporting organizations, that obscure philanthropies created to support specific charities.
The revocations, made during an investigation of supporting organizations begun by the I.R.S. in 2004, were disclosed this month at a meeting in Baltimore of tax advisers to nonprofit groups. In 2005, Mark W. Everson, its commissioner from 2003 to 2007, put such entities on the agency's Dirty Dozen list of the worst tax swindles.
Among the problems the I.R.S. found were supporting organizations that were created as tools in shady financial planning programs to let donors take a tax deduction, only to get their supposed charitable donation back through offshore investments or interest-free loans to relatives. 
An additional 30 supporting groups examined by the I.R.S. agreed to end their business in audits. The agency reclassified 59 more as charities or private foundations, making them subject to more stringent reporting and granting requirements.
''Hats off to the I.R.S. for finally showing some giddyap and enforcing the law,'' said Dean A. Zerbe, a tax consultant who, as a staff lawyer for the Senate Finance Committee, wrote legislation in 2006 to make supporting organizations more accountable. ''We've known for a long time that these things were problematic, and the high number of revocations is further proof.''
I.R.S. officials do not discuss specific organizations, but the agency does publish lists of nonprofit groups that have lost their tax exemption through revocation.
Lois G. Lerner, director of the exempt organizations division of the I.R.S., said the organizations that had been examined in the continuing investigation were largely those linked to promoters that had been identified by other I.R.S. divisions.
''Many of the organizations we looked at were ones where we already knew there was an apparent connection with a scheme, so it's not surprising that we found problems with them,'' Ms. Lerner said.
She said the most common abuse involved promoters who set up supporting organizations on behalf of their clients. The client would take a deduction for donating money to the organization. Then, through a series of promoter-controlled transactions -- some involving offshore activity -- the ''donation'' would be returned to the client or a relative, often in the form of a no-interest loan.
Several supporting organizations that have lost tax exemptions in the last several years, for example, were involved with Merrill Scott & Associates Ltd. of Utah. Merrill Scott is in receivership after a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation that claimed it had operated a Ponzi scheme. (In 2008, Merrill Scott's principals were charged, among other things, with tax evasion and money laundering.)
The tax exemption for the HFZ Charitable Supporting Organization of Santa Barbara, Calif., was revoked because of its relationship with Merrill Scott, said Scott Haskins, its co-founder. ''We were just looking for some financial planning advice, we weren't hiding money offshore or doing anything weird,'' said Mr. Haskins, a specialist in art restoration and conservation. ''The I.R.S. came in pretty much like a bull in a china closet, and for the last eight years, we've been through line-item audits of all our personal and business matters.''
HFZ's tax forms show that it was set up primarily to support the Dove Center, a nonprofit group in southern Utah that Mr. Haskins said helped women who were victims of domestic violence. ''We never made any donations to them,'' he said. ''We were going to provide some support for them, but never really got to that point.''
Mr. Haskins said he and his wife now plan to establish a donor-advised fund at the Santa Barbara Foundation, a community foundation where he lives. ''I know that there are a lot of people who set up supporting organizations as a kind of cloak for other activities, so I understand that it's bureaucratically difficult to distinguish those who've done so for the right reason from those who've done it for other reasons,'' he said. ''In our case, it was totally justified.''
The most common types of supporting organizations are what are known as ''Friends of'' groups, which typically raise money of behalf of a university sports program or an arts institution.
Congress ordered revisions to the regulations governing supporting organizations in the 2006 Pension Protection Act, effectively applying some of the rules that govern private foundations to prevent private benefit. In particular, the law took aim at Type III supporting organizations, which, unlike their Type I and Type II cousins, are not controlled by the charity they were created to support and are free to support any nonprofit organization.
A major provision of the act requires the Treasury Department to establish a mandatory payout rate for Type III organizations to ensure they are giving money to charity. The Treasury has proposed a payout rate of 5 percent of assets, which is the rate required of private foundations, but the American Bar Association and others are challenging that recommendation, seeking a lower rate. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, led the push in Congress for greater control of supporting organizations that preceded the Pension Protection Act. ''At the time, some critics of reform said concerns about abuse were overblown,'' Mr. Grassley said in an e-mail. ''It turns out there's plenty of cause for concern, and the new proposed payout rules will help. But the I.R.S. needs to hold firm on applying them.''

HEADLINE: To Stand Out, Retailers Flock to Exclusive Lines

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
To find Miley Cyrus's line of clothes, shoppers head to Wal-Mart. For Selena Gomez's, they go to Kmart. Jennifer Lopez's line is at Kohl's, and Demi Lovato's at Target. Rachel Bilson dinnerware can only be found at Macy's, while for the Kardashian Kollection, fans must go to Sears.
Department store shopping is getting more and more complicated, driven by the growing popularity of exclusive lines, often backed by celebrities.
In an effort to stave off rounds of price-slashing with competitors over the same brands, stores are increasingly relying on merchandise that can be found nowhere else. Retailers can mark these exclusive lines down at their own pace, with a far more profitable outcome than with a national brand. 
Though such lines have existed for years, the recession made them more prevalent as the designers became willing to cut exclusive deals rather than risk being cut from store floors altogether.
''One of the biggest challenges within, especially the department store realm, but probably throughout most of retail, is the lack of differentiation, the me-too-ness and the sameness that has plagued retailing for years,'' said Robert Drbul, an analyst with Barclays Capital. ''This push on exclusive brands has really helped separate many retailers from their competition.''
Yet while exclusive lines can attract a shopper, they can also be dizzyingly hard to keep track of -- was it Selena at Sears and Miley at Macy's?
''There are chances of fatigue,'' Mr. Drbul said.
Celebrity lines are particularly tricky because the star can wane in popularity almost overnight, and a scandal can hurt clothing sales. Many celebrities lend their name to clothing without being picky about the manufacturer, choosing an accessible price or promoting it after the initial buzz wears off. Along with celebrity fashions, exclusives can be designer lines available at only one venue or items in special colors or materials. Saks, for instance, has the exclusive on the ''taupe'' color of a Christian Louboutin ankle boot, while a metal-heeled Louboutin in beige is only at Neiman Marcus.
Even home improvement stores are getting in on the action -- Home Depot, for instance, began selling an exclusive line of Martha Stewart hardware, paint and furniture last year.
The thinking of retailers is smart, said Chris Donnelly, a senior executive in the retail practice of Accenture. ''It takes you out of being a commodity seller of goods at the lowest price.''
At Macy's, 42 percent of total sales were from exclusive merchandise in 2009, the most recent figure available, up from 40 percent in 2008.
At J. C. Penney, almost 50 percent of sales are from exclusives. Kohl's had about 48 percent of its 2010 sales from exclusives, up from 44 percent the previous year. (Figures include private-label clothing, which the stores commission).
At Saks Fifth Avenue, the proportion of exclusives is lower -- about 10 percent now -- but the company plans to raise it to more than 20 percent of sales in the coming years.
''The idea of selling products that you wouldn't be able to buy in other stores has been part of our thinking for some time,'' said Stephen I. Sadove, chief executive of Saks.
''During the recession, as business was so tough and you saw that purchases were being cut dramatically and some vendors were being eliminated from the mix, there became more of a willingness to work differently,'' he said. ''You found a greater degree of receptivity.''
Paul Sinclaire, who was the creative director at Club Monaco for some time, recently signed an exclusive deal with Saks, and said he received major advantages by doing so.
''It's focused -- it's one group of stores, it's one vision, and you build the business together,'' he said. ''Every step of the way, from press, to merchandising, they are kind of the co-creator of the line,'' he said of Saks. Selling in several retailers, ''you'd never get that attention,'' he said.
Besides, women have grown tired of seeing the same clothes everywhere.
''Right now, you go in and out of stores and you see the same merchandise by the same designers. Women don't want to necessarily see themselves coming and going,'' he said. ''There's a cachet to it that we're trying to bring back.''
Mr. Drbul, the financial analyst, said that exclusive lines are also a way for retailers to strengthen ailing brands. Liz Claiborne, for instance, became troubled when it was ubiquitous. J. C. Penney proposed turning it into an exclusive brand at its stores, which it did in 2010, and it has been a strong seller there.
''If a national brand starts to be more sluggish, retailers are pretty aggressive about proposing to some of the parent companies, saying can we have this as an exclusive product?'' Mr. Drbul said.
While stores like Saks use designer exclusives to draw in shoppers, stores that cater to a middle-income customer, like J. C. Penney, Macy's and Kohl's, have largely emphasized celebrity-affiliated exclusive lines.
Penney's has clothes from Cindy Crawford, the Olsen twins and the gymnast Nastia Liukin. Kohl's has lines from the reality star Lauren Conrad, the ex-MTV host Daisy Fuentes, the skater Tony Hawk, Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony. And along with lines from Martha Stewart, Donald Trump, Madonna and Sean Combs, the hip-hop entrepreneur, who sells his clothes under the name SeanJohn, Macy's announced on Thursday that it would start selling Ms. Bilson's dinnerware line exclusively.
''When you get a great celebrity that has an authentic vibe that caters to a particular customer base, that can be really potent,'' said Jeffrey Gennette, chief merchandising officer for Macy's. Without much pondering, customers ''get the celebrity, and they get the product.''
At Macy's, each celebrity line must fit a specific slot.
''We've got to make sure that whatever we're going to do with a celebrity or a brand that it hits white space, a category or a customer base that's underserved by my existing brand or portfolio,'' Mr. Gennette said.
For instance, Macy's brought in Madonna's line, Material Girl, as a fast-fashion brand for preteenagers, because it did not have one.
''If you heard the number of celebrities that come to us -- we convert on maybe one out of 10,'' Mr. Gennette said. Macy's will take a pass, he said, ''if we don't believe that the celebrity has longevity, or we believe they're changing their own personas, so it's unclear to a customer base what they're all about.''
At Kitson, the Los Angeles-based boutique, owner Fraser Ross said he was largely avoiding celebrity lines. ''If you're going to promote your TV show on Jay Leno, you've got to sell your clothing like a product,'' Mr. Ross said. ''I don't think celebrities realize that with clothing lines, you're going into a marketplace.''
The popularity of celebrities tends to peak quickly, leaving retailers that have signed them to exclusive deals with weakening attractions.
Lauren Conrad's line, for instance, was introduced at Bloomingdale's in the fall of 2008. By spring of the next year, she had left her show, ''The Hills,'' and in the fall of 2009, she was designing for Kohl's instead.
LL Cool J's exclusive line for Sears came and went within about a year.
Ms. Conrad's costar in ''The Hills,'' Heidi Montag, introduced a line, called Heidiwood, for the store Anchor Blue, but it was panned in the media. Today, Heidiwood clothing is nowhere to be found -- and Anchor Blue is going out of business.

HEADLINE: The Obama Budget

 BODY:
On paper, President Obama's new $3.7 trillion budget is encouraging. It makes a number of tough choices to cut the deficit by a projected $1.1 trillion over 10 years, which is enough to prevent an uncontrolled explosion of debt in the next decade and, as a result, reduce the risk of a fiscal crisis.
The questions are whether its tough choices are also wise choices and whether it stands a chance in a Congress in which Republicans, who now dominate the House, are obsessed with making indiscriminate short-term cuts in programs they never liked anyway. The Republican cuts would eviscerate vital government functions while not having any lasting impact on the deficit. 
What Mr. Obama's budget is most definitely not is a blueprint for dealing with the real long-term problems that feed the budget deficit: rising health care costs, an aging population and a refusal by lawmakers to face the inescapable need to raise taxes at some point. Rather, it defers those critical issues, in hopes, we assume, that both the economy and the political environment will improve in the future.
For the most part, Mr. Obama has managed to cut spending while preserving important government duties. That approach is in stark contrast to Congressional Republicans, who are determined to cut spending deeply, no matter the consequences.
A case in point: the Obama budget's main cut -- $400 billion over 10 years -- is the result of a five-year freeze in nonsecurity discretionary programs, a slice of the budget that contains programs that are central to the quality of American lives, including education, environment and financial regulation.
But the cuts are not haphazard. The budget boosts education spending by 11 percent over one year and retains the current maximum level of college Pell grants -- up to $5,500 a year. To offset some of the costs, the budget would eliminate Pell grants for summer school and let interest accrue during school on federal loans for graduate students, rather than starting the interest meter after graduation.
Those are tough cutbacks, but, over all, the Pell grant program would continue to help close to nine million students. The Republican proposal would cut the Pell grant program by 15 percent this year and nearly half over the next two years.
The Obama budget also calls for spending on green energy programs -- to be paid for, in part, by eliminating $46 billion in tax breaks for oil, gas and coal companies over the next decade. Republicans are determined not to raise any taxes, even though investing for the future and taming the deficit are impossible without more money.
The budget would also increase transportation spending by $242 billion over 10 years. It does not specifically call for an increased gas tax to cover the new costs, though it calls on Congress to come up with new revenues to offset the new spending. Republicans want to eliminate forward-looking programs like high-speed rail.
The budget is responsible in other ways. It would cap the value of itemized deductions for high-income taxpayers and use the savings to extend relief from the alternative minimum tax for three years so that the tax does not ensnare millions of middle- and upper-middle-income taxpayers for whom it was never intended. For nearly a decade, Congress has granted alternative minimum tax relief without paying for it.
House Republicans want to leave military spending out of their budget-cutting entirely, but Mr. Obama's budget reduces projected Pentagon spending by $78 billion over five years. If anything, Mr. Obama could safely have proposed cutting deeper, as suggested by his own bipartisan deficit panel.
The bill for the military is way too high, above cold-war peak levels, when this country had a superpower adversary. There's a point where the next military spending dollar does not make our society more secure, and it's a point we long ago passed.
Mr. Obama's budget also includes a responsible way to head off steep cuts in what Medicare pays doctors. It would postpone the cuts for two years and offset that added cost with $62 billion in other health care savings, like expanding the use of cheaper generic drugs.
But not all of Mr. Obama's cuts are acceptable. The president is proposing a reduction by nearly half in the program that provides assistance to low-income families to pay for home heating bills. Shared sacrifice need not involve the very neediest.
Ideally, budget cuts would not start until the economic recovery is more firmly entrenched. But the deficit is a pressing political problem. The Obama budget is balanced enough to start the process of deficit reduction, but not so draconian that it would derail the recovery.
The same cannot be said for the plan put forward by Republicans last week. It would amputate some of government's most vital functions for the next seven months of fiscal year 2011. (They haven't even gotten to next year yet, never mind the more distant future.)
Real deficit reduction will require grappling with rising health care costs and an aging population, which means reforms in Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, as well as tax increases to bring revenues in line with obligations.
Mr. Obama's budget does not directly address those big issues, but doing so would require a negotiating partner, and Mr. Obama, at present, does not have one among the Republican leaders in Congress. His latest budget is a good starting point for a discussion -- and a budget deal -- but only if Republicans are willing participants in the process.

HEADLINE: OBAMA'S BUDGET FOCUSES ON PATH TO REIN IN DEFICIT

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With President Obama's release on Monday of a budget for next year and House action this week on a Republican plan for immediate deep spending cuts, the nation is getting its clearest view since the president took office of the parties' competing visions of the role of government, the urgency of addressing the deficit and the best path to long-term economic success.
Mr. Obama used his budget for the fiscal year 2012 and beyond to make the case for selectively cutting spending while increasing resources in areas like education and clean energy initiatives that hold the potential for long-term payoffs in economic growth. With this year's deficit projected to hit a record, $1.6 trillion, he laid out a path for bringing down annual deficits to more sustainable levels over the rest of the decade.
Republicans said it was not nearly enough to address chronic fiscal imbalances and reduce the role of the federal government in the economy and society. 
Neither party has put forward specific proposals to begin grappling with the most pressing long-term budget problem: the huge costs in the Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security programs as the population ages and medical costs rise, a bill that could overwhelm the government and crimp the economy if not addressed.
''We're doing things that are the most painful and of least long-term economic value because we're not willing to do the things that everybody, at least privately, agrees are necessary,'' said Vin Weber, a Republican Party strategist and former congressman.
Nonetheless, with his budget, Mr. Obama was pivoting from the emphasis in his first two years on costly efforts to revive the economy. He said his plan would reduce the total projected deficits over the next decade by $1.1 trillion, or about 10 percent.
His budget, for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, would cut spending for an array of domestic programs, including community services and environmental protection, and reduce the Pentagon's previously proposed budget by $78 billion over five years. At the same time, it would make room for spending increases for education, infrastructure, clean energy, innovation, as well as research.
''Even as we cut out things that we can afford to do without, we have a responsibility to invest in those areas that will have the biggest impact in our future,'' Mr. Obama told students at a science and technology school in Baltimore. ''And that's especially true when it comes to education.''
On Capitol Hill, Republicans rejected Mr. Obama's talk of budgetary investments, calling them runaway spending by another name, and blamed him for the fact that the projected deficit for this fiscal year will set a record. But that deficit projection swelled mostly because of the costly tax cuts deal that Republicans negotiated with Mr. Obama in December.
On Tuesday, Republicans plan to begin three days of debate on a package slashing at least $61 billion from nonsecurity domestic spending just in the remaining seven months of the current fiscal year.
In an interview, Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and chairman of the House Budget Committee, accused the president of ''an abdication of leadership'' for not being bolder in trying to reduce the long-term debt, as a majority of Mr. Obama's own bipartisan fiscal commission recommended in December.
While Republicans will not write their own budget for the fiscal year 2012 and beyond until April, making comparisons with Mr. Obama's agenda difficult for now, their assault on 2011 spending showed how much deeper the new House majority is prepared to cut. It is shrinking or eliminating programs for education, environmental and energy initiatives, health services, border security, law enforcement and much more, both to downsize government and reduce deficits and to make room for more tax cuts.
Yet even as Republicans criticized Mr. Obama as fiscally timid, dissension in their ranks over those spending cuts suggested their challenges in writing their own budget. For the past two years, with Democrats in control of both chambers of Congress and the White House, Republicans could attack freely without any responsibility to produce alternatives.
For all the partisan finger-pointing, however, both sides are far from taking the comprehensive long-term approach that the fiscal commission majority and similar bipartisan debt-reduction groups have recommended, and that most people in both parties in Washington privately acknowledge are necessary.
The commission majority, including liberal and conservative lawmakers, proposed to save $4 trillion over 10 years by reducing all domestic and military spending and by overhauling the tax code, throwing out a raft of tax breaks for individuals and corporations to both reduce rates and raise additional revenues for deficit reduction.
Neither Mr. Obama nor Congressional Republicans are tackling the large entitlement benefit programs. As for tax revenues, Republicans want only to cut taxes further while Mr. Obama has promised not to raise taxes for the 98 percent of American households with income under $250,000 a year. In his budget, however, he does revive a number of proposed tax increases for upper-income individuals, financial institutions, oil and gas companies, insurance companies and multinational corporations that Congress has rejected before; the new revenues mostly would offset the costs of budget items that have bipartisan support but typically are just added to deficits.
Mr. Obama and Republicans are left, then, competing to cut just 12 percent of the federal budget, the so-called nonsecurity discretionary spending that Congress appropriates each year.
Yet that small slice covers a wide range of public services, including air-traffic control, disease research, transportation, food safety and rural development programs.
''I'm a real hawk on cutting discretionary spending, but that won't come close to doing it,'' said Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, who was part of the fiscal commission majority.
In his budget preface, Mr. Obama simply called on Republicans to join him in negotiating a bipartisan agreement overhauling corporate taxes and securing Social Security's actuarial solvency over 75 years.
Following the approach of his fiscal commission, but without its specifics, Mr. Obama proposed to overhaul the corporate tax code by eliminating loopholes and using the savings to lower the corporate income-tax rate. But unlike the commission majority, he did not propose dedicating some of the savings to deficit reduction.
''We need to do both,'' Mr. Coburn said.
Some administration advisers wanted him to propose specific changes to fix Social Security, which has accumulated surpluses to date but before long will begin paying out more than it takes in from payroll taxes.
But, Democrats say, Mr. Obama and his political team figured that Republicans are unwilling to talk compromise this soon after their return to power in the House and that a president facing re-election next year would be unwise to risk proposing bold but controversial ideas, like small reductions in cost-of-living adjustments for future Social Security beneficiaries, only to be rebuffed.
Mr. Ryan, the House Republican budget chairman, rejected that reasoning.
''Presidents are elected to take the country's challenges on and fix them before they get out of control,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''Everybody knows the debt is out of control. The president set up a commission to that effect, and he doesn't even take on any of the commission's big recommendations.''
But asked whether House Republicans would propose a bold budget this spring that would truly rein in future deficits as the fiscal commission proposed, Mr. Ryan demurred. ''I wish I could tell you the answer to that,'' he said.
Referring to the scores of new Republican lawmakers, many of them elected with the support of antispending Tea Party conservatives, Mr. Ryan said, ''I've got 87 new people who are just getting to learn the process, who are just getting to learn the issues.''
And, he added, ''everybody who comes in learning the budget finds out that things are more difficult than they at first seemed.''
Mr. Obama is happy to lose the competition to cut the most, Democrats say, and they contrast his approach with what they describe as Republicans' slash-and-burn budgeting.
''He's talking about stuff that the public is for, making the kinds of investments that are really critical to business success as well,'' said John Podesta, president of the Campaign for American Progress and a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton.
Republicans, of course, disagree.
''Being on the smaller side of a spending fight in this environment is the place to be,'' said Don Stewart, deputy chief of staff to Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader.

HEADLINE: Reagan And Reality

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
Early in Eugene Jarecki's documentary, ''Reagan,'' you hear the voice of Ronald Reagan saying, ''Someday it might be worthwhile to find out how images are created -- and even more worthwhile to learn how false images come into being.''
Indeed. The image that many, perhaps most, Americans have of the nation's 40th president is largely manufactured. Reagan has become this larger-than-life figure who all but single-handedly won the cold war, planted the Republican Party's tax-cut philosophy in the resistant soil of the liberal Democrats and is the touchstone for all things allegedly conservative, no matter how wacky or extreme. 
Mr. Jarecki's documentary does a first-rate job of respectfully separating the real from the mythical, the significant from the nonsense. The truth is that Ronald Reagan, at one time or another, was all over the political map. Early on, he was a liberal Democrat and admirer of Franklin Roosevelt. Reagan's family received much-needed help from the New Deal during the Depression.
It is well known that Reagan was the head of the Screen Actors Guild. And though he was staunchly anti-Communist, he did not finger anyone when he appeared before the rabid House Un-American Activities Committee. But Mr. Jarecki learned that at the height of the Red Scare, Reagan had been secretly cooperating with the F.B.I. He was registered officially as Informant T-10.
No less than other public figures, Reagan was complicated. He was neither the empty suit that his greatest detractors would have you believe nor the conservative god of his most slavish admirers. He was a tax-cutter who raised taxes in seven of the eight years of his presidency. He was a budget-cutter who nearly tripled the federal budget deficit.
The biggest problem with Reagan, as we look back at his presidency in search of clues that might help us meet the challenges of today, is that he presented himself -- and has since been presented by his admirers -- as someone committed to the best interests of ordinary, hard-working Americans. Yet his economic policies, Reaganomics, dealt a body blow to that very constituency.
Mark Hertsgaard, the author of ''On Bended Knee: The Press and the Reagan Presidency,'' says in the film, ''You cannot be fair in your historical evaluation of Ronald Reagan if you don't look at the terrible damage his economic policies did to this country.''
Paul Volcker, who served as chairman of the Federal Reserve during most of the Reagan years, commented in the film about the economist Arthur Laffer's famous curve, which, incredibly, became a cornerstone of national economic policy. ''The Laffer Curve,'' said Mr. Volcker, ''was presented as an intellectual support for the idea that reducing taxes would produce more revenues, and that was, I think, considered by most people a pretty extreme interpretation of what would happen.''
Toward the end of his comment, the former Fed chairman chuckled as if still amused by the idea that this was ever taken seriously.
What we get with Reagan are a series of disconnects and contradictions that have led us to a situation in which a president widely hailed as a hero of the working class set in motion policies that have been mind-bogglingly beneficial to the wealthy and devastating to working people and the poor.
''It is important that we stop idolizing our public figures, lionizing them,'' said Mr. Jarecki, in an interview. He views Reagan as a gifted individual and does not give short shrift in the film to Reagan's successes in his dealings with the Soviet Union and other elements of what Mr. Jarecki called ''the positive side of Ronald Reagan.'' The film also has interviews with many Reagan stalwarts, including James Baker and George Shultz.
But when all is said and done, it is the economic revolution that gained steam during the Reagan years and is still squeezing the life out of the middle class and the poor that is Reagan's most significant legacy. A phony version of that legacy is relentlessly promoted by right-wingers who shamelessly pursue the interests of the very rich while invoking the Reagan brand to give the impression that they are in fact the champions of ordinary people.
Reagan's son, Ron, says in the film that he believes his father ''was vulnerable to the idea that poor people were somehow poor because it was their fault.'' A clip is then shown of Ronald Reagan referring to, ''The homeless who are homeless, you might say, by choice.''
''Reagan,'' an HBO documentary, will be shown on Presidents' Day to U.S. military personnel on the American Forces Network. It will be available soon in theaters and home video release. It is an important corrective to the fantasy of Reagan that has gotten such a purchase on American consciousness.

HEADLINE: Obama Budget Raises School Spending and Keeps Pell Grant Maximum

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON and TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
President Obama proposed a 2012 Department of Education budget on Monday that would, if approved, significantly increase federal spending for public schools, and maintain the maximum Pell grant -- the cornerstone financial-aid program -- at $5,550 per college student.
Whether it will be possible to keep that Pell maximum remains uncertain, however, given that House Republicans have proposed cutting the maximum by about $845, or 15 percent, in their proposal to extend the current budget. 
The administration's education proposal asks for $77.4 billion. That includes $48.8 billion for the portion of the education budget that does not include Pell grants, or an increase of about 4 percent above the 2010 budget. Congress has not yet enacted the 2011 budget.
Among education programs that the administration was protecting was Race to the Top, the competitive grant program that the administration has made its centerpiece initiative. Last year the administration used the Race to the Top to channel $4 billion in economic stimulus money to New York and other states that had proposed bold school improvement plans.
The 2012 budget proposal includes $900 million for Race to the Top, which the administration says would be awarded this time not to states but to school districts. That would make it possible, for instance, to channel money to Houston or other districts in Texas that wanted to compete in the Race to the Top initiative but could not because their state declined to participate.
Some House Republicans are skeptical of the program, however, and -- like other line items in the education budget -- it could face trims or elimination as Congress works on its own budget and the administration's.
The Republicans also propose to cut $1.1 billion from the Head Start program, which, according to estimates by the National Head Start Association, would eliminate services for more than 200,000 children and the jobs of more than 50,000 Head Start employees.
Reacting to the administration's budget, Representative John Kline, the Minnesota Republican who is chairman of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, indicated a reluctance to invest more in education.
''Over the last 45 years we have increased our investment in education, but the return on that investment has failed to improve student achievement,'' Mr. Kline said. ''Throwing more money at our nation's broken education system ignores reality and does a disservice to students and taxpayers.''
The administration's education proposal also includes $600 million for School Turnaround Grants, another favorite of the president and of Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. This would be a $54 million increase above 2010 levels. The turnaround effort, which the administration hopes will finance makeovers of thousands of the country's worst schools, was also financed with billions in economic stimulus money.
The vast program known as Title I, which channels money to school districts to help them educate disadvantaged children, would receive $14.8 billion, an increase of $300 million over 2010.
Last year, the president said that, to remain competitive, the nation must increase the number of college graduates. But forced to make deep cuts in many areas of government, the president now proposes to eliminate some provisions of the Pell program, which has doubled in size over five years, and serves nine million low-income students. The administration's budget would end Pell grants for summer students and end interest subsidies on graduate students' loans.
''We're making some tough choices to protect the Pell grant,'' Justin Hamilton, a department spokesman, said Monday in an e-mail statement. ''We're cutting where we can so that we can invest where we must.''
Congress passed the legislation providing an extra $36 billion over 10 years for the Pell program, and increasing the maximum grant to $5,550 only last year. But with the new Congress's emphasis on cost-cutting, Pell grants became a prime focal point for cost-cutting. Beyond the 15 percent cut in this fall's Pell grants, the House Republicans' proposal would, over 10 years, cut $56 billion from the program.
Mr. Kline said the Democrats had expanded Pells beyond what taxpayers can afford and put the program on the path to bankruptcy.
But education groups warned that cutting the Pell program would put college out of reach for many low-income students.
''With millions of Americans struggling to make ends meet, cutting Pell grants would pull the rug right out from under students and families who are counting on these crucial grants to help pay for college this fall,'' said Lauren Asher of the Project on Student Debt.

HEADLINE: Soaking Up the Sun to Squeeze Bills to Zero

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
GOLDEN, Colo. -- The west-facing windows by Jim Duffield's desk started automatically tinting blue at 2:50 p.m. on a recent Friday as the midwinter sun settled low over the Rocky Mountain foothills.
Around his plant-strewn work cubicle, low whirring air sounds emanated from speakers in the floor, meant to mimic the whoosh of conventional heating and air-conditioning systems, neither of which his 222,000-square-foot office building has, or needs, even here at 5,300 feet elevation. The generic white noise of pretend ductwork is purely for background and workplace psychology -- managers found that workers needed something more than silence.
Meanwhile, the photovoltaic roof array was beating a retreat in the fading, low-angled light. It had until 1:35 p.m. been producing more electricity than the building could use -- a three-hour energy budget surplus -- interrupted only around noon by a passing cloud formation. 
For Mr. Duffield, 62, it was just another day in what was designed, in painstaking detail, to be the largest net-zero energy office building in the nation. He's still adjusting, six months after he and 800 engineers and managers and support staff from the National Renewable Energy Lab moved in to the $64 million building, which the federal agency has offered up as a template for how to do affordable, super-energy-efficient construction.
''It's sort of a wonderland,'' said Mr. Duffield, an administrative support worker, as the window shading system reached maximum.
Most office buildings are divorced, in a way, from their surroundings. Each day in the mechanical trenches of heating, cooling and data processing is much the same as another but for the cost of paying for the energy used.
The energy lab's Research Support Facility building is more like a mirror, or perhaps a sponge, to its surroundings. From the light-bending window louvers that cast rays up into the interior office spaces, to the giant concrete maze in the sub-basement for holding and storing radiant heat, every day is completely different.
This is the story of one randomly selected day in the still-new building's life: Jan. 28, 2011.
It was mostly sunny, above-average temperatures peaking in the mid-60s, light winds from the west-northwest. The sun rose at 7:12 a.m.
By that moment, the central computer was already hard at work, tracking every watt in and out, seeking, always, the balance of zero net use over 24 hours -- a goal that managers say probably won't be attainable until early next year, when the third wing of the project and a parking complex are completed.
With daylight, the building's pulse quickened. The photovoltaic panels kicked in with electricity at 7:20 a.m.
As employees began arriving, electricity use -- from cellphone chargers to elevators -- began to increase. Total demand, including the 65-watt maximum budget per workspace for all uses, lighting to computing, peaked at 9:40 a.m.
Meanwhile, the basement data center, which handles processing needs for the 300-acre campus, was in full swing, peaking in electricity use at 10:10 a.m., as e-mail and research spreadsheets began firing through the circuitry.
For Mr. Duffield and his co-workers, that was a good-news bad-news moment: The data center is by far the biggest energy user in the complex, but also one of its biggest producers of heat, which is captured and used to warm the rest of the building. If there is a secret clubhouse for the world's energy and efficiency geeks, it probably looks and feels just about like this.
''Nothing in this building was built the way it usually is,'' said Jerry Blocher, a senior project manager at Haselden Construction, the general contractor for the project.
The backdrop to everything here is that office buildings are, to people like Mr. Blocher, the unpicked fruit of energy conservation. Commercial buildings use about 18 percent of the nation's total energy each year, and many of those buildings, especially in years past, were designed with barely a thought to energy savings, let alone zero net use.
The answer at the research energy laboratory, a unit of the federal Department of Energy, is not gee-whiz science. There is no giant, expensive solar array that could mask a multitude of traditional design sins, but rather a rethinking of everything, down to the smallest elements, all aligned in a watt-by-watt march toward a new kind of building.
Managers even pride themselves on the fact that hardly anything in their building, at least in its individual component pieces, is really new.
Off-the-shelf technology, cost-efficient as well as energy-efficient, was the mantra to finding what designers repeatedly call the sweet spot -- zero energy that doesn't break a sweat, or the bank. More than 400 tour groups, from government agency planners to corporations to architects, have trouped through since the first employees moved in last summer.
''It's all doable technology,'' said Jeffrey M. Baker, the director of laboratory operations at the Department of Energy's Golden field office. ''It's a living laboratory.''
Some of those techniques and tricks are as old as the great cathedrals of Europe (mass holds heat like a battery, which led to the concrete labyrinth in the subbasement). Light, as builders since the pyramids have known, can be bent to suit need, with louvers that fling sunbeams to white panels over the office workers heads' to minimize electricity.
There are certainly some things that workers here are still getting used to. In nudging the building toward zero net electricity over 24 hours, lighting was a main target. That forced designers to lower the partition walls between work cubicles to only 42 or 54 inches (height decided by compass, or perhaps sundial, in maximizing the flow of natural light and ventilation), which raised privacy concerns among workers. Even the managers' offices have no ceilings -- again to allow the flow of natural light, as cast from the ceiling.
''The open office is different,'' said Andrew Parker, an engineer. ''You want to be next to someone quiet.''
Getting to the highest certification level in green building technology at reasonable cost also required an armada of creative decisions, large and small. The round steel structural columns that hold the building up? They came from 3,000 feet of natural gas pipe -- built for the old energy economy and never used. The wood trim in the lobby? Lodgepole pine trees -- 310 of them -- killed by a bark beetle that has infested millions of acres of forest in the West.
Ultimately, construction costs were brought in at only $259 a square foot, nearly $77 below the average cost of a new super-efficient commercial office building, according to figures from Haselden Construction, the builder. Other components of the design are based on observation of human nature.
People print less paper when they share a central printer that requires a walk to the copy room. People also use less energy, managers say, when they know how much they're using. A monitor in the lobby offers real-time feedback on eight different measures.
The feedback comes right down to a worker's computer screen, where a little icon pops up when the building's central computer says conditions are optimal to crank the hand-opened windows. (Other windows, harder to reach, open by computer command.)
Rethinking work shifts can also contribute. Here, the custodial staff comes in at 5 p.m., two or three hours earlier than in most traditional office buildings, saving on the use of lights.
The management of energy behavior, like the technology, is an experiment in progress.
''Right now people are on their best behavior,'' said Ron Judkoff, a lab program manager. ''Time will answer the question of whether you can really train people, or whether a coffee maker or something starts showing up.''
If Anthony Castellano is a measure, the training regimen has clearly taken root. Mr. Castellano, who joined the research laboratory last year as a Web designer after years in private industry, said the immersion in energy consciousness goes home with him at night.
''My kids are yelling at me because I'm turning off all the lights,'' Mr. Castellano said.
At 5:05 p.m., the solar cells stopped producing. Declining daylight in turn produced a brief spike in lighting use, at 5:55 p.m. Five minutes later, the building management system began shutting off lights in a rolling two-hour cycle (the computer gives a few friendly blinks, as a signal in case a late-working employee wants to leave the lights on.)
Mr. Duffield, whose work space is surrounded by a miniature greenhouse of plants he has brought, said his desk has become a regular stop on the group tours. If the building is a living experiment, he said, then his garden is the experiment within the experiment. Co-workers stop by, joking in geek-speak about his plants, but also seriously checking up on them as a measure of building health.
''They refer to this as the building's carbon sink,'' he said.
And Mr. Duffield's babies -- amaryllis, African violet, a pink trumpet vine -- are very happy with all the refracted, reflected light they get, he said.
''The tropical trumpet vine in my house stops growing for the winter,'' he said. ''Here it has continued to grow, and when the days starting getting longer it might even bloom.''
