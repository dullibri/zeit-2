HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY: Digital Commerce;
Personal information is like gold in the Internet economy, and the rush is on to both exploit it and protect it.

BYLINE: By Denise Caruso 

 BODY:
FOR the last few weeks, the data privacy battle has been waged with such fury that privacy advocates have not known whether to cry, cheer or simply assume the fetal position.
Personal privacy -- the disposition of all those pieces of information that computers hold about each of us -- has been debated in the electronic world for almost two decades. Although the issues are complex, the bottom lines have always been pretty clearly drawn. 
 People and companies that sell personal data want to be able to collect and distribute it pretty much with abandon, and they fight like cornered weasels at even the suggestion of government regulation.
Yet, most people on line -- 87 percent in a 1997 Georgia Tech survey -- want "complete control" over their personal data. And if they feel violated by data collectors, they often scream bloody murder.
In 1991, for example, the Lotus Corporation was forced to cancel shipments of Marketplace, a CD-ROM data base, after receiving thousands of angry E-pistles from people who took grievous offense at the data base's content: the names, addresses, income levels, numbers of children and other data for every household in the United States.
More recently, privacy advocates wrested a hollow victory from the Intel Corporation, after the company announced that its new Pentium III chips contained embedded electronic serial numbers for authenticating documents, E-mail and copyrighted material. Watchdogs warned that the numbers could be used to identify a computer to prying software, or to allow companies or agencies to track a person's movements across the Internet.
Intel refused to remove the number, but agreed to provide software that hides it behind a digital fig leaf, software that some say has already been compromised.
And the California Legislature, often a bellwether for technology issues, is considering more than a dozen privacy laws, including one that would restrict the collection and disclosure of personal information by government, business or nonprofit organizations. It specifically includes information gathered via Internet sites.
Still, plenty of others are rushing to cash in on the data gold rush.
Privacy advocates were extremely cranky after discovering that Florida, South Carolina and Colorado were selling residents' driver's license information to a New Hampshire-based company, Image Data L.L.C.
They were even more outraged to discover that the Secret Service had financed another private company's efforts to develop a national data base of driver's license photographs.
And in the most telling testament yet to the commercial value of personal data in the Internet economy, a start-up called Free PC announced that it would provide a free Internet connection and a free Compaq computer to anyone willing to "apply" by answering a detailed questionnaire and then accepting constant bombardment by advertisers based on the personal profile created from the questionnaire.
Rich Le Furgy, chairman of the Internet Advertising Bureau, an industry group, said that advertisers haven't even begun to tap the Internet's potential. They are now investigating how to aim promotions at individual consumers based on their on-line behavior: vendors want to co-market products in much the same way that convenience stores did after discovering, for example, that people who buy beer also often buy diapers at the same time.
Not exactly music to the ears of a privacy-sensitive consumer. Obviously, on-line advertising organizations find themselves straddling a very pointy fence between companies that pay for advertising and customers who are subjected to that advertising. The constituencies have very different viewpoints, and finding a solution palatable to both is not a task for the squeamish.
For example, Mr. Le Furgy said "it would be a beautiful thing" for consumers to control their personal data -- especially if it meant avoiding legislation and regulation.
"Privacy is an enabler of commerce," he said. If consumers can get money for their personal information and still control it, "they'll be much more willing to provide it."
In fact, a new breed of Internet company is already making a business of that concept.
These companies, known as infomediaries -- a term coined by John Hagel, co-author of "Net Worth: Shaping Markets When Customers Make the Rules" (Harvard Business School Press, 1999) -- will step in and help consumers regain control of their personal data.
For a price, of course.
A recent Wired News feature predicts that an up and coming pack of these entrepreneurs will "cut the consumer in" on the deal when information about them is bought and sold. Infomediaries keep a percentage for themselves for providing the security mechanisms by which consumers can control exactly who buys their personal data and for what purpose.
But some privacy advocates would eliminate even the infomediary and pass laws granting consumers not just civil rights to their privacy, but property rights to their private data, ending the free-market eminent domain that data marketers have exploited for decades.
Citing a Virginia law that forbids the use of anyone's name or likeness without permission, Ram Avrahami, a business consultant, unsuccessfully sued U.S. News & World Report in 1996 for selling his name to another magazine. At the time, Mr. Avrahami's opponents ridiculed him for suing over 8 cents, which is what the magazine had paid for his name.
"The point is this: It's 8 cents for me, for you, for 100 million other Americans, which becomes big money," said Mr. Avrahami, who has since become a leading advocate of private data ownership. "Think of it this way: Free PC proves that our personal information is worth hundreds of dollars. Now, who should get those dollars, if not us?"

HEADLINE: Building on Borrowed Cachet;
Cathleen Black Shakes Up the Culture at Hearst Magazines

BYLINE: By ALEX KUCZYNSKI 

 BODY:
It was the closest you could get to a debutante party in the mud-slinging, ego-bruising, advertising-hungry world of magazine publishing.
The occasion: a dinner in early February given by the American Jewish Committee in the ballroom of the New York Hilton, in honor of Cathleen Black, the president of Hearst Magazines. But, alas, all eyes were not on Ms. Black. 
 Instead, heads swiveled toward Tina Brown and Ron Galotti, the editor and publisher of Talk magazine, the Hearst Corporation's newest joint venture -- who sat, smiles firmly in place, at a table behind Ms. Black, in their first public appearance as affianced partners of the Hearst company. And a Hearst executive, noticing the rubbernecking, nodded his head toward the pair.
"We're showing them off tonight," he said in the tone a proud father might use to describe a glowing daughter. "Our new gems."
The fact that Hearst executives were swooning over Ms. Brown demonstrates the dynamic of what has become an emerging strategy at Hearst: partnership. In this case, the muscle of Hearst coupled with the ceaseless chattering chorus that seems to follow Ms. Brown everywhere. At a time when magazine publishers, feeling a squeeze at the newsstand, are wary of introducing new magazines unless they are guaranteed sure things, the partnership formula seems to be working for Hearst. The company's two other joint ventures, Smart Money (which is published in conjunction with Dow Jones & Company) and Marie Claire (with Marie Claire Album, a French company) are two of the strongest titles in the industry. With the Talk deal, Hearst has attracted attention from the advertising community by teaming up with two well-known magazine figures -- but only assuming half the financial risk and half the estimated $50 million start-up costs.
But not all eyes will remain glued to Talk; many will be monitoring Ms. Black's progress in changing the company to increase advertising revenue. The decision to become a partner with Miramax Films on Talk is a definite change of pace for Hearst. The $1-billion-a-year magazine division -- which publishes 19 titles in the United States, including Cosmopolitan, Popular Mechanics and Good Housekeeping -- has long been considered the most middle of the road, least daring of the four major magazine companies (the others being the stylish Conde Nast, the mainstream but news-oriented Time Inc. and the scrappy, growing Hachette Filipacchi Magazines).
The decision adds one ingredient advertisers love: glamour. And at half-price.
Ms. Black has changed the company slowly; in three years, she has dismissed or reassigned only a handful of publishers and editors. (By contrast, when Steven T. Florio, the chief executive of Conde Nast, was named publisher of the company, the magazine division of Advance Publications, he made dozens of personnel changes in the first months.) She has concentrated on rehabilitating the magazine company's image among advertisers, who had grumbled loudly in 1995 when Hearst cut its magazines' guaranteed circulation rates. (The decision prompted many big advertisers to slash their spending for advertising in Hearst magazines.)
She has maintained Cosmopolitan's status as a market leader, Despite high-level editorial changes. It routinely pummels its archrival, Conde Nast's Glamour -- now edited by the former Cosmopolitan editor Bonnie Fuller -- at the newsstand, a success that must be sweet for Ms. Black. In December -- in another advertiser-oriented move -- she reorganized the company's magazines into two groups, in an attempt to encourage advertisers to buy pages in several magazines jointly, in effect offering package deals.
An extroverted and aggressive seller, Ms. Black is known for her close ties to the advertising industry, and sits on the boards of two of the country's largest advertisers, the Coca-Cola Corporation and I.B.M. She said that to woo advertisers, brand names like Dow Jones and Miramax, a unit of the Walt Disney Company, are essential.
"If we do a joint venture with anybody," she said, "we want them to be major corporations. Apart from the consumer audience, your advertiser audience is saying, 'Gee, Dow Jones and Hearst,' or 'Gee, Miramax and Hearst are behind this,' then they know we're putting a lot of resources and talent and energy behind the product that an individual entrepreneur just doesn't have."
Like her company, Ms. Black is frill-free. A self-described Catholic schoolgirl from Chicago, she started her career at Holiday magazine, then moved to New York magazine, becoming advertising manager of Ms. Magazine when it was founded by Gloria Steinem in 1972. ("It was real lick-your-own-envelopes-at-midnight work," she said.) She was named publisher of New York in 1979, but made her mark at USA Today as publisher in the 1980's by smartening it up in the eyes of advertisers wary of a newspaper nicknamed "McPaper." In 1991, she became president of the Newspaper Association of America and then moved to Hearst as president of the magazine division in January 1996. (Her husband, Tom Harvey, is a lawyer; they have two children, a dog, and a country house in Connecticut.)
Hearst is a privately held company, and Ms. Black will not discuss numbers -- even good ones, choosing instead to highlight the successes of Smart Money and Cosmopolitan. In an effort to build on Cosmopolitan's growth and the popularity of magazines for teen-agers, Cosmopolitan plans to test a title aimed at teen-age girls in the fall.
But onlookers say Hearst is still not sufficiently focused on fresh editorial product. One advertising agency media director who works with Hearst and spoke on the condition of anonymity said: "Nothing's really happened since she's gotten there. At Conde Nast, they love to toss the thing around. You get the sense that they're constantly stirring the pot. At Hearst, it still feels status quo."
But John Fennell, the chief operating officer at Hachette Filipacchi, who has worked with several editors who are now at Hearst, said that Ms. Black had stepped into an insider culture. "Hearst used to be a country-club, old-boy environment," Mr. Fennell said. "For Cathie to step in at the level she did and make the changes she did, even if they are not enormous ones, was a dramatic move."
Former Hearst editors say the company's culture is not directed toward creative tinkering. "At Conde Nast, editors are treated like entertainment impresarios. At Hearst, they're expected to put on green eyeshades and sign expense vouchers from the photo department," said Randall Rothenberg, an editor at Wired, which is owned by Conde Nast, and a former executive editor at Esquire, which is owned by Hearst.
But Ms. Black sees no conflict between the bottom line and creativity.
"We have an incredible group of lively, energetic, talented editors here, who break new ground every day," she said.
While the Talk deal is a change of tactics for Hearst, it signals a shift for the magazine industry in general as more companies move toward joint ventures in a publishing economy that feels increasingly unsure. Among other problems, magazine newsstand sales are suffering. And editors worry about consumers who spend more time surfing the World Wide Web than curling up with their favorite magazine, a trend that is ominously called "usage erosion" in the industry. The general interest category that Talk is entering is already crowded, with advertisers increasingly drawn to niche publications.
Perhaps in this tenuous market there is room only for sure things and joint ventures. Later this year, Smart Money will test what could become yet another Hearst joint venture, a magazine aimed at parents concerned with their children's financial futures.
E. Daniel Capell, an authority on magazine circulation and the editor of Capell's Circulation Report, said that joint ventures were very appealing, especially to a company like Hearst.
"Hearst has all these other arms available: subscription fulfillment, distribution, circulation, so that makes it very easy to do joint ventures," he said. "The amount of money required to launch a new magazine is so big and you have so much at risk, that when you can split the risk it makes sense."
But Hearst had time to mull the deal, because the Talk team approached both Time Inc., which is part of Time Warner Inc., and Hachette Filipacchi, a unit of the Lagardere Group, first. Time executives balked because they believed that Ms. Brown had never run a profitable magazine in the United States. At Hachette, executives simply did not want to spend the money.
In an intriguing hint of that much-overused term, synergy, Talk may be able to offer unusual package deals to advertisers, because its other corporate parent is Disney's Miramax. Mr. Galotti has said that advertised products may even get placement in Miramax films. Say, for example, Prada buys 50 pages of ads, does that mean that Gwyneth Paltrow will wear Prada loafers and tote a Prada handbag in a Miramax film?
"We're going to help people market products to consumers whatever way we can," Mr. Galotti said. "If there's an opportunity to work with them that way, then we will do that."
Hearst editors seem to bear no ill will toward the new venture and the $25 million Ms. Black will sink into it.
"We're glad she's made Hearst give her the resources to class up the joint," said one Hearst editor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "And that's part of the reason she wanted Talk. She has realized that there is an upside to pursuing glamorous things. It gets advertisers excited."
In the meantime, advertisers await their invitations to the launch party, the all-important soiree at which guests are plied with cocktails and enjoy solicitous bowing and scraping by the publisher. Will it be held at the Four Seasons? Nobu? Or in London? Will there be many supermodels in attendance? Mr. Galotti said no.
"We'll do something more low key," he said. "How about a cookout?"

HEADLINE: Behind Olivetti's Move: Cellular Explosion

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: ROME, Feb. 28

 BODY:
As any traveler here knows, the tribe of Italians who do not walk around with a cell phone hanging from one ear is quickly facing extinction.
While it is true that roughly 48 percent of Norwegians and Swedes, and fully 58 percent of Finns own them, Scandinavia is only about 20 million people. Italy is more in a league with France and Britain, which have roughly 60 million people each. And among Italians, 36 percent of potential users have wireless phones, compared with 22 percent in Britain and 18.8 percent in France. An even lower portion of Germans -- 17 percent of 80 million -- use them. 
 The likelihood that something like this might happen led Carlo de Benedetti, the chairman of Olivetti S.p.A., the typewriter maker turned computer company, to decide in the 1980's that mobile phones might be what Olivetti needed to replace its ailing computer business.
The shift cost him his job. By 1996, Olivetti had generated so much red ink and debt that its main shareholders -- British and American pension funds -- replaced Mr. de Benedetti with one of his little-known proteges, Roberto Colaninno.
By last year, Olivetti had joined with several big international partners, including Mannesmann A. G. of Germany, Vodafone of Britain and Bell Atlantic of the United States to form a phone business with six million subscribers, making it the No. 2 Italian phone business after the former state phone company, Telecom Italia.
So eyebrows were raised when Mr. Colaninno, 55, announced a week ago that Olivetti would sell its phone business for $8 billion to its phone partner, Mannesmann, then raise $50 billion more through debt and make a $60 billion unsolicited bid for its far bigger rival, Telecom.
"Who are these guys, and can they handle this?" Franco Bernabe, the Telecom chairman, asked about Mr. Colaninno and the investors around him, an associate recalled.
The remark, a tone of wonder mingled with doubt, appeared last week to catch the ambivalent mood of Italians, who seemed captivated by the sheer daring of a minnow seeking to swallow a whale, yet questioned what the bid meant both for Telecom and for Italy's drive to be a more open market.
Olivetti's decision to swallow Telecom, a company five times its size, represents one of the biggest hostile takeover attempts by any company.
"I'm not sure there really is a rational explanation," said an analyst at a large German brokerage firm, who insisted on anonymity. Eighty percent of Olivetti's value was its mobile phone business, he said.
Moreover, Mr. Colaninno's bid, he noted, was "predicated on asset stripping" by selling off Telecom businesses -- possibly including a share in Telecom's mobile phone unit, Telecom Italia Mobile, at a time when the phone business is rapidly shifting from fixed-line to wireless. And the enormous debt would drain Telecom at a time when increased competition was putting intense pressure on phone costs throughout Europe, squeezing industry margins.
Other analysts, however, said the potential for turning Telecom into a leaner, more efficient phone company gave Mr. Colaninno's plan an inner logic.
From an industrial point of view, said Peter Roe, an analyst at Paribas Securities in London, "it makes sense, and you can justify it."
"Telecom has a very strong position in the domestic market and a strong balance sheet," he said. "It's a very significant company in Italy and a large international player as well. So you're going up the size scale very quickly when you take on Telecom Italia."
To be sure, Telecom had floundered since the Italian Government took it public, and successive executives have done little to sort out its tangled problems -- not the least of which is getting its cost structure down by reducing its bloated staffing.
"If you had aspirations to take it, molding it to your image, now is the time to do it," Mr. Roe said.
The problem, of course, was that Telecom shareholders, disgusted with management's dithering, voted last fall to hire Mr. Bernabe, 49, who earned his spurs in the preceding six years reorganizing the former state oil giant, ENI S.p.A., and taking it public. So the question came down to Colaninno versus Bernabe.
Mr. Bernabe lost no time elaborating a turnaround plan, proposing to Telecom's board that he merge it with the profitable mobile phone unit, Telecom Italia Mobile, shed noncore activities like phone equipment manufacturing, and sell minority stakes in foreign phone companies that had no strategic value.
On Thursday, Telecom's board ordered Mr. Bernabe to move ahead, despite Olivetti's hostile bid, and present them with detailed plans.
But Italian securities regulators hampered that effort over the weekend. They had rejected Olivetti's offer, saying it provided insufficient details, but they approved a renewed bid on Saturday.
Under laws enacted in July, companies subject to takeovers are precluded from adopting "poison pill" maneuvers meant to block bids. Only a favorable vote from more than 30 percent of the company's owners at a shareholders meeting can decide otherwise, and analysts said that would be unlikely.
At the same time, Mr. Bernabe is seeking to persuade Italians, generally committed not so much to the quick kill as to finding competitive edge, that Mr. Colaninno's bid, if successful, would fatally weaken Telecom -- and with it, Italy's telecommunications industry.
Meeting with Telecom's union leaders, he cited figures meant as much for Telecom's shareholders as for its employees. If successful, he calculated, Olivetti's leveraged bid would leave Telecom with annual debt service of $2.8 billion.
As if to impress Italian politicians fearful of higher unemployment and their union backers alike, he declared that Telecom, to offset such financial burdens, would be forced to lay off up to 35,000 of its 126,000 employees, beyond the 20,000 to 25,000 he has said must go if Telecom is to be competitive.

This Column Does Not Mention Monica's Dress

BYLINE: By MELINDA HENNEBERGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE irony, said Ken Bode, munching on chips and salsa on an afternoon when he would normally have been at work, was that he had planned to give up his Washington gig anyway.
Commuting here from Evanston, Ill., where he is dean of the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University, to be the host of "Washington Week in Review," meant spending two and a half days a week away from his wife, and he was tired of missing her. When it came time to renegotiate his contract for the PBS program, he said, "I was going to say, 'Let's do this for one last year.' " 
 Now, of course, that won't be necessary. After clashing with a new boss who thought the show's quiet discussions of targeted tax cuts and Kosovo needed a little more edge and attitude, Mr. Bode was pushed out last week and had to tune in from a friend's place and watch his fill-in smile and thank him for his five years of service.
He had wanted to go on one last time and, before saying "So long," get a panel of four Pulitzer Prize winners talking about the nature of punditry, the argument culture and the "TV wasteland."
"I don't make Tom Friedman come on and say what he thinks about Clinton's morals!" Mr. Bode said of the New York Times columnist, one of his regulars. "He talks about the collapse of the Asian economy, and if that's too dull, O.K." Is there really no room for a show that dares to be serious, and seriously unsexy?
The trend toward news reporters, who are supposed to be objective, loudly sharing their opinions all over television has been a concern of Mr. Bode's for years. A decade ago, as a political correspondent for NBC News, he asked his bureau chief to forbid him to go on "The McLaughlin Group" because he did not have the stomach for what he calls "that food fight."
One small comfort is that Mr. Bode (pronounced BO-dee), 59, appears to have beaten back "attitude." For now, he has probably saved the show from such proposed improvements as visiting high school journalists and man-on-the-street interviews. After a week of bad publicity and questions about whether even public television now requires journalists to break chairs over one another's heads, the program's producer, WETA-TV, has made clear it won't be fiddling with the format. WETA even announced that for a few months the host will be Paul Duke, who was moderator for 20 years and makes Mr. Bode look like Geraldo.
Mr. Bode seems hurt, certainly, and a bit at loose ends. After a long lunch, he seems to feel there ought to be some place to hurry off to. But it is also clear that the real compensation for him is that he has a life to go back to.
His friends tell you right off he's not one of these ultra-driven Washington types who thinks a night off television is dead air -- as do, frankly, a couple of his regular guests, who in interviews seemed quite moved by the nobility of their sacrifice in staying off Friday's show.
"He's outstanding, but he also seems normal," said Elizabeth Piersol, Mr. Bode's producer, who was dismissed, apparently for remaining loyal to him. She called him "the person I've worked with with the most integrity," adding, almost by way of explanation, "He doesn't have to live here full-time."
Which is how he wanted it. Ten years ago, in the prime of his career as a national political correspondent, Mr. Bode quit and moved his family to Indiana so he could spend more time with them. At the time, he says, laughing, even they didn't really get it.
"It hit me one day. I was in Boston debating Pat Robertson on journalism ethics and I had to get home because my daughter was giving the commencement address for her sixth-grade class. I called her and told her I'd be there. Then you know how you put the phone down and it rings right away? It was the New York desk saying, 'On Friday I need this piece.' I said, 'I'll do it, but after the commencement.' "
"I knew then," he said, "that my problem was, I've got the best job but I've also got one chance to be a father, and I'm losing it."
Mr. Bode grew up in Hawarden, Iowa, where his family owned a small dairy that went under when milk bottles gave way to cartons. He earned a doctorate in political science from the University of North Carolina and taught at Michigan State and the State University of New York at Binghamton before moving into journalism. Soon after his epiphany in Boston, he returned to academia, to build a broadcast journalism program at DePauw University and to raise his family in Greencastle, Ind.
THEY were not immediately grateful. "I was on a bike ride with my 11-year-old, and she's crying. Finally, she says, 'Dad, I think it's a big comedown to go from being a Washington national correspondent for NBC to teaching where Dan Quayle went to college.' " But she came around, and both daughters ended up loving Indiana, where they collected "19 varsity letters between the two of them," he brags, and he spent evenings in school gyms. Last year, with both girls at Kenyon College, he took the Northwestern job.
Even after the ugliness of the last week, it is hard to feel sorry for Mr. Bode when he talks about how his family reacted. His daughter Matilda, president of her senior class, sent flowers. His daughter Josie, captain of the rugby team, wrote: "Tell me the name of this guy. I've got a bunch of pals."
His wife, Margo, a writer and designer of educational materials for children who are learning disabled, penned a love letter. "She said, 'We are starting another new phase together. Let's have fun.' "

HEADLINE: 10,000 Welfare Recipients Hired by Federal Agencies

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28

 BODY:
Federal agencies have hired more than 10,000 former welfare recipients in the last two years, meeting a goal set by the White House 19 months ahead of schedule, Administration officials said today.
Vice President Al Gore plans to announce the numbers on Monday at a meeting in San Francisco with companies that have hired people off welfare. 
 President Clinton ordered Government agencies to hire welfare recipients in a radio address in March 1997. At the time, Mr. Clinton's goal seemed ambitious because the Government was not hiring many people, and the number of civilian Federal employees was at the lowest level in three decades.
But Mr. Gore will report that the Federal Government has hired 10,187 former welfare recipients since March 1997. The White House had set a goal of hiring 10,000 people from the welfare rolls by the end of the next fiscal year in September 2000.
The Administration has repeatedly prodded private employers to hire welfare recipients. Mr. Gore coordinated Federal hiring efforts, and he says he believes that "the Federal Government should lead by example."
The Commerce Department has hired 3,194 former welfare recipients, or 76 percent of the number it was supposed to hire by the end of the next fiscal year. Some of the new employees are helping the Government prepare for the census next year.
The Defense Department has hired 2,094 people from the welfare rolls, exceeding its quota of 1,600, and the Department of Veterans Affairs has hired 1,323, far above its quota of 800.
But data compiled by the White House show some agencies falling far short of their goals. The State Department, for example, has hired only 56 former welfare recipients, representing 25 percent of its quota of 220 through the year 2000. The Justice Department has hired 245 former welfare recipients, or 54 percent of the 450 it is supposed to hire by September 2000.
The Department of Health and Human Services has met its goal, hiring 300 people who were receiving public assistance. Most of the new employees work outside Washington, in offices and clinics of the Indian Health Service.
The White House itself has hired eight former welfare recipients, two more than it had promised to hire.
Fewer than 8 million Americans are on welfare, the lowest number in decades. The number stood at 14.1 million in January 1993, when Mr. Clinton took office, and has fallen 35 percent since August 1996, when he signed a comprehensive bill overhauling the welfare system and establishing strict work requirements.
The changes in Federal welfare policy come at a time of strong economic growth, when many companies are avidly seeking workers.
A private nonprofit group, the Welfare to Work Partnership, formed in 1997 with support from Democrats and Republicans alike, helps companies hire welfare recipients. Vice President Gore will say the 10,000 companies in the Welfare to Work Partnership have now hired 410,000 welfare recipients.
Eli J. Segal, president of the Welfare to Work Partnership, said companies hiring welfare recipients described them as good, productive employees. "Companies report higher retention rates for welfare recipients than for other newly hired employees," Mr. Segal said.
Employers often provide extra training to welfare recipients, and they have discovered that it is useful to assign a mentor, or job coach, to each person hired off welfare, Mr. Segal said.

HEADLINE: As U.S. Buyers Age, Designers of Autos Make Subtle Shifts

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 28

 BODY:
Engineers at the Lear Corporation, the world's largest independent supplier of automotive interiors, labored for months last year to come up with a vehicle that would meet all the needs of older Americans. The seats swivel out for easy access, the dashboard controls and displays are unusually large and the trunk floor partly rolls out at the back for easy loading.
When the engineers were done, they showed the prototype to the 82-year-old father of the company's chairman -- and were crestfallen at his response. Looking at the swiveling seats in particular, he was dismissive. 
 "He said he didn't need it," said Marilyn Vala, Lear's product analysis manager.
The aging of Americans poses quandaries for businesses in many industries, but few companies face as many difficult decisions as auto makers and their suppliers. Power, sex and youth have long been used to sell cars, so anything that suggests buyers might not be as virile and agile as they were could backfire.
"Baby boomers don't want to admit they're getting older," said John Wolkonowicz, an auto industry consultant at Arthur D. Little. "You can't be too catering to age, you have to do it invisibly -- you have to give people vehicles they can get excited about."
Yet driving or climbing into a car can be difficult and even painful for aging bodies. And with millions of baby boomers now entering their 50's every year, the auto industry is starting to redesign its vehicles to meet the needs of older Americans -- without being obvious about it.
For various reasons, the average age of new-car buyers is rising even faster than that of the overall population. Many older buyers would be better served by vehicles designed differently from vehicles for younger buyers, to reflect the less acute vision and reduced muscular flexibility of bodies that are 50 or older.
Until now, older Americans have shown little interest in buying vehicles tailored to their needs and auto makers have paid fairly little attention to selling such vehicles. Auto makers have long been obsessed with luring young buyers in the hopes that brand loyalties, once formed, will persist over the 10 or 15 new cars a prosperous American might buy over a lifetime. Even car divisions like Buick and Cadillac, which did very well selling to older Americans, have shifted their marketing focus to drivers in their 40's and younger.
"Everyone is always going after the young buyer," said Ben R. Level 3d, the Ford Motor Company's executive director of market research. "You very rarely hear about anyone going after the old buyer -- maybe it's cultural."
But there are signs now that attitudes are beginning to change. The main reason for the subtle shift is the enormous and growing market that older, more affluent Americans represent. As auto makers try to accommodate their needs, however, they are trying to be as subtle as possible.
The result -- new car features that are easy to overlook but reflect a new awareness of older Americans' needs. When the new Chevrolet Impala midsized sedan goes on sale later this year, for example, it will have the ignition on the dashboard rather than the side of the steering column -- a seemingly unimportant choice. But the ignition will be on the dashboard because General Motors found that slightly arthritic hands could turn a key sideways more easily if the wrist were not already bent.
Similarly, the new Ford Focus, which will replace the Ford Escort this year, has front door openings that extend farther forward on the car at knee level, to make it easier for older drivers to swing their legs into the car. The Focus and the new Dodge Neon also have seats that are slightly higher, partly because many older people find it harder to climb in or out of a low vehicle.
Even the new Chevrolet Corvette sports car, long a symbol of youthful virility, has been redesigned to make it easier for aging baby boomers to climb in and out. And the trunk has been enlarged to carry golf clubs.
Auto suppliers say that they are starting to receive many requests from auto makers for parts that are designed for older Americans. "The interest is there now -- why it wasn't there five years ago, I don't know," said Kenneth Way, the chairman and chief executive of Lear.
Lear will display its prototype for an older person's vehicle on Monday, at the opening of the auto parts industry convention here, an event expected to include many products aimed at an aging America. Lear modified a Dodge Caravan minivan to show all the products that could be installed on cars to make them easier for older people to use.
Meanwhile, manufacturers are working on seat belts that are mounted on both sides of each seat and clasp in the front, so that older customers will not have to twist their bodies to find and pull seat belts around and across their bodies. They are designing thicker door handles with more contoured grooves, to make them easier to grip.
DaimlerChrysler and other auto makers are experimenting with prototypes of sedans that would not need side pillars. The rear doors would open backward with hinges at the rear, offering more room to climb into the vehicle and enabling handicapped drivers to readily swing a folded wheel chair in behind the seat.
Dashboards increasingly feature big knobs and large displays. Auto designers say that such details also attract young buyers at a time when other fashions include kitchen tools like ice cream scoops that have big, rubber handles that were originally designed for arthritic hands.
"It's coming from the younger generation, they're showing us that suspenders are O.K., and the little granny glasses," said Jerry Hirshberg, Nissan's president of North American design. "It used to be if there were a lecture with ergonomics in the name, I'd probably skip it, but now it has a zing to it."
Auto designers and consultants say that no single car will include all of the possible devices for older Americans, but many cars will quietly incorporate some features. An old, slightly ageist, adage in the auto industry says that an old man will buy a young man's car, but a young man will not buy an old man's car.
Indeed, Detroit auto makers are leery of catering too heavily to older buyers. They recall the early 1980's, when younger customers defected in droves to foreign auto makers and domestic manufacturers like Chrysler were left with mostly older drivers, said David P. Bostwick, DaimlerChrysler's director of North American corporate market research.
Still, the median age of new-car buyers in the United States has risen to 47 from 40 over the last decade, while the median age of buyers of sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickups has climbed to 43 from 39, according to auto makers' research. Over the same period, the median age of all Americans has only crept up about three years to 34.9.
Americans over 55 make up a fifth of the population but control up to three-quarters of the nation's financial assets, researchers estimate. After a nearly two-decadelong stock market boom, they can afford new cars even though the average price is now around $20,800.
Dr. Harvey Kornblit and his wife, Doris, who are both 71 and live in Houston, just bought a new $30,000 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited with such features as radio controls on the steering wheel, so that they no longer have to lean over to change stations. But the couple chose the vehicle not because of these features but because they liked the solid feel of its exterior, Mrs. Kornblit said.
"What I want is a sturdy body that's metal, not plastic," she said.
Late-model used cars have become popular as substitutes for smaller, similarly priced new cars, but mainly among younger buyers.
Some of the ideas now being considered to accommodate older drivers have been tried and abandoned before. The Chrysler Corporation, for example, offered swiveling seats in the late 1950's, although they were not powered and were marketed to women leery of clambering into cars while wearing tight skirts.
Gerry T. Piaskowski, DaimlerChrysler's director of passenger car and minivan interior design, said that the company would take another look at swiveling seats. "Sometimes old ideas," he said, "are good ideas."

HEADLINE: Argentine President Admits Interest in 3d Term

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Feb. 27

 BODY:
Seven months after he announced that he was leaving office, President Carlos Saul Menem says he will run for re-election if his supporters can legally overturn a constitutional ban prohibiting a third consecutive term.
Mr. Menem's aides say that he is convinced that the country needs him in office to resist the financial contagion spreading from neighboring Brazil and that he is committed to negotiating a treaty with the United States during the next few years that would replace the peso with the dollar as Argentina's currency. 
 "If there's a possibility of running in the primaries, I'll do it," Mr. Menem said in a radio interview on Friday.
Mr. Menem remains far behind in the polls, and, with the ruling Justicialist Party's primary vote due in May or June and the general election scheduled for October, he may be running out of time. But since he was first elected as a dark-horse candidate in 1989, he has repeatedly surprised analysts with his political resourcefulness and cunning.
After Brazil's problems accelerated with its Jan. 13 devaluation, Mr. Menem's standing in opinion polls improved somewhat. He is generally credited with ending Argentina's long history of hyperinflation by pegging the peso's value one-to-one to the dollar in 1991.
The Argentine Constitution prohibits three consecutive presidential terms. A 1995 amendment specifically barred Mr. Menem from a third term, since the Constitution was written after he was already in his first term. Mr. Menem's supporters are appealing to the Supreme Court to strike that amendment.
Many analysts say the case will be a test of the independence of the judiciary. Over the years, court rulings have favored Mr. Menem. But since he announced he would step down, the courts have shown increasing independence.
Mr. Menem's aides said he could run in the primary while waiting for the Supreme Court to make a ruling. They said Carlos Reutemann, a Senator from Santa Fe Province, could run as Mr. Menem's Vice President.
Mr. Menem is a bitter enemy of Eduardo Duhalde, the Buenos Aires Governor and current leading Justicialist candidate for President. Analysts say that Mr. Menem's campaign may be intended as much to deny Mr. Duhalde the opportunity to lead their party as it is to win a shot at the Buenos Aires Mayor, Fernando de la Rua, who is the Alianza presidential candidate.
The former president, Raul Alfonsin, a leader of the Alianza opposition coalition, said Congress should consider impeaching Mr. Menem for attempting to subvert the Constitution. He said Mr. Menem was acting strangely due to a "strange psychological state." Mr. Menem responded angrily, saying no one should listen to Mr. Alfonsin because "he couldn't govern the country."
Mr. Menem announced that he was not running for re-election last July to save his party from bitter division. He met privately with Mr. Duhalde today to try to keep the party united.

HEADLINE: As Albright Arrives in China, Congress Is Watching Closely

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Feb. 28

 BODY:
Every time a Secretary of State comes to China, Congress watches closely. And perhaps no more so than on a brief visit this week by Madeleine K. Albright, who arrived here this evening.
Hours before she left, the Senate passed a unanimous resolution calling on the Clinton Administration to condemn China's human rights policy at the meeting next month of the United Nations human rights commission in Geneva. 
 While she was en route, the State Department released its annual human rights report, chastising China for regression on the matter and expressing disappointment that it had not delivered on the improvement in human rights it had promised.
On board her plane, her spokesman, James P. Rubin, described as deplorable the detention of one dissident and the 18-month sentence given another in the last two days by the Chinese authorities.
The Administration has prided itself on broadening its China policy in the last several years from being focused on just human rights to encompassing other issues, including trade and developing what the Administration dubbed a "strategic partnership."
But with the budding relationship with China in retreat, Ms. Albright will touch on a host of problems that enrage the Chinese, from a proposal for a theater missile defense system in Asia to the cancellation of the sale of an American satellite to a company with ties to the Chinese military.
Ms. Albright will also grill the Chinese on why they cannot help out more in controlling nuclear developments in North Korea, and gauge their readiness to join the World Trade Organization, Administration officials say.
The officials, insisting on anonymity, declined to put an order of priority on the long list of problems that the Chinese would raise with Ms. Albright or that she would put to them. But one of her tasks, Mr. Rubin said, will be to "tell it like it is" about Washington's expectations on human rights.
At the same time, Mr. Rubin and other Administration officials who have prepared Ms. Albright for this trip said they were uneasy with the approach of many in Congress who believe that sponsoring a resolution against the Chinese in Geneva is the best policy.
Administration officials have argued in recent weeks that a resolution against China may make members of Congress feel good but does not necessarily reap results.
China objects to the resolution as an infringement of its sovereignty. It sounded a similar tone in its official response to the State Department human rights report, expressing indignation and resentment at what it termed American meddling in China's internal affairs.
In recent months, Chinese officials have argued that because of the nation's mounting economic problems and unprecedented numbers of unemployed, they cannot allow political dissent from the ruling Communist Party. The Government has expressed concern about the potential of sudden widespread social instability, particularly in the 50th anniversary year of the Communist takeover of China and the 10th anniversary of the student protests and deaths in Tiananmen Square.
Ms. Albright's talks could serve to assess how the Chinese would react if Washington went ahead with a resolution in Geneva in late March. The problem is made even more vexing because the Chinese Prime Minister, Zhu Rongji, is due in Washington for an official visit on April 8.
Last year, for the first time since 1991, Washington did not introduce a resolution against China in Geneva, saying China had made some progress in human rights. The Chinese would see any American move toward a resolution this year as a sharp deterioration in their relationship with the United States.
But with three democracy activists jailed late last year for 11 to 13 years and deepening pressure from Congress to take a stand in Geneva, the Administration must decide soon what to do.
The Hong Kong office of the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said tonight that organizers of a planned seminar on human rights in Wuhan this weekend had been detained.
On Friday, Wu Yilong, the founder of a banned political party, was detained in Hangzhou for questioning, and Peng Ming, a liberal intellectual who had tried to run an independent discussion forum in Beijing, was sentenced without trial to 18 months in a labor camp.

HEADLINE: Essay;
Taxpayers: Revolt!

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A half-century ago, government at all levels controlled a fourth of our economy. Today it's up to a third; this is the wrong direction.
This year's rough handling of tax relief was best analyzed by an economist-humorist: 
 "Unless something is done -- and soon," writes Dave Barry, "to relieve the massive buildup of excess tax receipts, the Treasury Building will explode and release its contents into the atmosphere, forming an immense cloud of money. . . . If the wind were to shift, the money could fall back to Earth, where some of it could, conceivably, wind up -- this is referred to in top-secret government documents as 'The Doomsday Scenario' -- back in the hands of taxpayers."
With the Government awash in the profits of prosperity, why has there been no taxpayers' revolt -- no demand that a chunk of today's surplus be left in the pocket of its source?
One reason is that maintaining today's high rate of taxation is being falsely sold as "saving Social Security" -- as if we were squirreling away the decades of anticipated surplus for the boomers' rainy day. But that trust fund is always on loan to the Treasury; it's a pocket-switching business that does not deal with real reform, which would be to raise the next generation's retirement age.
Another reason for the unrevolt is that much of the suddenly discovered bonanza in Rosy Scenario's "projected surplus" could be used to reduce the national debt. Conservatives like that; it means that when massive Treasury borrowing is needed to send out checks to boomer-geezers, interest rates would probably be lower.
So let's deal with reality. If two-thirds of the surplus is earmarked for debt payment, what sort of tax cut is likely? President Clinton would veto a one-size-fits-all 10 percent rate cut, while his array of tailored loopholes would not be passed.
1. A partial fix of the marriage penalty. Social conservatives argue rightly that government should not discourage marriage. Today, two people making $100,000 each have to pay up to an additional $10,000 a year just to have children in wedlock. That's anti-family and it's time to stop it.
2. An equal reduction of everybody's rates, shaving only a couple of percentage points off the fortyish top rate. This is part of what economic conservatives urge to keep the boom booming. If it benefits the top third most, that's because the top third pays most of the taxes and would use that money most productively -- saving, buying, investing, employing. That system has left the redistributive world far behind.
3. Some progress on "death to the death tax." By confiscating 55 percent of your savings beyond a certain amount when you die, the Government punishes you for saving for your children. Tax policy now says: You can't take it with you and you can't leave it behind, so spend it. But most Americans, and not just richies, think that you should be able to leave most of what you save to your kids. A reduction of the estate tax to the percentage of the top income rate is considered fair.
Such a package of tax cuts might be difficult to vote against. Vice President Al Gore would think twice before opposing it. It does not have the sweeping benefit of the historic 1986 reforms, but today's Senate Finance Committee does not have Bob Packwood and Bill Bradley to conceive a daringly simple and fair plan and to build a surprise coalition.
Presented with such a modest but sensible package worked out in the Congress, what would Clinton do? My guess is that he would declare victory on "preserving the surplus" and averting the full 10 percent across-the-board rate cut, scrap his unsalable retirement entitlement and cut a deal on the sartorial tax reductions.
The anticipated Clinton price for tax cuts: Let's take a $200 billion slice of our projected pie in the sky, and let me plan to spend half on education while you spend half on defense.
Would Democrats in Congress go along with this sort of a tax-budget deal? The education lobby would like it; California could use the anti-missile money; some creative credit could be found to pay off contingency-fee lawyers.
There; that would comfort the overburdened taxpayer. Let's keep moving on.

HEADLINE: German Leader Is Popular, but Grip Seems Unsure

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: BERLIN, Feb. 28

 BODY:
There he was last week, the German Chancellor, no less, on a television talk show being asked if he would submit to a test that would determine if the color of his abundant dark brown hair was real. Yes, Gerhard Schroder said with a coy grin, "This is all genuine, really everything."
It was a moment that captured the extent of Germany's transformation during the four-month rule of the 54-year-old Mr. Schroder. His predecessor, Helmut Kohl, rarely appeared on talk shows, let alone to talk about his (gray) hair. Mr. Schroder, a white-toothed modern image merchant, has popularized the exercise of power. 
 Germans tend to like the change: Mr. Schroder's personal popularity remains high. But has Germany's first Social Democratic Chancellor in 16 years also trivialized governance, to the point where Europe's most powerful country is sublimely coiffed at the top but rudderless?
Abrupt policy shifts on immigration and nuclear power, discordant ministerial voices, rising unemployment, signs of recession and messy decision-making by committee have all raised sharp questions about Mr. Schroder. "Where is the line?" the conservative weekly Die Zeit asked. The centrist Berlin Tagespiegel was blunter last week, alluding to "lunatic amateurism."
Bodo Hombach, the Chancellor's chief of staff, said in an interview that the Government needed time. "In many ways we are a blocked society, but you cannot push things through here over the objections of others," he said. "Action by consensus is an old German tradition, and we will build the necessary bridges."
But time seems short. Uncertain government matters less when an economy is strong and a country's self-image stable. But Germany's combination of stalled growth, an aging population, disappearing jobs, uneasy relations between its eastern and western regions, charged politics of immigration and a continuing quest for a "normal" identity appears treacherous.
The euro, Europe's infant common currency, has fallen 7 percent against the dollar in a month as Germany's Economics Minister has done something long unthinkable: he has bickered with central bankers. The German economy shrank 0.4 percent in the last quarter of l998, a grim sign when unemployment under Mr. Schroder, far from falling by one million as he promised, has already surged to 11.5 percent, from 10.9 percent.
On the international front, Germany's relations with its European allies and with the United States are in the midst of a difficult adjustment reflecting the arrival in power of a new, more assertive postwar German generation.
Jean Glavany, the French Agricultural Minister, expressed his country's dismay by declaring last week that Mr. Schroder's demands for a cut in Germany's huge contribution to the European Union budget reminded him of Margaret Thatcher.
From a Gallic source, such criticism suggests that the French-German alliance, long at the heart of European integration, is in trouble -- or at the very least in flux.
Elected on a largely domestic agenda, Mr. Schroder has found himself thrust abruptly into difficult international issues -- among them reform of the European Union budget and NATO -- for which his Government has sometimes appeared poorly prepared.
"The allies are somewhat flabbergasted," said Joachim Krauze, deputy director of the German Society for Foreign Affairs. "Germany demanding its interests in an assertive way, Germany no longer viewing the independence of the European central bank as sacrosanct. It's worrying and I don't think it's productive."
But perhaps it is what most Germans want. Although opinion polls have recently shown that Mr. Schroder's coalition of Social Democrats and environmentalist Greens would be defeated if a new election were held today, the Chancellor's own popularity was estimated at more than 70 percent this month by Der Spiegel.
It seems clear that the Chancellor's glad-handing style, his informality, his preference for talking about the future rather than the trauma of Germany's past, his popular touch, even his readiness to talk hair have struck a chord with a generation of Germans tired of Mr. Kohl's history lessons.
"Mr. Schroder has understood that people want to be left in peace," said Bernhard Schlink, the novelist. "What we have is a generation of nice passive consumers who are busy in a nice passive way. Why should they bother about big ideas, projects, goals and ambitions?"
The fact is, though, that Germany does appear to have to resolve some basic problems in order to move forward.
One is whether this is "a country of immigration," as Mr. Schroder's coalition initially proposed. Another linked question is whether Germany's vaunted "social market" economy, built on consensus between unions and employers and on extensive social insurance, has stalled irrevocably. If it has, immigration could clearly become an explosive question. No sinking economy embraces foreigners.
Last week, Mr. Schroder was obliged to reverse course on a major element of his proposal to make German citizenship easier to acquire for the country's 7.3 million foreigners.
Faced by a petition that had already gathered one million signatures against his plans, and by a defeat this month to Christian Democrats in a state election in Hesse, he dropped a proposal that dual citizenship be permitted.
The proposal was important because many of Germany's more than two million Turks are reluctant to give up Turkish citizenship (that alone confers the right to buy land in Turkey) although they want to become Germans, and have, for instance, the right to vote in all elections. But the Chancellor perceived -- albeit belatedly -- that his entire immigration revision, aimed at changing a 1913 citizenship law based largely on blood lines, would collapse if this measure was not abandoned.
Once again, as in his earlier reversal on banning the export of nuclear waste, he appeared to have been carelessly drawn into an untenable position by his Green coalition partners. "We underestimated the reaction on dual citizenship, but we will still get a new immigration law that will critically redefine German identity," said Karsten Voigt, a Social Democratic Foreign Ministry official. "That is the main thing."
But Mr. Schroder seems certain to face a battle even on the rest of his proposed law allowing foreigners to request citizenship after eight years of residence -- instead of 15 -- and granting automatic citizenship to children born here who have at least one parent who has lived in Germany since the age of 14.
The fact is that the immigration issue has become steadily more sensitive as Mr. Schroder has so far failed in his central electoral pledge: to reduce the number of unemployed by at least one million people.
In fact, unemployment lines have lengthened by more than 500,000 people in just four months.
If the Chancellor has a discernible passion -- rather than issues that are merely material for image management -- it is putting Germans back to work.
Characteristically, Mr. Schroder, who likes to moderate quietly between opposing factions rather than lead from the front, has asked Mr. Hombach to take the initiative at the head of a so-called Alliance for Jobs. This group of labor unions and employers is reviewing issues including taxation, social security, working hours, pensions, wages, training and education.
Call it German consensus-making writ large. It is unwieldy, slow, and just possibly productive. A lot of people seem to agree on the basic problem: the German labor market is too regulated and too weighed down with high social security charges to generate jobs. But, as Mr. Hombach said, "To get from knowledge to action in this society is extremely difficult."
According to Mr. Hombach, about $350 billion is earned annually in the German black economy. "We probably have four times more worker hours in this black economy than we need to get rid of unemployment completely. So the problem is clear: how do you get this labor out from under?"
The answer, he said, was clear enough: bring down the taxes and charges on legal salaries that make people prefer the combination of off-the-books wages and unemployment benefits to a regular job.
But that, of course, might eventually imply a partial dismantling of the health and other insurance benefits enjoyed by Germans (and immigrants) -- an explosive suggestion.
Germany still seems very far from agreement on reform. Indeed a wage rise of 4 percent (with inflation at close to zero) won this month by the huge I.G. Metall engineering union -- which sets the bar for all other unions -- had many businessmen in a fury.
It is clear that Mr. Schroder is tempted to emulate Tony Blair of Britain. But Mr. Blair, of course, could build on what Mrs. Thatcher had already done. The Chancellor, by contrast, has everything to do and a divided Social Democratic Party to deal with, in which resistance to market reform remains strong.
The figurehead for that resistance is Oskar Lafontaine, the Economics Minister and party chairman. He and the European central bank governor, Wim Duisenberg of Holland, have been engaged in extraordinary low-level warfare as Mr. Lafontaine suggests lower interest rates are really the answer to Germany's -- and Europe's -- problems.
Last week Mr. Duisenberg said that he had never read the book on economics written recently by Mr. Lafontaine and his wife, and that he had "absolutely no intention" of doing so.
As in many of his Government's tiffs and travails, Mr. Schroder has not intervened decisively, leaving the impression that Germany is ready to abandon its long sacrosanct monetary orthodoxy in pursuit of murky new goals.
"Basic decisions have been left untaken, basic lines left unclear," said Mr. Krauze, the foreign policy expert. "A lot of time has been lost on issues that are basically luxuries -- like giving up nuclear power. We need direction."
Mr. Schroder has promised to provide it soon, speaking of "technical problems" in the first months. He leads a coalition made up of a party that has not been in power for almost a generation and another that has never been in power. Teething problems were probably inevitable. But further drift looks dangerous.
"We will get there," Mr. Hombach said, "and with a style that is less encrusted, more relaxed, more open, more frank."

HEADLINE: For Women in Medicine, a Road to Compromise, Not Perks

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
By all rights, this should be the perfect time to be a woman in medicine.
The days of women toiling as a mostly unwelcome presence in the country's medical schools are long over: women now account for roughly 45 percent of all medical students, up from about 25 percent in 1980. 
 And once they graduate, they are in high demand: many patients, especially women, now request female doctors because, among other reasons, they are perceived as spending more time with patients. Further, women's health issues -- breast and ovarian cancer most prominently -- are front and center in medical research and political agendas, fostering star-studded fund-raisers, road races and the like in every major city in the country.
But despite these gains, the top tiers of medicine have remained inaccessible to many women, largely, experts say, because they are unwilling or unable to find a balance between the years of study those specialties require and a life outside of medicine.
"Basically, the picture is bad," said Dr. Wendy Chavkin, editor of the Journal of the American Medical Women's Association. "Women comprise very few dean and tenured faculty positions, and there are a lack of them in surgical specialties." The main reason, Dr. Chavkin said, is that in medicine, "there are still issues about career pathways that are the least bit off track, like taking time off for child rearing."
But rather than giving up their medical careers for their families, as so many of their predecessors felt forced to do, or forgoing motherhood altogether, more female doctors today are finding ways to practice medicine part time -- as some women in law, journalism, finance and other demanding fields have been doing for years.
They are joining multi-physician practices, or working as employees for practices run by managed-care companies that give them a chance for an office life that is closer to 9 to 5, willingly sacrificing higher salaries for a flexibility that until recently was virtually unheard of in medicine.
In a recent study, the Commonwealth Fund, a large private philanthropic and research organization in New York, found that 25 percent of female doctors who were surveyed said that they worked fewer than 40 hours a week, compared with 12 percent of male doctors. And 17 percent of female doctors said they worked 30 hours a week or fewer, compared with only 8 percent of males.
In New York State, the trend of women working fewer hours is borne out most dramatically among younger doctors. Over all, female doctors work 9 percent fewer hours than male doctors. But among female doctors under 45, the number jumps to 15 percent, said Edward Salsberg, director of the Center for Health Workforce Studies at the State University of New York at Albany.
"The emergence of managed care has introduced the idea that you can be an employee," said Dr. Erica Frank, an assistant professor at the Emory School of Medicine in Atlanta, and the principal investigator of the Women Physicians' Health Study, the largest national study of female doctors.
"This can mean more flexible hours and fewer of them, and the ability to think about medicine as a profession that doesn't require complete consumption," Dr. Frank said. "And clearly women are leading the way. The pay is lower. But this might be acceptable to some people to have more of a life."
Dr. Rayze Simonson works as an obstetrician in a six-person practice on the Upper West Side. The practice is run by St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, which takes care of administrative tasks like billings, relieving the doctors -- five of whom are women with children -- and of some of the time-consuming hassles of running a medical office.
"The idea was that in a larger group you could balance more your life and career," Dr. Simonson said. "We are only on call every sixth night and every sixth weekend, which in ob-gyn is huge flexibility." Her husband is a journalist, and they rely heavily on a baby sitter.
 
Accepting Less In Pay and Prestige
Yet while this kind of work has become a welcome option for some doctors looking for more balanced lives, experts say that it has created an increasing "pink-collar" level of medicine -- in which more women are concentrated in the lowest-paying, least prestigious specialties.
Indeed, while the number of women practicing medicine has more than tripled in the last 20 years, female doctors still earn roughly two-thirds of their male counterparts' salaries, largely because they work fewer hours a week and because there are far fewer of them in the most prestigious and highest-paid specialties.
Of the 34,882 female residents in the country in 1997, one-tenth of one percent were in the surgical subspecialties. Or, looked at another way, of all residents studying surgical specialties, only 17.2 percent of them were women.
And while the average male doctor in private practice in the United States makes $273,690 a year, his female counterpart makes $155,590 on average, according to Medical Economics, a trade journal. Further, 50 percent of female doctors surveyed by the Commonwealth Fund reported incomes of $100,000 or less, compared with 22 percent of men.
Although health experts, including many women, said there was still sexism in medicine, particularly in the top echelons of academia, they cited the difficulty in combining a demanding profession with a family life as the biggest hindrance most female doctors faced in rising higher in their fields.
"I think a lot of male doctors still have housewives at home," said Dr. Simonson, who has four children, one of them a newborn. "They can stay at work until 10 P.M., and when they get home, their kids are bathed and there is food in the house."
"I just don't have the luxury of staying at work late," she added, saying that means a lower income.
 
Obstacles for Women May Also Hurt Field
Outside of the financial penalties for women, there may be a loss to medicine generally when they are withheld from its top ranks.
"The gains of women help to contribute to an ongoing focus on women's health," said Dr. Karen Scott Collins, a vice president of the Commonwealth Fund. "What they bring is additional important concerns. For example, there is more focus on domestic violence as a medical problem, a lot of attention to counseling for menopause, a focus on reproductive health and so on."
Women in other high-intensity fields face similar challenges although medicine presents conflicts for women that appear more intractable, experts said.
There are years of study and grueling hospital training programs, followed by demanding schedules and unpredictable patients. And unlike, say, investment banking, there are constant critical advances in medicine: stay out of the field for two years to raise children, and one would miss out on entire bodies of research and treatment developments vital to patients' health.
As a result, many women are attracted to pediatrics and primary care "simply because there is not as much training," said Dr. Holly Andersen, a 36-year-old cardiologist on the Upper East Side, especially since most of that training coincides with a woman's prime child-bearing years.
"Why do men care about this?" she said. "They can always marry 25-year-olds."
Dr. Gail Bauchman got her first taste of compromise in medical school in the 1980's. Although her dream had been to specialize in obstetrics, she felt that she would have a hard time managing a family life while tending to patients in labor on weekends and in the middle of the night. So she chose family medicine instead, and built a bustling private practice on the Upper West Side.
At 36, she decided to try to get pregnant. "I realized it was now or never," she said. But after she gave birth to twins, Avital and Natalia, in August 1997, compromises turned to disappointments.
She tried to return to her full-time practice, but found life unmanageable. So she looked for a part-time position. "Most practices said, 'You work full time or you don't work here,' " Dr. Bauchman said.
Her solution was to take a part-time job at the Mount Sinai Adolescent Health Center, for a fraction of her earnings as a private practice doctor. She said the situation works for her, but was hardly what she had hoped for.
"There is this problem with finding the middle ground," Dr. Bauchman said. "I shouldn't be struggling to find part-time work. And if these practices close their doors to part timers, they don't have the benefit of having a female doctor, and therefore you lose patients, because patients say that they want that."
 
Growing Demand For Personal Approach
Even while they are earning less on average, female physicians are more in demand than ever, experts say, particularly in specialties that cater to female patients.
Dr. Alison Estabrook, a prominent breast surgeon and associate director of the breast center at St. Luke's, remembers sitting around her family's kitchen table just a decade ago, listening to her mother's friend say that she would never let a female surgeon touch her.
Today, a female breast surgeon can "basically write her own ticket," Dr. Estabrook said. "As more women patients are seeking power in their own care they are attracted to strong women doctors," she said.
Dr. Estabrook concedes that part of the market value of female surgeons is based on supply and demand, because far fewer women than men are willing to devote their lives to surgery. "Surgery creates tremendous conflicts," said Dr. Estabrook, who is 47 and married to another doctor. She deliberately chose not have children, she says, because she could not imagine where she could trim her professional day.
The demand for female doctors is not limited to specialties that serve women, hospital administrators say. "The minute we put a female physician in a practice," said Dr. Myron L. Weisfeldt, chairman of medicine at New York Presbyterian Hospital, "the appointment book becomes fully booked.
"It is not only women who appreciate these physicians," Dr. Weisfeldt added. "I think it deals with professional attitudes." He said that studies have shown that women tend to spend more time with patients and to focus on them as people rather than on the procedures they need.
 
With Children, Going Part Time
Some women find that when they become mothers, they need to scale back or forgo jobs with prestigious academic medical centers, and instead choose work in large practices, often ones that serve a high H.M.O. base.
Dr. Genevieve Lambert worked for eight years at the Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center, mostly in the Pediatric H.I.V. unit. After giving birth to each of her two children, she cut back one work day. As she awaits her third, she has given up her career at the hospital altogether to loosen her schedule and has joined a private practice on Long Island where she works two and a half days a week and is paid per diem.
"At least half of my female friends from medical school are working part time now," said Dr. Lambert, who is 41. The women, she said, are generally not doing this willingly, but because society as a whole still makes child rearing primarily a mother's responsibility.
"Medicine is fairly egalitarian in that a woman who chooses to rise to the top of medicine can do so now," she said. "The issue of how to bring women to parity with men in the workplace is finding ways to relieve women as primary care givers to children."
Dr. Andersen, who was chief medical resident at Cornell in 1994-95 and is now one of only a handful of female cardiologists in Manhattan, said she is beginning to appreciate the conflicts she will face if she chooses to have a family.
"Being a woman in medicine, there are not that many paradigms we can look to and say, 'This is how they did it, this is the way I can do it, too,' " Dr. Andersen said. "You have to work on it yourself."

HEADLINE: State Will Transfer Control Of Armory on Park Avenue

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB 

 BODY:
In a major move to halt the deterioration of the landmark Seventh Regiment Armory on Park Avenue, the Pataki administration has decided to transfer control of the building and oversight over the cultural and art shows held there to a private company or a nonprofit organization.
State officials said the transfer would end control of the armory by an obscure state military agency that critics say has long neglected vital repairs. Last March, The New York Times reported that collapsing ceilings, leaky walls and crumbling masonry were endangering parts of the 19th-century building's ornate rooms and a multimillion-dollar collection of American paintings, decorative arts and military artifacts. 
 "Someone has to do something quickly to save this building," said Charles A. Gargano, an economic adviser to Gov. George E. Pataki who is in charge of forming a rescue plan for the armory.
Mr. Gargano is chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, the unit that offers loans and technical assistance to rehabilitate civic projects. He said that a preliminary study indicated that $50 million might be needed for making long-term repairs and adding air-conditioning to the building.
Mr. Gargano said he doubted the state would finance a large part of the repair work, and added that the money would have to be raised mainly by the organization that assumes management control. The funds, he said, could be obtained by raising rental fees for art and antiques shows and by using the armory for concerts and plays year-round. Because it is not air-conditioned, the five-story crenelated building is largely unused in the summer.
In addition to housing a rare collection of Civil War art and military memorabilia, the building is New York City's premier showcase for internationally renowned art, antique and craft shows.
The agency that runs the armory, the Division of Military and Naval Affairs, has long said that it lacked the funds to operate the building. But critics assert that the division ignored maintenance for decades, failed to seek renovation appropriations from the Legislature and without competitive bidding, leased space at bargain rates to a select group of producers who reap huge profits from art fairs and exhibitions in the armory.
Last year the state obtained $1.9 million from rents at the armory, while the division spent $693,000 on repairs and operation costs. The rest went to the state's general fund.
Mr. Gargano said that the state would hire a consulting company this month to help negotiate terms with organizations that submit proposals to operate the armory, which covers the block between East 66th and East 67th Streets and Park and Lexington Avenues.
He said the state expects to turn over full administration of the building next year.
"We want a practical business plan from the private sector that can generate the funds needed to rescue this priceless treasure and to maintain it as a cultural and art center," Mr. Gargano said.
Later this year, he added, the Empire State Corporation will take control of the building from the military division and supervise it until another organization is in place. The military division oversees the state's National Guard units, and under Mr. Gargano's plan, the Guard will continue to use offices in the building for administrative purposes.
Asked if the Pataki administration was displeased with the military division's administration of the armory, Mr. Gargano said, "I won't characterize their management, but I am unhappy with the condition of the building."
Scott Sandman, a spokesman for the division, said its officials had no objections to surrendering control. "A situation as unique and complex as this requires a creative, forward-thinking solution," he said.
Mr. Sandman said the division spent $415,000 last year for renovations, mainly to repair leaks on the building's south side. Water damage and safety concerns forced the closing of two rooms and the removal of dozens of paintings from public view.
Members of a nonprofit organization, the Seventh Regiment Conservancy, said their group would make a bid to run the armory. "Our vision is to turn the building into a venue for performing and visual arts," said Wade F. B. Thompson, the conservancy's chairman. Mr. Thompson is a trustee of the Municipal Art Society, a private group dedicated to maintaining the city's architectural heritage.
A takeover by a private or nonprofit entity, however, could be complicated by a court dispute between the state and a veterans' group, the Seventh Regiment Fund, over ownership of the armory's art collection, which includes a prized Thomas Nast canvas of the regiment leaving the city for battle at the start of the Civil War in 1861.
"This is not the state's building to give away," said Kenyon B. FitzGerald Jr., the fund's president. "They only have the right to administer it as long as it is a state military facility."
Mr. FitzGerald said the fund wants a military museum established in the armory as well as cultural exhibits.
"But we are glad that the military affairs division is being removed," he added, "It was at the low end of the state's food chain and would never be given the money necessary to restore and preserve this landmark."
The armory opened in 1870 after being built on city-owned land with private funds raised by the Seventh Regiment, a state militia unit that no longer exists. In 1942, the National Guard took over the management and maintenance of the building from the city. The state has said the building's artwork was donated to the people of New York, not the veterans' group.
Besides providing office space for the National Guard, the armory houses 100 homeless women in a shelter run for the city by the Lenox Hill Neighborhood House, a nonprofit, and is used for meetings by the Knickerbocker Greys, a military youth corps, and by veterans' groups.
A privately run restaurant, the Seventh Regiment Mess, occupies the fourth floor. Mr. Gargano said it was unclear whether the new managers would have to keep the shelter, the youth corps and the restaurant.
"We are, in effect, taking the first step to privatize this building," Mr. Gargano explained. "Within a year or so we hope to have it completed."

Cars, Sex and Stocks On One Web Site

BYLINE: By LISA NAPOLI 

 BODY:
For some people, few things are as sexy as a new Internet stock. At least that's the assumption of Joseph Preston, a 28-year-old entrepreneur in Bethesda, Md. Mr. Preston plans to file documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission today stating his intention to raise $7.5 million in a stock offering for Efox.net.
The business, he said in an interview, will be an electronic-commerce Web site that focuses on "the heterosexual man's favorite pursuits: ladies, automobiles, sports, and stocks." He said the women who pose provocatively for his site -- the "eye candy," he calls them -- will each be paid with 500 shares of Efox.net stock. 
 Of course, in this realm, air-brushed surfaces can be deceiving. The company is only a month old and its Web site right now is little more than a come-hither home page. To date, Mr. Preston has raised only about $100,000 for the operation from private investors. And he plans to dispense with the usual step of finding an investment banker by underwriting the stock issue himself.
In a market where companies raise millions and millions with decidedly less sexy topics like books, Internet broadcasting and on-line access, Mr. Preston's venture raises the question: Why hasn't anyone yet married Internet sex and the stock market?
Sex, as a business proposition, does not necessarily magnetize the average investment banker, said Mark Hardie, senior analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., who is skeptical about Mr. Preston's plan.
Adult-themed sites are among the few that actually make money on the Internet. But they are risky business as far as the financial community is concerned.
"Going public is about convincing a host of risk-averse financial service firms who manage the assets of retirees to plunk down tens of millions of dollars on a porn business," Mr. Hardie said. LISA NAPOLI

HEADLINE: Former Military Ruler Wins Nigerian Presidential Vote

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

DATELINE: LAGOS, Nigeria, Feb. 28

 BODY:
Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, a former military ruler who campaigned as the only man capable of holding together this vibrant and fractious country, today scored an overwhelming victory to become the first elected president here in 16 years.
His challenger, Olu Falae, a former finance minister, immediately disputed the fairness of the vote, held on Saturday after years of promises by military dictators to move Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa, toward democracy. 
 It was not clear tonight, however, whether Mr. Falae would formally contest the results, particularly since they showed him trailing by almost seven million votes, with the margin widening in General Obasanjo's favor as more returns came in.
"I said if General Obasanjo won a free and fair election I would congratulate him but clearly this is not a free and fair election," Mr. Falae told journalists before leaving for the capital, Abuja.
A victory for General Obasanjo would cap a tumultuous period in the history of Nigeria, ruled until last June by a callous dictatorship that had turned the country, the world's sixth-largest oil producer and the biggest military power in West Africa, into an international pariah.
It would also be the culmination of an extraordinary personal journey for General Obasanjo, who was released from prison just eight months ago after serving three years for criticizing the military rule.
Tonight, an anxious nation waited for officials to formally declare the winner of the election that many hoped would fulfill the promise of a nation whose seemingly boundless potential has been squandered by years of misrule.
General Obasanjo had yet to make any public statement, apparently waiting for election authorities to give him the official nod.
Before that announcement, reaction to the results was muted in a nation that has often seen its democratic aspirations thwarted.
International election monitors said supporters for both candidates had committed fraud in some areas of the country.
But they said the cheating did not appear significant enough to affect the election's outcome, given the wide margin of General Obasanjo's victory.
Official results tonight showed that the retired general had garnered 62 percent of the votes, compared with 38 percent for his opponent, from 33 out of 36 states, plus the federal capital.
Election officials are scheduled to announce final results on Monday, when they are also to formally declare the winner.
Former President Jimmy Carter, who led a team of American election monitors, praised the current military government's commitment to the transition to civilian rule and the conduct of officials at the Independent National Election Commission, which oversaw the vote.
The Carter Center and the National Democratic Institute, present with the assent of the Nigerian Government, said in a report on the elections that there was "no evidence indicating that electoral abuses would have affected the overall outcome of the election."
"There has not been a pattern of nationwide fraud or irregularities," Mr. Carter said in an interview.
But he said that monitors had observed fraud and irregularities in a number of states, including ballot boxes that were stuffed, vote tallies that were inflated and results that were manipulated.
Clement Nwankwo, the chairman of the Transition Monitoring Group, an umbrella organization of Nigerian organizations that dispatched thousands of observers on Saturday, said General Obasanjo would have to win over the public, because the irregularities had been serious enough.
"The winner must immediately embark on popular measures to deal with the severe economic problems of this country and build popular support for himself," Mr. Nwankwo said.
If Mr. Falae contests the results, he will have to appeal his case to a tribunal, which can decide to hold elections again in certain areas or throughout the country. The new President is scheduled to take office on May 29.
Most significant for General Obasanjo might be the effect of a challenge by Mr. Falae on people in the south.
According to the results released tonight, he performed according to expectations by winning most of the north.
But Mr. Falae won the southwest, which is dominated by the Yoruba, one of the three main ethnic groups in Nigeria, along with the Ibo in the southeast and the Hausa-Fulani in the north.
Both men are Yoruba. But because of General Obasanjo's close ties to the north, many of his fellow Yoruba distrusted him and considered him a candidate imposed by the northern-dominated military.
The Yoruba have been angry especially since one of their own, Moshood K. O. Abiola, a billionaire businessman, had his apparent victory in the 1993 presidential elections annulled by a northern general.
That led to five years of brutal dictatorship under Gen. Sani Abacha, which ended only with his sudden death last June. After Mr. Abiola also died unexpectedly a month later, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, the current President, announced a timetable for elections and handover to civilian rule.
Mr. Falae was the candidate of the Alliance for Democracy, which is essentially a Yoruba party with little reach outside the southwest. The All People's Party, which is strongest in the north, joined forces with the Alliance for Democracy and presented Mr. Falae as their common candidate. During a weeklong campaign period, Mr. Falae attacked General Obasanjo as a soldier in civilian disguise and said an Obasanjo presidency would be a continuation of military rule.
The theme resonated among many Nigerians weary of the military, which has ruled Nigeria for all but 10 years since independence from Britain in 1960. But Mr. Falae, weakened by poor organization and the shakiness of the alliance that backed him, was unable to spread his message.
By contrast, General Obasanjo tried to use his military past to his advantage by arguing that he was the only one close enough to military officers to prevent them from snatching back power, as they have done in the past. He would serve as a bridge, his campaign argued, to a civilian administration.
His party, the People's Democratic Party, enjoyed the most money and the backing of the retired military elite. The party dominated in elections since December for local and statewide government seats, as well as for the national assembly.

HEADLINE: A Rocket Substitute For Shuttles Falls Short

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
An experimental rocket that is at the heart of NASA's plans to develop a low-cost, re-usable vehicle that may eventually replace the space shuttle has fallen more than a year behind schedule for its first flight because of mounting technical problems.
The rocket, called the X-33, represents a radically different approach to launching space payloads. Proponents say the new approach may drastically reduce costs and expand access to space for new types of uses, including tourism. 
 Critics charge that the X-33, a half-scale prototype that is to demonstrate an array of new technologies for future launchers, is behind schedule and under budget pressures because it is designed to do too much under a tightly limited program.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the project's lead contractor, the Lockheed Martin Corporation's Skunk Works Division in Palmdale, Calif., acknowledge that unexpected technical problems have delayed the experimental rocket project. But they say such troubles should be expected with a cutting-edge program and should be considered part of the price of innovation.
Problems affecting the X-33 include difficulty in manufacturing its engines, a new design that has never flown before; trouble in making its lightweight, graphite-reinforced plastic fuel tanks, and excess weight that will reduce the craft's performance.
"When we picked this X-33 concept in the summer of 1996, we knew this design was brand new and nothing like it had been built before," said Gary Payton, head of NASA's re-usable launching vehicle program. "When you choose an aggressive and daring project, you know you will run into problems," he continued, "That's one way of knowing you're really pushing the technology, which is what we wanted to do."
The X-33 program is a cooperative Government-industry effort to demonstrate that it is possible to make a rocket that is cheaper and easier to operate and maintain than anything now flying. It costs about $10,000 per pound to orbit payloads with the space shuttle and one of the goals of the new rocket would be to reduce this to $1,000 a pound, or less.
NASA has committed $941 million to the project and Lockheed Martin and its industry partners have put up about $230 million.
The envisioned vehicle is called a single-stage-to-orbit rocket because it is intended to fly into space and return to Earth in one piece, much like an airliner. Conventional rockets, even the space shuttle, are not totally reusable because with each use they discard parts like fuel tanks, booster rockets or spent lower stages.
NASA and Lockheed Martin hope a successful X-33 program will prove the feasibility of building a larger rocket, called the Venture Star, which would be able to carry space shuttle-size payloads into space at much reduced cost. The plan calls for the company to seek private investment of more than $5 billion to build two Venture Stars that it would own and operate, selling launching services to government and commercial clients as early as 2004.
But some are skeptical about the program's chances for success. John E. Pike, director of space policy for the Federation of American Scientists in Washington, said developing a privately owned space launcher of this scale would take more time and money than proponents acknowledge.
"I don't think a dozen flights of a sub-scale vehicle will give you a firm handle on the reliability and flight rates of a Venture Star that you can take to investors," Mr. Pike said, "The main challenges of Venture Star are not technical, but economic."
Henry Vanderbilt, a spokesman for the Space Access Society, a national advocacy group for cheaper space flight, said the designs of the X-33 and Venture Star were too complex to reduce costs enough to open space to small businesses and individuals. And failure of the project could cause potential investors to turn away from other, more promising, low-cost rocket proposals, he said. "It would be a tragedy if Venture Star made people think the single-stage-to-orbit concept can't work," Mr. Vanderbilt said.
The winning Lockheed Martin design, the most ambitious of three candidates proposed in 1996, is a vehicle shaped like a flat arrowhead with fins at the bottom. It is designed to take off vertically using a new type of nozzleless rocket engine, to re-enter the atmosphere protected by a novel metallic thermal covering, to fly back horizontally with the help of lift generated by its flat body, and to land on a runway like an airplane.
Standing 67-feet-tall and measuring 68-feet-wide at the tail, the unmanned experimental craft is not designed to reach orbit with its two engines powered by liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. But engineers say it should be able to fly 50 miles high at hypersonic speed, more than enough to prove its design and test its components under the harshest conditions.
The X-33 was originally to begin a series of 15 test flights this month, but a number of manufacturing and engineering problems forced the first launching date to slip, first to July, then to December. Program officials said last week that the new target date was July 2000.
Gene Austin, NASA's X-33 program manager, said project delays were attributed to a range of problems, including late delivery of parts by suppliers and difficulties in assembling components. For example, trouble bonding high-temperature engine parts at the Boeing Company's Rocketdyne engine division added $36 million to project costs and pushed the schedule back several months, he said.
The X-33 and its successor are to be powered by linear aerospike engines, which save weight and complexity by forgoing the movable, bell-shaped engine nozzles used for conventional rocket engines. Each of the X-33's engines, which generate 205,000 pounds of thrust, has small combustors, or thrust chambers, that fire along curved open exhaust ramps instead of through a nozzle. The two ramps form a V-shape with thrusters, aligned along the top outside surface of each side, that fire downward toward the point.
The ramps are made of a copper alloy sheet milled to include internal passages through which coolant is circulated. The copper is backed by a brazed-on steel sheet, but temperature differences throughout the ramps and other problems made the bonding much more difficult than expected, Mr. Austin said.
In a problem related to the engine, which has been tested extensively on the ground since the 1970's but never in flight, NASA and Lockheed Martin announced in November that they had given up on a more than three-year effort to test-fire a small aerospike engine atop an SR-71 research plane during high-speed runs.
During the $27 million program, known as Lasre for Linear Aerospike SR-71 Experiment, a small engine carried in a one-tenth scale model X-33 flew aboard the former reconnaissance jet seven times, but was never fired.
Jerry Rising, the Lockheed Martin executive in charge of the X-33 program from the beginning, said persistent fuel leaks in the test model's plumbing system made live firings dangerous and the company felt it was not worth spending more money to fix the problem. Fuel flow tests during the flights and ground firings of the engine helped the company validate computer predictions of how the aerospike's hot, open exhaust plume would behave in flight, he said, and further investment in Lasre was not warranted just to fire the engine in the air.
A bigger problem arose in December when part of one of the X-33's two liquid hydrogen fuel tanks came apart when it was being heat-cured. A 28-foot-long section of the tank's skin, made by laying sheets of composite material, pulled apart from its inner surface and has to be completely replaced, engineers said. Mr. Rising said that it would cost $6 million to make and replace the damaged tank skin, but that there were no estimates of the total cost of correcting the snag.
The X-33 also has had a weight problem, at one point growing from its intended 65,000 pounds to 78,000 pounds, Mr. Rising said. The craft is now down to about 75,000 pounds, he said, but the company has decided not to invest in a severe weight-reduction program because it would be costly and most of the rocket's flight objectives could be reached without being lightened further.
"We are already taking what we are learning with X-33 and applying it to the design of the Venture Star, and that's where we are making the weight-reduction measures," Mr. Rising said.
Weight is one of the reasons the X-33 will not meet an original program goal of flying at a top speed of Mach 15, or 15 times the speed of sound, a little more than 11,000 miles per hour.
Mr. Rising confirmed that the craft's maximum speed is now down to Mach 13.8, about 10,000 m.p.h., but said this was sufficient for the craft to meet all its test objectives.
Launched vertically from a recently completed site at Edwards Air Force Base in California, the X-33 is to make test flights in which it would land at military bases in Utah or Montana and then be brought back to California by truck.
Early flights will be to the Dugway Proving Ground in Utah, and higher, longer-ranged tests will take it to Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana.
Mr. Rising said the problems with the X-33 should not detract from the program's accomplishments so far, including completion of its launching site ahead of schedule, certification of its metal heat-shield system as flight-ready, successful testing of the systems that pump fuel to the engines and control their thrust, and completed verification testing of the system of small rockets that will control the spacecraft at high altitudes.

HEADLINE: China's Human Rights Record

 BODY:
A disturbing pattern is developing in the Clinton Administration's relationship with China. The more Washington seeks to broaden its agenda with Beijing, the more harshly China treats its democrats and dissidents. In the face of a new wave of political repression in China, President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright must do more than repeat stale complaints and then change the subject to trade. Americans will not support a policy of engagement and improved relations with China if the price is American inaction on human rights abuses.
Ms. Albright traveled to China this week just days after the State Department published a withering report on repression in China. It found that in 1998 Chinese leaders broke their promises to respect international human rights conventions, held thousands of political critics and religious activists in prison, tortured detainees and tightened restrictions on the press. Beijing has been using long prison sentences to crush the formation of independent political parties. 
 Ms. Albright talked bluntly about the dismal record in her meetings with Chinese officials yesterday, as she has done before. That seemed sufficient when China's conduct was improving, but as President Jiang Zemin has tightened controls on political expression in recent months, the American criticism has seemed increasingly hollow and ineffectual. Ms. Albright's words were further muffled by the primary purpose of her visit, which was to advance the Administration's policy of building diplomatic links with China, specifically by advancing Beijing's entry into the World Trade Organization and preparing for a smooth visit to Washington next month by China's Prime Minister, Zhu Rongji.
Washington can act more forcefully on human rights by sponsoring a new United Nations resolution on Chinese abuses in Geneva later this month. Last year, for the first time since 1991, the United States did not support a resolution condemning China before the U.N. human rights commission in Geneva. The Administration hoped that this gesture would encourage Beijing to ease political repression. American silence on the issue this year would be unconscionable.
Mr. Jiang and his fellow Communist leaders fear social unrest. As economic growth has diminished because of Asia's financial crisis and Beijing's own incomplete economic reforms, political protests have spread and the Government has tried to intimidate those who favor greater freedom and democracy. But as President Clinton noted last week, sooner or later China will have to realize that it "cannot purchase stability at the expense of freedom."
If the repression grows worse in the weeks ahead, the Administration may have to reconsider its commitment not to link China's admission to the World Trade Organization to its human rights performance. For now, the membership decision will depend on Beijing's willingness to lower tariffs to international standards. Concerned that too rapid an exposure to free trade will increase Chinese unemployment and unrest, Beijing wants an extended transition period. Some accommodation is reasonable. But the point of admitting China into the W.T.O. is to bring it more fully under the rules of the international trading system. Excessively watering down those rules to have an agreement ready in time for Mr. Zhu's visit to Washington would be a mistake.

HEADLINE: Index of Manufacturing in U.S. Shows First Increase in 9 Months

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1

 BODY:
Manufacturing expanded in February for the first time in nine months, adding fuel to an economy already benefiting from rising incomes and increased construction spending, new reports showed today.
The factory index of the National Association of Purchasing Management rose to 52.4 last month from 49.5 in January as production, orders and hiring all increased. It was the best reading since 52.5 last April. 
 "The signal from this survey is clear: The manufacturing slowdown is over," said Ian Shepherdson, an economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y.
Another report showed that consumers' incomes rose six-tenths of a percent in January, after falling one-tenth of a percent in December. Spending slowed to a rise of three-tenths of a percent in January as Americans bought fewer cars, Commerce Department figures showed; spending in December had risen seven-tenths of a percent.
Construction spending was up 1.6 percent in January, the largest gain in seven months and a bigger increase than the 1.4 percent in December, the Commerce Department said.
Manufacturing was the one weak spot in the United States economy last year as housing and consumer spending surged to records. As factories rebound, the economy's expansion is on track to begin a ninth year in April and set a record for longevity a year from now.
While the reports were all positive, the January gain in income may be hard to replicate in the months ahead because it includes the yearly Federal cost-of-living adjustments and pay increases for civilian and military personnel.
Spending was restrained by a 2.1 percent decline in big-ticket durable goods, like cars, after a 3.3 percent increase in December.
In the purchasing management association index, a reading above 50 means the number of manufacturers who said business improved was greater than the number of those saying it deteriorated. Readings below 50 suggest the manufacturing economy could be contracting.
Today's report showed that the production index, a gauge of current output, rose to 56.9 in February from 53.1 during January. The index of new orders rose to 57.2 in February from 51.3 during January. And the employment index, a gauge of hiring plans and labor market conditions, rose to 45.0 in February from 44.8 during January.

HEADLINE: Political Battle Threatens To Destabilize Paraguay

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: ASUNCION, Paraguay, Feb. 28

 BODY:
This small landlocked country in the heart of South America has just reached a major milestone in the life of any nation, its first 10 years of uninterrupted democracy.
But on the streets here there are no streamers, posters or other reminders to suggest that the February anniversary brought joyful celebration or even relief. Instead the graffiti here feature obscene gestures and demand that a handful of politicians across the political spectrum be hauled off to jail. 
 The conflict is paralyzing this poverty-stricken nation and could bring the impeachment of the second popularly elected president of the decade of democracy.
The clash grows out of President Raul Cubas Grau's defiance of a Supreme Court order to send a close political ally back to prison. The ally, Lino Oviedo, a retired general, is accused of leading an unsuccessful coup attempt against President Juan Carlos Wasmosy in 1996, after Mr. Wasmosy had dismissed General Oviedo and he refused to leave the barracks. After General Oviedo had won the primary for the governing Colorado Party, Mr. Wasmosy had him arrested, and he was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Soon after he became President in August, Mr. Cubas freed his friend by decree.
The President's action was hardly a surprise. He had been General Oviedo's Vice-Presidential running mate in the elections last year and became the Presidential candidate only after General Oviedo had been imprisoned.
Mr. Cubas, an uninspired speaker, appealed to voters as the shadow of the former general.
Last week, a judge here refused to prosecute the President for refusing to send General Oviedo back to jail. But he sent the prosecutor's case on to Congress, the first step in a possible impeachment.
Although it is too early to say how the case will fare, Mr. Cubas appears to be growing increasingly isolated. On Friday, the ambassadors from most of Paraguay's regional trading partners met him over lunch. But the Argentine ambassador stayed away.
The American ambassador, Maura Harty, spent three hours last Tuesday evening meeting with Vice President Luis Maria Argana. A spokesman for the embassy denied that Ms. Harty had discussed a possible Argana Government and insisted that the meeting was routine. But Paraguayans read the meeting as a highly visible show of support for Mr. Argana.
Paraguayans, new to the workings of democracy, are not sure where the limits of the conflict lie. Some fear that it could set off a move to hold power by force. Others say they believe that Mr. Argana will maneuver to take over the Presidency. Persistent street demonstrations, although largely peaceful, have raised fears of civil violence.
The nation now has the trappings of democracy, with periodic elections, a Constitution and separate branches of Government. But there is little confidence in the independence of the courts and the Congress.
Paraguay regularly figures among the most corrupt countries in surveys by organizations like Transparency International, which issues annual reports. The official economy, at $10 billion, is dwarfed by an underground economy centered on counterfeit goods, arms and drug smuggling that is generally estimated at $12 billion a year.
Rosa Palau, who oversees a center that maintains archives from the military dictatorship, said the crisis could drag on indefinitely and inconclusively. "This is an improvised country," Ms. Palau said.
In the atmosphere of uncertainty, investment is at a standstill. Stores remain virtually empty, and public works appear to have stalled.
"How can people believe in democracy?" Ms. Palau asked. "How can they believe in anything when the President simply decides to ignore an order of the court and nothing happens?"
The currency, the guarani, has lost 25 percent of its value in the last month. Tax collections this year are 21 percent below expectations, and international reserves have shrunk to a less than $800 million.
Dr. Alfredo Boccia Paz, a hematologist in Asuncion, said the crisis seemed to have paralyzed the economy and spirits.
"We can continue like this for a long time," Dr. Paz said. "We'll reach the end of the year poorer and with people still talking about the same things."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Bond Prices Plunge Again; Stocks Mixed

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Fresh signs of strong economic growth preyed on the bond market again yesterday, pulling down stock prices early, but major market gauges pared their declines and closed narrowly mixed on unusually light volume.
A stronger-than-expected gain in the index of manufacturing compiled by the National Association of Purchasing Management led to wholesale selling in the bond market. In its survey, the association said its index for February climbed to 52.4, the first time it had risen above 50 since last May. A reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing. 
 The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 1 9/32, to 94 2/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.66 percent, from 5.57 percent on Friday.
The increase in yields pushed long-term rates back to levels last seen in August, before Russia defaulted on its debt.
"One of the themes everyone talked about earlier in the decade was that the bond market helped to self-regulate the economy," said Lou Crandall, chief economist at R. H. Wrightson & Associates.
"That whole mechanism was ignored in the second half of last year," he said. "The bond market ignored the ongoing strength in the U.S. economy, and that stimulated absolutely stratospheric performance in interest-sensitive sectors of the economy, like housing. Now bond yields have gone back to levels where mortgage applications will slow."
Besides the deterioration in bond prices, fears about the high prices of technology shares caused problems for stocks early in the day. Then, to the surprise of some, the market rallied and closed little changed.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 18.20 points, or two-tenths of a percent, to 9,324.78. Hurt by a pounding in Intel shares, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.17 points, or nearly two-tenths of a percent, to 1,236.16. But the Nasdaq composite index managed to rise 7.15 points, or three-tenths of a percent, to 2,295.18. And the Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks gained 2.13 points, or five-tenths of a percent, to 394.39.
"The market was reminiscent of that old Timex watch commercial," said William Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. "It takes a licking but keeps on ticking."
Bill Allyn, director of listed trading at Jeffries & Company, said, "We are still in this push-pull, rip-tear environment, where the market has violent swings but doesn't end up going very far."
On the Big Board, a relatively sparse 699.5 million shares changed hands. On the Nasdaq market, where volume has routinely approached one billion shares lately, slightly more than 771 million shares traded.
Normally, activity tends to pick up at the start of a new month as pension funds and other institutional investors put fresh money into their stock portfolios.
But given the uncertainties about market valuations and the state of the economy, analysts said it was not altogether surprising that the pace of business had slowed.
The markets will pay particular attention to Friday's employment report from the Labor Department. "Who wants to make a big commitment in front of the employment numbers?" Mr. Meehan asked.
Most analysts are expecting the report to show a rise in nonfarm payroll employment of 250,000, but they are bracing for a surprise.
"The numbers have come in above consensus for the last three months," Mr. Crandall said. "There would be a certain amount of relief if we got through the report with no nasty surprises."
Worries about slowing sales of personal computers, set off last week by a report from Compaq Computer, continued yesterday.
Intel, the biggest maker of computer chips, led the S.& P. 500 index lower, dropping 2 7/8, to 117 1/16, after Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette cut its ratings on the stock. Compaq fell 1 27/32, to 33 17/32, and I.B.M. lost 1 3/8, to 168 3/8.
But financial stocks, which have never fully recovered from last summer's selloff, did well. So did companies with performances that are closely tied to the strength of the economy.
Among financial stocks, Citigroup gained 2 1/2, to 61 1/4; American Express rose 3, to 111 1/2, and Chase Manhattan was up 1 1/8, to 80 3/4.
Caterpillar, the world's largest maker of construction equipment, was the best-performing component of the Dow. It gained 3 5/8, to 49 3/16.
General Motors, the No. 1 auto maker, was up 9/16, to 83 1/8, and Alcoa, the world's largest aluminum company, rose 7/8, to 41 3/8.
Not all technology stocks suffered yesterday. Microsoft climbed 1 5/8, to 151 3/4; Cisco Systems gained 1 5/8, to 99 7/16, and Lucent Technologies rose 1 5/16, to 102 7/8.
Many big Internet stocks also did well. Yahoo gained 6 5/8, to 160 1/8, and Amazon.com rose 4 7/8, to 133.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: A Winner And New Era Are Declared In Nigeria

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

DATELINE: LAGOS, Nigeria, March 1

 BODY:
Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, who was officially declared Nigeria's next president today, pledged to foster democracy in a country where years of corrupt military misrule have squandered vast oil wealth and restricted the freedom of one in six Africans. 
 Final results in the presidential elections on Saturday showed the retired general winning a decisive victory, with 63 percent of the popular vote. But his rival, Olu Falae, seized on reports of fraud and irregularities to dispute the results, although he did not say how far he would take his challenge.
The outcome appeared to have been accepted by a nation weary from 16 years of uninterrupted dictatorships and nine convulsive months that, at times, threatened to irreparably widen the ethnic, religious and regional fissures in Africa's most populous land. Lagos -- a base for Mr. Falae and a city that has often expressed its political displeasure with dramatic violence -- was quiet as night fell.
Significantly for General Obasanjo -- who will inherit a country on the verge of economic collapse, with the price of oil plummeting to generational lows -- the United States, Britain and France issued statements welcoming the election's outcome. Oil companies from the three countries have billions of dollars invested in Nigeria.
The vote now holds the promise of democratization for the country's 108 million citizens, who make up a sixth of the continent's population.
"Election is not the end of democracy," the President-elect told reporters in Abuja, the capital. "Democracy is a process. Election is just one important event in the process, and democracy under my own leadership will continue."
The election was peaceful but marred by what international observers described as serious fraud and irregularities including ballot box stuffing and inflated results in some regions. They said irregularities occurred on both sides.
Most observers described the problems as not significant enough to change the outcome, given the wide margin of victory. Former President Jimmy Carter, however, wrote to the independent commission overseeing the elections that because of the fraud, his team of observers could not "make an accurate judgment about the outcome."
General Obasanjo acknowledged irregularities, but called on Mr. Falae, a former Finance Minister, to accept the outcome for the sake of national unity. In a letter to the election commission, Mr. Falae urged it not to declare the results final. Mr. Falae did not say whether he would pursue his challenge. But there was little evidence that the outcome would generate the outrage necessary to give momentum to a formal challenge.
Lagos State gave Mr. Falae 88 percent of its votes and 12 percent to General Obasanjo, the most lopsided margin of the 36 states and the federal capital territory of Abuja. But even here, most people interviewed today said they were tired of political fighting.
"I am not happy about the results," said Larry Sule, 33, a banker, who shared the same birthplace, Abeokuta, as General Obasanjo, and who had voted for Mr. Falae. "But I think we should accept the results and allow Obasanjo to be sworn in in the name of the transition. If there is a prolonged dispute, going to the courts, the military might take it as an excuse to prolong their stay."
Lagos is dominated by the Yoruba, one of the three main ethnic groups in Nigeria, and both candidates are Yoruba, but because of his military past and his close ties to northerners, General Obasanjo is mistrusted by many Yoruba.
During a weeklong campaign, General Obasanjo presented himself as a safe bridge between a future civilian government and military rulers ever ready to seize back power. Mr. Falae sold himself as a clean break from the past.
According to the final results released today, General Obasanjo, the candidate for the People's Democratic Party, won 62.8 percent of the popular vote or 18.7 million votes. Mr. Falae, who was the joint candidate for two smaller parties, the All People's Party and the Alliance for Democracy, garnered 37.2 percent or 11.1 million votes. There were 53 million registered voters, though election officials suspected that only 40 million were genuine.
As expected, Mr. Falae swept the six southwest Yoruba states, but won only three others outside the region. General Obasanjo's party retained the dominance it had exhibited in recent elections for local, statewide and national assembly seats.
"I'm very happy about it," said Jeji Jatay, 88, a farmer near Abuja, which voted overwhelmingly for General Obasanjo. "I want an Obasanjo Government to help the poor and the farmers. By the grace of God, the Obasanjo Government will be a listening Government."

HEADLINE: Sales of Credit Card Accounts Are Hurting Many Consumers

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
First there was the 5.9 percent teaser rate. When that expired, the interest rate on Tom Moore's PNC Bank credit card jumped to 14.4 percent. Finally it settled at 12.5 percent. Mr. Moore, an illustrator who lives in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn, was satisfied.
But last week Mr. Moore was stunned to find that he was no longer a customer of the Pittsburgh-based bank but of a bank in Oklahoma he had never heard of. And his interest rate had been jacked up to 20.74 percent -- and 24.74 percent on cash advances. 
 "This is about the most odious business practice I've ever seen," complained Mr. Moore, who is 46.
Odious or not, tens of millions of Americans have been facing the same stark choice -- to take the new terms or leave them -- as the credit card business rapidly consolidates into fewer and larger hands. About 32 million accounts were sold last year, mainly by regional banks like PNC, Keycorp, First Maryland and First Union. That is more than four times as many as in 1996, according to R. K. Hammer, who runs a card industry advisory firm in Thousand Oaks, Calif. Because many people have multiple accounts, the sales involved some 20 million consumers. The figures do not include transfers resulting from mergers.
Mortgages and automotive loans are routinely bought and sold, but this has little impact on borrowers, since the rates cannot change. But the new owners of credit card business are free to impose whatever interest rate the traffic will bear, subject only to the handful of remaining state usury ceilings. They can also impose that rate on existing balances, shorten the time for making payments without interest charges, eliminate grace periods for payments received a few days late and raise penalties for late payment, now commonly as much as $29.
Big buyers have included Chase, which bought 3.5 million Bank of New York accounts last year, and Citibank, which bought AT&T's 14.5 million Universal Card accounts. Other buyers are Fleet Financial and Banc One, which owns First USA, as well as some little-known companies.
Citibank said there was "really no impact" yet on Universal Card customers.
Except for low teaser rates guaranteed for, say, six months, banks have no legal obligation to honor any rates card holders now pay, and have shown little inclination to do so. But while it is not unusual for rates to rise six or eight percentage points, they could also fall. "It's the natural time to examine the risk and reward of each," Mr. Hammer said, and the result "could be a repricing up or down." And even when rates stay the same, penalties and grace periods may change, sometimes to the consumer's benefit.
Still, Gerri Detweiler, a credit card specialist and consultant to Debt Counselors, called it "scandalous" that consumers can so easily fall prey to the wheeling and dealing of large institutions.
"If your mortgage or car loan were sold, your rate would stay the same," Ms. Detweiler said. "That's not the case with credit cards." When consumers see an account has been transferred, it is very important to read the fine print because of a high probability that the interest rate or some other terms have been changed.
With an estimated 3.5 billion credit card offers flooding Americans' mailboxes each year, card holders would have little trouble taking their business elsewhere. Often, by paying a fee, they are even able to transfer balances. But even though banks are required to notify card holders of a switch, they "anticipate that a lot of new customers won't pay attention," Ms. Detweiler said.
Mr. Moore, who said, "I've never had a credit problem," acknowledged that a month or two earlier he had received a mailing that might have included a notification of the higher rates but that he had not focused on it.
Credits cards once provided a lush business for regional banks like PNC, but many are fleeing it now, squeezed by the high costs of uncollectable debt and a rising number of consumers who pay monthly balances in full, depriving the bank of interest income. And the cost is rising for the increasingly sophisticated computer models that analyze customer use patterns.
David Robertson, president of the Nilson Report, an industry newsletter in Oxnard, Calif., says the industry's ever-more-sophisticated ability to analyze account data has helped it tailor new products and cut costs, savings ultimately shared with customers. "Never has there been a better time," he said, "to find the card that appeals to you."
But even at a time of unparalleled prosperity, there is no letup in the record number of Americans filing for bankruptcy, raising fears that a business downturn would send bad card debt soaring.
"The card business is really becoming a business of scale," said Warren G. Heller, research director at Veribanc Inc., a Wakefield, Mass., company that rates banks. "A lot of companies are recognizing this and throwing in the towel."
Some retailers are also making changes. For example, Ikea, the Swedish furniture company, retains its blue-and-yellow credit cards but switched the servicing of customer accounts to Citibank last year.
Mr. Moore, inquiring about the sale of his account, telephoned the new owner, Direct Merchants Bank in Tulsa. A service representative told him that his was one of a half-million PNC accounts transferred and that if he did not like the new terms he could close his account.
He promptly canceled his card, but must still pay the higher interest rate on his $848 balance, which he hopes to pay off soon. But if he had been running a balance too big to settle fairly quickly, he would have been forced, with only a few weeks' notice, to pay a much higher interest rate for some time unless he could transfer it to a new card.
"If you build up a substantial amount, you may not be able to pay it all," said Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation of America. He called it "gouging" when a credit card rate is raised sharply for no reason other than a business deal between large institutions.
Direct Merchants Bank belongs to the Metris Companies, a Minnesota-based marketer of consumer credit products, including credit card registration and extended warranties on appliances. It was once an arm of the Fingerhut Companies, a catalogue and telemarketing concern with which it still has some ties.
Metris is one of the more aggressive of several buyers of credit card portfolios being shed by banks, having acquired $1.6 billion worth in the last two years, half from PNC and the rest from the Cleveland-based Keycorp, Mercantile Bancorporation of St. Louis and Huntington Bancshares of Columbus, Ohio.
Metris charges interest rates on its cards ranging from 15.9 percent to 26.9 percent, depending mainly on how it judges creditworthiness.
"It's a price-for-risk philosophy" tailored to individual customers, said Alfred A. Galgano, a vice president, citing what he said are more than 150 combinations of rates and fees. He said the Metris system for judging risk was more refined than those of some banks it was buying credit accounts from, suggesting that at least some customers might find an advantage in being sold.
Mr. Galgano would not say how many former PNC customers, like Mr. Moore, refused to accept Metris's terms, only that there was a "fair amount of attrition," no more than expected. He also said some PNC customers were headed for higher rates even if there had been no transfer, either because of the end of an introductory rate or, say, a deteriorating pattern of payment.
Kevin Mukri, spokesman for the Comptroller of Currency, which enforces the notification process for national banks, said he knew of no serious violations by banks or of consumer complaints.
The biggest resistance tends to come from people who sometimes carry balances. Those who always pay their cards off immediately would never be levied the high rates. Those who never pay cards off tend to be so stretched that they may not qualify for better rates elsewhere.
Metris caters mainly to people of moderate income, which Mr. Galgano defined as those earning between $15,000 and $35,000 a year.
In PNC's eyes, Mr. Moore belonged to a group of customers it regarded as geographically incorrect for its business -- that is, beyond the limits of its physical operations. It announced in September an agreement to sell these to Metris, then decided just before Christmas to sell the rest of its credit card operation, 3.3 million accounts serviced in Wilmington, Del., to the Wilmington-based MBNA Corporation, the industry's No. 3.
The going rate that a bank will pay for a card account ranges from $50 to $180, depending on creditworthiness and use patterns.
Jonathan Williams, a spokesman for PNC, said that he knew nothing of how Metris was handling his bank's former customers and that the bank had no obligation to them. Asked specifically about Mr. Moore's contention that he had been delivered up to sharks, Mr. Williams said he "would disagree" with that characterization.
"It is not uncommon to sell a business that has accounts and at which point it now becomes the business of the successor," he said. "The customer by law has to be informed of any change in terms and has the option not to accept it."
Even as competition for creditworthy customers has put downward pressure on credit card rates, profit margins have withered by two-thirds in the last seven or eight years, said Allen W. Sanborn, president of RMA, a Philadelphia-based association of bank lenders. "Some customers you just can't make any money on," he said, even when card issuers raise late fees and other penalties to offset the effect of lower rates.
Mr. Hammer, the California analyst, figured that pretax returns to lenders on card balances had now fallen four straight years, to 2.5 percent in 1998 from 3.9 percent in 1994.
High fees themselves have now created a backlash, one reflected in Congressional efforts to curb abusive credit card terms. John LaFalce of New York, ranking Democrat on the House Banking Committee, plans to introduce legislation today covering various practices, like hidden rates and aggressive solicitations.
The measure would also give consumers hit with a higher interest rate the right to pay off balances at the earlier terms. "It's only simple fairness," said Gary Luczak, a spokesman for Mr. LaFalce.

Worldwide, Things Are Not Going Better for Coke

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
In a speech in Chicago last week, the chairman and chief executive of the Coca-Cola Company made references to several well-known films, including "Being There" and "From Here to Eternity," when describing his company's experience overseas.
He left out "Suddenly, Last Summer." 
 That's when Coca-Cola, long the paragon of successful American consumer-products companies, began to feel the effects of a global battering that is without recent parallel. Coke's sales volume has dropped in many countries, profit is flat or falling, and the company is trying to manage its way through more simultaneous crises abroad than at any time since the end of World War II.
Now, with the Brazilian economy in recession and threatening to affect those of other Latin American nations, Coca-Cola's damage control has moved into high gear.
This morning, Coke's chairman, M. Douglas Ivester, is scheduled to make a rare appearance at a consumer-products conference presented by Merrill Lynch for dozens of portfolio managers who hold the keys to billions of dollars in investment funds. Such appearances are usually delegated to others, like Coca-Cola's chief financial officer, James Chestnut.
Mr. Ivester, a 20-year company veteran and a principal mechanic behind the Coke machine, is expected to try to reassure investors at the Manhattan conference that the long-term outlook for Coca-Cola remains positive. After his scheduled remarks, he is to answer questions from those attending the "by invitation only" event.
His message may be a tough sell. Even though stock analysts acknowledge the organizational strength of Coca-Cola, they say that investors are looking for more short-term security than the company's shares can provide. Last week, several Wall Street analysts reduced their 1999 earnings forecasts for Coke to about $1.45 a share, down sharply from the $1.95 many had estimated before the company's fortunes began to slide in August. It is also about the same as Coke earned last year.
The stock price, which is down nearly 5 percent for the year, fell 18.75 cents yesterday to close at $63.6875 -- off sharply from last July's high of $88.9375.
Mr. Ivester, whose normal travel schedule borders on the frenetic, has been spending an unusual amount of time making the company's case to his business peers. Last Thursday, in the address to the Economic Club of Chicago, he spoke enthusiastically about Coke's prospects.
"I have to chuckle sometimes when I read that some analyst is fretting about our 'global exposure,' " Mr. Ivester told the group in his measured Georgia twang. "I hate to tell them, but that's the idea."
Capitalism, he went on to say in a speech that included the various movie analogies, "doesn't usually begin with steel mills or automobile plants."
"It begins with consumer goods," he said. "Even in developing countries, many people can afford a Coca-Cola."
Some analysts beg to differ, especially when it comes to Brazil, Coke's No. 3 market in case volume.
"Brazil is definitely a challenge for them in 1999," said Jennifer Solomon, a beverage analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, who is one of the few urging people to invest in Coke now. (Her rationale is that the time to buy Coke stock is when the company hits a rough patch.) "And they didn't have a great 1998," she conceded.
Many analysts expect volume in Brazil to fall 5 to 10 percent this year, particularly as people decide that they don't have the disposable income to shell out for pricey American soft drinks.
Because the currency has plummeted in value, even spectacular growth in Brazil would be diminished on the balance sheet. Bill Pecoriello, a stock analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, predicts that the drop in the Brazilian currency's value will reduce Coke's earnings more than the 6 percent he had originally forecast, given the rest of the global risk facing the company. In 1998, Coca-Cola reported, currency devaluation worldwide reduced earnings by 9 percent.
In addition, Mr. Pecoriello expects case volume in Brazil to fall 13 percent this quarter, far worse than the 3 percent decline in the fourth quarter of 1998. Global volume will grow by 4 to 5 percent, he predicts, down from the 6 percent growth recorded last year and well off the 7 to 8 percent growth target of Coca-Cola's management.
"If Coke doesn't adjust marketing spending for the volume shortfall, margins should come under additional pressure," Mr. Pecoriello wrote in a note to investors last week, referring to the company's worldwide operations. He rates Coca-Cola stock as "market perform," while Coke's chief rival, Pepsico, is rated "outperform," the highest ranking. And while he predicts that Coke's earnings for this year will come in at $1.46, he cautions, "There's still risk in our numbers."
Another analyst, Marc Cohen of Goldman, Sachs, said Brazil was one piece of what might be a very large problem for Coca-Cola. "I'm growing increasingly concerned that the growth rate of the company is slowing," he said, citing compound earnings-per-share growth just under 13 percent for the 1990's -- not the 15 percent the company has repeatedly promised.
In Colombia and Venezuela, volume is also in a downward spiral, off more than 16 percent in the fourth quarter. And Colombia shows signs of shrinking demand for soft drinks over all, said Laura D. Meizler, a Latin American beverage analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. "Substitute products have been growing," she said, noting that malt drinks are among them.
The good news for Coke's shareholders is that a personal appearance by Mr. Ivester tends to have a soothing effect on the skeptical, who find comfort in his command of the business and his breadth of experience.
"One of the virtues of a 113-year-old company is that we've traveled over bumpy roads before," he declared in Chicago. "We have seen the movie before."
The bad news is that in many countries around the world -- in Japan, Russia, Germany, Colombia, Venezuela, South Africa, Brazil, to list just the big box-office names -- Coke's epic is only in the first reel.

Credit Card Consolidation Holds Some Surprises
Tens of millions of Americans have been surprised to find their credit card rates rising after their accounts are sold to other banks as the business rapidly consolidates into fewer and larger hands.
The new owners of credit card business are free to impose whatever interest rate the traffic will bear, subject only to the handful of remaining state usury ceilings. They can also impose that rate on existing balances, shorten the time for making payments without interest charges, eliminate grace periods for payments received a few days late and raise penalties for late payment.

HEADLINE: HOCKEY;
Old-Timers Help Dallas Come of Age

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE 

DATELINE: DALLAS, March 1

 BODY:
The Dallas Stars are so old that "Remember the Alamo" is not merely a figurative expression. The veterans don't mind that the National Hockey League will expand to 30 teams in two years because they remember how hard it was for them to earn a job in the six-team league. When the Stars signed a free agent named Hull last summer, one of them said, "Bobby may have lost a step, but his slap shot will help us."
Derian Hatcher's father was in the locker room the other day. Derian is the Stars' 26-year-old captain but his dad did not look all that out of place among a few of Derian's teammates. In need of an extra defenseman, the Stars last week hired the 38-year-old Doug Lidster, a former Ranger who had retired last year. Stashing his gear into his locker after practice Saturday, Lidster looked around and said, "I fit right in." 
 When the Stars visit New York this week to play the Rangers on Tuesday and the Islanders on Thursday, they will bring the league's oldest roster, averaging more than 31 years of age. They also bring the league's best record and its biggest expectations. In 58 games, they are 38-11-9 and 7-1-1 in their last nine. Their longest losing streak has been two games. On the road, they are unbeaten in their last eight. Their goals against average is 2.00, lowest in the league.
"We might not have the fastest team, but we can match fast teams," Guy Carbonneau, who turns 39 this month, said earlier this season. "We might not have the strongest team, but we can play a physical game. We might not be the best at any one thing, but right now we're the best team."
When they played Detroit last spring in the Western Conference finals, the Red Wings beat them in six games, on their way to their second consecutive Stanley Cup championship. But it seemed to some as if the craftier team in decline won over the better team ascending. Apparently en route to their second consecutive Presidents' Trophy for best regular-season record, the Stars' biggest challenge might be to stay healthy and focused on the last quarter of the regular season until the post-season tournament begins in April.
"It's definitely tough when everyone in the room knows we are all looking forward for the playoffs to start," Hatcher said Sunday, just before the Stars beat the Los Angeles Kings by 1-0.
Mike Modano, the scoring leader with 65 points and the alternate captain, said: "We all have a picture of the big picture, to get back to the conference finals again. It was tough losing then, and the toughest part is waiting to get another crack at it."
Colorado, which won the cup in 1996, also wants another crack at it. The Avalanche made a trade with Calgary for Theoren Fleury, an energetic scoring wing. But Bob Gainey, the general manager of Dallas, said the Colorado trade would not create extra pressure on the Stars to make a similar move by the deadline of March 23.
"I don't think it forces our hand," Gainey said. "We're open to all kinds of opportunities. But there is a certain need for chemistry to work properly together."
Gainey, a former captain of the Canadiens, has built a roster filled with veterans. Two of them, Mike Keane, who arrived from the Rangers last spring, and Carbonneau, were also captains in Montreal. Pat Verbeek was a captain in Hartford. Brian Skrudland was a captain in Florida. Brett Hull, Bobby's 34-year-old son, was a captain in St. Louis. Carbonneau said: "If Bob makes a trade and the chemistry is not there anymore, he is the one who will have to pay for it. He's going to try to make the right deal, but he also knows that sometimes the best trade you make is the one you don't make."
And, sometimes, the best signings you make are free agents. They compose a quarter of the roster, including Hull, Verbeek, Shawn Chambers, Ed Belfour and Dave Reid. Although more than half the Stars are older than age 30, the nucleus of the team is composed of stars in their prime, such as Hatcher, Modano, Sergei Zubov, Jamie Langenbrunner and Jere Lehtinen, all between ages 23 and 28.
Common among both older and younger Stars are strong personalities, a challenge to Ken Hitchcock, a strong-willed coach who was still coaching junior teams in Kamloops, British Columbia, when many of his players were established in the N.H.L. "These people are set in their ways," Hitchcock said. "So many strong opinions. There is no coaching clinic for this."
In his four seasons with the team, Hitchcock has learned to listen. Because he is so demanding in games and in practices, his players demand off days and he allows them, at least five each month, he said. "Otherwise, I'm going to burn this group out," he said. The veterans and even the 20-somethings bang on his door, Hitchcock said, to give him free advice. "Yinning and yanging," is what Hitchcock calls their ongoing negotiations. But even the Stars have free-speech limits. When Hull joined the team last fall, he brought the reputation of being hockey's version of Charles Barkley, a talented man who sometimes says too much. Midway through the season, when Hull complained to reporters about his ice time, Hitchcock didn't have to respond.
According to Jim Lites, the team president, the veterans told Hull that such things were "not done here" and Hull stopped complaining.
Currently sidelined with a hamstring strain, Hull still leads the team in goals with 26, despite playing a more restrained system that includes defensive responsibilities. Craig Ludwig, a Stars defensemen, said: "Hully played a free-wheeling kind of game" in St. Louis before joining the Stars and "He probably didn't expect to have that many goals with this kind of a system." As for Hull's conversational skills, Ludwig said: "He never shuts up. That's his character. But at least he plays the way everybody else does." Ludwig, who turns 38 this month, is the other alternate captain. Hitchcock calls him and other veterans his "glue guys." The coach meets with the captains and team elders about twice a month, to discuss everybody's gripes. Belfour, the goalie, said: "I have some input, but, basically, I leave it up to the older guys. I don't feel like I'm one of the older guys." He's a mere pup of 33.
The best way to protect Belfour's goals-against average is to keep the puck at the other end of the ice, Hitchcock said. To accomplish this, he encourages his defensemen to join the attack, not off the rush but rather after the forwards take puck possession in the other end. He learned this, Hitchcock said, when the Stars lost to the Wings in the playoffs. "We decided after playing Detroit last year to stop playing scared," Hitchcock said. So far this season, they are 3-0 against the Wings. Describing the style of extended puck possession in the attack zone, Hull recently said: "It's almost like a football game. Whoever has time of possession longest is going to win." This does not go unappreciated in football country. "The whole game seems to fit with the Texas personality," Hitchcock said.
The Stars make their share of mistakes, but teammates cover up for each other, a common trait of good teams. They are able and willing to block shots and to hustle on the backcheck. Although they aren't heavily penalized, the Stars know how and when to play mean. In the opening minutes against Pittsburgh on Friday night, Verbeek barged through two checks and then exchanged swings with Penguins goalie Tom Barrasso and Ludwig dropped Stu Barnes with an elbow to the head. After both served their minor penalties, Verbeek scored to spark the Stars to a 6-4 victory.
"I got slashed, I got punched," Verbeek explained afterward, ice bags on each elbow, a few stitches in his upper lip. "I reacted."
Such scenes are enjoyed by a fan base that is growing in hockey sophistication in the sixth season since the team moved from Minnesota. In some ways, the Texas culture, with oil and cattle, is like that of Alberta, in Western Canada, where several stars come from. Hatcher, one of several Stars from the "Hockeytown" suburbs of Detroit, said "It seems like every other person I meet is from up north." Many migrated during the Rust Belt recession two decades ago, from states round the Great Lakes. Hitchcock said the transplanted Northerners "are all coaching youth hockey, watching it on TV and buying season tickets."
Sunday's sellout was the 26th in succession and a new, bigger arena will open in two years. Lites said some fans used to cheer when the team pulled its goalie for an extra attacker during a delayed penalty, thinking it was a novel way of attacking. They don't any more, but they do shout the word "Stars!" when it is heard in the lyrics of the national anthem. And they cheer a film clip on the video board before the start of the period in which Pee-Wee Herman sings "The stars at night are big and bright" and a chorus of people in cowboy hats respond with "Deep in the Heart of Texas!" Perhaps, by June, the Stars will give the audience a great deal more about which to hoot and holler.

HEADLINE: No Medical Insurance Means Tough, and Creative, Choices

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Peggy Parraga, a part-time massage therapist from Queens, divides her life into two phases: the time when she and her family had health insurance, and now, when they do not.
Seven years ago, she had a baby at Our Lady of Mercy Medical Center in the Bronx, which accepted her managed care plan, offered good prenatal care and even served her and her husband a celebratory champagne dinner. In 1996, pregnant again but uninsured, she could afford only a clinic at Elmhurst Hospital Center, and endured a chaotic and unpleasant delivery by a doctor she had never met before. 
 Mrs. Parraga said she used to be good about checkups for her family. Now, her husband, a draftsman whose employer stopped offering insurance several years ago, has aches and pains that he cannot afford to have checked. "It has really made a big difference in my life," she said.
To live without health insurance is to linger between denial and fear. It means ignoring the little pains and dealing with the unmanageable ones in a frantic way. It is knocking wood for good health while knowing that medical calamities can show up at the most inconvenient times.
Most of the uninsured cobble together an approach of avoiding care whenever possible and using hospital emergency rooms or pay-as-you-can clinics when it is not. They are a diverse group, from the chronically ill woman in Harlem who borrows her mother's medicine because she cannot afford her own, to a roofer in Yonkers who is fending off bill collectors, to a young Web site designer making about $65,000 a year who takes the calculated risk he will never have to see a doctor at all. Others choose their medical battles -- say, an annual mammogram -- and pay upfront.
For the most part, the uninsured are not the poorest of the poor, who tend to be covered by Medicaid, the Government health program for the indigent. Indeed, of the 43 million Americans without health insurance, 75 percent work at least part time, but are not offered insurance through an employer or cannot afford their contribution. (The rest tend to be students, children and early retirees.) And their numbers are swelling, as the price of insurance rises -- especially for small businesses -- and as more people move from welfare to jobs where there are few benefits.
Nationwide, 17.6 percent of people under 65 lack health insurance. In New York State, the figure is even higher -- 19.1 percent, or roughly 3 million people -- and their ranks are growing faster. In part, this is because New York has a large working population of illegal immigrants and a plethora of small entrepreneurial companies, like those in the new electronic media, that are too new and unstable to offer benefits. Further, New York is home to a disproportionate number of people who toil in the visual and performance arts, many of whom put together a living with part-time or freelance work without benefits. The state has about 1.5 million part-time workers, second only to California, according to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
 
Even Without Frills, Coverage Is Costly
For many of the uninsured, individual coverage can be prohibitively expensive, or too meager to be worth the cost. Those costs vary wildly: $100 a month for no-frills coverage to $400 a month and up for extensive benefits similar to an employer's package.
"I am wary of the monthly expense," said David Wickland, who works four days a week as an office temp and paints the rest of the week in his Brooklyn studio. "Anything that I could afford would basically be for just the most minimal ambulatory care. At $100 a month, I am unable to justify it. I don't go to doctors when there is an option not to go."
For the occasional emergency, going without coverage can work. Mr. Wickland, who earns roughly $33,000 a year, fell off a ladder recently and fractured his femur. He called several clinics until he was referred to the public Gouverneur Skilled Nursing Facility, Diagnostic and Treatment Center, where a long wait and confusing maze of transfers and paperwork finally resulted in care.
"It was really chaotic," he said. "People speaking several languages were running everywhere; it was very mixed up. I had to wait a couple hours in this waiting room, and it was strange to see that people were in a lot of pain waiting for hours."
For $80 and a card that would allow him to come back for a checkup, he considered himself a satisfied customer.
"I realized that if something like that came up I would have some place to go, and I was relieved it was available," he said. "But it also made me leery about going on without health insurance. There are certain things like teeth care, or a mole that should be looked at, and I just can't go."
For people with complicated or chronic health problems, this strategy often fails.
Thai Brooks at first blush seems to be the perfect candidate for scraping by without insurance. She is 27, lives with her mother in Harlem and works 35 hours a week with disabled people, netting about $1,200 a month. Checkups and annual dental appointments are within her financial reach, and she is happy that she no longer has to rely on Medicaid.
But her health problems are daunting: she has severe asthma, a defective heart valve, a chronic gastrointestinal disorder and anemia.
Under Medicaid, she would go to a medical office at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan for most of her ailments and for dental care, and took advantage of the hospital's cardiac care center.
But now, she must pay $74 per visit to Mount Sinai, a figure computed from a stack of pay stubs she took to a recent visit. Visiting the cardiac center is out of the question now, as are many drugs.
So she borrows asthma drugs from her mother and has taken to swallowing over-the-counter antidotes for her intestinal problems. ("It makes things bearable.") She hit her head recently and had to go to the emergency room. In trying to come up with $600 to pay for it, she has ignored a phone bill. "I like working," she said. "But it is frustrating because I cannot afford to get sick."
 
Mental Health Care Is Difficult to Get
Mental health problems, which need constant attention, get perhaps the shortest shrift. Yolanda Bako, who is 52, has worked as an off-track betting clerk for three years. She works 20 hours a week and until just recently was not eligible for insurance.
Her medical home is Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx, a public hospital 12 blocks from her cramped apartment. The hospital offers a clinic with a sliding scale of fees, where she goes for everything from a sore throat to urinary tract infections to depression.
But getting good care for the latter has been the most problematic. She has taken 20 different antidepressants in the last few years, she said, and when she goes to Jacobi's psychiatric clinic, a different doctor sees her each time.
When she told one of them she felt suicidal, she was told to go to the hospital's in-patient unit, where she said she was kept for eight days and emerged without a diagnosis or plan. "I was the closest thing to a rational person there," she said.
Total bill: $14,000, none of which she could pay. Her bank account was impounded, and she has battled her way through hospital administrators and courts to sort out a payment plan, which she admits she has not always honored. "This is supposed to be the cheapest hospital around," she said. "I didn't understand how it could be so high."
Everyone interviewed said that in a pinch, the emergency room is the place to head for care. "They scold me," said Mrs. Parraga, who sometimes takes her children there when they have high fevers. "But I just can't sit home with a sick baby."
City hospital emergency rooms do not just offer a poor choice for those who seek to use them as doctors' offices, they are a severe drain on the system. When there are wages to garnish, as in the case of Ms. Bako, it can be done. But more often, care for the uninsured is written off as bad debt.
Dr. Luis R. Marcos, president of the Health and Hospitals Corporation, which runs the city's 11 public hospitals, regularly cites the uninsured as the largest economic drain on his system. Of the city's uninsured population, 71 percent seek care through his hospitals and clinics.
"In a health care world that all the philosophers these days want to make into a competitive marketplace, these are nonpaying customers," said James R. Tallon Jr., president of the United Hospital Fund.
Gov. George E. Pataki recently vetoed a bill that sought to enrich the corporation's charity pools by $100 million, and he has said he is interested in earmarking only a small portion of the tobacco settlement money for the uninsured. In the meantime, those without insurance take services they are not equipped to pay for.
Stephen Baldwin sheepishly admits he is part of the problem. At 43, he stitches together a living of about $30,000 a year with writing and roofing. While repairing a roof last year, he got a bad splinter that became infected. He has yet to pay the $150 bill for a tetanus shot at a hospital in Yonkers, near his home. The bill has been turned over to a collection agency.
"I don't like to live like that," he said. "But I am not making a lot of money right now."
The lack of preventative care is largely viewed as one of the most serious medical issues affecting the poor. The stories are well known among policy makers, like the women who show up in the emergency room with horrible coughs and are diagnosed with advanced breast cancer.
But there is evidence that even people who can afford insurance and choose to forgo it are missing out on preventative care. Adam Coti, who is 30, estimates that he makes around $65,000 a year between his two jobs as a Web page designer and a free-lance circulation consultant, depending on how much work he gets.
He is tilting toward one of the fastest growing groups of uninsured Americans: households with annual incomes of $75,000 or more accounted for half the increase in the number of the uninsured last year, according to the Census Bureau.
Mr. Coti's logic works like this: he gets an ear infection each winter, which costs him roughly $150 after a clinic visit and a prescription. This is cheaper than the $250 in monthly premiums he was offered for a very basic insurance plan.
But his father died of colon cancer, which is often hereditary, easily diagnosed and curable if caught early with the recommended annual test. "My mother reminds me that I need to spend up to $1,000 for a general checkup," he said. "I don't believe in skimping on that. It has to be done. I want to make sure that 'one of these days' doesn't turn into next year."
His greatest fear is a catastrophe. "I am not looking for the best insurance in the world," Mr. Coti said. "I'll take a huge deductible. But one out of control cabdriver mad at his dispatcher hits the pedal, and I am in trouble. I go bike riding, and there are a couple steep hills where I live, and I think to myself, 'You don't have insurance.' "
 
An Unusual Solution Is Found in Mexico
Ellen Pearlman has come up with an unusual solution to the expense of health insurance: when it comes time to go the the doctor, she simply leaves the country. Ms. Pearlman, who works as an adjunct professor at Columbia University and does freelance computer work, has been uninsured since 1990.
Four years ago, she was on a writers' retreat in Merida, in the Yucatan region of Mexico, when she had a dental emergency. What she found was so fantastic, she said, she decided to come back. She has had dental work that would have cost $2,000 at home for $200, and blood tests for $10. She has received checkups and the like each of the six times she returned there, and twice went there just to get some minor surgery. The doctors are first rate, she said.
"I look forward to discovering other health care systems in other countries," she said. "Because I have no hope of availing myself of the care system in America."

Chart: "GETTING HELP: Small Programs Offer Medical Coverage to Employers and Individuals at a Discount"
 
Though there are no comprehensive programs that address the problems of the uninsured, some small programs have emerged that offer insurance to employers or individuals at discounted rates.
 
WHO -- Working Today
 
WHAT -- A comprehensive health plan for individuals that includes mental health benefits. Functions similar to a health maintenance organization but offers point-of-service options. The group is also forming a "portable insurance" project for freelance media workers that would enable them to take their benefits from job to job. Packages start at $255 a month.
 
CONTACT -- (212) 366-6066, Ext. 14, or www.WorkingToday.org on the Web.
 
WHO -- Small Business Health Insurance
 
WHAT -- An H.M.O. for businesses with under 50 employees in East Harlem and parts of Brooklyn and the Bronx, run by the Health and Hospitals Corporation, which requires patients to use certain public hospitals and their doctors. The program may expand to other neighborhoods at a later date.
 
CONTACT -- (212) 501-4442
 
WHO -- New York Health Purchasing Alliance
 
WHAT -- Under this program, to be offered later this year by the New York Business Group, employers with 2 to 50 employees will be able to buy insurance through a central office and offer each employee a choice of many plans. The company can subsidize the least expensive option, and the worker who wants a fancier plan can pay the difference.
 
CONTACT -- (212) 252-7440
 
In addition, individuals can also open medical savings accounts, which are health insurance plans with high deductibles that are paid for with money that is deposited into an account upfront.
At the end of the year, any money remaining in the account is carried over to the next year, and all contributions are deductible on Federal income tax returns. Ask your employer or accountant for details. (pg. B5)

HEADLINE: ALBRIGHT DEBATES RIGHTS AND TRADE WITH THE CHINESE

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Tuesday, March 2

 BODY:
Trying to infuse the troubled relationship between the United States and China with a new sense of direction, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright spoke sternly today to the authorities here about human rights but also encouraged them to move forward on joining the organization that governs world trade.
Ms. Albright told President Jiang Zemin and other senior officials that the United States was disturbed by Beijing's crackdown on opposition groups and called on them to release a number of political prisoners. 
 Ms. Albright said at a news conference this morning that "in the last two days we've seen what a candid dialogue looks like" on human rights. One Administration officials said rights issues were "prominent but not dominant" during the visit.
Ms. Albright's visit came on the heels of the annual report by the United States Government that identifies countries with human rights problems, which was far more critical of China than last year's report.
At the same time, Ms. Albright made clear that the Administration was sticking to the approach it had developed, separating human rights from trade issues. "We determined some time ago that it was not a good idea to link human rights and trade," she said during the first day of her visit on Monday, "and that we actually make better progress in both when they are not linked." She emphasized the possibility of membership for China in the World Trade Organization, aides said.
Relations between Washington and Beijing strained by the roundup of dissidents, charges that China is trying to hone the accuracy of its missiles with American technology, and a growing trade deficit. Today Ms. Albright described relations as "neither the best of times nor the worst of times."
Still, the Administration has been eager to sound positive about China's chances of entering the trade organization.
Her comments about separating membership in the organization from China's human rights record marked the latest in a series of signals that Washington is sending in an effort to prompt the Chinese to make serious offers to open its markets.
But there are huge obstacles to an agreement. The Administration would have to win the backing of American business, which is split on the issue of exactly what markets China must open, and how fast.
Moreover, China wants assurances that Congress will drop the annual review of its "most favored nation" trade status -- which despite its name means the rights afforded to most American trading partners.
The review has brought an annual Congressional debate over the nature of the economic relationship between the two countries. Dropping it would require Congressional action. And even if the Administration separates China's entry into the trade group from human rights issues, it is highly unlikely that Congress will keep them separate.
China views membership in the World Trade Organization as a matter of national prestige, and the United States has a virtual veto over who can join the Geneva-based organization, the rule-maker and arbiter in world trade matters.
In return for membership, Washington has insisted that China provide a detailed schedule for opening its markets to foreign goods. But Chinese officials, facing a severe economic slowdown, are loath to allow international competitors to vie with outmoded state-owned enterprises that are laying off millions of workers.
Ms. Albright's visit is not likely to stop China's Communist Government from taking further action against dissidents. Late last week it detained one dissident and handed down an 18-month sentence in a labor camp to another without a trial.
A human rights group based in Hong Kong said on Monday that another dissident planned to form an independent political party. A recent effort to form such a party brought several arrests.
But the visit also came as other vexing problems with China surfaced, including the arrest last week of a Chinese citizen in California whom Federal agents charged with trying to obtain a component vital to missile guidance systems.
Publicly, at least, Chinese officials did not emphasize that or other security matters. Instead, they limited their public criticisms of the United States to its human rights stand.
Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan, with whom Ms. Albright spent most of her time, obliquely warned the United States not to submit a resolution criticizing China's human rights record at the annual meeting in Geneva this month of the United Nations Human Rights Commission. He said such "confrontation" would not solve the problem.
The Administration is in the midst of a heated internal debate about whether to go ahead with such a resolution, which is bound to antagonize the Chinese Government.
The State Department has characterized Ms. Albright's trip as a "business visit," intended to develop a system of regular meetings between the two countries.
It was the highest-level of a constellation of visits to Beijing in recent and coming days by American officials. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers was here last week, discussing China's beleaguered economy and its possible route to membership in the trade organization.
The United States is seeking Chinese membership because it would force Beijing to agree to a schedule of reductions in tariffs and trade barriers and would subject China to the rulings of the organization's court, which enforces trade rules. While reluctant to lower those barriers, the Chinese want to insure that other countries -- including the United States -- cannot discriminate against Chinese-made goods.
The Clinton Administration sees China's desire for membership as an opportunity for a tangible accomplishment that could move the relationship between the two countries forward. The United States is eager to close a deal in time for a scheduled visit by Prime Minister Zhu Rongji to Washington in early April.
An Administration official familiar with Washington's efforts to get China into the organization said it appeared that Mr. Zhu was serious about the talks and understood the benefits of membership.
The Administration has been contemplating some "imaginative transition" periods for China's entry so that the uncertain economy here, particularly some sectors including agriculture, would not be overwhelmed by the immediate lowering of tariffs, the official said.
In addition to human rights, the main complaint from China during Ms. Albright's talks was an American proposal for a missile defense system in Asia, Administration officials said. The Chinese have said that if such a system embraces Taiwan, its deployment will set off a new arms race and deeply harm Chinese-American relations. A Pentagon study released last week portrayed a growing threat to Taiwan from a buildup of missiles along the Chinese coast facing Taiwan.
Ms. Albright countered, according to her spokesman, James P. Rubin, that the system, which is in the design stage, was intended to protect American troops in the region from threats posed by ballistic missiles.
She told the Chinese that if they improved relations with Taiwan and stopped their missile buildup near the island, the enthusiasm in Washington for the theater missile defense system would probably wane.
The Chinese also brought up the Clinton Administration's cancellation last week of a satellite sale to China on the ground that the purchasing company had ties to the Chinese military.
An Administration official said the Chinese had expressed puzzlement, arguing that if the United States was interested in reversing its huge trade deficit with China, it should allow the Chinese to buy high-technology goods. The deficit, which reached an all-time high of $57 billion last year, is second only to the American trade deficit with Japan.
On a subject that increasingly concerns the Administration, Ms. Albright urged the Chinese to be more helpful in preventing North Korea, with whom China has diplomatic and military relations, from becoming a nuclear power.
An Administration official called the talks on that subject constructive, but another official said the Chinese were fairly coy about how much influence they could or would use with the North Koreans.

HEADLINE: U.N. Panel Urges Tribunal For Khmer Rouge Leaders

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1

 BODY:
A United Nations panel has recommended that a new international tribunal be convened to try about a dozen senior Khmer Rouge officials on charges of crimes against humanity while they ruled Cambodia, according to diplomats and senior Administration officials.
Under the recommendation, a separate Cambodian truth commission would consider all other cases. 
 But in a sign of the growing tensions between China and the United States, the Chinese have told Administration officials who are lobbying for a tribunal that Beijing would veto the idea if it is brought before the United Nations Security Council, those officials said. The Khmer Rouge relied almost exclusively on Chinese support during their rule, which led to the deaths of nearly two million Cambodians from 1975 to 1979.
"China has always emphasized it defers to the domestic decision of Cambodia," said an Administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity. "The only way the Chinese will not veto this is if the Cambodian Government goes to the U.N. Security Council and asks for it."
The recommendation for a tribunal was given to the Cambodian Prime Minister, Hun Sen, last week, but will not officially be made public for several weeks, officials said.
In contradictory statements during the last two months, Mr. Hun Sen has alternately complained that the world is at least a decade late in condemning the Khmer Rouge, has given half-hearted support for an international tribunal and has questioned whether a trial would lead to new violence.
At the same time, Mr. Hun Sen has grown closer to China, signing five new agreements in Beijing last month that provide Cambodia with increased trade and economic benefits. In the same month, China's Foreign Minister, Tang Jiaxuan, said in Bangkok that Western nations, especially the United States, had come up with the idea of trying the Khmer Rouge, which he said was inappropriate because "these are internal problems of Cambodia" and should be decided only by the Cambodians.
"China has outmaneuvered the United States once again," said Stephen R. Heder, a professor of political science at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London and a Cambodian scholar.
"It's highly unlikely that Hun Sen can be turned around. He's been prepared to have a trial or not have a trial depending on the highest bid and China and its friends are willing to give him economic benefits, security guarantees and general diplomatic support that the United States can't offer."
The proposal does contain a way to circumvent a possible Chinese veto. The proposed International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia could be put before the General Assembly for a vote, should it be blocked in the Security Council. But the five permanent members of the Council, including the United States, are wary of setting such a precedent.
Written by three outside experts, the proposal for a Cambodia tribunal includes innovations based on the experiences in the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda and South Africa, among other nations, according to officials. To set up the tribunal quickly and to save money, the offices of the tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda will be used. The trial of the top dozen or more officials would be held at the Hague, in Manila or in Canberra.
The truth commission, which was the idea of Thomas Hammaberg, the Secretary General's Special Representative on Human Rights in Cambodia, would be established in Cambodia and would allow Cambodians to have a full airing of what went on in one of this century's worst cases of mass murder.
"It's a good balance of the twin imperatives of justice and national reconciliation," said Craig Etcheson, program director of The International Monitor Institute and the former head of the Cambodian Documentation Center. "You establish a record through the tribunal and at the same time you allow Cambodians to feel that their suffering has been acknowledged and to find their way to reach social reconciliation within their community."
Mr. Hun Sen also said he is reluctant to approve a tribunal because world powers ignored his requests for nearly two decades to set up a Khmer Rouge trial, waiting until it suited their timetable.
From 1979 to 1991 Cambodia was hostage to the Asian cold war, and the United States, among other countries, refused to even officially acknowledge the mass killings for fear of upsetting China. Then, the Khmer Rouge signed a peace treaty and other countries worried about upsetting Cambodia's delicate recovery.
It was only in 1997 that a real push began, stimulated in part by Mr. Hun Sen and his then co-Prime Minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh. They petitioned the Secretary General that June asking "for the assistance of the United Nations and the international community in bringing to justice those persons responsible for the genocide and crimes against humanity during the rule of the Khmer Rouge from 1975 to 1979."
Pointing out that Cambodia did not have the "resources or the expertise" to conduct a trial, Mr. Hun Sen argued that "only in this way can this tragedy be brought to a full and final conclusion." Two weeks later, however, Mr. Hun Sen overthrew Prince Ranariddh and his ardor for a trial has since cooled.
There is little dispute over which Khmer Rouge leaders should be tried and whether there is sufficient evidence to convict them. At the top of the list is Nuon Chea, second to Pol Pot, the head of the regime who died last April, followed by Ta Mok and Khieu Samphan. Mr. Nuon Chea and Mr. Khieu Samphan turned themselves in to Mr. Hun Sen's Government in December and are living in a western Cambodian city with other Khmer Rouge defectors. Mr. Ta Mok is at large in the jungles of western Cambodia.
Cambodians fear that the long delay will prevent a trial from ever being held. According to a recent private poll cited by senior Administration officials, 80 percent of Cambodians favored an international tribunal. In a smaller survey done in 1997 by the Cambodian Documentation Center some 75 percent of Cambodians favored a trial.
While Secretary General Kofi Annan has yet to read the proposal, senior United Nations officials say he is worried about the precedent set by the arrest in Great Britain of General Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator.
"The Secretary General is listening to the Pinochet argument that it is better to bury the mistakes of the past, a senior United Nations official said.

HEADLINE: Doctors' Group Merges With a Larger Union

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
The Doctors Council, a union representing 2,500 salaried doctors at New York City hospitals, announced yesterday that it was merging with the larger Service Employees International Union as part of a plan to accelerate efforts to unionize doctors nationwide.
Under the merger agreement, the Doctors Council -- most of whose members are post-residency attending physicians at the city's municipal hospitals -- will begin a campaign to unionize physicians in other states, helped by the larger union's pledge to spend $1 million a year on the effort. 
 Barry Liebowitz, president of the Doctors Council, said one priority would be to press for legislation in New York State and elsewhere that would make managed-care organizations liable if they overrule doctors' decisions and patients are hurt as a result.
At a news conference announcing the merger, Dr. Liebowitz and other union leaders said repeatedly that doctors' unions would fight as much to improve patient care as to increase doctors' wages and benefits.
"Medicine has been infected by a big-business mentality," said Dr. Liebowitz, a pediatrician. "Hospitals are merging and downsizing. Profit-driven managed-care companies and corporate administrators are dictating medical treatments to protect the bottom line. For the sake of our profession and for the sake of patients everywhere, this must stop."
With the merger, the Doctors Council becomes the third medical union in the Service Employees International Union, which now includes 15,000 doctors, making it the the nation's largest representative of doctors. The service employees union has created a new umbrella group, the National Doctors Alliance, comprising the Doctors Council, the Committee of Interns and Residents, and United Salaried Physicians and Dentists.
In 1997, the Committee of Interns and Residents, which is based in New York and represents 9,000 doctors, joined the service employees union, which has 1.3 million members, 600,000 of whom are in health care.
Andrew L. Stern, president of the service employees union, said it would make a big push to unionize not just interns and residents, but also salaried physicians. Doctors in private practice are usually considered independent contractors who are prohibited by law from bargaining collectively.
Labor leaders say many doctors are interested in unionization because they are angry about stagnating salaries and stepped-up restrictions imposed by hospitals and managed-care organizations.
"Nearly 50 percent of practicing physicians in the United States are now in salaried positions, making them eligible to join unions," said John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. "They need unions because the upheaval in the health-care industry is affecting their work, just as it is affecting other health-care workers."
Dr. Liebowitz said the union would not rule out calling strikes. He said it would be hard to justify doctors' striking over economic issues, but he said a strike might be appropriate to prevent reduced quality of care -- closing a cardiology and neurology department to cut costs, for example.
"Sometimes it is better to strike than to allow patients to go into a substandard facility," he said.

HEADLINE: China Syndrome: Disputes Persist, Civility Rules

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 2

 BODY:
On her departure from China today, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright put the best face on the fractured United States-China relationship, saying it was mature enough to withstand sharp disagreements.
As she headed for Thailand for talks about that country's economy, she lauded the Chinese for the "depth and ease" of her discussions here, which were crammed into less than 48 hours. She emphasized that there would be no going back on the Clinton Administration's policy of broad engagement with China. 
 In short, she suggested, the United States has managed despite the rough bumps of the last few months to get beyond a relationship whose health depended primarily on one issue, whether human rights or trade or national security.
But in each of those areas, which were the hottest topics in the talks, Ms. Albright and her advisers acknowledged that they still faced significant obstacles in China and at home in Congress.
On human rights, Ms. Albright told the Chinese authorities that the recent arrests and long prison sentences imposed on members of a fledgling opposition party were a breach of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, not just an internal matter as the Chinese insist. From the American point of view, she said, the political stability that China values so highly cannot be bought at the price of freedom.
Fairly predictably, her advisers said, the Chinese rejected the arguments. But less predictably, a senior Administration official said, the Chinese did not "go through the roof" as they have in the past at the mention of human rights.
Further, the official said, slow progress is being made in persuading the Chinese to set up an information exchange on prisoners that would allow the American Embassy in Beijing to have regular contacts with the Chinese Foreign Ministry on the status of individual prisoners.
The Chinese were also told that the visit of the Prime Minister Zhu Rongji to Washington in early April would present them with an opportunity to make a positive move on human rights.
To coincide with his visit, Ms. Albright suggested that the Chinese formally agree to one of the United Nations civil rights covenants they have signed but not yet ratified: the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights or the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.
Congress remains angry over China's human rights policies, and the recent arrests and sentences of opposition party members in China has heightened the antagonism.
In a sign of this renewed ire, the Senate unanimously adopted a resolution last week urging the Administration to condemn China at the annual meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva, which will begin at the end of this month.
One of Ms. Albright's tasks on this trip was to assess whether the Administration should introduce a resolution against the Chinese in Geneva and what effect it would have on the Chinese leadership, who have always interpreted such resolutions as highly negative acts.
By the end of Ms. Albright's talks, her advisers said, no decision was made on the touchy subject -- but they allowed that it was not a bad idea to keep the Chinese guessing.
In another area of discussion -- China's possible membership in the World Trade Organization, which governs global trade -- Ms. Albright came away somewhat heartened.
Her aides said that for the first time Mr. Zhu, who has major responsibility for the economy, appeared to understand the benefits of joining the trade organization, even as the Chinese economy was being shaken by slowing growth.
The Administration has hammered at the idea that opening the Chinese market for services, goods and agricultural products are likely to create job growth, not job loss as the Chinese have feared.
While the atmosphere for China's entering the trade organization has improved, officials said, the details of the concessions China is prepared to make for what the Administration insists must be a "commercially viable" agreement were far from clear.
China is now the fourth-ranked United States trading partner, and Washington argues that China is too big to leave outside the trade organization. The Americans believe that membership would force China to agree to a schedule for lowering tariffs and trade barriers and would subject China to the rulings of the group's court, which enforces trade rules.
The United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, is due in Beijing on Wednesday and will make a specific proposal that addresses the outstanding issues, a senior Administration official said. "After her visit we'll have to see where we are," the official said.
Although the Administration has for the moment made the trade organization its central focus in the relationship with China, there are major problems with gaining support from Congress for Chinese membership.
Various interest groups in Congress will be taking a close look at how the Administration negotiates requirements for market openings in areas like agriculture and telecommunications.
In addition, China has demanded that its agreement to join be tied to ending the annual vote in Congress on whether China should have "most favored nation" trading status, entitling it to the basic rights enjoyed by most United States trading partners.
It is not clear, several aides to Democratic senators said recently, that lawmakers will favor waiving the annual debate over the economic relationship between the two countries. At the very least, they said, senators will want to see improvement by China on human rights -- and, if not, a resolution in Geneva by the Administration -- in exchange for permanent trade status.
A specialist in China's economy, Nicholas R. Lardy, who is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said the Chinese were nervous about their prospects in Congress.
"The Administration has got only one carrot -- that is permanent trade status -- but the Chinese say, 'What if we don't get the vote in Congress?' " Mr. Lardy said. "The Chinese say, 'We've made all these concessions, but what do we get?' "
On United States national security interests, which have also riled Congress, Ms. Albright had to reply to some pointed complaints from the Chinese about Washington's intentions to deploy a missile defense shield in Asia. The Chinese view that plan, which could involve a protective shield around Taiwan, as a threat.
Ms. Albright's answer was equally pointed: "I replied that instead of worrying about a decision that has not been made to deploy defensive technologies that do not yet exist, China should focus its energies on the real source of the problem -- the proliferation of missiles," she said at a news conference today.
China should use its influence with North Korea to help restrain missile development there, she said. And China should work with Taiwan to reduce tensions so that the Chinese can reverse their recent buildup of missiles on the Chinese coast opposite Taiwan.
If missile threats from North Korea and China were not perceived to exist, then the need for a United States missile defense shield in Asia would diminish, she said.

Working on Poverty

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Courage is a quality in short supply with politicians of any era, and especially now. So it seemed odd at lunch this week with Andrew Cuomo, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, to hear him insist, passionately and un-self-consciously, that now is the time to move on behalf of the perennial underdogs in our society -- the families living in squalor and hopelessness on Indian reservations, or in the economic and social wreckage that has defined Appalachia for decades, or in the worst of our inner cities, which continue to be dangerous and isolated crucibles of despair.
"We have real people in real pain that we have to attend to," said Mr. Cuomo, who toured the poverty-ridden coal mining regions of West Virginia last week. 
 With the U.S. economy humming, and with the budget deficit gone, there is an unprecedented opportunity to make investments that will bring training and real jobs to men and women for whom employment has been little more than a distant memory, or a dream.
"The economy is breaking all sorts of records," Mr. Cuomo said. "And because the economy is strong we want to say everything is good. A lot of things are good. Employment is up, crime is down, poverty is down, welfare is down. But at the same time we have a lot of significant problems."
He picked up a stack of large color photographs and spread them across a table. "The Dow Jones? They don't know from it," he said, pointing to individuals in the photos who have been so hounded for so long by poverty in the Mississippi Delta, on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota, on the South Side of Chicago, that they cannot imagine an economically viable future.
"This is a great economy, yes," said Mr. Cuomo. "But you go to Appalachia, it's just like it was 30 years ago. We've had some success with the cities, but over all the cities are not doing well. They are smaller, poorer, and the poverty is more concentrated than 20 years ago. You want to say the poverty rate has come down? Yes. But it's still one in five." He was referring to the fact that even in these most prosperous of times, one in five American children lives in poverty.
The 10 poorest counties in the U.S. are rural, and their poverty rates are staggering, in some cases higher than 60 percent.
The way to deal with these problems is to put people to work, said Mr. Cuomo. And because the economy is doing so well, the necessary investments should be made now. "You fix the hole in the roof when the sun is shining," he said, "not when it's raining."
The goal, said Mr. Cuomo, is to get businesses and jobs into poverty-stricken areas, or to get residents of depressed areas into jobs that are located elsewhere. "We have some new approaches to these problems that are designed to create jobs by stimulating the private market economy," said Mr. Cuomo. "It will require government action because the private market is not going to South Central Los Angeles without a subsidy. Period. So you have to say, 'If you go to South Central L.A., I'll give you a tax break.' That's Jack Kemp's enterprise zones. Or you say, 'If you hire a person from South Central, I'll subsidize their salary.' That's Charlie Rangel. We do both, but it has to be about either creating jobs or getting people into jobs."
In an era in which technological miracles have become commonplace, it is possible to get good jobs to the unlikeliest places. Mr. Cuomo recently asked a gathering of executives if their operations could function out of the Pine Ridge Reservation. Sure, he was told. For the right price, they could work anywhere.
Mr. Cuomo is trying to spread the word that there are many Americans living in squalor and with very little hope at a time when the nation is more prosperous than ever. He insists they can be helped to help themselves, and that it is in the national interest to offer that initial help.
"The President talks about untapped markets," Mr. Cuomo said. "Where do we still have the economic potential, the untapped markets where the economy can still grow? It's the very same areas that need the help. The high-unemployment areas. The high-poverty areas.
"We know how to do this. We have the resources. The excuses are gone."

HEADLINE: International Study on Water in Mideast Leads to a Warning

BYLINE: By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr. 

DATELINE: RAMALLAH, West Bank, March 2

 BODY:
The drought this winter could be a portent of an even drier future unless Israel, Jordan and the Palestinians work together to conserve shared water resources, an international panel of scientists warned today.
With a population of 12 million in a region with as much rainfall as Phoenix, Ariz., water supplies "are barely sufficient to maintain a quality standard of living," said Gilbert F. White, a geographer from the University of Colorado who was chairman of a research group from the United States National Academy of Sciences and counterpart institutions from Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority. 
 In what was described as the first major study of the long-term outlook for water supplies between the eastern border of Jordan and the Mediterranean Coast of Israel, the report said even with strict management "the area's inhabitants will almost assuredly live under conditions of significant water stress in the near future."
Ancient underground aquifers are being drained dry, while scarce rains flow unused into desert gulches and rivers are diverted for water-intensive tropical agriculture, the researchers said. Watersheds cross political boundaries and can only be managed jointly, they said.
It is hardly news here that water is getting ever scarcer and the population steadily larger. Yet by drawing on data from disparate sources within and outside the region, the study provides what its authors believe is the first comprehensive analysis of regional patterns of water demands and supplies, while at the same time detailing feasible methods of conserving water and reducing consumption.
At least as significant as the content, participants said, was the political fact that this was the first serious study involving Jordanian, Israeli and Palestinian experts, all of whom urged their Governments to work together on recycling waste water, developing more efficient irrigation and using brackish water for industry and agriculture.
The unusual regional collaboration and the prestige of the Academy of Sciences should help assure that the study will guide the World Bank and other Western aid donors whose support is crucial to all three Governments, the authors said.
Left carefully unmentioned were the consequences of an regional battle over dwindling water resources. But the concern was implicit.
"This is a very dry region and a very tiny region, with an importance out of all proportion to its size," said David Policansky, staff director of the project.
The 225-page study, which took more than two years, is itself rather arid, scrupulously avoiding any hint of national bias or ideological advocacy, and concentrating on regional research rather than policy prescriptions.
"While we were aware of many proposals for managing water supplies in the study area and neighboring areas, we explicitly refrained from making recommendations about these specific programs and political policies," Mr. White said.
The scientists acknowledged that their hope was to galvanize policymakers into action and to remove the excuse that there is insufficient scientific information on which to base broad new water policies.
Members of the group met on Monday with the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat. The Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities will be presenting its findings to the Israeli Government, and the Royal Scientific Society of Jordan is advising the Government in Amman about the research.
The principal scientific contribution of the panel, some suggested, was to collate and verify existing research from varied sources on regional industry, irrigation, meteorology and geology.
"There was a serious lack of regional information," Mr. Policansky said, pointing to a map of regional rainfall patterns that was drawn from different official sources and research institutes. "This is quite basic. But until we did it there was nothing like it."
The report stresses the limits of a landscape ranging from "sparse forest" to desert and "semidesert," cleaved by the "temperate steppe" of the Jordan Valley, itself increasingly dried out by upstream irrigation. In 40 years, all fresh water in the region should be reserved for household use, with treated waste water and saline water used to supply agriculture and industry, the researchers said.
As the largest and by far the most prosperous of the three, Israel accounts for most of the consumption, the study confirmed. At 344 cubic meters, its per capita water use in 1994 was almost four times that of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, at 93 cubic meters a person.
Palestinian officials and Israeli environmentalists often point critically to this disparity and to California-style watered lawns and capacious bathtubs that they consider irresponsibly profligate. Yet the study showed that Israel's use is only marginally greater than Jordan's. Jordan is poorer than the West Bank, yet consumed 244 cubic meters a person.
In Jordan and Israel, the thirstiest consumers are not households, but farms, out of all proportion to their share of the economy and workforce. In Israel, agriculture accounts for 3 percent of the gross domestic product and 57 percent of water consumption. The Jordanian agricultural sector contributes 6 percent of the G.D.P., but uses 72 percent of the water. In the less developed West Bank and Gaza Strip, agriculture absorbs about the same share of water, 64 percent, yet accounts for fully a third of the local economy.
The Israeli Foreign Minister, Ariel Sharon, has been promoting plans for Mediterranean desalting plants that could supply Gaza and Israeli coastal communities. But the study noted that desalting sea water was extremely expensive -- $1 or more for a cubic meter of potable water -- and would not usually be considered feasible in a region without cheap and abundant fuel supplies.

Reassuring Data and High Yields Help Treasury Prices Post Gains

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Bond prices rose yesterday for only the second time in almost a week as market participants covered short positions after a benign report on new-home sales.
Also contributing to higher prices were the unwinding of positions in front of a large amount of corporate debt expected to be priced during the next few days and the attractive yields resulting from recent selloffs. 
 "Unlike existing-home sales, which rose to a record level in January, new-home sales fell modestly during the month," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, "and while this was the second consecutive monthly decline, the sales pace is still at historically high levels and shows no definitive signs of slowing as of yet."
Although rising mortgage rates could dampen housing activity in the short term, he added, "keep in mind that housing is the leading edge of broad economic momentum, and the economy's rip-roaring advance is not likely to slacken significantly until a housing slowdown is under way."
He said a separate report that the Conference Board's index of leading economic indicators rose five-tenths of a percent in January did not suggest a slowdown in the economy.
Despite the market's recent swoon and concern about rapid economic growth and Federal Reserve intervention, Mr. Fine said the odds that the Federal Open Market Committee would raise interest rates at its March 30 meeting were slim but that there was a good chance that the committee could shift its stance in favor of higher rates in the future.
"Given the recent onslaught of strong economic data, the labor market data to be released this Friday could prove very instrumental in this decision," Mr. Fine said.
The price of the benchmark 30-year bond rose 24/32, to 94 26/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.61 percent, from 5.66 percent on Monday. The two-year note gained 3/32, to 99 24/32, to yield 5.13 percent, down from 5.18 percent the previous day.
The Treasury was an active seller of debt yesterday, selling $10 billion of new 52-week bills and $19 billion of 12-day cash management bills. The 12-day bills are used to meet the Treasury's short-term cash needs and are an addition to its regular schedule of debt sales.
The auction of 52-week bills went well, analysts said, thanks to the increase of nearly 30 basis points in yields since last month's auction. The bills were awarded at an average rate of 4.665 percent, with the number of bids the best since last September's auction. The rate of the 12-day cash management bill came in at 4.79 percent.
Elsewhere in the bond market, Colombia sold a five-year note that was priced to yield 11.587 percent, or 6.3 percentage points over the comparable Treasury issue. The issue was another indication that Brazil's devaluation of its currency in January has had much less fallout than feared.
This was the first bond that Colombia has sold since Russia devalued the ruble and defaulted on some bonds last August. The high yield attracted enough investors to raise the issue to $500 million from $400 million, said Rachel Hines, the managing director for Latin American capital markets at J. P. Morgan Securities, one of the joint lead underwriters on the issue.
Following are the results of yesterday's auctions of a 52-week Treasury bill and 12-day cash management bill:

HEADLINE: Hewlett Plans To Split in 2 In Revamping

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, March 2

 BODY:
Responding to the ever-shifting fortunes of high-technology industries, the Hewlett-Packard Company, the cornerstone of California's Silicon Valley, announced today that it would split into two independent companies, one focusing on computers, printers and scanners, the other on electronic test equipment and medical technology products.
Wall Street greeted the move enthusiastically, sending Hewlett-Packard shares up $2.75 to close at $68.625 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 Analysts said the split would allow Hewlett-Packard's computer and imaging businesses to compete more effectively with more focused companies that have lower cost structures, like the Dell Computer Corporation, Sun Microsystems Inc. and Lexmark International Group.
Although Hewlett-Packard's reputation was built on the quality of its test and measurement equipment -- not to mention its legendary founding in the iconic Palo Alto garage 60 years ago -- that business has been marked by higher overhead and slower growth than the company had realized in computers, printers and scanners.
"The company has been in too many businesses," said Steven Milunovich, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. "H.P. has actually done surprisingly well through the years with a diversified business, but the time has come for this kind of step. I think it should be a shareholder-enriching event."
Hewlett-Packard has struggled to meet its own or analysts' estimates of revenue growth, although it beat earnings estimates in the most recent quarter through rigorous cost-cutting. Test and measurement, which also includes medical products like ultrasound, patient monitoring devices and heart defibrillators, had averaged better than 10 percent revenue growth over the last decade, but in the most recent fiscal year, growth dropped to 1 percent, because of the Asian economic crisis and a slowdown in the semiconductor business.
"We still have quite a collection of businesses under one roof, which have become increasingly divergent in terms of their business models, the way they go to market, and the customers they serve," Lewis E. Platt, Hewlett-Packard's chairman, president and chief executive officer, said in a telephone interview.
After the split, the computer and imaging company will continue to be known as the Hewlett-Packard Company, while a new name will be chosen for the measurement company. Hewlett-Packard plans a public offering of 15 percent of the measurement company's outstanding shares by year-end, which would be the largest initial public offering in Silicon Valley history. The measurement business, including chemical-analysis and medical businesses, represented $7.6 billion of Hewlett-Packard's total revenue of $47.1 billion in the 1998 fiscal year.
"The focus we get from being separate will help our outbound message," Mr. Platt said. "What can you say about a company like H.P.?"
In contrast, he said, Sun Microsystems, a major competitor in large network server computers, "is out there with just one message."
"The complexity and confusion of having all these businesses under one roof outweigh the synergy of having them all together," he said.
Mr. Platt, 58, said he would remain chief executive until Hewlett-Packard's separation was completed. That is expected to take 12 to 18 months. A search for a successor is under way.
Aside from the printer business, where Hewlett-Packard has a commanding market share, the company has struggled to own any particular market segment the way Sun is identified with the Internet, Dell with personal computers or I.B.M. with large enterprise systems.
Analysts say that while Hewlett-Packard has credible offerings in all of those markets, it has lacked a coherent strategy to address any one of them. What is not clear is whether spinning off test and measurement will change that picture, they said.
"I actually think test and measurement is the crown jewel," said James Moore, chief executive of Geopartners Research in Cambridge, Mass. "Test and measurement is where the technology tends to be, where a lot of the talent tends to be. The problem is on the PC side. It was a great mistake for them to plunge so heavily into PC's. They and Compaq got into a price war, and what neither company understood was that Dell was hitting them in a blind spot."
Dell has grabbed market share from Compaq Computer and Hewlett-Packard with a combination of a direct sales model, which eliminates the overhead of dealers and distributors, and custom configuration, which allows it to sell machines at higher average prices.
Even so, Mr. Platt said the companies' business models were actually coming closer together. "Dell's out now very aggressively recruiting dealers and distributors to help them serve customers who prefer to be served that way," he said. "While we started out with very different multitier strategies, we are converging."
At $10.2 billion, revenues in Hewlett-Packard's computer business increased 3 percent over last year; in contrast Dell grew sales by 38 percent in the same period. At the same time, revenue from the measurement organization declined 11 percent, with test and measurement down 14 percent, chemical-analysis up 8 percent, and medical-products down 13 percent.
Mr. Platt said one quarter's results did not drive the decision to split the company, but he conceded that they might have been a factor. "If we'd had quite a wonderful year, maybe there would have been less urgency," he said.
Edward W. Barnholt, Hewlett-Packard's executive vice president and general manager of the measurement organization, has been named chief executive of the new company.
"We'll work very hard to be an $8 billion start-up that will compete very effectively with companies of all sizes," Mr. Barnholt said.
Whatever name is eventually chosen for the new company, he said, it will likely reflect the legacy of Hewlett-Packard. "We certainly want to build on the heritage of H.P.," he said. "We don't want to leave that equity behind."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Brazil Intervenes as Inflation Fear Sends Currency Down

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, March 2

 BODY:
Weakened by uncertainty about revisions in the Government's agreement with the International Monetary Fund and growing fears of a rise in inflation, the Brazilian currency continued its slide to a record low against the dollar today, forcing the central bank to intervene for the fourth time in a week.
The currency, the real, dropped as low as 2.22 to the dollar before recovering somewhat and settling at 2.16 after the central bank stepped in. In New York, the real edged up to 2.10 to the dollar from 2.13 on Monday, after falling 8.6 percent in a week. 
 Since Brazil devalued its currency in mid-January, it has declined more than 40 percent, leading to sharp increases in prices of imported goods and forcing the Government to raise interest rates to levels that threaten to suffocate the economy.
The immediate cause of the sharp drop in the real's value over the last two days was the need for Brazilian companies to pay obligations to foreign creditors. The lenders, because of their continued concerns about the economic crisis here, have been unwilling to roll over about $2 billion in bonds and other payments due this month, and Brazilian debtors have been forced to scramble to obtain dollars. "This is not really a run against the real," Paulo Ferraz, president of Banco Bozano Simonsen, said today. "This is a specific demand for payments of Eurobonds, and once it is met, I would hope the dollar will begin to fall."
But market analysts said other factors, chiefly a sharp rise in the rate of inflation, traditionally the Brazilian economy's great worry, have also played a role in the decline of the real this week. By official calculation, prices rose 3.61 percent last month, more than double the 1.79 percent recorded during all of 1998.
Inflation, which as recently as five years ago had been running above 1,000 percent annually, is expected to increase further in March and April, as January's devaluation makes the price of everything from medicine to wheat more expensive. As a result, interest rates, which already stand at a punishing annual rate of 41 percent, may soon be running behind inflation, increasing the likelihood they will have to be raised more.
That, in turn, has exacerbated fear that the recession brought on by the collapse of the real will be longer and deeper than the Government is willing to acknowledge. Hence, the anxiety about the precise terms of the new targets for spending cuts and taxes contained in the revised agreement being negotiated with the I.M.F. -- something made necessary after President Fernando Henrique Cardoso abandoned the defense of the real in mid-January.
When the decision to allow the real to float freely on the foreign-exchange markets was announced then, the Government indicated that it would no longer intervene to prop up the currency. The central bank reversed course once the real passed the symbolic level of 2 to the dollar, but has acted inconsistently in recent days, encouraging speculators to mount attacks on the currency.
"Above all, what is needed is a more active posture by the economic team, especially the president of the central bank," said Carlos Kawall, chief economist for Citibank. "Absent a more vigorous role as regards exchange policy and other initiatives, the market will continue" reacting unfavorably.
The real's recent decline has come despite a statement on Monday by Michel Camdessus, managing director of the I.M.F., that good news would soon result from the negotiations with Brazil. The market "was anticipating a quicker freeing up" of I.M.F. money and a return of bank credit "than we are seeing now," Mr. Kawall said.
In the meantime, impatience with the I.M.F. and the deep spending cuts required as part of its $41.5 billion aid package is growing. Some of Mr. Cardoso's closest political allies have joined in the chorus of complaints, spreading concern that the Brazilian Congress may not agree to some of the I.M.F.'s demands.
"We understand that the Government needs to go to the I.M.F.," Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, the president of the Brazilian Senate and Mr. Cardoso's most powerful political associate, said last week. "But that doesn't mean the I.M.F. can interfere in national problems, above all to create difficulties for the poorest sectors in Brazil."
Arminio Fraga, president-designate of the central bank, has been having acrimonious confirmation hearings in Brasilia. Opposition senators have interrogated him mostly about his ties to the financier George Soros, his previous employer. But some questions have elicited indications that he intends to move ahead with an austerity program.
"Monetary policy in the next few months will necessarily have to be characterized by a restrictive slant so long as the transitory effects of the devaluation have not disappeared," Mr. Fraga said on Friday. He warned that "the next few months are going to be difficult," with unemployment likely to rise and businesses to go bankrupt.

HEADLINE: Earnings Top Expectations At Two Large Retailers

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Federated Department Stores Inc. and the Dayton Hudson Corporation, two large retailers, reported quarterly earnings yesterday that were higher than expected, aided by the economy's strength, which spurred sales of home goods and clothing.
Federated, the department-store company whose chains include Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Burdines, said net income rose 7.7 percent in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended Jan. 30. Dayton Hudson said operating earnings jumped 27 percent as sales rose at its Target discount chain and rebounded at its Mervyn's midprice department stores. Net income rose 19 percent. 
 Record employment and rising wages left consumers flush with cash to buy brand-name goods at bargain prices during the holiday season at Target and other discount chains. And a late burst of holiday shopping and demand for marked-down clothes in January increased sales at department stores.
"It's a good sales environment for both companies because the consumer is really driving this economy," said Timothy Ghriskey, senior portfolio manager at the Dreyfus Corporation, which owns shares in both retailers.
Profits received a further boost from the retailers' efforts to hold down inventory and operating costs, offsetting the price cuts that were needed to spur sales of coats, sweaters and other winter clothing during the holiday season.
At Federated, which is based in Cincinnati, net income in the quarter rose to $408 million, or $1.88 a share, from $379 million, or $1.66 a share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected a result of $1.82 a share, and Federated's shares gained $1.4375, to $40.0625, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.
Revenue grew 2.9 percent, to $5.21 billion from $5.06 billion, aided by a 4.1 percent increase in sales at stores open at least a year.
Dayton Hudson's profit from operations rose to $453 million, or 97 cents a share, from $356 million, or 76 cents a share. The results exceeded forecasts by 7 cents a share. The Minneapolis-based company's shares closed down $2.25, to $61.875 on the Big Board.
Gains and charges related to a change in the company's income tax rate, the hiring of an outside company to handle data center operations and the redemption of long-term debt resulted in net income of $423 million, or 90 cents a share. There were no gains or charges a year ago.
Revenue rose 13 percent, to $10.1 billion from $8.95 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year rose 6.1 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCIES;
The Euro Falls, And Some Find Economic Fault

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, March 2

 BODY:
In the two months since the European single currency was introduced, pretty much the only direction it has moved is down.
From a buoyant and technically smooth start-up on Jan. 4, the euro has steadily slipped against the United States dollar. An initial exchange rate of $1.17 is now around $1.09. 
 The decline has surprised most experts and puzzled the overseers of the new currency at the European Central Bank. It could also strain relations with the United States, where Government officials now loudly complain that Europe has to do more to stimulate world growth. A weak euro makes that harder, because it increases the price of imported goods and diminishes European demand for them.
The euro's troubles reflect a series of economic and political developments that have taken the shine off Europe and its new currency. Economic growth has sharply slowed, particularly here in Germany, while the United States has defied expectations with an unrelenting pace of torrid growth.
Some experts and political leaders also warn that the financial markets may have been unnerved by recent squabbling among European political leaders over monetary policy, farm subsidies and budget cuts. "You can't get around the fact that the euro is the economic component of a blueprint for political unification," said Graham Bishop, an adviser on the single currency to Salomon Smith Barney. "If you see disarray at the heart of the political process, that ought to make people nervous."
Many economists argue that the euro will regain its initial strength later this year, though perhaps not before it sinks a little further. But many also concede that their predictions two months ago were simply wrong. "I had to change my view fairly quickly," said Ravi Bulchandani, chief currency strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in London. Like many others, Mr. Bulchandani had expected the euro to climb from its starting price of $1.17. Now he predicts that it could sink to $1.05 before it strengthens.
Wim Duisenberg, president of the European Central Bank, suggested in January that he would be comfortable if the euro traded between $1.14 and $1.19. When it dropped below $1.14, Mr. Duisenberg acknowledged that he was "puzzled," but he did not signal any policy change.
Economists say the euro's decline largely reflects the sharp contrast between American and European growth rates. Industrial production across the 11-nation euro zone declined two-tenths of a percent in December, the European Commission said in data released on Monday.
By comparison, the Commerce Department said Friday that fourth-quarter growth in the United States increased at an annualized 6.1 percent, the fastest in nearly 15 years.
European sluggishness has been notable in Germany, which accounts for one-third of the euro zone's total economy. Just today, the German Chambers of Industry and Commerce said that companies now expect the economy to grow only 1.5 percent this year, down from 2.8 percent in 1998. The German central bank has already estimated that the economy declined four-tenths of a percent in December. "There are clouds spreading over the German economy and the sunshine has disappeared," said Franz Schoser, the chambers' managing director.
In Italy, Europe's third-largest economy, things are worse. The Government said on Monday that economic growth last year was only 1.4 percent, far short of its projections.
At the same time, economic expansion has made the United States a magnet for foreign money, increased the demand for dollars and reduced that for euro investments.
"If you look at the two economies," said Stefan Schneider, chief European economist for Banque Paribas, "they just seem to be going in opposite directions."
Europe's uncertain prospects have aggravated the running battle between some left-leaning political leaders and the conservative monetarists at the European Central Bank.
Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine of Germany continues to press the bank for reduced interest rates, which would help stimulate European economies with increased lending but could further weaken the euro by reducing the value of investments denominated in the currency.
Some currency traders thought the bank would soon give in, and some economists say that the expectation of lower rates probably helped push down the euro in recent weeks.
But Mr. Duisenberg and other members of the central bank's board made it clear this week that they would not change course at their next meeting on Thursday. "We think the interest rate should stay where it is now," Mr. Duisenberg said in an interview with the Spanish newspaper El Mundo, and several of his colleagues have since echoed those views.
Bank officials note that parts of Europe are still growing at a pace they consider reasonable. France is more buoyant than Germany, and economists say it can still grow by more than 2 percent this year. Spain, Portugal, Ireland and the Netherlands are all growing much faster than that.
Indeed, some analysts say German political leaders appear at odds with their French colleagues. Both Governments are now controlled by left-of-center parties, but French leaders have refrained from actively criticizing the central bank.

Electronic Serial Numbers Raise Privacy Concerns
From computers to cellular phones to home electronics, everyday devices and software programs are increasingly embedding telltale identifying numbers that enable them to interact. That trend is generating a dispute pitting security interests and convenience against privacy concerns.
Privacy groups argue that the merger of computers and the Internet has brought the specter of a new surveillance society. But a growing alliance of computer industry executives, engineers, law enforcement officials and scholars contend that absolute anonymity is not only increasingly difficult to obtain technically but is also a potential threat to democratic order because of the possibility of electronic crime and terrorism. "You already have zero privacy -- get over it," Scott McNealy, the chairman and chief executive of Sun Microsystems, said recently. Page A1. 

Since Birth, Euro Has Fizzled
In the two months since the European single currency was introduced, pretty much the only direction it has moved is down. The decline has surprised most experts and puzzled the overseers of the new currency at the European Central Bank. A1.
 
Car Sales Strong in February
Major auto makers reported record sales for February. Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler both said sales rose 8 percent. American Honda said sales rose 14 percent. C2.
 
Sony Introduces Playstation II
Making what could be a quantum leap in the march to wed consumer electronics to computers and the Internet, Sony introduced the widely anticipated second generation of its hit Playstation video-game console. C4.
 
Broadcaster Wants to Try Banking
Pat Robertson, the religious broadcaster, wants to go into the banking business. He and the Bank of Scotland applied for a charter to operate a new national bank that will not have any branches but will instead deal with customers by telephone and mail. C5.
 
Retail Giants Post Good Profits
The retail giants Federated Department Stores and Dayton Hudson reported quarterly profits that beat forecasts, aided by the economy's strength, which spurred sales of home goods and clothing. Shares of Federated gained $1.4375, to $40.0625, while Dayton Hudson fell $2.25, to $61.875. C7.
 
Computer Shares Pull Stocks Down
Stocks ended lower, led by Intel and 3Com, on concern that waning demand and increased competition will hurt profits in the computer industry. Nasdaq fell 36.15 points, or 1.6 percent, to 2,259.03. The Dow industrials fell 27.17 points, or three-tenths of a percent, to 9,297.61. The S.& P. 500 declined 10.66 points, or nine-tenths of a percent, to 1,225.50. C8.
 
The price of the benchmark 30-year bond rose 24/32, to 94 26/32. Its yield fell to 5.61 percent, from 5.66 percent on Monday. C8.

HEADLINE: COLLEGE BASKETBALL: He's Got the Moves Off Court, Too;
St. John's Point Guard Conquers a Road Fraught With Danger

BYLINE: By JUDY BATTISTA 

 BODY:
Erick Barkley and Tyrone Grant, their low voices spiked with bravado, had a conversation recently that turned civic pride on its head -- debating which one of them came from the worse Brooklyn neighborhood. Grant -- from Brownsville, "a few blocks from Mike Tyson," he noted -- brought the debate to a quick conclusion when he conceded that Barkley's was "the worst neighborhood in the world."
"It was either be a drug dealer or play basketball," Barkley said in perhaps an overstatement about the Farragut Houses in Fort Greene. "You took one side of the road or the other." 
 Shirley Barkley can still look out her apartment window at Farragut and see the concrete court below where her small son took his first underhand shots when he was 6 and began to make that choice.
Barkley was terrible; "I was an ant," he said. But basketball led him on a circuitous course fraught with the perils of the urban ghetto, a course he managed to navigate from childhood games against Stephon Marbury to a key role in the elevation of St. John's to a top 10 ranking this season. From the chaos rose the consummately controlled, reticent fulcrum of St. John's offense, a freshman who will be on display this week in the Big East Conference tournament, which begins today at Madison Square Garden.
Good point guards, St. John's Coach Mike Jarvis said, give teams the chance to win every night. St. John's has been in every game.
"If it wasn't for Erick, we wouldn't be in the top 10," said Grant, the senior center. "He's made all of us better. His decision-making has been perfect."
His decision-making off the court has been nearly as good. Barkley was born in 1978 and grew up during the crack scourge, when one early mentor used to hear gunshots and gang fights as he escorted young Erick home from the gym. Shirley Barkley, an evangelist, did not want Erick, the youngest of nine children, in the projects then, and still tries to dissuade him from visiting there.
"It was drug-infested," she said. "You couldn't help it. I never had any problems with Erick, though. He was always a good kid."
Barkley was the beneficiary of what now looks like the smooth exchanges of a practiced relay team: a handoff from mother, to church league coach, to high school, to concerned friends to a fortuitous trip out of town to improve his grades, to college.
It was not so smooth, of course. When Erick was still in high school, Shirley Barkley left her son behind with friends and went to Georgia, a move she made to get away from the neighborhood, her son said. And Barkley struggled so much academically in high school that there were doubts he would be eligible to play for St. John's this season.
But the inner city has forged that most legendary of New York athletes -- the playground point guard -- and Barkley figured out that he could steal the moves from the good ones like Marbury and still avoid the pitfalls that swallowed other street phenoms.
"Basketball was his salvation," said Bob Oliva, Barkley's coach at Christ the King High School in Queens. "I've never coached a player who had such a one-track mind. Erick's social life was going to the gym and playing basketball. It was his outlet."
Joe Francis knew that from the first time Barkley showed up for a St. Ann's Catholic Youth Organization practice. Barkley was about 6 then, and very small. Francis, a dean at Xaverian High School, has a picture of Barkley standing next to a water fountain; the fountain is taller than Barkley.
"I was practicing with the basketball team, with a bunch of older guys maybe 14 years old," Francis said. "He said, 'I want to be an N.B.A. player.' I go into this thing about hard work and dedication. He said he was right-handed. I said, put the ball in your left hand and just dribble around the court. This was about 5:30. I lost track of this little guy going around the court. At 9, I'm kicking everybody out of the gym and I notice the little guy still going. I said, 'Why didn't you stop and go home?' He said, 'You never told me to.' "
Francis became one of the people Shirley Barkley relied on to rescue her son. He shooed away the gang members when they tried to woo a 12-year-old Barkley, and Francis' gym became the haven for Barkley and the place where the first glimmers of his basketball future became clear.
He once scored 20 points in a half during a 12-and-under tournament, when Barkley encountered Marbury at a Christmas tournament in Coney Island. Barkley was 9 and Marbury was 11. The final score was 54-48.
"His team had 48 and Steph had 44," Barkley said. "We won the game and I was the m.v.p. I will never forget that game."
By the time he got to Christ the King, Barkley was already a standout player -- Oliva said he was the most controlled freshman he had seen -- and the team won the Catholic league championship in Barkley's sophomore season.
The personal turning point came before Erick's senior year, when Shirley Barkley moved to Georgia. Mother and son agreed that Erick would stay in New York and then go to prep school to straighten out his grades.
Francis talked to the family of Craig (Speedy) Claxton, Barkley's close friend, who is now Hofstra's point guard. Yvette and Steve Claxton run a quiet household where the television is off and the schoolwork is done. They have seven children, the oldest of whom is about to graduate from medical school. When Barkley moved to the Claxtons' home in Hempstead, on Long Island, it was his first brush with the dynamics and discipline of a middle-class family.
"He saw that people could live better, so that's the way he chose to go," Shirley Barkley said.
Craig Claxton said: "When he moved in with me, it was a nice neighborhood, and he didn't have a choice about getting into trouble. My father drove my sister to school every day, so he had to go. It's tough on you if you don't have somebody looking after you telling you to go. They treated him like another part of family. I think he was more friendly and easier to get along with afterwards. Living with my parents, it opened him up to people."
Barkley is now so quiet and composed that an on-court flare-up between him and Ron Artest during a game against Connecticut in January was shocking. But in high school, Barkley displayed a fiery temperament, and he was ejected from a diocesan championship game for scuffling with an opponent.
"I was uncoachable," Barkley said. "I had a bad attitude. I didn't listen. At Christ the King, I would mumble something under my breath if things didn't go my way. I'd point my finger at somebody else. My temper was so quick."
That changed when Barkley got to Maine Central Institute in remote Pittsfield, a prep school powerhouse Barkley attended to improve his grades. He got the test score he needed, and with the change in scenery came a change in style. His coach, Max Good, told him that the innate New York suspiciousness and street-tough attitude would have to go.
"When Erick came to visit he said, 'Coach, let me use your car.' " Good said. "I tossed him the keys. I don't think he really wanted the car; he wanted my trust. His host parents said he hardly left the driveway. When I gave it to him it had an eighth of a tank of gas. When I got it back, it was full. I think he learned to trust people here."
As his personal life settled down, so, too, did his game. The temper faded and so did the flashy plays. Barkley had seen prodigies whose games were so full of juking and thread-the-needle passes that colleges spent two years changing their style. Why, he wondered, shouldn't he just develop a stripped-down game from the start?
"I never used to settle for the easy play," Barkley said. "At Maine, I was watching a lot of games. I really liked John Stockton's game a lot. One move, and he'd go right by them. Being flashy doesn't get you anywhere. Being a fundamental point guard gets you places."
St. John's is going places with him. Barkley's minimalism -- crisp passes and simple moves -- has enabled him to play four games this season with no turnovers, and seven games with just one. He has 74 steals. He is the point guard St. John's didn't have during the Felipe Lopez era. Last season, St. John's two point guards, Tarik Turner and Collin Charles, turned the ball over 113 times and made 169 assists. Barkley has 62 turnovers and 133 assists.
"He not only has the candy," Jarvis said, "he knows when to give it out."
Coach Jim Calhoun of Connecticut said: "He's allowed that team to have other guys do things. But he's the guy who gets them into spots where they need to be."
St. John's is where it needs to be, a likely third seed when the national tournament brackets are announced Sunday. Shirley Barkley is back in town for a while, too, to see her son finish his season. The latest handoff has been made. Barkley is taking St. John's to the top level.
"The first couple of games, I was nervous and I tried to make everybody feel I was perfect," Barkley said. "Once I got that out of my head, it's worked out. I guess I've got a game."

HEADLINE: January New Home Sales Slowed From Record Levels

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 2

 BODY:
Sales of new homes fell more than expected in January as harsh winter weather stalled buying in the Midwest. Even so, January's pace of sales was the third strongest ever.
In a separate report, the Conference Board, based in New York, said today that its index of leading economic indicators rose five-tenths of a percent in January, the fourth consecutive monthly increase and a sign that the economy is moving into a ninth year of expansion with plenty of momentum. 
 New single-family home sales fell 5 percent in January, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 918,000 units, the Commerce Department said. While the sales fell short of analysts' forecasts of a 971,000 pace, the monthly total was surpassed only by those in December and November, when new houses sold at a record annual rate of one million.
Also, January was the 38th consecutive month that the new-home sales rate exceeded 700,000 units, the longest such string on record.
"A peaking housing market doesn't mean the economy is slowing," said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., who expects sales to rebound in February. "The surge in sales will insure strong retail sales of household durables for many months to come."
A panel of forecasters from the National Association for Business Economics concurs. Almost 80 percent of the 248 economists surveyed said they thought the current expansion would become the longest on record in February 2000.
This year, the business group expects the economy to grow 3 percent, slower than the 3.9 percent of 1998 but faster than earlier forecasts of 2.1 percent late last year. The group also expects the Consumer Price Index to rise 2 percent in 1999 after rising 1.9 percent last year, and the unemployment rate to increase to an average 4.5 percent this year from the current 29-year low of 4.3 percent.
For all of last year, home sales totaled a record 887,000, compared with 804,000 in 1997. Last year's new- home sales beat the record of 819,000 set in 1977. A new-home sale is recorded when a buyer signs a contract or puts down a deposit to buy a dwelling.
The median price of new homes rose 3.8 percent in January, to a record $157,000 from $151,300 in December. The price increase probably was a reflection of the sales strength in the West, "where houses cost considerably more than in the Midwest and South," said Christopher Low, chief economist at First Tennessee Capital Markets in New York.
Higher interest rates are a potential negative for home sales, however. The average weekly 30-year mortgage rate in January was 6.79 percent, up from December's 6.72 percent, according to weekly statistics compiled by Freddie Mac. For the week ended Friday, the 30-year rate rose to 6.89 percent, the highest since mid-November.

HEADLINE: Major Auto Makers Report Record Sales

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 2

 BODY:
Most major auto makers, including the Ford Motor Company, DaimlerChrysler A.G. and American Honda, reported record sales for February.
"Since the end of the General Motors strike in August, the industry has had an incredible run of monthly records," said David Healy, an auto analyst for Burnham Securities in New York. "The reasons are the usual suspects. Car prices are reasonable, if not declining. Employment levels and consumer confidence are very high. Used-car prices are strong, making trade-ins worth more and causing people to buy new cars instead of used ones." 
 At Ford, sales of Ford, Mercury, Lincoln and Jaguar cars and trucks rose 8 percent, to 319,340 vehicles, from February 1998, surpassing the previous February sales record set in 1996.
DaimlerChrysler reported sales of Dodge, Jeep, Chrysler and Plymouth cars and trucks totaling 215,450 units, also up 8 percent over a year ago and beating the previous record set 1996. Mercedes-Benz posted slightly lower sales in February from a year ago.
Ford's sales rose on the strength of trucks, most notably the full-size Ford F-Series and compact Ranger pickup trucks as well as sport utility vehicles like the Ford Explorer and Expedition. Ford's total truck sales climbed 20 percent, to 193,779 vehicles. F-Series sales rose 27 percent, breaking the previous monthly sales record set in 1978; Ranger sales rose 46 percent for the best February since 1978. Combined sales of the Explorer and Expedition set new records, and the redesigned Ford Windstar and Mercury Villager minivans also posted increases.
Ford's car sales, however, dropped to 125,561 vehicles, down 6 percent from a year ago, because of lower sales to daily rental fleets, Ford said. Excluding fleet sales, retail car sales rose 12 percent, the company said. Sales of the redesigned Ford Mustang and Mercury Cougar were higher, but sales of Ford's high-volume Taurus fell. A redesigned Taurus will be displayed at the New York auto show in April and put on the market in the fall.
At DaimlerChrysler, truck sales rose 7 percent, to 145,436 vehicles, setting a new record for the sixth month in a row. Sales of sport utilities led by the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango and minivans, especially the Dodge Caravan, contributed to the increase. The automaker's car sales rose 9 percent, to 70,014 vehicles.
Honda also reported record February sales for its Honda and Acura brands. Its car and truck sales totaled 81,910 units, up 14 percent from a year ago. Honda's new Odyssey minivan and redesigned Acura TL entry-level luxury car had triple-digit gains.
Volkswagen reported its best February in 18 years; Audi had the best February since 1986. Volvo, Subaru and Kia also reported higher sales.
Auto makers said the continued upswing would likely carry through to spring, typically the strongest season of the year, with March sales already coming in strong.
"There is very little doubt that March sales will be higher than a year ago," said Robert Rewey, Ford's group vice president for marketing, sales and service, in a statement. "After that, the mountain is going to get a little steeper because the sales rate in the second quarter of 1998 was very fast. Still, momentum is on the side of a strong U.S. economy and confident U.S. consumers."
Indeed, Mr. Healy of Burnham Securities said he was uneasy with the industry selling significantly above recent levels. When the rest of the auto companies, including the General Motors Corporation, report sales Wednesday, Mr. Healy said he expected the seasonally adjusted rate would be at a lofty 16.7 million for cars and light trucks.
"It seems too good to last, but I don't see anything to spoil it," he said. "Every month I raise my forecast, and I suppose I'll keep raising it."
Auto makers are also increasing their forecasts for this year's vehicle sales. DaimlerChrysler's early February forecast put car and total truck sales for 1999 at 15.6 million vehicles. "We've increased the forecast every month for the last three months, and I wouldn't be surprised if March gets off on a good foot and the forecast ticks up a little more," said Jamie Jameson, vice president for sales and marketing operations at DaimlerChrysler.

HEADLINE: Budget's Reliance On Social Security Is Under Scrutiny

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 2

 BODY:
Republican leaders began today to explore publicly ways to end the longstanding practice of using Social Security money for other purposes -- but not necessarily right away.
Needing money to pay for tax cuts and additional spending, House and Senate leaders discussed allowing Congress to dip into Social Security funds for the next several years but then walling off the retirement system's money from the rest of the Federal budget. 
 The idea of weaning the Congress from reliance on Social Security's money has more support among House leaders than among their counterparts in the Senate, many of whom favor putting the retirement system's funds off-limits immediately, Republicans said.
Removing Social Security from the budget equation entirely, though, has repeatedly proved politically impossible. Backers of the gradual approach say theirs is the only realistic way of imposing a new fiscal discipline on Congress and the White House, while still giving Republicans the wiggle room they need to propose the tax cuts and spending increases that they hope will be the centerpiece of their electoral strategy in 2000.
Although the proposal's prospects remain unclear, Republican leaders say they will have to decide soon because the question of using Social Security will go a long way toward shaping their tax and spending plans.
The House plan for gradually taking Social Security out of the budget was detailed today in legislation introduced by Representatives Wally Herger, Republican of California, and David Minge, Democrat of Minnesota, who is among his party's most fiscally conservative members.
Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, said the plan, though gradual, would be "a remarkable accomplishment, certainly far superior" to past efforts to keep Congress from mingling Social Security's money with general revenue.
But because it would leave their party exposed to attacks by Democrats that they are endangering Social Security, Republicans said they wanted to see how much bipartisan support the gradual approach might attract before making a decision on how to proceed. Democrats have rallied around President Clinton's proposal to address the same problem by reserving 62 percent of total budget surpluses over the next 15 years for Social Security.
The debate illustrated the difficulties Republicans are having reconciling their desire for new spending and tax cuts with their efforts to shore up Social Security and retain their claim to fiscal responsibility. And it brought to life the complex politics of the post-deficit world in Washington, where Democrats and Republicans each vow to be more austere than the other even as they confront the likelihood of huge and growing surpluses in the next decade.
Although the plan won support from a handful of moderate to conservative House Democrats, it drew criticism from others, including the House minority leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri.
"While the general theory of taking Social Security monies out of circulation is a worthy goal, to the extent we understand their bill it's not an approach we would support," said Laura Nichols, a spokeswoman for Mr. Gephardt.
For most of the last 30 years, the Federal Government ran deficits even after spending the revenue generated by Social Security along with general revenues. Under the accounting used by the Government, the Federal budget moved from deficit to surplus last year, and is projected to remain in surplus for years to come.
But last year's surplus of $70 billion was the result of a $99 billion surplus in Social Security more than offsetting a $29 billion deficit in the Government's operating budget. Projections suggest that the Government will run an operating deficit this year and next year, and then run operating surpluses.
President Clinton's proposed budget for next year leaves the entire surplus untouched, but only by proposing tax increases and using budget maneuvers that Republicans have already rejected.
If adopted, the gradual approach to taking Social Security out of the budget could make it easier in the short run for both parties to pay for new spending they have proposed for the military and education, among other programs, and could provide Republicans with additional flexibility in financing the big tax cut that they envision as the centerpiece of their legislative agenda.
In the long run, the idea would be to make the money generated by Social Security sacrosanct, thereby making it easier for the Government to pay all promised benefits in the coming decades as the population ages. But by allowing some of the money to be spent for the next few years, the gradual approach would put Congress in the position of explicitly endorsing its longstanding practice of papering over the country's remaining fiscal problems.
The more austere proposal favored by many Senate Republicans -- to wall off Social Security immediately and completely -- would insulate the party from Democratic attacks over spending Social Security's money, but would complicate the task of drafting a budget containing spending increases and tax cuts.
Senator Pete V. Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who is chairman of the Budget Committee, is leading the effort to leave Social Security untouched. But Mr. Armey said after today's meeting that the differences were narrowing and that he expected a compromise soon.
Mr. Armey said even a phased-in approach to removing Social Security from the budget would preserve more of the retirement system's money than Mr. Clinton's plan. Mr. Herger and Mr. Minge said their bill would reserve $1.69 trillion for Social Security in the next decade, while the President's plan would reserve $1.59 trillion.
Walling off Social Security would reduce the national debt, which most economists say would make it easier for the Government to pay baby boomers their retirement benefits. But both parties agree that reducing the debt alone does not fully address Social Security's problems.
The House plan for gradually taking Social Security out of the budget would separate out from the Federal budget the money earmarked for Social Security, but do it over three years in a way that would leave $89 billion in play for tax cuts or spending over the next two years.
For the coming fiscal year, the plan would wall off all $80 billion of the excess Social Security payroll taxes, but leave $51 billion in interest payments from Social Security's reserves. In the next fiscal year, the plan would wall off all the excess payroll taxes and half the interest payments, leaving a projected $38 billion for Congress to play with.
In the third year, all money derived from Social Security, both payroll taxes and interest, would be taken off the Government's books for purposes of spending and tax cuts.
In a letter to Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, Mr. Herger and Mr. Minge said they did not intend their bill to provide cover for "a final raid on the Social Security Trust Fund" for either tax cuts or spending increases.
But the practical effect of their plan would be precisely to allow the money left on the table to be used for tax cuts or spending increases. Representative John R. Kasich, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the House Budget Committee, has generally supported the approach as he seeks to put together a tax and spending blueprint for next year.

The Government includes the money collected for Social Security along with all other revenues when figuring the budget. The Government has been able to boast of big surpluses only by adding big surpluses from Social Security to an operating budget that won't have a surplus until 2001. Graph tracks the overall surplus, the surplus contribution of Social Security, and the actual budget surplus when the Social Security surplus is not figured into the equation. Graph runs from 1998 through a projected 2008. (Source: Congressional Budget Office)(pg. A14)

HEADLINE: Congress Hears Status of Year 2000 Solutions

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 2

 BODY:
American industry and the government are generally winning the race to fix year 2000 computer glitches by year's end, but the problem is likely to cause widespread civil unrest and economic disruption abroad, a Senate panel reported today.
With 304 days to go, most Federal agencies, utilities and big companies are solving computer flaws that could spew faulty data or worse, the panel said. But its 160-page report warned that the nation's health care industry "lags significantly" in redressing the problem, as do millions of small businesses, and scores of state and local governments. 
 More chilling are the findings abroad. Global communications, financial systems, air transportation, and oil supplies could be interrupted for days or weeks. Important allies like Japan, Mexico and Germany are nine months to two years behind schedule.
In a closed briefing at the Capitol, senators heard that computer failures in Russia could blind early-warning radar and lead to false alarms of nuclear attacks. Soviet-built nuclear reactors in Russia and Eastern Europe could shut down. And there is a chance that terrorists will try to exploit the chaos.
"In this country we will have a bump in the road but it will not be crippling," said Senator Robert F. Bennett, a Utah Republican who heads the Special Committee on the Year 2000 Computer Problem. At midday, he briefed his colleagues on national security risks.
"Internationally, we think the chances of difficulty are much higher," Mr. Bennett said.
The Senate, in its quest to resume a regular legislative agenda, took the unusual step of devoting its entire day to aspects of the year 2000 problem.
The Senate voted 99 to 0 this morning, to authorize the Government to guarantee loans to small businesses to fix computer problems.
This afternoon, the Senate voted 92 to 6 to extend the panel's work through February 2000, and approved its $800,000 budget.
Moreover, the House and Senate are considering bipartisan bills that would limit litigation, lawyers' fees and damage awards related to the problem. Lloyd's of London has projected that global legal costs could reach $1 trillion.
An unlikely coalition of insurers, high-technology companies, and large and small businesses support the legislation, which is opposed by consumer groups, trial lawyers and the Clinton Administration.
Republican leaders in Congress have put the bills on the fast track, making consideration by both houses likely in the coming weeks.
As 2000 approaches, experts around the world are concerned about computer crashes that might occur if software, written to recognize the year by the last two digits, mistakes 2000 for 1900.
The Senate panel and the Administration use the same analogy to describe the problem's domestic impact: a bad snowstorm that disrupts daily life for a few days at most.
Senator Gordon H. Smith, an Oregon Republican, said: Prepare but do not panic. Set aside some extra canned goods and bottled water, but do not stockpile.
Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat who is the committee's vice chairman, said, "We have tried to discount what I call the Y2K survivalist mentality."
Indeed, the Gartner Group, a research and consulting firm, has estimated that only 10 percent of any computer failures in the United States are expected to last more than three days. And the panel gave relatively high marks to the nation's utilities, telecommunications, financial and transportation areas.
But the report, the most comprehensive assessment of the year 2000 problem, singled out the nation's 6,000 hospitals, 50,000 nursing homes and 800,000 doctor offices for criticism. About 80 percent of doctors' offices and 50 percent of small- to medium-sized businesses have failed to take action, the report said.
The problem is more serious abroad, the senators said, because foreign governments either do not have the resources, the political will or the interest to deal with the problem, which could hamper everything from credit-card transactions to utilities.
Many nations are looking to the United States for help. Today, John A. Koskinen, President Clinton's year 2000 czar, was in the Philippines to discuss ways to avert breakdowns with 30 Asian-Pacific countries.
The Pentagon sent a delegation to Moscow last month to meet with Russian technical experts and lay the groundwork for a plan to have Russian specialists sit with their American counterparts this New Year's Eve in a joint missile-warning center in Colorado.

HEADLINE: In New Hampshire, Buchanan Rides Again

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., March 2

 BODY:
Patrick J. Buchanan, who in two previous Presidential forays fashioned himself the icon of the disaffected worker and the iconoclast of the Republican Party, is back for a third run.
"Mount up and ride to the sound of the guns," Mr. Buchanan ordered his loyalists today in announcing his latest bid for the Presidency and offering up his familiar platform: for restoring America's "lost sovereignty," for trade protection, for a moratorium on immigration and for "the rights of the innocent unborn." 
 Added to his populist stew was a repudiation of President Clinton, who, he said, has desecrated the White House by using it "to shake down corporate executives, to lie with abandon to the American people," and by turning it into "a place to exploit women." It is time, he said, "to call down the curtain on the sorry soap opera in the White House."
Mr. Buchanan's candidacy, which became abruptly evident when he took a leave from his role as co-host of the CNN television program "Crossfire" just a week ago, is widely perceived as more of a vanity run or even a mischief run than a serious campaign for the White House. Friends say he was bored with his television job, and even fervent supporters say he has little chance of becoming President.
But there is no denying the passion in his crusade against those he calls the elite global economists. And analysts say Mr. Buchanan, who won the 1996 New Hampshire primary, has the ability to shake up a Republican field crowded with lower-wattage conservatives who have been unable to distinguish themselves from one another.
"He will have a dramatic impact on the second- and third-tier candidates who are trying to carve out a niche on the right," said David Carney, a venerable New Hampshire Republican strategist who is not affiliated with any Presidential campaign. "He may peter out, but between now and Labor Day he will be the 800-pound gorilla in that half of the party and will drive these other guys crazy trying to figure out how to deal with him."
Greg Mueller, his communications chief in 1992 and 1996, said Mr. Buchanan seemed driven by a preoccupation with economic dislocation and believed it was an issue that no other candidate in either party was addressing.
"That's a cause and a mission that he's taken upon himself," Mr. Mueller said. "He believes that the Republican Party must identify with those working-class issues to rebuild the Reagan coalition to take back the White House."
Still, the populist pitch to the downtrodden worker may have less resonance in an economy that has now been expanding for eight years, and it is unclear whether the 60-year-old Mr. Buchanan can recapture the romanticism and the early momentum of his previous campaigns.
The candidate made today's announcement here in the state where he achieved his greatest electoral vindication: his 1996 triumph over Bob Dole, the party's eventual nominee, following a drive in which Mr. Buchanan conjured up the image of peasants "coming over the hills" with pitchforks and overthrowing the establishment.
New Hampshire's rough-hewn individualists have always been good to Mr. Buchanan, giving him 37 percent of the primary vote in 1992. George Bush won New Hampshire that year, but Mr. Buchanan's strong showing was a searing indictment of the incumbent President, who went on to lose to Mr. Clinton.
But the event today lacked the kind of full-dress, media-savvy theatrics that Buchanan watchers have come to expect. The usually spontaneous candidate, well practiced on his feet, read his speech to about 200 people at a sterile, low-ceiling conference center here. There was no music, no warm-up act, no grand entrance, no sense that something historic or even new was happening. Only one man came with a pitchfork, a smoothly carved work of art that was actually crafted in Germany, an unintended illustration of Mr. Buchanan's message that foreign-made goods are flooding the American market.
Except for his wife, Shelley, Mr. Buchanan has no entourage, no spokesmen, no consultants, no advance team. In part, that is the nature of his latest insurgent candidacy. But it also reflects the fact that his 1996 aides are working for other candidates this year. Mr. Mueller, for example, plans to sign up with Steve Forbes. Perhaps the biggest absence is that of Bay Buchanan, Mr. Buchanan's sister, who served as the central strategist in his previous campaigns. This year she plans to keep her job as a commentator at MSNBC.
Mr. Buchanan plays down the need for such aides.
"We find the big entourages cost you an awful lot of money," and "then you run out of money," he said in a brief interview as he stepped off a commercial flight at the airport here. "You don't need all this in the early days. These consultants, I used to know them when they were all kids. They weren't that bright then!"
At his announcement speech here, he was preaching to the converted. The single pitchfork-toting supporter, Craig Henne, a lumber salesman from Eliott, Me., said that when he heard that Mr. Buchanan was running again, he "dusted off" his old Buchanan bumper stickers from the last time around.
Mr. Henne said that even if Mr. Buchanan's campaign "amounts to nothing," he wanted to show his support for a man who says what he thinks and believes what he says.
At a rally with 1,300 people on Monday in the gritty steel town of Weirton, W.Va., Mr. Buchanan demonstrated something important: that he could conceivably win over support from those who had not voted for him before. Weirton is a heavily Democratic town where the steel mill, stricken by the "dumping" of cheap foreign imports, has become a cause celebre of Mr. Buchanan.
"He's the one well-known person who is taking an interest in what is happening to us," said Janet Stagani, a 55-year-old Democrat who works as a bookkeeper for the steelworkers' union. "If he's willing to take a stand regardless of the outcome, then I can support him regardless of the outcome. I'll see what my choices are down the road. But right now I want to give him a vote of confidence."

HEADLINE: Arkansas Roots, New York Panache;
Clintons Seem Suited to Local Political and Social Scenes

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

 BODY:
They cause traffic jams of epic proportions. They hold so many Manhattan fund-raisers that even their Democratic allies complain. They have endorsed policies that have infuriated labor unions, hospital officials, advocates for the poor, immigrants and, oh yes, Republicans.
So why is it that Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton seem so popular in New York? 
 That is a question many New Yorkers may be asking themselves these days as they watch Mrs. Clinton's very public exploration of whether to run for the United States Senate from New York next year.
They may also be pondering the question as they sit in midtown traffic waiting for Mrs. Clinton's motorcade to pass today and tomorrow. The First Lady is in town to deliver speeches before the Women's Leadership Forum and the United Nations, meet with local Democratic supporters and tour public schools in Queens and Manhattan.
In many ways, the idea that New Yorkers would embrace a former governor of Arkansas and his Illinois-born wife still seems a bit improbable. Neither has lived or worked in New York, and except for occasional excursions to Manhattan or the Hamptons, they have not even vacationed here much. Most of their visits have been to campaign or to raise money. And they have feuded with a host of local officials, including the Democratic senior Senator, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who is retiring next year.
Yet their connection to New York is strong for a range of reasons, including their deep base of support among major Democratic voting groups, the large number of New Yorkers in their inner circle, distrust of their conservative opponents and the sense among some people that they radiate New York-style panache and sophistication.
A consensus of New York pollsters say both Clintons' ratings tend to be several points higher in New York State than nationwide. Mr. Clinton's job approval ratings in New York have been hovering in the 60 percent range for more than a year now. And recent polls show Mrs. Clinton scoring between 60 and 70 percent favorable ratings statewide.
Voters seem to respect her even in traditionally Republican strongholds in the suburbs and upstate.
"New Yorkers like the Clintons," said John Zogby, a pollster from Utica. "Period."
The clearest reason is that New York is a Democratic state -- registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by a ratio of 3 to 2 -- and the Clintons, despite their many scandals, have been the most successful national Democratic politicians in a generation.
But it is more than that, political analysts assert. New York, they say, has higher concentrations of the voting groups that are the Clintons' most ardent supporters nationwide: professional women, homosexuals, Jews and black and Hispanic residents. "These are groups that are important to the Democratic Party nationally," said Philip Friedman, a Democratic public relations consultant in New York. "But they are absolutely central to the New York State Democratic Party."
Not all of those groups were big fans of the Clintons during the early years of the Administration. But through politics and policies, the Clintons have won them over. Many Irish-Americans, a major New York voting bloc that is no longer reliably Democratic, like Mr. Clinton for his role in helping to broker peace in Northern Ireland. Jewish-Americans have come to view the Administration as a stalwart defender of Israel.
And a preponderance of blacks view Mr. Clinton as not only sympathetic to their concerns about racism, but also extraordinarily in tune with their culture, black politicians and intellectuals say.
"Bill Clinton is functionally an African-American politician," said Manning Marable, director of African-American Studies at Columbia University, noting that the President gets higher approval ratings among blacks than many black officials.
But will the Administration, and Mr. Clinton's, high job ratings, rub off on Mrs. Clinton if she runs for the Senate? Mr. Marable says yes. "There is a general perception that she is to his left," he said. "And that is just fine. Because ideologically, black politics is social democratic. There is a deep belief in state intervention to redress social problems."
The same may not be true with other groups. Mrs. Clinton may be less trusted by Jews because of her open support for a Palestinian state. Wall Street barons who like the Administration's economic policies may be uncomfortable with Mrs. Clinton's more expansive view of government. Centrist Democrats and Republicans may view her as too liberal on crime or social issues.
"She is identified ideologically with the left," said Mitchell Moss, the director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University. "That helps her in New York City, and it mobilizes her core constituency. But New York State has not been electing liberals for a long time."
Republicans and some pollsters also say that the moment Mrs. Clinton becomes a candidate, her poll numbers will drop as she is pressured to explain her positions in detail and demonstrate her understanding of New York, a place where she has never lived. State law requires only that she be a resident as of Election Day next year to seek the Senate seat.
"She might have trouble showing she knows the differences between Detroit and Schenectady," said Adam Goodman, a Republican media consultant who worked on Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's 1997 re-election campaign. Mr. Giuliani is also considering running for the Senate next year.
Politics aside, the Clintons clearly have a social affinity for the city, one that many New Yorkers relish. There was the whirlwind birthday party for their daughter, Chelsea, a couple of years ago, complete with stops at performances on Broadway.
And the visits to the Hamptons, featuring the omnipresent shoulder-rubbing with society and Hollywood types. After all, even places as chic as the Hamptons and as sophisticate-minded as Manhattan like the validation conferred by a visit from the First Family.
What amazes some analysts is the fact that the Clintons have received such loyal support from core Democratic groups despite having taken positions that have angered those groups on numerous issues.
Many blacks objected vehemently to the 1994 crime bill that expanded the Federal death penalty and established mandatory sentences for many crimes. Black and immigrant politicians in New York were also furious with the President for signing the sweeping welfare bill in 1996 that sharply curtailed benefits.
New York hospital officials perennially fight proposed Administration cuts in health care spending. Most labor unions hated the North American Free Trade Act, which the President championed. Gay-rights advocates were deeply disappointed in 1996 when he signed legislation allowing states to outlaw same-sex marriages.
But what has helped the Clintons overcome anger with their positions on certain issues has been an even greater antipathy among New Yorkers toward the First Couple's opponents, many political analysts say.
"The Republican revolution of '94 and '95 really just scared the hell out of New Yorkers, including moderate Republicans," Mr. Zogby said.
Mr. Marable said, "Even though African-Americans have had many criticisms of this Administration, from the crime bill to the welfare bill, on balance, in the era of the Contract With America, in the era of the Christian Coalition, in the period of attacks on affirmative action, Clinton looks almost like a positive good rather than a necessary evil."
The Clintons' enemies may have helped them on another issue: impeachment, which appears to have solidified Mr. Clinton's support in New York and raised Mrs. Clinton's favorable ratings, analysts say. The First Lady has long been popular among professional women. But her stoic, steadfast defense of her husband last year won her additional support among more traditional, conservative women, pollsters say.
"I think the year softened her image," said Lee M. Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. "People can, in different ways, identify with the trauma she's gone through."
Judith Hope, chairwoman of the New York State Democratic Party, said Mrs. Clinton should therefore benefit in a race against Mr. Giuliani.
"I think New Yorkers see her as the personification of the new woman in transition," Ms. Hope said. "That she has juggled a child, a job and a loss of personal privacy with such style and grace really inspires women."
But while many people like Mrs. Clinton for standing by the President, a smaller but still substantial number of people seem to dislike her for exactly the same reason.
The Marist poll picked up on that paradox in the answers it received from respondents to the question: Why do you like Hillary Clinton more, or less, than you did two years ago? Many who said they liked her more used words like strong, dignified and poised to describe Mrs. Clinton's handling of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. But many who said they liked her less described her as weak, opportunistic or dishonest for sticking by her husband.
Some analysts say Mrs. Clinton may benefit from the competition between New York City, a place she professes to love, and Washington, a town she seems to despise. Many New York politicians assert that their hometown is more sophisticated than the nation's capital, more drawn to independent women, less upset by sexual scandals.
For that reason, Manhattan might be the ideal place for both Clintons to settle after he leaves office, whether she runs for the Senate or not.
"New Yorkers love people who live near the margins," said Mr. Moss, the N.Y.U. political scientist. "The very qualities that make people like Billy Martin or Joe Namath helps explain why they like the Clintons. New Yorkers like risk takers."

State's Jobless Rate Is Lowest Since 1989

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
The state's revised unemployment rate for 1998 was 4.6 percent, the lowest it has been since 1989, and well below the 1997 rate of 5.1 percent, officials said yesterday.
The revised rate, which takes into account data such as employers' wage reports, was two-tenths of a point below the preliminary annual figure of 4.8 percent released in January, said Kevin Smith, a spokesman for the State Labor Department. The national unemployment rate for 1998 was 4.5 percent. In terms of employment growth, New Jersey had a net gain of 66,000 jobs in 1998 from the year before, Mr. Smith said. 
 The state's January unemployment figure remained at 4.4 percent, the same as December's and the lowest monthly rate since 1990, Mr. Smith said. The national unemployment rate for the month was also lower than the state's, at 4.3 percent.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
All Three MajorIndicators Turn Down in Late Trading

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks ended lower yesterday, led by Intel and 3Com on concern that waning demand and increased competition will hurt profits in the computer and networking industries.
"People got overly optimistic about personal computer sales in the first quarter," said Bruce Simon, chief investment officer of the Glenmede Trust Company, which oversees $15 billion in Philadelphia. Recent warnings about slower growth at Compaq Computer and Dell Computer "caused people to ratchet down their expectations to a more reasonable level," he said. 
 The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index fell 36.15 points, or 1.6 percent, to 2,259.03. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 27.17 points, or three-tenths of a percent, to 9,297.61. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 10.66 points, or nine-tenths of a percent, to 1,225.50. 3Com slid the most on the index. All three market measures surrendered gains in late trading. Declining stocks outnumbered advancers on the New York Stock Exchange 15 to 14.
Intel, the most active issue, fell 7 1/4, to 109 13/16, bringing its losses in the last five trading days to 18 percent. Jonathan Joseph, an analyst at Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities, downgraded the world's largest computer-chip maker to "hold" from "buy," citing weak processor demand, sluggish earnings growth, a slow transition to the Pentium III chip and order cancellations. Yesterday, a Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette analyst also downgraded Intel.
Other semiconductor makers fell. Texas Instruments fell 5 3/4, to 86 1/2, and Micron Technology dropped 3 1/4, to 54 1/4.
3Com was halted after it fell 3 11/16, or 12 percent, to 27, on concern that the No. 2 networking company's fiscal third-quarter profit may lag behind forecasts because of price cuts and steeper competition.
Hewlett-Packard rose 2 3/4, to 68 5/8, after the company said it would separate its computer and printing business from its medical devices and electronic testing equipment. It will also replace its chief executive, Lewis Platt, when the transformation is completed by mid-2000.
Shares of airlines and consumer-products makers gained on optimism a strong economy will lift profits. Airline stocks rose after Glenn Engel, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company, raised the industry group to "moderate outperform" from "market weight."
UAL, the parent of United Airlines, rose 3 9/16, to 65 9/16. AMR, the parent of American Airlines, rose 1 3/4, to 57 7/8. Delta Air Lines gained 2 11/16, to 65 5/8, and Southwest Airlines climbed 1 1/4, to 31 3/8.
A report on Monday that personal income and spending rose more than expected in January added to confidence that consumers are continuing to spend freely.
Whirlpool climbed 2 3/4, to 43 3/4, after the world's top maker of large appliances said it expected double-digit increases in earnings for the first quarter and full year. The company also said it would buy back as much as $250 million in stock.
Xylan jumped 8 13/16, to 35 3/4, after Alcatel of France agreed to buy it for $2 billion. Alcatel, Europe's No. 2 phone-equipment maker, already owns 6 percent of the maker of networking equipment and is buying the rest to bolster its business of linking computers to phone networks and the Internet. The $37-a-share offer is a 37 percent premium to the close on Monday.
Auto stocks declined even as February car and truck sales exceeded estimates for a third straight month, amid concern that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates if consumers keep buying at this pace.
"These are blowout numbers," said David Garrity, an analyst with GVA Research L.L.C. "Assuming General Motors comes in at or slightly below expectations, this will be an annual rate of 16.8 million units. Sales this strong could tempt the Federal Reserve to take action."
Ford Motor fell 1 1/4, to 57 1/8, and General Motors lost 7/16, to 82 11/16.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 5, 1999, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article by Bloomberg News in Business Day on Wednesday, about the stock market, referred incorrectly to an earnings forecast that preceded a 6.7 percent rise in Whirlpool Corporation shares. Whirlpool predicted a double-digit increase in first-quarter and full-year operating earnings -- not in net earnings, which can be affected by one-time accounting adjustments and other extraordinary circumstances.

HEADLINE: GAME THEORY;
Cheating Death Has Never Been Easier

BYLINE: By J. C. Herz; E-mail address: Herz@nytimes.com

 BODY:
CHEATING is big business in video games. To Interact, the company that manufactures Game Shark "enhancement devices," it's worth $40 million a year.
Interact is the fifth-largest video game company in America. It makes no free-standing hardware. It doesn't publish a single software title. It has, however, sold two million pieces of plastic and silicon that plug into the back of a Sony Playstation or the cartridge slot of a Nintendo 64 to give the player invincibility, extra weapons, superpowers and access to hidden areas and bonus levels. If you want to fight the boss on the 17th level (and brag about it in the schoolyard), you don't have to invest 30 hours to master the game. Just plug in a Game Shark, which contains hundreds of cheat codes for all the hottest games in one package. 
 From a technological standpoint, cheat codes are nothing new. The factory that manufactures Game Sharks, in Manchester, England, was cranking out similar devices for the Commodore Amiga in 1979. A device called the Game Genie turbocharged thousands of eight-bit Nintendo consoles in the 1980's.
Game Shark's cheat codes function on the same principle as its predecessors. But it can do what early devices could not because the world of consumer electronics has changed radically.
The biggest difference can be summed up in two words: cheap memory. As any PC owner knows, the price of computer memory has taken a nose dive since the 1980's. Back then, it was much too expensive to put memory chips in a game peripheral, so there was no room to store codes. If you wanted to use a cheat code on your Nintendo machine with a Game Genie, you had to enter it manually every time you played, and the device could handle only one code at a time.
The Game Shark comes with hundreds of codes and a user-friendly software interface because four-megabyte memory chips cost $8. Cheap memory is what made beepers and cellular phones and Tamagotchis economically viable, and it makes the Game Shark a more robust and profitable device.
Cheap memory also makes stored information a more important part of the experience. People buy a Game Shark for the cheat codes stored on it, not for the raw device. Essentially, Interact is an information vendor. So the information has to be current. "Previous manufacturers of cheat devices treated them like toys," said Todd Hays, Interact's chief executive. "They made them as cheaply as possible, in one big batch, and shipped them all at Christmas.
"We decided that just wasn't going to work -- you've got to be able to promote these things year-round. So we invested in a help line, an 800 number for codes, a 900 number for really advanced codes. We invented Web site support. And we always ship very fresh product -- we treat it like a loaf of bread. If there's a hot new game coming out tomorrow, the Game Sharks we're shipping today will have a whole new fresh stash of codes."
Generating those codes involves a squad of full-time hackers who crank video games through high-powered computers and software algorithms. "On a television," Mr. Hayes said, "all you can see is the result of the programming. What we see is a million lines of actual code, and we have seasoned hackers that go through and look for aberrations.
"Our hacking stations are hooked up to a logic analyzer, and we've written software for it -- find all locations in the game where life equals zero. Boom, at the end of the game, and here and here and here -- these are all the places where you might die. Then you go and look at the code, and you might find a way you can avoid that place.
"We find all sorts of things. We even find things that the software company never meant for you to see, places you can't get to from normal game play. Sometimes developers put things in there, like the Tiger Woods game that Electronic Arts published -- there were some lines of code buried in there that produced a pretty offensive scene from 'South Park.' Electronic Arts found out about it and recalled the product.
"It's rare for something like that to get past quality control, but it happens -- a lot of these programmers are so creative and so artistic, and they're cooped up in these little rooms, and it's a challenge for them to get something past their boss. It's an anti-Establishment, rebel thing to do -- let's see if the bug police can find it."
In that sense, the hardware hackers at Interact are the ultimate gamers, uncovering everything that is meant to be found, as well as a few things that are meant to stay buried. Software, by its very nature, is a palimpsest -- there are always layers that no one is supposed to see. A piece of hardware loaded with cheat codes is a lens that reveals those layers.
The larger question is whether the use of this device qualifies as cheating. What a Game Shark allows you to do is have more extensive access, at your discretion, to the software you already own. In game play, that is called cheating. But if you buy a book and skip to page 200, or rent a movie and fast forward to your favorite scene, does that count as cheating? If you're doing scientific research and discover a technique that yields vast quantities of high-quality information at blinding speed, does that qualify as cheating?
If the object is to gain knowledge of a system, which is the ultimate object of any computer game, then what separates cheating from learning? And if using a Game Shark isn't cheating, then what is?
"I don't know," Mr. Hayes said. "That's a good question. I suppose if you changed the game code itself. Like, there's another company that makes devices, and their claim to fame most recently was a nude Lara Croft code for Tomb Raider. We went in and investigated this, and it turned out that there was no nude Lara Croft in the game, that what they'd actually done was take skin tone from other parts of the game and paste it over her bathing suit so that she looked nude.

HEADLINE: ARTS ABROAD;
France Playing Catch-Up In the Arts?

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI 

 BODY:
Delacroix, Cezanne, Manet, Monet, Matisse . . . and, and? While people around the world are lining up to see French masters, not to mention expatriates like van Gogh and Picasso who spent most of their careers in France, the country's contemporary artists are not exactly carrying on the tradition.
Germany can boast of international art stars like Gerhard Richter, Anselm Kiefer and Sigmar Polke. Britain can take pride in Lucian Freud and young Brit Pack artists like Damien Hirst and Rachel Whiteread. And the United States has Jasper Johns, Richard Serra, Bruce Nauman, Elizabeth Murray, Cindy Sherman and many more. 
 But France? "We have Arman, but he is of a different generation," said Pierre Buhler, the French cultural counselor in New York. "And Christian Boltanski. Annette Messager and Sophie Calle have had some success here. You know Kiefer is now working in France. But we will not appropriate him."
The situation is galling to a nation ever eager to proclaim its cultural superiority.
The French Government, in inimitable dirigiste fashion, is now trying to intervene. If all goes as planned next fall, dozens of galleries, contemporary art centers, museums and art schools on the West Coast will participate in "Cote Ouest: A Season of French Contemporary Art." The promotional material for the event, which was planned by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, says it is "the biggest initiative to date to promote foreign art in the United States."
To pull it off, France had to dangle a few enticements. Through itsembassy in the United States and the Association Francaise d'Action Artistique, a Government-financed agency, it paid for American museum and gallery curators to visit France to view the available art. It offered subsidies to art centers that agreed to show work in the United States. It promised to bring French artists to the United States as well for workshops and lectures.
Etant Donnes, a French-American Fund for Contemporary Art, volunteered to help museums find American corporate and foundation sponsors for exhibitions. The principal benefactors of Etant Donnes, aside from the Florence Gould Foundation in New York, are all French: Air France, Banque Nationale de Paris and the Government.
When everything is added up, Government and private support for "Cote Ouest" may exceed $1 million. Which is not extraordinary. In 1998 French Government agencies spent about $500,000 promoting their contemporary artists in the United States even though nothing big like "Cote Ouest" was on the agenda.
Other countries, including Britain, promote their artists too. But Mr. Buhler said that "no other country has such a comprehensive approach. Other countries do one thing and then wait 10 years to do something else. Ours is ongoing."
French artists lag nonetheless, the magazine L'Express observed last fall in an article about New York's rule over the art world. Michael Kimmelman, the chief art critic of The New York Times, was among the experts interviewed by the magazine. "For the visual arts, France is now considered to be the rear guard among the great European nations," he said. Though it was the center of the art world until World War II, he added, "France pretty much dropped off the map" by the 1960's and 70's.
Mr. Buhler brushed off such talk. "It's possible that our artists are not known enough and were not marketed or did not market themselves enough," he said.
Some Americans agree. Shoshana Wayne, who owns a gallery in Santa Monica, Calif., and who intends to participate in "Cote Ouest," cited the publicity coups by France's rivals. "There is very good work being done in France right now," she said, "but the galleries, the museums, the collectors and the Government are not creating a scene the way they do in London."
But many more experts say the reasons for France's decline in artistic standing run deeper. Some cite a dearth of French collectors of contemporary art and France's failure over the years to generate the wealth that begets new collectors (in contrast to the stronger economies and healthy collecting ranks in Britain and Germany). Others say that French artists suffer because they shun the commercial system that creates "hot" art stars. It is also possible that French art is simply in a fallow period.
 
Blaming The Bureaucracy
Other experts say that France's arts bureaucracy, which gives generous grants and even helps artists find studios, has stifled rather than fostered creativity. "We have the impression of an institutionalized system, where creativity is sustained by the state," Mr. Kimmelman told L'Express. "And this induces a certain complacency."
Possibly at the risk of reinforcing such impressions, then, France is organizing "Cote Ouest." "We in the embassy and in the A.F.A.A. decided to go as big as we could," Mr. Buhler said. They invited West Coast curators and dealers to Paris to visit museums, galleries and artists and subsidized the trips. "About 10 went, possibly more," Mr. Buhler said. Thomas Collins, an associate curator at the Henry Art Gallery of the University of Washington, for example, spent a week and a half in France last fall, visiting about 18 studios, about 10 art centers and several galleries.
Then, Mr. Buhler said: "The whole thing snowballed, and now we have such demand. It's unprecedented to have an exhibition stretch over so many miles." Come October, he hopes, 12 museums, 5 universities, 9 alternative spaces, 3 public art projects, 19 galleries and an art fair will take part in "Cote Ouest."
The list of participating institutions is, however, a work in progress, and there appears to be a little hype as well as hope in the project.
The Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, for example, is on the list and did send a curator to Paris to research French artists, courtesy of the event's French sponsors. But the museum will not take part. Kathleen S. Bartels, the museum's associate director, said that the research was not complete and added that a fall show "didn't fit in our schedule."
Officials at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art said that its schedule for October through January was also fully booked by the time the French approached them, although the museum is cited in the organizers' news release as a definite participant.
Robert A. Sobieszek, the photography curator at the museum, explained the discrepancy. In a history of photographic portraiture that he has been working on for 30 years, he is including French items, from 1830's daguerreotypes to current work of Orlan, a woman who alters her appearance through numerous plastic surgery operations and then photographs herself. "I already had some French stuff in it, but I haven't changed the show," he said.
Not that there was no temptation: "If I did a whole project," Mr. Sobieszek said, "they offered me up to $20,000, and they said they would bring the artist out."
 
Criterion of Success Is Hard to Define
The Portland Art Museum in Oregon cannot join in either. "I'm disappointed that we can't participate," said Kathryn Kanjo, the contemporary art curator. "But because we are expanding, our exhibition space is sorely limited. We knew all along that if we did participate, it would have to be in an extragallery way, outside museum walls."
But there are a number of participants. Mr. Collins, curator of the Henry Art Gallery, said that the gallery would show works by Gilles Barbier. In San Francisco, the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts plans to exhibit sketches and sculptures by Jean-Michel Othoniel, and Camera Work will show photos by Stephane Couturier. Several commercial galleries are planning exhibits.
Ms. Wayne, the gallery owner in Santa Monica, said: "I thought this was a great opportunity. I can't talk about the money, but that's not the reason I'd do it."
At this point it is hard to determine whether "Cote Ouest" will succeed or what criteria should applyin judging it. "From a P.R. standpoint, it couldn't fail to gain attention," Mr. Collins said. "And I'm looking forward to seeing a lot of these exhibits." He thinks he will show more French artists in the future now that he is familiar with their work.
Still, other art experts doubt that "Cote Ouest" will change attitudes toward French art. "Given the efficiency of communications today, works of art of interest and quality float to the surface of public perception pretty quickly, internationally and nationally," said Lucy Mitchell-Innes, a dealer and the former head of Sotheby's contemporary art department in New York.
"A good artist gets shows in New York with ease today, and Paris is not some forgotten, out of the way place," she said. "One really has to look at what's being made there."

Prices Retreat AFifth Time In Seven Days

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The price of United States bonds fell yesterday for the fifth time in seven days as the General Motors Corporation reported stronger-than-expected February car sales, the latest sign that the economy is booming.
The price on the benchmark 30-year bond dropped 1 4/32 , to 93 23/32 , while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose 8 basis points, to 5.69 percent, from 5.61 percent on Tuesday. The yield has risen more than one-half of a percentage point so far this year as reports on jobs, manufacturing and consumer confidence have shown a robust economy.
Investors fret that too much growth will lead to faster inflation and will prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates later in the year, have driven down the price.
"The worst is not over," said Eric Cheung of the Wilmington Trust Corporation in Wilmington, Del. "There's no question about it -- it all comes back to the economy."
Yields on two-year notes, the most actively traded Treasuries, rose 4 basis points, to 5.17 percent.
Corporate bond sales also drew demand away from Treasuries, traders said. Fannie Mae, the largest provider of United States home mortgage financing, sold $3 billion of three-year notes.
And this trend could continue. The AT&T Corporation is expected to sell several billion dollars of debt in coming days. Lucent Technologies Inc., Pepsi-Cola Bottling Group and the Charter Communications Corporation are all planning sales of $1 billion or more in the weeks ahead.
Bonds fell yesterday as G.M. said that United States sales of North American-built cars and light trucks rose 18 percent, to 382,261 in February, beating estimates of a 6.4 percent increase. "That was important, and bonds fell right after the release," said Tony Crescenzi, head of fixed income at Miller Tabak Hirsch & Company in New York.
With 19 of 24 auto makers reporting through yesterday, February sales were 11 percent ahead of the comparable month a year earlier.
Bonds also fell as the National Association of Purchasing Management said its index of nonmanufacturing business activity rose for the second consecutive month to 57 in February from 54 in January. The report measures activity at service providers, farms and other companies.
The report is a sign that first-quarter economic growth "is closer to 3.8 percent rather than 3 percent," said Christopher Rupkey, senior financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in New York.
That kind of growth may lead the Fed to raise interest rates later in the year. Market indicators, such as futures on eurodollars, or dollars held by banks outside the United States, reflect trader expectations for an increase.
The approach of tomorrow's jobs report also has investors concerned about the economy's strength.
The report will probably show that the economy added about 243,000 nonfarm jobs last month, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. The unemployment rate is expected to hold at 4.3 percent, the lowest in nearly three decades.
"The market is going to be on the defensive" before the release, said Rob McCool, a trader at First Chicago Capital Markets Inc.
To be sure, low inflation makes bonds attractive to some. Inflation in 1998 ran at its slowest pace in 12 years.

HEADLINE: New York's Job Growth in '98 Was Best Since '84, State Says

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
Companies in New York State added jobs in 1998 at the fastest pace since 1984, and the number of jobs in the private sector continued to grow in January, the State Department of Labor announced yesterday.
Private sector jobs grew by 2.3 percent last year, to 6.8 million, and 1,000 more jobs were added in January, according to the Labor Department's newly revised figures. The figures are adjusted for seasonal factors; without such adjustments, the number of jobs would have fallen in January, as they do every year after the holiday season. 
 Unemployment in the state fell to 5.2 percent in January from 5.4 percent in December, mostly because the jobless rate in New York City fell to 7.6 percent from 8 percent, adjusted for seasonal factors. In the rest of the state, unemployment remained flat at 3.8 percent, compared with a national average of 4.3 percent.
The Pataki administration used yesterday's news to argue that the upstate economy was pulling out of the long slump that began in the early 1990's. Growth upstate has lagged growth in New York City, where a booming securities market has helped spark an economic surge.
"While the rate of growth downstate has been higher, the number of jobs upstate is now at a record high," said Stephen Kagann, chief economist to Gov. George E. Pataki.
Jobs in manufacturing continued to fall in the year ended January, but the declines were relatively minimal in industries that make things like industrial equipment and other so-called durable goods. The biggest drops in manufacturing were in businesses that are concentrated downstate, like the printing and garment industries, which lost 6,900 jobs.
Service industries continued to boom, adding more than 100,000 jobs. Growth was especially strong in motion pictures, business services and engineering, according to the Labor Department figures. Jobs in retailing and construction also jumped in the last year.
Binghamton tied with New York City as the metropolitan area with the fastest job growth in the 12 months ending in January, according to state figures. In both places, the number of jobs grew by 2.4 percent. For the entire state, the number of jobs grew by 1.9 percent.
New York now ranks about 20th among the states in terms of job growth, Mr. Kagann said. In 1992 and 1993, the state hovered in last place among the states, because it was still losing jobs while other states were growing, he said.
Despite the fast growth of jobs in the city, the unemployment rate in the five boroughs remains high. The jobless rate in the Bronx is 9.7 percent; in Brooklyn, 9.6 percent; in Queens, 7.1 percent; in Manhattan, 6.9 percent, and in Staten Island, 7.1 percent.
The highest unemployment in the state is in Hamilton County in the Adirondacks, where the jobless rate was 15.2 percent in January.

HEADLINE: Iran's Impulse for Change

 BODY:
The power of democracy is altering Iran. Unofficial results from municipal elections show that Iranians overwhelmingly supported moderate politicians associated with President Mohammad Khatami. The voting mirrored the presidential election that swept Mr. Khatami to power two years ago. Though conservative clerics remain the paramount rulers of Iran, Iranians are clearly impatient to lift religious repression and transform their country.
Iran's Constitution, adopted after Ayatollah Khomeini's 1979 Islamic revolution, provides for local elections, but none were held for two decades. Mr. Khatami called last Friday's vote hoping to create a more decentralized civil society that could support his agenda of political and social change. His gamble apparently paid off. The winners included liberal clerics like Abdollah Nouri, a Khatami ally who was forced out of the national Cabinet last year by clerical conservatives and who has now been elected to the Teheran city council. The high turnout that carried many moderate candidates to victory may now embolden Mr. Khatami to take further conciliatory steps toward America. 
 Washington would benefit greatly from the development of a more moderate and internationally responsible Iran, and should do what it can to encourage change. While continuing to support exchanges by sports teams and cultural groups, the Clinton Administration should begin to ease trade restrictions against Iran in ways that would have the most impact on ordinary Iranians.
The White House rightly insists that normal relations cannot be completely restored until Iran stops trying to build nuclear and other unconventional weapons, severs its links with terrorism and accepts peacemaking efforts between Israeli and Arab leaders. Iran has distanced itself from terror and now concedes the Palestinians' right to make peace with Israel. If further steps can be taken, the Mideast will be a safer place and Iran may resume its traditional role as a regional counterweight to Iraq.
Specifically, the White House should approve a request by an American trading company, pending since last year, to sell three million tons of grain and 400,000 tons of sugar requested by the Iranian Government. President Clinton also ought to ease restrictions on American imports of Iranian carpets, leaving in place only measures to discourage the exploitation of child labor. Neither step requires Congressional action. American food sales would make it easier for the Khatami Government to subsidize the diet of families hurt by collapsed world oil prices. Permitting carpet imports would allow the creation of many new Iranian jobs. Iran's people have once again voted for change. America should welcome their democratic choice and extend new opportunities for friendship.

According to the Council on Economic Priorities, an environmental group based in New York, car buyers face a rock-and-a-hard-place choice: They can buy cars that were made in nonpolluting plants or cars that run clean themselves, but they cannot do both. 
 In a report released yesterday, the council lauds the fuel efficiency, and thus environmental cleanliness, of the Honda Civic and Mitsubishi Mirage. But it criticizes Honda of America Manufacturing and Mitsubishi Motor Manufacturing of America for the high levels of pollutants spewing out of the Ohio and Illinois plants where the cars are made.
It cites the Chrysler Jeep Grand Cherokee as a gas guzzler, even when compared with other sport utility vehicles. But it praises the Toledo, Ohio, plant where the Cherokee is made as one of the cleanest around.
"Some of the most polluting cars are made at the least-polluting facilities, while the clean cars are coming out of dirty plants," said Romi Chin Gottfrid, an environmental research associate at the council.
None of the plants mentioned in the study are flagrant violators of state or Federal environmental regulations. A spokeswoman for the Environmental Protection Agency, while acknowledging the "irony that sometimes clean products come from dirty facilities," indicated that the agency was not particularly incensed by the study.
Ms. Gottfrid responded, "Regulators should be holding these companies to a higher standard."
Not surprisingly, none of the companies are apologizing. "We've taken pro-active action to minimize environmental impact," said a Mitsubishi spokeswoman, who added that "the council's data is incomplete." Ron Lietzke, a spokesman for Honda of America, said that Honda's four Ohio plants were recently certified as environmentally sound by the International Organization for Standardization in Geneva. "We have continuous, active efforts going to reduce our emissions, waste and use of natural resources," he said.
DaimlerChrysler A.G., which makes the Jeep Grand Cherokee, meanwhile, is focusing on the praise. "We're very pleased that our employees' efforts to address environmental performance have been recognized," said Sonja Bultynck, an environmental spokeswoman.
And about that nagging fuel efficiency problem? "Well, the 1999 Cherokee is 7 percent more fuel efficient than the 1998 model," she said.

HEADLINE: Should We Cut Social Security Loose?

BYLINE: By Charles J. Zwick and Peter A. Lewis; Charles J. Zwick and Peter A. Lewis were, respectively, director and assistant director of the United States Bureau of the Budget (now the Office of Management and Budget) under President Lyndon Johnson.

 BODY:
Two conservative members of Congress -- Representative Wally Herger, a California Republican, and Representative David Minge, a Minnesota Democrat -- have introduced a bill that would separate Social Security from the rest of the Federal budget. Their rationale sounds persuasive enough on the surface: to protect future retirees by preventing Social Security's current surpluses from being absorbed into other parts of the budget.
But a little history is in order. The move would mean reversing a carefully considered decision made 30 years ago. 
 Until 1968 there were three Federal budgets: an administrative budget, a cash budget and a trust fund budget, which included Social Security. These budgets were consolidated on the recommendation of a bipartisan commission appointed by President Lyndon Johnson. The commission's reasoning was that the operations of the Federal Government must be viewed in total to correctly measure their impact on the economy.
Of course, the commission recognized that it was not beyond the ability of economists to add up three different numbers. But the public and the press, it realized, usually latch onto just one.
Now, as then, failing to include Social Security with the rest of the budget would create a distorted understanding of the state of the nation's finances. Public debate -- and Congressional debate -- would become confused as different factions argued from different sets of numbers to make political (but not necessarily reliable) points.
The separation of the Social Security budget was a relic of President Franklin Roosevelt's original conception of the program, which was that it was simply an insurance plan rather than a concrete recognition of the Government's obligation to senior citizens. But ever since the 1930's, it is along the latter lines that Social Security has developed.
Separate budgets make sense only if one believes that Social Security and other trust funds handled by the Government are essentially private-sector operations or have no impact on the rest of the economy. But Social Security is based on involuntary collections by the Government. It's hard to equate these payments with the kinds of retirement plans offered by Merck or Microsoft.
Taking Social Security out of the overall budget would make that budget look worse now, because Congress taps into Social Security funds to pay for other programs. If conservatives are still hoping to seek a tax cut, citing the current Government surplus, why would they want to weaken their case by making the budget appear less flush? That's what would happen if they stripped away the Social Security trust fund. This effect would not appear to be consistent with conservative priorities.
A more plausible explanation is that the proposal is part of a continuing effort to privatize Social Security. The inclusion of Social Security in the unified Federal budget presupposes that Social Security is a Government program -- in other words, a Government obligation.
Taking Social Security out of the unified budget would be a victory -- albeit a small one -- for those who would remove the obligations for Social Security from the Government. And it would make intelligent public debate on the economy more difficult -- as the Presidential commission recognized 30 years ago.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Shares End Day Mixed, With the Dow Falling by 21.73

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Stocks ended mixed yesterday after slumping technology shares rallied in the final hour, pulling the major market gauges up with them.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 21.73 points, or two-tenths of a percent, to 9,275.88, after rising as much as 40 points and shedding as much as 86 before trimming its losses in the final 30 minutes. 
 Broader indexes, which are more heavily stocked by technology shares, were lower most of the day but crossed into positive territory late in the session. The Nasdaq composite index ended up 6.17 points, or nearly three-tenths of a percent, to 2,265.20, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.20 points, or nearly two-tenths of a percent, to 1,227.70. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.48 points, or six-tenths of a percent, to 391.95.
Computer stocks dropped after 3Com, which sells Internet data, voice and video systems, said on Tuesday that its third-quarter operating earnings would be far below analysts' expectations because of an unexpected slowdown in sales to businesses in the United States and Latin America. 3Com fell 2 3/8, to 24 5/8, in Nasdaq trading after dropping from 27 in after-hours trading on Tuesday.
3Com's statement came after similar warnings of soft sales from Compaq Computer and Micron Electronics, a unit of Micron Technology.
Technology stocks tried to weather the storm early but ran out of steam by early afternoon. Still, some companies had gains. After 3Com, the most active stocks were Intel, up 4 7/8, to 114 11/16 ; Compaq, up 1 15/16 , to 33 7/8; Dell Computer, up 2 7/8, to 80 15/16 , and Microsoft, up 1 1/16 , to 149 5/8.
Stocks were pushed lower by the bond market, where prices sank after the National Association of Purchasing Management said its index of nonmanufacturing activity rose to 57 percent in February from 54 percent in January. But the group's index of nonmanufacturing prices eased, to 46.5 percent from 47 percent.
"The specific problem, short term, is the bond market and rising yields," said Larry Wachtel, a market analyst at Prudential Securities. With stock prices so high, "it's very hard to justify these valuations when interest rates are rising."
Meanwhile, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, restated his reservations about President Clinton's proposal to invest a significant portion of the nation's Social Security trust fund in the stock market.
Addressing a Congressional subcommittee, Mr. Greenspan said such a plan could encourage investments for political reasons in companies that are not well run or discourage investments in companies that could earn the best return for future retirees.
Investing Social Security money in the stock market could also lead to higher overall interest rates and curb economic growth, while doing "little or nothing" to make sure the retirement needs of the next century are met, Mr. Greenspan said.
His remarks ruffled a market that was already poised to continue a selloff of technology shares while no other sector has stepped forward to lead the market higher, said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter in New York. "This market is locked in a trading range," Mr. Bleier said. "You are in the process of building some very serious negative sentiment, far more negative than we've seen in several months."
Declining issues led advancers by 16 to 13 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume was moderately heavy.

HEADLINE: A Haughty Blast From Communism's Past

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: ROME, March 3

 BODY:
On his first vacation as Italy's Prime Minister, Massimo D'Alema took his family on a private visit to New York over Christmas. His children wanted to see the Broadway musical "Cats" and F. A. O. Schwarz. Mr. D'Alema, a former Communist, wanted to see what the world's leading superpower has to offer, so he also went to eat at the TriBeCa Grill, the trendy downtown restaurant.
"It was nothing special," he said with a shrug. He then explained that there are only three cuisines in the world: French, Italian and Chinese. Italy, he said, was most important because it had given civilization its first real "proletarian dish," pizza. Pressed, Mr. D'Alema conceded that he had eaten well at one place in New York, Asia de Cuba a Cuban-Chinese restaurant in midtown. 
 Mr. D'Alema, who will turn 50 in April, became the first former Communist to lead a Western European Government in October, and he underlines the word "former." But even in small talk he retains a trace of 1970's left-wing hauteur.
When he holds his first official meeting with President Clinton in Washington on Friday, Government officials and ordinary Americans will get a first-hand look at a Prime Minister who is fiercely intelligent, confident and direct. Mr. D'Alema is also cold and quite free of easy charm. As he himself recently confessed to a television talk show host, "As a child, I was antipatico," using an Italian word that means displeasing.
Like Socialist leaders now in power in Germany, France and England, Mr. D'Alema has distanced himself from the most ideological extremes of his party and recast himself as a moderate. So far, his economic and foreign policies have mirrored those of his predecessor, Romano Prodi, a centrist. Mostly, Mr. D'Alema differs from the affable Mr. Prodi in background and personality. Mr. D'Alema's churlish assessment of American cuisine, delivered during an informal chat with foreign journalists in January, may have also been colored by his mood at that moment. At the time, the Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan was in Italy and seeking political asylum there.
Mr. D'Alema was under intense pressure from Turkey and the United States to turn him over for trial in Turkey. The Ocalan affair was his first real foreign policy test as Prime Minister, and also his first taste of how the United States can squeeze an ally.
Mr. D'Alema refused to extradite Mr. Ocalan on the ground that Italian law forbids the extradition of prisoners to countries with death penalties. The United States reacted harshly at first, then backed off publicly and switched to nagging private diplomacy. Turkey threatened economic boycotts and worse.
Mr. D'Alema, who is sympathetic to the Kurdish cause, initially suggested Italy might grant Mr. Ocalan political asylum. The United States, Turkey and his many political opponents at home bludgeoned him for it, and Mr. D'Alema began searching for other solutions.
Germany, which feared a blowup within its large Turkish and Kurdish minorities, refused to take him, even though Germany had outstanding warrants for his arrest. Hopes for an international trial dried up under Turkey's opposition.
Italy finally asked Mr. Ocalan to leave in mid-January, and he ended up under Greek protection in Kenya. Turkish commandos captured him there, and he is now in a Turkish prison awaiting trial.
Mr. D'Alema, who sought a principled approach but eventually had to bow to realpolitik, views the episode as a learning experience -- but for the United States and Europe, not for himself.
"If we defend the rights of the Albanians in Kosovo, and rightly so, then I think we have to also defend the rights of the Kurdish minority," he said in an interview in his office last week. He said he would raise the issue of Kurdish rights with Mr. Clinton. "We cannot split up Turkey, but there are other national issues there which must be addressed by the West, by the United States and Europe together," he said.
But foreign policy is not the most urgent problem on the Prime Minister's agenda. Mr. D'Alema, who came into office pledging to reduce Italy's unemployment rate, which in some areas of the south is about 23 percent, is facing many hurdles. Italy's economy in 1998 showed the slowest growth rate in Europe: 1.4 percent instead of the 2.5 percent goal the Prodi Government set when Italy agreed to adopt the new European currency, the euro.
Mr. D'Alema has made it his mission to reform the chaotic and chronically unstable Italian electoral system and create a two-party system. He faces opposition from the conservative right wing, and even his allies are not exactly on board. This month, Mr. Prodi created his own center-left party, which is likely to further splinter the left.
Mr. D'Alema is the first Italian Prime Minister to hold weekly news conferences. Yet his relationship with the Italian press is not exactly cozy. One of his closest aides, Fabrizio Rondolino, his media adviser, was forced to resign last month after steamy accounts surfaced of Mr. Rondolino's newly published erotic novel. Mr. D'Alema accepted his resignation but also attacked the "vulgarity" of the Italian media. Italian newspaper columnists paint Mr. D'Alema as arrogant and remote, but they have also attacked him for recent appearances on popular television shows intended to warm up his image.
Mr. D'Alema says the media assaults are the result of his unstinting honesty. "Perhaps mistakenly, I have always said what I thought," he explained.
But Mr. D'Alema is also heavily scrutinized for his Communist past. His parents were Communists and his father was a high-ranking party official. As a child, Mr. D'Alema was sent to Soviet summer camp at Artek, the Soviet union's most prestigious international "pioneer" camp on the Black Sea.
He mostly spoke French to fellow campers, he recalled. "At the time, it was the international language of choice." (Mr. D'Alema now studies English during his lunch breaks, in an effort to improve his communication skills at NATO meetings and summits of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations).
He was the head of the Young Communist League in the 1970's, and edited l'Unita, the Communist Party newspaper, from 1988 to 1990. In 1991, against the backdrop of the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Italian Communists splintered, and Mr. D'Alema left to form a non-Marxist party, Democrats of the Left. Since then, he has often denounced the mistakes of Communism, but he gets irritated when Italian journalists harp on his own.
"Many of these gentlemen were to my left, advocating armed insurrection," he said. "My past is also their past."
Mr. D'Alema, whose trip will be his fourth to the United States, said he is not anti-American, but he acknowledged that he sees the United States through the eyes of a left-wing European intellectual. And that includes a dim view of American popular culture.
"I am a Benigni fan," he said, referring to Italian director and actor Roberto Benigni, whose Holocaust comedy, "Life Is Beautiful," won seven Academy Award nominations this year.
"Naturally, I hope that this time, the Americans will not betray our hopes and expectations," Mr. D'Alema said, referring to Oscar night later this month. But he added that his own expectations were confounded by the film's popularity with ordinary Americans. "I never would have imagined it," he said. "It improved my image of the United States, the fact that this film could be successful there, because it is a film that forces one to think."

HEADLINE: Thais Show Albright the Fruits of American Aid: Meaningful Jobs and Legal Crops

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: CHIANG MAI, Thailand, March 3

 BODY:
Madeleine K. Albright put a human face on foreign policy today, listening to a group of young Thai women explain how American aid money had helped turn them away from drugs and prostitution and toward meaningful jobs.
It was unusual for an American Secretary of State to be sitting at a table with rural women one-third her age in an out-of-the-way town in northern Thailand. Proudly, Ms. Albright acknowledged as much. 
 "I'm doing things secretaries of state didn't do," she told the women, some in the ornate dress and headgear of the hill-tribe people. "Partially because they interest me but more importantly because they are new elements of American foreign policy." In the United States, she said, "combating drugs is a job for the Secretary of State."
Ms. Albright met with trainees from the New Life Center and Thai Women of Tomorrow to highlight what money from the United States Agency for International Development can do.
The programs, which Hillary Rodham Clinton visited two years ago, claim success in educating and then giving vocational training to girls who have been rescued from opium-addicted parents, or from brothels and drug dens.
Ms. Albright arrived in Thailand primarily to support the Government in its painful path of economic reform after the financial crash in 1997. The Thai economy is still shrinking, but Clinton Administration officials said the worst appeared to be over.
But before meetings in Bangkok, Ms. Albright wanted to show the importance of dealing with the social side of the financial crisis.
In rural Thailand, young women are expected to become the breadwinners for elderly parents and relatives. Without jobs, they become vulnerable targets for traffickers in women and prostitution rings.
One of the women at the round-table session with Ms. Albright, Chanpen Promsen, 21, told how after finishing school she had stayed at home looking after her family.
A former teacher got in touch with her and suggested she go to Bangkok for six months of vocational training under the Women for Tomorrow program, Ms. Promsen said, and is now employed as a garment worker. "I'm making money and can support my family," Ms. Promsen said.
Earlier today, Ms. Albright took a 20-minute drive through tropical vegetation of banana and bamboo trees to the village of Nong Hoi, where the Thai royal family has been helping farmers grow fruit and vegetables instead of opium. The Thai Government has made substantial progress in eliminating opium-growing in northern Thailand, which is part of the area known as the Golden Triangle.
Ms. Albright went out of her way to praise the Thais for curbing opium growing by the introduction of crop substitution.
"This is in marked contrast to the country of Burma, where they are not doing the kinds of things you are doing," she said. In the last two years, she said, Washington has contributed $1.3 million to the crop substitution program.
"Here we are saying no to narcotics and yes to vegetables," said Ms. Albright.
Local farmers who used to earn the equivalent of $100 a year from opium now earn about $1,200, he said.
"That's stunning," Ms. Albright said. "It's not as though they are losing money; they are making money."

HEADLINE: Kingstown Journal;
An Outpost in the Banana and Marijuana Wars

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: KINGSTOWN, St. Vincent and the Grenadines

 BODY:
When American troops helped destroy more than one million marijuana plants in December in the rugged northern regions of this island, growers were outraged. They protested on radio and in front of Government offices. They appealed to business and political leaders. They even started a petition drive to ask President Clinton for damages.
"The Americans are not showing any real concern for our economic and social development," said Junior Cottle, chairman of a group of marijuana growers who described himself as "representative of the ganja man." 
 Mr. Cottle said he did not grow marijuana but did smoke it.
Marijuana is not legal here. But its production in the remote mountains has, American officials said, taken off in recent years, making St. Vincent the second largest grower in the Caribbean, after Jamaica.
Growers said they were turning to the crop to deal with an unemployment rate that is officially 20 percent but that many people here say is far higher.
The animosity directed at the United States comes from two directions. Residents have a feeling that Washington has abandoned this corner of the world, now that the cold war is over and it no longer sees a Communist threat in the Caribbean.
There is also a marked hostility against Mr. Clinton for waging war with Europe over banana trade preferences, the legitimate backbone of the economy.
The nub of the dispute is that Europe unfairly favors bananas grown by its former colonies, including this onetime British outpost, where English is spoken and cricket is a favorite sport. The preference discriminates against American companies that produce bananas, the United States says.
Officials here say removing the import protections would deal an economic catastrophe to countries that have little capacity to grow anything else and whose bananas are costly to grow. Some Government and business leaders say the United States risks undermining its anti-drug efforts in the region if banana growers turn to drugs -- not just marijuana, but also trafficking in Colombian heroin and cocaine as alternatives.
At the very least, some Caribbean experts note, the banana issue is creating such deep resentment that it may compromise the willingness of Caribbean countries to continue cooperating in anti-drug efforts.
"When Caricom countries meet in July, I think you'll see a bold statement of resistance," said Ivelaw Griffith, a Caribbean expert at Florida International University in Miami. Caricom is the Caribbean Community, the regional economic association.
Marijuana growers here are seeking to anger the public against further eradication while exploring an agenda that includes promoting marijuana for medicinal purposes and pushing for job creation in fishing and nonbanana agriculture.
The president of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce, Martin Barnard, said of the United States' stance: "People don't understand it. They're saying, 'What more can they do to us?' "
Prime Minister James F. Mitchell, who asked for the mission in December, refused to see the farmers, telling them in a terse letter in November that his Government was "firmly opposed to the illegal drug trade."
Mr. Mitchell said in an interview that he would like to see even more American assistance to curb marijuana cultivation and the heroin and cocaine trafficking through the Caribbean. But he said he regarded the friend in drug control as a foe on the banana front.
"We have a property-owner democracy, and that's what's been threatened, our quality of life," he said.
American trade officials said that they did not want to hurt Caribbean banana producers and that there were ways to protect them like subsidies to bring down banana prices.
At the University of Miami in February, the Clinton Administration director of drug policy, Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, declined to comment on the banana problem, calling it "a complex issue." But General McCaffrey said he did not accept the argument that "it's either this or drugs."
"Nobody turns to marijuana or opium or cocaine production as a survival mechanism," he said. "They turn to that because you can make more money."
But drug riches are not readily apparent at the house of a 39-year-old banana farmer who also grows marijuana and identified himself only as Nebo. He lives in the northeastern town of Georgetown, an hour's drive from here, in an unpainted concrete-block shell with two bedrooms and a family of seven.
As the sweet smell of marijuana wafted in from somewhere around the house, Nebo said his 10,000 marijuana plants yielded an income that was at least 10 times the revenue from his three acres of bananas. Nebo said he had no reason to grow bananas anymore except that "it's in the culture."
"It's been in my family," he said. "I just keep doing it. 'Right now I'm taking my income from ganja to support the banana crop. Ganja has been beneficial to me. It's paid for my house, schooling, food, the bills."
Another banana grower in Georgetown, Iris Walker, said she and her husband would never resort to drugs. But she said marijuana farmers should be accepted as a necessary evil, underscoring the feelings of many residents.
"It's illegal," Ms. Walker said. "But if some people don't do it, they don't have bread for the children."
She called the Americans "selfish."
Government officials said they were trying hard to diversify the economy to reduce the reliance on the banana crop, which is recovering from a slump caused by bad weather and low prices.
Tourism in St. Vincent and the Grenadines earns three times as much as bananas. But officials say that the agricultural dollar goes longer because it is spent locally and that no industry can yet replace bananas in importance.
Marijuana growers and their supporters say they stand ready to help.
"We're ready to be part of the process," Mr. Cottle said. "The fact that we come out and talk illustrates the magnitude of the problem."

HEADLINE: Democrats and Republicans Rally on Issues

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 3

 BODY:
Under a campaign-style blue banner, President Clinton rallied today with Congressional Democrats to show party unity on a legislative agenda that would reserve more than three-quarters of Federal budget surpluses for Social Security and Medicare.
The event was an effort by Democrats to frame the agenda for the 106th Congress, while the Republicans were still seeking their own consensus on legislation. 
 Mr. Clinton and Vice President Al Gore received standing ovations from Democrats who protected the President from impeachment but wanted to censure him for "shameful, reckless and indefensible" behavior. Mr. Gore and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, who recently gave up plans to challenge him for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 2000, even hugged.
With the impeachment process over, Democrats and Republicans have quickly become enmeshed in battles over issues like education and how to apportion surpluses for tax cutting, spending and the long-term solvency of Social Security and Medicare.
Looking to inoculate themselves against a Democratic assault on the issue of Social Security, the Republican leaders of Congress have been working on a budget plan to reserve Social Security only for the popular retirement program.
Mr. Clinton praised Republicans for agreeing to reserve billions of dollars for Social Security, but said another 15 percent of the surplus should be put aside for Medicare, a stand the Democrats hope will allow them to frame the Republican tax-cutting plans as a raid on the Federal health care program for the elderly.
"There are still strong differences in our approach," the President said in an ornate room in the Library of Congress, "and we must resolve them in a way that benefits the American people."
Under a frieze of warriors carrying their dead, Mr. Clinton spoke of the Democratic origins of the Great Society programs for the elderly.
"If we do these things -- saving Social Security, saving Medicare, empowering more Americans to save for their own retirement," he said, "we will fulfill our historic challenge to meet the difficulties and the opportunities of the aging of America in a way that provides a stronger economy and more stable families for our children."
House Republicans countered with a rally led by the majority leader, Representative Dick Armey of Texas. The crowd shouted "ka-ching" -- to imitate the sound of an I.R.S. cash register -- as Mr. Armey recited all the ways that a family is taxed.
Representative Rick Lazio, Republican of Long Island, called the surplus the "overcharge" and said that tax cuts allow a family to save money "for a new home, or money for ballet lessons for your daughter or shots for the new puppy."
Mr. Armey said Republicans had agreed with Mr. Clinton to set aside 62 percent of projected budget surpluses to fix Social Security, making the real debate over whether to use the rest of the surplus to cut taxes or increase Government spending.
"When the choice is seen that way," Mr. Armey said, "the American people overwhelmingly come out on the side of cutting taxes."
But with the party feuding over which taxes to cut, the Republicans did not showcase any particular tax cut. Instead they announced plans for town hall meetings nationwide to promote tax relief.
At the Democratic rally, Senate Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, said that a Republican proposal for a 10 percent tax cut would give people who earn $800,000 an annual tax cut of $20,000 while families who earn $38,000 or less would save 27 cents a day.
"We believe America's families deserve better than 27 cents a day," he said and moved on to other Democratic agenda items like education and health care. "They deserve good schools for their children. If they are sick, they deserve whatever treatment their doctor says they need."
The Democrats today also called for raising the minimum wage, putting 50,000 more police on the streets, and for tax credits devoted to retirement savings, child care and long-term health care.
The competing rallies showed that for all the recent talk of bipartisanship both parties are on a campaign footing -- not a good sign for legislative achievement. A sign of the mood of Democrats on Capitol Hill was that the most enthusiastic and spontaneous applause came not for Mr. Clinton or Mr. Gore, but when Mr. Daschle introduced Mr. Gephardt as "the next Speaker of the House."
Mr. Gephardt urged Democrats to work with Republicans, and said: "We will be judged by our progress, our action, our accomplishment, not by our words."
But other Democrats made clear that they would be happy to bludgeon the Republicans if they block the Democratic agenda.
"If they reject all of it, they provide the foundation for the 2000 elections," said Senator Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey, the chairman of the Senate Democratic campaign. And Representative Patrick J. Kennedy of Rhode Island, who heads the House campaign effort, said, "We are going to have to continue to identify Republicans as the party that has put off the important business of this country for the past year."

Banking legislation puts fiscal heavyweights in rival corners.

BYLINE: By Michael M. Weinstein 

 BODY:
A CONTINUING spat between Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, over modernizing bank regulations threatens to bury legislation that comes before House and Senate committees today. They agree that laws from the 1930's and 1950's that keep banks out of the securities and insurance markets should be scrapped. But they disagree how banks should be structured to handle their new responsibilities.
Mr. Rubin, with the support of most economists, looks as if he will get most of what he wants from the House. Mr. Greenspan, drawing powerful support from past and present Fed officials, may win in the Senate. Indeed, the Administration yesterday threatened to veto the proposal by Phil Gramm, chairman of the Senate banking committee. The risk is that Congress will be deadlocked, forcing the economy to operate under Depression-era rules for at least a few more years. 
 The nation's laws prohibit commercial banks from underwriting insurance and securities or engaging in most commercial activities. Nearly everyone agrees that most of these prohibitions should be scrapped. The idea is that banks could be allowed to offer customers a single, convenient and low-cost place to bank, invest and buy insurance.
Mr. Greenspan would require banks to affiliate with securities and insurance firms under the joint ownership of a bank holding company. He would not allow banks to provide financial services directly or through wholly owned subsidiaries. Under the Greenspan plan, bank holding companies would rule the market. By the way, Mr. Greenspan's Fed regulates bank holding companies.
Mr. Rubin would allow banks to avoid the complicated and costly burden of setting up holding companies and instead create wholly owned, but separately incorporated, subsidiaries. In this arrangement, banks could become financial giants. By the way, Mr. Rubin's Treasury regulates banks.
To almost anyone outside the Beltway, the distinction between affiliates and subsidiaries appears arcane. Suspicions are heightened by the strong aroma of a turf war. But there is more to this dispute than petty jealously.
The Fed points out that subsidiaries are dangerous because their losses would directly eat into the financial reserves of the parent bank. That leaves the bank financially vulnerable. The Fed worries that transfers between parent banks and their subsidiaries could grow excessively large because the money would still be owned by the bank and would not, therefore, spook creditors.
But the Fed is hard pressed to point to independent economists who share its fears. George Benston of Emory University says that the Rubin plan -- and the bipartisan bill proposed by James Leach and John LaFalce, the chairman and ranking minority member, respectively, of the House banking committee that embraces many of Mr. Rubin's demands -- "gives Mr. Greenspan all the protections that he needs."
Under the bill, banks could offer securities underwriting through a subsidiary. But participating banks would be required to hold an extra layer of capital reserves. And none of the dollars that the bank invests in its subsidiary could be counted toward its capital requirement. In other words, if the subsidiary went bankrupt and the parent bank lost its entire investment, the bank would still be left with more capital than is normally required. Second, the amount of money that the bank would be allowed to send to its subsidiary would be limited to the amount the bank would be allowed to send to an affiliate of a holding company.
Mr. Benston's point, like Mr. Rubin's, is that affiliates and subsidiaries are largely equivalent under the House proposal.
But Mr. Greenspan makes a second criticism of the House plan. Banks, he points out, can borrow money more cheaply than other firms because of various Government-provided favors. The Government insures money deposited by the bank's customers. The Government provides loans to banks in times of distress. And the Government guarantees the system that provides for rapid processing of deposits and payments. Mr. Greenspan worries that banks will pass the financial benefit of these implicit Federal subsidies to their subsidiaries, thereby distorting competition in the market for financial services.
But Mr. Benston dismisses these arguments, as well. "The subsidy Mr. Greenspan points to may not exist, but it is almost surely small. Along with the Federal insurance come layers of expensive regulations. Besides, the benefit of the subsidy, if it exists, can be passed along to affiliates about as easily as subsidiaries. And, banks have little incentive to pass along subsidies to affiliates or subsidiaries."
The Fed appears to fear that securities underwriting and other financial services are so inherently nuclear that they can blow open holes in the parent bank's capital before regulators have time to react. But, Mr. Benston points out, "Derivatives can blow up faster than stock and bond purchases. Underwriting poses no special risk."
But there is another argument that may explain the Fed's animus toward subsidiaries. If banks prefer Mr. Rubin's model to the Fed's, bank holding companies will shrivel, leaving the Fed little to regulate. Over time, Fed officials fear, their regulatory expertise will also shrivel. Fed officials believe regulatory expertise is integral to the Fed's ability to do its other job: setting monetary policy.
There are other contentious issues, including Senator Gramm's threat to undermine the rules that compel banks to lend in poor neighborhoods. But the major dispute is over bank structure. It might seem obvious that the impact on the economy of Depression-era bank rules is large. But the presumption may well be wrong. Regulators have chipped away at the regulatory shackles, finding loopholes by which to approve, for example, a merger that brought Citibank and Salomon Smith Barney together. A legislative fix may not be all that important. Mr. Leach says his bill will deliver a "psychological boost" to the financial services sector, especially to firms serving midsize business. Perhaps. But Mr. Leach cites testimony that the economywide benefits might be only a few billion dollars a year.
"There is always good reason to throw out silly rules," Mr. Benston said, "but don't expect bank reform to pack much of a wallop."

HEADLINE: Deal Protects Maine Woods From Development

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: BOSTON, March 3

 BODY:
Great swaths of the Maine woods with a combined area larger than Rhode Island would be protected forever from development under a $28 million plan announced today and thought to encompass more territory than any other such deal.
Gov. Angus King of Maine said in Augusta that the plan would include more than 2,000 miles of shoreline on streams and rivers, more than 85 lakes or ponds, and nesting areas for bald eagles and peregrine falcons. 
 "This is probably the biggest day for Maine out-of-doors since Governor Baxter first saw Mount Katahdin," Mr. King said, referring to the 1920's Governor, Percival Baxter, who personally bought and donated Baxter State Park, a widely beloved wilderness area crowned by Mount Katahdin in northern Maine.
Under the agreement, a family of longtime Maine landowners, the Pingrees, would provide a conservation easement on the land by selling the development rights on 754,673 acres to a private nonprofit group, the New England Forestry Foundation. The family can continue limited industrial logging and the public will still have recreational access, although there are no plans to transform the land into a park. They have no immediate plans to develop the land.
The foundation, which is 55 years old and promotes sustainable forestry, is still raising the money for the purchase and has two years to amass it.
Governor King, who announced the agreement, said it was probably the largest conservation easement deal on private forest land.
On a roll of recent victories in their efforts to preserve Northeastern forest land, environmentalists praised the Pingree agreement as a significant step toward saving more of the Northern Forest, the 26 million acres of woods from Maine to New York.
"It's the soul-satisfying sound of another big piece of the Northern Forest puzzle clicking into place," said Bob Perschel, chairman of the Northern Forest Alliance, a coalition of 35 groups.
The deal came at a moment of exceptionally hot debate over what Maine should do about its 17 million acres of woods, a discussion prompted by land sales last year of giant paper company holdings that amounted to about 15 percent of the state.
Conservationists scored their most recent Maine triumph in mid-December, when the Nature Conservancy, an international group, announced that it would pay $35 million to buy 185,000 acres of International Paper Company land in northern Maine. Not far away, a week earlier, conservationists cheered an even bigger landmark preservation purchase: 300,000 acres of forest land in New York, Vermont and New Hampshire from the Champion International paper company for $76 million.
But at the same time, environmentalists in Maine have complained loudly that the state is not prepared to protect more of the millions of acres coming up for sale as global economic forces lead paper companies to shift their assets. The environmentalists called for the state to find the money and the will to buy more land to protect it, and warned that at least one big land purchaser was known for sub-dividing and building on wilderness parcels.
In a state where love for the forest gets as prosaic as moose meat in the freezer and as poetic as Henry David Thoreau's paeans to the Maine Woods, the heightened discussion has been enough to move the state Legislature to put the issue on the front burner in its current session. It is considering a variety of proposals, including one from Governor King for a $50-million bond issue for land purchases and ranging to more than $100 million. Any such bond issue would have to come before voters in November.
Legislative leaders say there seems to be enough consensus that at least a $50-million bond issue has a good chance of passing. In public debate, however, contention remains on issues ranging from just how much land should be bought to whether it should remain working forest or be protected from logging. But today's announcement seemed to please virtually all camps.
"It's a win-win," said Abby Holman, executive director of the Maine Forest Products Council, a trade association for the wood and paper industry. "You're actually able to provide for a conservation easement and reduce the threat of development in pristine areas, and secure the future of the timber industry."
At the other end of the forest spectrum, Jonathan Carter, executive director of the Forest Ecology Network and an advocate of maximizing wilderness areas, also praised the deal as a great step, though he added: "It's important that we realize that conservation easements are not wilderness restoration. Hopefully, now we've got it out of development's hands, we can now move forward and create a wilderness park."
That -- creation of a wilderness park -- was the kind of total stop to logging achieved this week by defenders of Headwaters, the old-growth redwood forest owned by a lumber company in Northern California. But in the East, where most forests are privately owned, unlike their publicly owned Western counterparts, just reducing logging and stopping development can seem to environmentalists like progress.
Injecting a note of skepticism into all the celebration, Mr. Carter pointed out that the Pingrees, who are known as the most environmentally punctilious of Maine's large landowners, would receive $30 million for abstaining from developing land that they may have had no intention of developing anyway.
"If you can continue to do what you've always done and someone will give you $30 million, who will say no?" Mr. Carter asked.
But Governor King countered that the Pingrees, who are now in their seventh generation of holding land first assembled in 1840, were showing unusual vision in putting a permanent ban on developing their land.
"This is forever," he said.

British Halt Cuts in a Key Rate, Driving Pound Up Against Euro

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: LONDON, March 3

 BODY:
The Bank of England brought five months of monetary easing to an end today, deciding to leave its key short-term lending rate unchanged at 5.5 percent. The decision helped send the pound to a record high against the euro.
The central bank's monetary policy committee announced the decision without elaboration. Economists said it was probably responding to recent data suggesting that a slowdown in British economic growth appeared to be ending. 
 There was little reaction in the London stock market, where the decision to leave interest rates unchanged had been expected. But the currency market was quick to bid up the pound on speculation that British interest rates would become more attractive compared with rates elsewhere. Higher rates tend to make a currency worth more; lower rates tend to stimulate the economy by making loans more affordable.
The pound hit a record high of 67.25 pence against the euro, the single European currency introduced two months ago. It gained nearly a cent against the dollar here, rising to $1.6225, before retreating to $1.6134 in New York.
Britain's central bank had reduced the short-term securities repurchase rate five successive times from October through February, which brought it to the current 5.50 percent level from 7.50 percent.
But a British industry lobbyist said rates were too high and should be cut further. "Inflationary pressures remain flat and with prospects for economic recovery still fragile, a significant cut was both workable and necessary," said Ian Peters, deputy director general of the British Chambers of Commerce.
He said rates needed to move in line with those in the 11-nation euro zone, where they are at 3 percent. Two other non-euro nations cut key rates this week -- Norway earlier today and Denmark on Monday. The European Central Bank is to hold a rate meeting on Thursday; there is no expectation it will reduce rates.

Hong Kong Plans Shifts in Reserves

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, March 3

 BODY:
Hong Kong said today that it would change the way it managed $118 billion of reserves, increasing the amount of United States dollars and equities in the portfolio and taking more risk in search of better returns.
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the de facto central bank, will cut the percentage of bonds in its Exchange Fund to 80 percent from 90 percent, and will double the ratio of equities to 20 percent. The United States dollar will account for 80 percent, an increase at the expense of European currencies and yen. 
 The changes reflect the way government reserves and pension funds are being managed, economists and treasurers said. Even the most conservative institutions are switching more money into equities as stocks have continued to outperform bonds.

Bonds Rally, Driving Yield To New Lows In Japan

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Thursday, March 4

 BODY:
Japanese bonds rallied today, driving the yield of the benchmark issue to its lowest in more than two months as expectations grew that the central bank would extend its efforts to guide down short-term interest rates.
The Bank of Japan, after pushing the overnight lending rate close to zero on Wednesday, is considering lowering other short-term rates such as yields on certificates of deposit. 
 The move "will make it easier for investors to buy long-term bonds by raising funds in the money market," said Michiya Seki, a trader at the New Japan Securities Company.
The benchmark No. 203 bond rose 1.105, or 511 yen per 50,000 yen bond, to 101.904, pushing the yield down 125 basis points, to 1.565 percent. It earlier touched 1.555 percent, the lowest intraday level since Dec. 22. It was the lowest close since Dec. 21.
The benchmark yield has fallen 37 basis points in the last five days as the central bank drove down short-term interest rates in an effort to end the recession and bring down bond yields. The yield is still up from a record low of 0.695 percent on Oct. 7.
Kazuo Ueda, a member of the Bank of Japan's policy board, said that lowering yields of certificates of deposit and other money market instruments could be another option to ease monetary policy.
The unsecured overnight loan rate between banks, which is equivalent to the United States Federal funds rate, hit a record low two-hundredths of a percent on Wednesday. As money market traders charge two-hundredths of a percent commission for brokering overnight loans, the interest rate effectively fell to zero, traders said. The rate fell after the Bank of Japan pumped 400 billion yen ($3.3 billion) into the banking system, adding to a 1.26 trillion yen initial daily surplus, signaling its commitment to bringing short-term rates down and expanding money supply.
Meanwhile, the central bank is sticking to its resolve not to underwrite Government bonds, a move that some politicians want the bank to take in order to absorb a glut in the debt market and cap a rise in long-term interest rates.

HEADLINE: With a Job, Without a Home;
Low-Wage Workers Turn to Shelters to Bridge the Gap

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
Kenneth Lindo walks with bond traders and bankers through the gleaming lobbies of Wall Street during the day, his canvas messenger's bag heavy with checks and stock certificates from the longest bull market in memory. But at night, he beds down at the 30th Street Men's Shelter in Manhattan, rolling his winter jacket in the sheet under his head.
Until January, Mr. Lindo had a pillow to call his own, in a Harlem room that cost $20 a day on his $5.50-an-hour pay -- almost 70 percent of his take-home income. At the shelter, he does without. 
 "I got to get there earlier than 5 P.M. to get a pillow," explained Mr. Lindo, 44, as he loped through deliveries in the financial district, where he has worked on and off near the minimum wage since he was 18.
Mr. Lindo's double life illustrates a larger paradox. The booming economy has provided employment for more low-wage workers like him, but by driving up rents, has made it harder for them to cover the cost of housing, sending some to the city shelter system to bridge the gap.
And the system they encounter is in the midst of re-evaluating the role work should have for its shelter residents.
Recent court rulings cleared the way for the city to require parents in family shelters to work for the city in exchange for their beds, and the Giuliani administration is arguing for the same authority in shelters for single adults. But how such a system would work remains unclear.
Would residents with pay from private-sector jobs still qualify for shelter beds? Might they, like shelter residents in Philadelphia, have to turn over a percentage of their earnings to sleep there?
Simply getting a steady bed in a shelter has become more difficult for many poor people who work but cannot find affordable housing. More than 69 percent of the city's 7,570 shelter beds are now operated under contracts by private, nonprofit agencies, many in programs geared to substance abusers or the mentally ill.
"So many of the specialized beds have been developed with a therapeutic or rehabilitation approach that there are very few beds available for men who are working and simply need a roof over their heads until they can get housing," said Steven Banks, director of the Legal Aid Society's Homeless Rights Project.
This winter, according to records compiled in New York by the Legal Aid Society, full-time stock clerks, short-order cooks and messengers were among several hundred homeless men who were shuttled through the shelter system's overnight circuit. They often waited past midnight at the 30th Street Shelter intake center near Bellevue Hospital Center, records show, then were bused to one-night bed assignments in other shelters throughout the city that they had to vacate by 5 or 6 A.M.
Mr. Lindo, the messenger, for example, spent 19 nights at different shelters before landing his current bed in the Bellevue shelter, one of the coveted "assessment beds" that serve as a gateway to a steady assignment.
Susan Wiviott, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Homeless Services, said that the recent overflow was temporary, caused mainly by seasonal demand. Like most cities, New York does not compile statistics on the number of people who are employed when they enter the shelter system, she said, but she estimated it as "very minimal."
But for these working homeless, the nightly routine of long waits, broken sleep and early morning ouster from unfamiliar beds can threaten their ability to keep a job.
Derek Wall-Carty, who works a mix of day and evening shifts as a cook for the Houlihan's restaurant chain in Garden City, on Long Island, was on the overnight circuit last month, and described the trial of keeping up private-sector work while depending on a rotating shelter bed. "It was six days of hell," Mr. Wall-Carty said, "and for three of them I didn't sleep at all."
The day he was housed at the Wards Island shelter, it took him two and a half hours by bus, subway and Long Island Rail Road to get to his 9 A.M. shift, after he had waited for a bed the whole night, he said.
Another day, he was bused to the Kingsborough shelter in Brooklyn at noon between two night shifts, he said, but the door manager told him he had to choose between going to work or having a bed when he returned.
Even when a caseworker at the Wards Island shelter agreed to reserve him a bed for his return from another night shift, the trip from Long Island left him stranded at 125th Street and Lexington Avenue at 1 A.M., because buses to Wards Island were no longer running.
He walked across the Triborough Bridge, he said, losing his way on Randalls Island and arriving at the shelter at 4 A.M. to find his bed gone after all.
"I refuse to lose my job because of a setback," Mr. Wall-Carty said, adding that he turned to the shelters on Jan. 20 after the woman who had rented him a room in her Bedford-Stuyvesant house for $70 a week objected to his work hours.
Mr. Wall-Carty, 21, who studied hotel and restaurant management at New York City Technical College for two years, now shares a room with 13 other men at Pamoja House, a 200-bed employment-oriented shelter operated by the Black Veterans for Social Justice in a city armory in Brooklyn. The program lasts up to six months, and he says he hopes it leads to an affordable apartment.
Although there are differences in shelter admission policies around the country and a lack of consistent data collection, other areas also report unexpected increases in the number of working adults living in shelters.
In Columbus, Ohio, 20 percent of the homeless families sheltered in 1998 reported income from jobs, up from 8 percent in 1994, said Matt White, research director for the Community Shelter Board, which allocates public and private money to the shelters.
In Orange County, Fla., a survey last year by the Homeless Services Network found that 53 percent of shelter residents there were employed, up from 36 percent when the same survey was done five years earlier.
While many people think of typical adult shelter users as chronically homeless derelicts or the mentally ill, a majority of those who entered the New York City system between 1988 and 1995 -- nearly 60,000 men out of a sample of 73,293 -- left within two months and did not return, or came back only briefly, over the next three years, according to an analysis by Dennis P. Culhane, an associate professor of social welfare policy at the University of Pennsylvania.
Residents in this group were not without problems, Mr. Culhane's analysis showed: about a third came with histories of substance abuse. But many, he said, were working people coping with crises of poverty.
One example is Damon Revells, 39, who was a cook for Norman's Jerk Chicken in Jamaica, Queens, when he became homeless in December. Mr. Revells, recently divorced, said that when his child support payments left him behind in the rent, his landlord locked him out.
After days of shuttling between temporary beds in different shelters, he said that he was so exhausted and emotionally drained, he dozed off on the job and burned the soup. He was laid off soon after.
"This thing could just become this grinding machine," he said in a recent telephone interview from a shelter on Wards Island, where he has been assigned a steady bed and is now looking for a new job.
"People for whom the economy has really made life good have trouble understanding why these people can't make it," said Mary Ann Gleason, the executive director of the National Coalition for the Homeless in Washington. "But there's an inverse relationship between a strong economy and the affordability of housing. You have this direct rise in housing cost in proportion to what the market will bear, but we haven't increased the minimum wage."
Tony Proscio, former deputy commissioner for the New York City Department of Homeless Services and now a consultant on urban development, said there was another reason why the current robust economy might cause more of the working poor to end up in shelters: employers hard-pressed to fill jobs without swelling labor costs have hired workers passed over in a weaker economy, including some with criminal records or histories of substance abuse that put them at greater risk of losing their housing.
Mr. Lindo, a divorced Army veteran who graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx in 1973, puts himself in that category. He spent six days in a detoxification program in early January at the suggestion of the private shelter he called when he first lost his room.
"Your life catches up with you sometimes," he said, describing a 1995 drug conviction for which he is still on probation, credit card debt from Christmas three years ago, and traffic tickets from a stint as a taxi driver.
He says he is trying to pay off the fines so he can drive a cab again. Meanwhile, he is back to being a Wall Street messenger. He starts and ends his shift in Jersey City, where the messenger service that employs him runs a mail room under contract to a prominent investment bank. Mr. Lindo asked that the companies not be named.
"They might not like it," he said, "that I'm living in a shelter."

Disney andHong Kong Confirm Talks on a Theme Park

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

 BODY:
Confirming weeks of breathless rumors, Hong Kong and the Walt Disney Company said yesterday that they were in early negotiations about building a theme park in the former British colony.
It would be the second Asia-based theme park for the entertainment company and would mark a major expansion of Disney's dealings with China, which regained sovereignty over Hong Kong 19 months ago. 
 Sir Donald Tsang, Hong Kong's financial secretary, said Disney and the Hong Kong government had reached a "common understanding" about building a park in Hong Kong. He said they would now begin "intensive negotiations" and hoped to make a final decision by the end of June. If a definitive agreement is reached, Sir Donald said the first phase of a Hong Kong Disneyland could be completed by 2005.
Besides its parks in Orlando, Fla., and Anaheim, Calif., Disney operates theme parks in suburban Paris and outside Tokyo.
The mere whisper of Disney's interest has generated giddy excitement in Hong Kong, which has been racked by recession and a steep drop in tourism in the aftermath of Asia's financial crises and the British-Chinese agreement that converted Hong Kong into a special autonomous region of China.
Some people in Hong Kong have come to view a Disney park almost as a pot of gold. Even as he confirmed the negotiations, Sir Donald felt obliged to temper public expectations.
"I am fully aware of, and indeed share, the public's excitement at the prospect of seeing Mickey and his friends in Hong Kong," Sir Donald said in his annual budget address in the former colony. "However, I must caution that while we have made the first important steps, there is still much ground to cover. Much hard negotiating lies ahead."
Disney, which is based in Burbank, Calif., confirmed through a spokesman that it was in preliminary discussions about building a theme park resort in Hong Kong but declined to elaborate.
The chairman of Disney, Michael D. Eisner, had said in the latest annual report that Disney would likely build a park in China in the coming years, and speculation grew that Hong Kong and Shanghai were preferred locations.
Regardless of where in China a Disney park is built, the negotiations themselves are persuasive evidence that Disney's fortunes in the world's most populous country are improving after a three-year chill. China's film market was closed to Disney movies after the company's 1996 release of "Kundun," a film about the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, who is considered a political enemy by Beijing. But in February, in an early sign of a thaw, China approved the release of the Disney animated hit about the Chinese heroine "Mulan," which opened in theaters there last week.
Before Disney committed to Hong Kong, it would need to agree on the price of the land for a theme park. Indeed, Ian Perkin, the chief economist of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, said: "I'd say the chances of this are less than 50-50. If you look at the cost of land in Hong Kong, I'm not sure Disney is willing to pay."
Sir Donald said the government and the company envisioned building the park on reclaimed land north of Lantau Island, not far from the new Hong Kong International Airport.
The airport, which is also built on reclaimed land, cost $20 billion, an amount that included the vast network of bridges, tunnels, highways and railways that connect the airport to central Hong Kong. Some of that infrastructure could presumably serve a new Disneyland as well. But the cost of another enormous reclamation project could easily reach billions of dollars.
One person with knowledge of the talks between Hong Kong and Disney said the company had initially proposed that the government give Disney the land. No matter how much Hong Kong wants to lure Disney, analysts said it could not accede to such a deal.
Sir Donald said a theme park would generate thousands of new jobs at a time when Hong Kong is suffering from record unemployment. He said the park would also protect the territory's status as a tourist destination in Asia.
Mr. Perkin agreed that a Disney theme park would be a potent growth engine for Hong Kong. But because such a project would require years of planning before construction started -- let alone the gates opened -- he said it should not be viewed as a panacea for Hong Kong's current problems.
In addition to the Disney project, Sir Donald announced that the government would build a giant industrial park for technology companies. The $2 billion project, called Cyberport, will be financed partly by the government and partly by the Pacific Century Group, a real estate and technology company controlled by Richard Li, the son of Hong Kong's most prominent tycoon, Li Ka-shing.
Sir Donald also forecast that Hong Kong's gross domestic product would grow five-tenths of 1 percent in 1999, after plummeting 5.1 percent last year. Mr. Perkin said even that modest goal would be hard to achieve.
For all the caveats, the prospect of a Disney park has been a tonic to a city sorely in need of good news. The shares of Hong Kong property developers have soared in recent days as the Disney rumors percolated. Analysts said the value of real estate near the park would rise significantly. In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Disney shares rose 31.25 cents, to $34.50.

ISRAEL: NETANYAHU ON PULLOUT
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would consider "the possibility of a unilateral withdrawal" from Lebanon if "accompanied by necessary security measures." He rejected a suggestion by Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon that May elections be postponed in order to form a unity government dedicated to a pullout. Both men's remarks followed a campaign promise by the Labor Party candidate, Ehud Barak, to withdraw troops within a year if elected Prime Minister. Deborah Sontag (NYT) 

ISRAEL: POLICE QUESTION SHARON
The police interrogated Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon on the suspicion that he might have bribed a former general to give false testimony on his behalf in a libel case. Mr. Sharon's lawyer, Yaakov Weinroth, strongly denies that there was either any act of bribery or any false testimony. Deborah Sontag (NYT)
 
JORDAN: EMBASSY IN KUWAIT REOPENED
Jordan reopened its embassy in Kuwait, ending a break between the two Arab countries that began during the 1990-91 Persian Gulf crisis. Jordan, unlike several Arab states, did not join the U.S.-led alliance against Iraq in the gulf war, and many Kuwaitis feel that Jordan favored Iraq after Baghdad's 1990 invasion. (AP)
 
EUROPE
 
NORTHERN IRELAND: 2 GROUPS BARRED
Two Protestant militia groups opposed to the Northern Ireland peace accord have been banned by the British Government, Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam said, because of their continuing involvement in sectarian violence. The Orange Volunteers and the Red Hand Defenders are fiercely pro-British groups that have carried out bomb attacks on Catholic nationalists. (Reuters)
 
GIBRALTAR: BRITAIN BACKS VOTING RIGHTS
Britain will seek voting rights for Gibraltar in European Parliament elections, risking a new dispute with Spain, which contests British rule over the territory. The European Court of Human Rights ruled last month that excluding Gibraltar from voting for candidates to the 626-member parliament was a breach of human rights. (Reuters)
 
RUSSIA: FAR APART ON I.M.F. DEAL
Russia and the International Monetary Fund are still far apart on an economic accord, and the I.M.F. must not bend its rules too far as it decides whether to start handing over cash again, Michael Mussa, the fund's chief economist, said. He told reporters that the Government of Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov was reversing some policies accepted by his predecessors. (Reuters)

JAPAN: BACKING FOR CONTRACEPTIVE PILLS
A Health Ministry committee approved the sale of birth control pills, bringing Japan closer to the general sale of the pill almost four decades after its first use in the West. The pill could be available by the end of the year. The shift came after women's groups protested the ministry's decision in January to approve the male impotence drug Viagra after deliberating just six months. Approval of the pill has taken nine years. (AP)
 
CHINA: CALL FOR TIANANMEN INQUIRY
As the 10th anniversary of the June 4 killings by the military around Tiananmen Square approaches, victims and their families have renewed calls for the Government to re-evaluate the incident. The group wants to clarify who ordered soldiers to move against the demonstrators, and a new compensation law for the victims, whom they number in the tens of thousands. Elisabeth Rosenthal (NYT)
 
CAMBODIA: HUN SEN BACKS TRUTH PANEL
Prime Minister Hun Sen says he favors a truth commission to deal with atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge, but warned in a letter to the U.N. that a trial of the group's leaders could cause "panic." His letter came a day after U.N. legal experts recommended the formation of an international tribunal outside Cambodia to try senior Khmer Rouge leaders and a truth commission inside Cambodia to deal with lower-level perpetrators of the 1975-79 killings.

PHILIPPINES: GRAFT TRIAL FOR MRS. MARCOS
Imelda E. Marcos suffered a major legal setback when a court ordered that she be prosecuted on five cases of graft. Prosecutors have accused her of setting up four foundations to conceal $350 million in Swiss bank accounts from 1978 to 1984. With interest, the deposits now amount to more than $500 million, Philippine officials say. (Reuters)

ZIMBABWE: NEWSMEN ALLOWED TO LEAVE
Over the objections of the Government, a judge has allowed two journalists who say they were tortured by soldiers to go to Britain for medical treatment. Mark Chavunduka, editor of The Standard, and a Standard reporter, Ray Choto, were detained after the paper reported a suspected coup attempt. They said they were beaten and given electric shocks before being released. (AP)
 
SOUTH AFRICA: AIDS DRUG REJECTED
Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma reaffirmed that the Government would not pay for AZT for pregnant women to prevent transmission of the AIDS virus to their babies.

HEADLINE: MIFFED AT EUROPE, U.S. RAISES TARIFFS FOR LUXURY GOODS

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 3

 BODY:
The United States heated up two politically contentious trade disputes with Europe today, slapping 100 percent tariffs on $520 million in European products and threatening to ban Europe's supersonic pride, the Concorde, from landing in the United States.
The tariffs imposed by the Clinton Administration on goods such as Louis Vuitton handbags, Parma ham, pecorino cheese and Scottish cashmere sweaters, which essentially double their price and make it much harder for European exporters to sell them in this country, are part of a six-year battle over trade in bananas. 
 The threat to ban the Concorde is in a bill passed overwhelmingly in the House of Representatives today, in retaliation for a European ruling that would ban many older American airplanes from landing in Europe. American officials say Europe's restriction is designed to promote the sale of new engines and aircraft made by European manufacturers.
But both battles are really about the enormous tensions that have erupted between the United States and a Europe newly unified by a common currency. On both continents, politicians are feeling the heat from slowing exports, and fear a slowdown in economic growth later this year. And Washington and the European Union find themselves unable to resolve seemingly ordinary economic disputes, with each accusing the other of defying the World Trade Organization, the four-year-old court of international trade.
The court has stepped in to arbitrate the banana dispute, which involves European limits on imports, and has become the battleground over other politically sensitive issues, including Europe's ban on imported beef from cattle raised with hormones.
The arguments have resulted in some of the nastiest trans-Atlantic bickering in years. This afternoon, American officials said they hoped the imposition of the 100 percent tariffs on European luxury goods -- with the exceptions of wine and Mercedes Benz cars -- would "freeze trade" in those items and compel the Europeans to negotiate. In response, Europe's top trade official, Sir Leon Brittan, called the American action "unacceptable and unlawful."
Oddly, the underlying dispute seems relatively trivial. "It's hard to believe," one American official mused today, "that we got to this by arguing over bananas."
The trade fight with Europe has become a major issue at the White House, with President Clinton becoming directly involved in some of the negotiations, most recently with French President Jacques Chirac. But the economic impact is relatively modest: The United States imported $176.3 billion in goods from nations in the European Union last year, meaning that today's sanctions apply to one-quarter of 1 percent of goods imported from Europe.
But in trade, as in politics, symbolism counts for more than statistics. And the symbolism of today's actions are clear: The United States is showing that it intends to retaliate if it believes Europe is manipulating trade rules to keep out competition.
The airplane battle, like the beef-hormone dispute, is a prime example of how one continent's environmental and health regulations are another continent's trade barrier.
The European Parliament recently passed legislation banning the takeoff or landing of older airplanes even if their engines have been retrofitted with devices called "hush kits" that reduce airplane noise. European officials say the planes still are too loud.
Rep. James Oberstar, a Minnesota Democrat who sponsored the measure to ban the Concorde flights, calls the rule "a thinly veiled attempt to give a competitive advantage" to the European aircraft and engine makers.
There are only 12 Concorde aircraft now flying, with regularly scheduled flights between Kennedy International Airport in New York and London and Paris. .
Both airlines today called for the United States and Europe to settle their differences at the World Trade Organization.
That may yet happen. But clearly the House action was intended to give the Clinton administration more leverage in their talks.
The banana dispute is steeped in American politics: While the Government is acting on behalf of the Dole Food Company and Chiquita Brands International, neither company grows or picks bananas in the United States. Almost all of their bananas are grown in Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua.
Europe has imposed an enormously complex banana quota system that limits the import of Latin American bananas, to benefit former European colonies, many in the Caribbean. The trade court has struck down the quota system several times. In each case, American officials charge, Europe made minor modifications to the rules that essentially kept the trade barrier in place.
So in December the Administration warned it was preparing to retaliate, publishing a list of goods that would be doubled in price for a total of $520 million -- the amount that United States banana companies say they've lost because of Europe's restrictions. Ambassador Peter Scher, who heads up agricultural talks for the United States Trade Representative's office, said that the "real issue is whether Europe is prepared to obey the W.T.O.'s rulings."

THE GREEDY HAND
How Taxes Drive Americans Crazy and What to Do About It
By Amity Schlaes
255 pages. Random House. $22.95.
"To tax and to please, no more than to love and to be wise, is not given to men," wrote Edmund Burke in 1774. Nor, he might have added, is it often given to humans to write about taxes and be stimulating. Yet in "The Greedy Hand: How Taxes Drive Americans Crazy and What to Do About It," Amity Schlaes not only manages to keep you wide awake, she also sets your blood to boiling. 
 She does so by citing particularly egregious examples of how our current Rube Goldberg machine of a tax code sometimes works. She tells, for instance, of a New York City couple who lost their 29-year-old son, an investment banker, in the crash of Pan Am's Flight 103 in Lockerbie, Scotland, and were dunned by the Internal Revenue Service for $6 million in back taxes on the settlement the I.R.S. estimated they would receive, even before the amount of that settlement was determined.
She tells of another couple who bought a house in East Dorset, Vt., because of the area's outstanding schools, only to learn that the state's supreme court had ruled that the local school-financing system was unconstitutional, that it would no longer be all right for one school district to spend more money on its students than another, and that henceforth local real estate money was to be sent to the state capital so that it could be given out equitably.
She writes that Tax Freedom Day -- which is what a Washington-based think tank called the Tax Foundation names the day on which the average American has finally paid off his total annual burden of Federal, state and local taxes -- fell in 1998 on May 10, "the latest day in history."
What Ms. Schlaes is getting at with these illustrations is not exactly subtle. She is talking about estate taxes, real-estate taxes and social-security taxes, and the point she is making is that the present American tax system is greedy, intrusive, unpredictable and meddling. And the Internal Revenue Service in administering this system acts with all the restraint and subtlety of a 500-pound gorilla on amphetamines.
Elsewhere, Ms. Schlaes details other alleged excesses of what Thomas Paine in "The Rights of Man" described as "the greedy hand of government thrusting itself into every corner and crevice of industry, and grasping the spoil of the multitude." In a chapter called "Your Clothes," she describes shopping for tax-free apparel at the Mall of America in Minneapolis-St. Paul as an example of the lengths to which people will go to escape sales taxes.
In "Your Work," she argues that the present Social Security System is "indeed and truly a Ponzi scheme," or a ruse in which money from one generation flows into the pockets of another until there are simply not enough people to pay. In "Your Marriage," she explains how two conflicting goals, "equality for the poor" and "equality for women," have combined to produce a result whereby married people pay higher taxes than a comparably earning single man and woman.
In "Your House," she argues apropos of the home-mortgage deduction that if real estate did not "enjoy a huge advantage over other investments, our economy would grow more efficiently overall." In "Your Baby," she laments how the cost and difficulty of hiring proper child care is actually causing couples to give up having additional children. In "Your Success," she insists that the progressive income tax does more harm than good and fails to fulfill its stated purpose of taxing the truly rich. And in "Your Retirement," she describes how the Social Security system has the effect of idling and infantilizing older people even as the economy demands more workers and people are living longer, more active lives.
How does the book propose to solve these myriad ills, which add up to such an indictment of our tax system that by the end you are almost ready to accept the flat tax proposed by the House majority leader, Dick Armey? Or the single tax once dreamed up by Henry George. Or even a system based on cowrie shells or maybe bubble gum. Encouragingly, Ms. Schlaes, a member of The Wall Street Journal's editorial board, concludes that "our impasse, in fact, contains the outline of its own solution, if only we allow ourselves to look at it clearly."
What "our long struggle with Paine's greedy hand" tells us, she writes, is that "taxes have to be "visible," "simple," "for revenue" (as opposed to for the purpose of steering behavior), and "lower." She goes on: "We don't have to load extra taxes on the rich"; "It's time to privatize Social Security"; "Local is good," ("The Federal government cannot solve everything"), and "We must lock in change." By this last she means simply that we ought to clear out the present "underbrush," and "put through lower, simpler rates that apply to all in a consistent manner" and that we ought to pass a constitutional amendment "that calls for limiting Federal taxes, including Social Security, to 25 percent of our income, or even a lower share."
She concludes that "luck is on our side. Today the nation is actually in a better position to undertake a tax reform than at any point in living memory. . . . Today we have no deficit and no cold war." We need only look to our own history of resisting taxes for "the path to follow."
Now there may be any number of details about which to quarrel with Ms. Schlaes. For instance, she fails to prove her case that all progressive systems inevitably fail to tax the rich proportionally, and she leaves one to suspect that the real reason the rich gain the benefit of loopholes is not because "progressivity" is flawed but simply because the rich have more power. And many will question her larger assumptions that the welfare state has proved itself useless and that an untrammeled free market will not create its own systemic problems.
Still, by criticizing our present tax code so concretely, Ms. Schlaes has provided a thoughtful overview of the system's many contradictions and inequities. Even if you don't always agree with her conclusions, she defines the debate over what we ought to do and gets you thinking constructively about the problems she identifies.

HEADLINE: Night Court Joins the Theater That Is New York

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
The hour was closing in on midnight. A detachment of ruddy-faced German tourists emerged from the metal detectors in the Criminal Courts building in lower Manhattan, took a sharp left and headed down the empty marble corridor toward the city's least likely international attraction, night court.
Tentatively, they filed into Room 130. They entered like spelunkers, wide-eyed and hushed amid the cavernous courtroom's disconcerting fluorescence. Wrestling off ski jackets, they settled into several rows of dark wooden benches, looking eager, alert and utterly out of place. 
 The court stenographer squinted at them, then shrugged.
"It looks like they came off a tour bus or something," she muttered.
"I'm telling you, this is in the tour books," said Judge Ruth Pickholz, who was presiding that night. "They should have been here the night of the escape."
Manhattan makes its name on superlatives, so maybe it should come as no surprise that in the only borough with 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week arraignments, the 5:30 P.M. to 1 A.M. shift at arraignment court at 100 Centre Street near Chinatown is both a tourist attraction and an occasional cheap date.
This is, after all, post-O. J. Simpson America. Who is not interested in sidebar conferences and orders to show cause? With criminal lawyers serving as hosts of television talk shows and Judge Judy becoming a celebrity, courtrooms are becoming a daytime-television cliche. Night court, meanwhile, is the real thing.
Like much in Manhattan, night court is real-life theater. It is the criminal-justice equivalent of a ringside seat at emergency-room admissions. It is mostly pantomime, robbed of its dialogue by bad acoustics, but it offers the curious visitor a hard look at a sad slice of New York life.
Hour after hour, the door to the holding pens behind the courtroom bangs open and shut. Men and women with smudged faces and sleep-flattened hair slouch before the judge. Charges are barked out: heroin possession, fare-beating, possession of stolen property. Lawyers argue in shorthand; the judge sets bail.
Once in a while, something startling breaks the rhythm. Denied bail, a defendant dares the court officers to force him to return to the pens. Or as had happened in Judge Pickholz's courtroom earlier that week, a man leaps the rail and tries to bolt, only to be caught in the corridor and charged with escape.
"I consider arraignments the E.R. of the court system," said Judge Pickholz, a former lawyer with the New York Legal Aid Society and former corruption prosecutor for the city. "We triage. Some cases need a Band-Aid. Some of them need major surgery."
Every day, hundreds of people are arrested in Manhattan. Under state law, the city has 24 hours to get them arraigned before a judge, who will hear arguments from a prosecutor and usually a court-appointed defense lawyer on, among other things, how high to set bail.
Time was, people used to languish in jail for days, unarraigned. Then in 1990, the Legal Aid Society went to the state Supreme Court and argued that the city was violating a law requiring arraignment "without delay." In April of that year, a judge agreed and set the limit at 24 hours.
These days, the arrest-to-arraignment time is usually less than that. But a visitor to night court may be struck by the tension between the pressure to deal quickly with the flow of "bodies," in law-enforcement parlance, and the countervailing impulse to treat the "bodies" as something more.
 
'Cans of Tuna Fish'
Not everyone finds the balance satisfactory.
"The system believes in processing our clients, kind of like cans of tuna fish," said Stephen P. Pokart, a Legal Aid lawyer who has worked in night court often since 1980. "They don't recognize them as humans. They are species as paperwork, species as statistic, the species defendant."
Standing on the western rim of Chinatown, the vast Criminal Courts building is an awesome place. "Where law ends there tyranny begins," reads the inscription on one wall. Homeless men can be seen bedding down along the sidewalk, while litter swirls in windy eddies near the entrance.
Room 130 is the bigger of the two arraignment courtrooms, a room so archetypal that Barbra Streisand replicated it for her 1987 movie "Nuts." The cracks in the benches appear in places to have been spackled with now petrified chewing gum; even tourists look pallid under the 11 overhead lights.
A low rail divides the room -- public on one end, lawyers and accused on the other. There is an interview booth for lawyers and clients, reminiscent of a confessional. Up near the ceiling, there are eight tall, rectangular windows, their Venetian blinds in varying degrees of disarray.
Judge John Walsh, a former police inspector who oversees arraignments throughout the city, recalls watching from the bench some years ago as a pigeon flew into the courtroom through an open window, circled the room as if according to long habit, then came blithely to rest in an indoor nest.
"You see what's on that screen?" he asked a visitor one afternoon, pointing out a mysterious constellation of small white globs on an out-of-use video monitor that had come to rest on top of the interview booth.
"Spitballs," he said.
 
A Revolving Cast
The cast of characters at night court is shifting yet somehow constant. Criminal- and civil-court judges are assigned in rotating five-night shifts. The lawyers cycle in and out, too. Only the court officers are regulars, a tight-knit group with a shared social life outside of court.
As for the accused, they have a certain superficial sameness. If they look as if they slept in their clothes, they did. They appear weary and bedraggled; some are sick. Told to keep their coats with them, many stand before the judge in down jackets, as though expecting snow.
Some stare at their feet, hands behind their backs. Some list to one side, looking warily at the judge. Some chortle in disbelief at the prosecutor's account. Some are mentally ill; many are indigent. Some are in withdrawal; a few are diabetics in danger of insulin shock.
"We have a great deal of trouble getting credibility with our clients, for all sorts of socio-economic and other reasons," said Mr. Pokart, 58, who joined the Legal Aid Society, a nonprofit agency that provides representation for indigent defendants, after graduating from Harvard Law School, then getting a degree in theater directing and running soldier shows in Vietnam.
"Clients often ask us, 'Are you a paid lawyer?' " he said. "You can make a joke and say, 'No, I do this for the fun of it.' So they smile, maybe. But they think of us as not paid lawyers because they're not paying us."
"So, we're not 'paid lawyers,' " he continued. "Generally we're white and they're not. We're well dressed and they're not. We're educated and they're not. We're out of jail and they're in there." Furthermore, he said, many of them have been badly represented by incompetent lawyers before. He added, "So there is a great deal of mistrust."
Each arraignment tends to follow a pattern. A defendant is brought into the courtroom through the door leading to the holding cells and is deposited on one of several wooden benches. There he is left to wait with maybe a dozen other men and women, their backs to the public, until a court officer calls his case.
 
Building Drama
Cases are announced in a loud, barely intelligible rush of terminology. The defendant takes his place next to his lawyer, whom he met minutes earlier in an interview booth adjoining the pens. The prosecutor asks that bail be at a certain level; the defense wants it lower.
If the defendant's mother is in the courtroom, she is pointed out -- an indication that the accused might be counted on to come back to court. The defense lawyer might talk about the client's job, if he has one, or his medical condition, if he has one, and how he will suffer if held in jail.
"Our job is to help them as lawyers," said Mr. Pokart, who once tossed a client's glass eye to a judge while making the case that the client could not keep it clean in jail. "If they're locked up at arraignment, helping them as a lawyer means to get them out of jail."
Then comes the judge's turn.
He or she skims a sheaf of papers: a one-page complaint; the defendant's rap sheet; a brief report on where he lives, how long he has lived there, whether he works, where he works, and a bail recommendation from the private agency that the city uses to prepare such reports and recommend bail.
The judge then has a minute or two to set bail. Maybe three.
"If they're not decisive, they had better become decisive very quickly," said Judge Walsh, who retired as a police officer, was sworn in as a judge and hit night court all in the same week. "You have to make decisions and there's no second call, no let-me-think or what-do-you-think? You're the one."
What is more, the decisions are hard and the judge has little information to go on. "I've never had something bad happen," Judge Pickholz said. "That's every judge's nightmare. That's the one thing you don't want to be responsible for -- having somebody get hurt because of something you've done."
 
Intermission
The pressure lifts briefly when the court breaks for dinner around 9 P.M. It is a segregated ritual: Judges gravitate to Forlini's, a nearby Italian restaurant, defense lawyers to Chinatown, court officers to their desks. When they return, many are fighting exhaustion.
Other tasks punctuate the night. Some defendants, charged with misdemeanors, plead guilty and must be sentenced. Sometimes orders of protection and search warrants need to be signed. Often, there are defendants with drug problems that jail will not help and who have no other place to go.
"You have to get yourself some help," Judge Pickholz told a woman, who was 41 but looked 60, limping toward the bench to be arraigned on yet another misdemeanor drug charge. "Do you know that? Because you're going to end up in jail or dead on the street."
The woman nodded blankly. A tourist dozing in the second row snapped awake. It was well past midnight. The defense lawyer and the prosecutor huddled with the judge. "She's a lost soul," the judge said quietly. "If you want to help get her into a program, I'm not going to keep her in jail."
Though the woman had a record, the prosecutor agreed to reduce the charge from a misdemeanor to a lesser category called a violation. That way, the woman could plead guilty and not be charged with violating her probation. Maybe she would even get help.
The judge thanked him.
"There's a place for D.A.'s like you," she said.
He answered, "I hope they send me there soon."
 
Where to Watch
For those who have an appetite for courtroom drama but who cannot face leaving the living room sofa, the current television season offers plenty of alternatives to a trip to night court. There's always Court TV, which televises real cases in real courtrooms. Then there is a flourishing genre of courtroom drama more akin to soap opera. The best known is "Judge Judy," with Judge Judith A. Sheindlin presiding, which now outstrips "Oprah" and "Jerry Springer" in the daytime ratings. But there are a half-dozen others, and counting, offering a full range of posturing plaintiffs, cranky judges and speedy justice -- all in the tidy space between commercials. Here is a sampling of courtroom shows on television and when they are broadcast in the New York region:
 
"JUDGE JOE BROWN" -- 3 P.M. weekdays on Channel 9.
 
"JUDGE JUDY," with Judith A. Sheindlin, a former New York Family Court judge -- 4 and 4:30 P.M. weekdays on Channel 2.

Competition For Cliff Notes

BYLINE: By James Sterngold 

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, March 4

 BODY:
Neither a borrower nor a lender be. . . . whateverrrrrrr!
Shakespeare has always enjoyed at least modest popularity in Hollywood, with one movie studio or another taking a crack at his plays in the form of faithful revivals or loose interpretations. 
 But rarely has there been as big a rush as this year, when audiences will get a chance to see works ranging from "Titus Andronicus," one of Shakespeare's least-known plays, to yet another modernization of "The Taming of the Shrew," this time called "10 Things I Hate About You," set in a high school and geared toward teen-agers.
Six Shakespearean productions are scheduled to hit theaters within the next year, three of them starring Julia Stiles (above) and all hoping to take advantage of the popularity of "Shakespeare in Love," a romantic fantasy that has little to do with the writer's plays or life but has received 13 Academy Award nominations.
Yet nearly everyone in Hollywood considers Shakespeare a box office liability, at least if audiences get the impression they will have to listen to long, opaque soliloquies in antiquated English.
"The trick is how do we overcome it, because there is audience resistance," said Mark Gill, president of the West Coast operations of Miramax Films, the Disney unit that is distributing three of the new Shakespeare movies. "The more contemporary they are, the better the chance they have."
Gil Junger, the director of "10 Things I Hate About You," said he had also been skeptical at first. "My immediate reaction was, a teen-ager is just not going to be interested," said Mr. Junger, until now a director for television, including the episode in which Ellen DeGeneres declared she was a lesbian on her sitcom, "Ellen."
"I just didn't want to do a Shakespeare movie because of the commercial concerns," he said. "But then I read the script and I thought it was a great story. Then I said, 'Of course, it's a great story. It's Shakespeare.' "
The film is scheduled to be released on March 31. In May, it will be followed by "A Midsummer Night's Dream," starring Calista Flockhart, Kevin Kline and Michelle Pfeiffer. A version of "Othello," also set in a high school and called "O," again with Ms. Stiles, is scheduled for an October release.
Late in the year there will be "Titus Andronicus," directed by Julie Taymor and starring Anthony Hopkins and Jessica Lange.
A contemporary version of "Hamlet" set in New York, starring Ethan Hawke, Bill Murray and Ms. Stiles, is expected early next year. That will be followed by a new version of "Love's Labour's Lost," with Kenneth Branagh, Alicia Silverstone and Nathan Lane, set in the 1930's and made with music by Cole Porter, George Gershwin and Jerome Kern.
"It all goes in cycles," Mr. Junger said. "This may be over in a year."
 
A Jackboot to Art
Art, it is often said, transcends politics. "The Harmonists" is a cautionary tale about the risks of believing too much in that old saw.
"The Harmonists," which opens next Friday, is a German movie about an extremely successful group of a cappella singers of the 1930's. Its members, like many Germans of the day, believe that while the Nazis may break a few windows and even a few laws, they will not interfere with the popular arts. The film, which has been quite successful in Germany, examines how wrong they were.
It is based on the true story of the Comedian Harmonists, who were modeled on the American group the Revellers. A play, "Band in Berlin," that is also based on their experiences, opens in New York on Sunday.
The German group was formed in 1927 by Harry Frommermann, a young man in love with music and eager to capture the upbeat sassiness of the day. There were six members, three of them Jewish. The movie ends with the group's forced dissolution in 1934, all shocked by the Nazis' belligerence yet still unaware of the extent of their evil.
The movie has in fact drawn some criticism for not heavily emphasizing the Holocaust, said Heino Ferch (left), a German actor who plays Roman Cycowski, a Jewish opera singer from Poland who was one of the band members.
Mr. Ferch, a former gymnast and acrobat, said the movie, while ending on a note of foreboding, gives no direct hint of the Holocaust. As a result, he said, some people suggested that the movie pulled its punches.
Buthe said that one of the film's strengths was showing how people only slowly woke up to the Nazis' real agenda.
"It wasn't necessary in a movie like this to go hard on the Holocaust itself," Mr. Ferch said. "It goes deeper in your heart, I think, because you can see how these people reacted and their denial. They were Jews, but they thought they were so popular, no one would attack them."
The Nazis later began a crackdown on what they called Jewish art or degenerate art, banishing or killing artists in many fields.
But the movie keeps its gaze tightly focused on the hopes, dreams and personal lives of the Comedian Harmonists.
In one striking scene, Mr. Ferch's character says he will marry his girlfriend only if she converts to Judaism. She does, and the wedding scene, shot in a synagogue in Prague, is a joyous occasion filled with music and dancing, a stark counterpoint to the fate of the group and millions of Jews across Europe.
 
Dimming Star Power
S. Abraham Ravid, a business professor at Rutgers University and New York University, has produced a fairly dense academic paper whose conclusions are supported with entries like "mean of dependent variable," "adjusted R-squared" and "F-statistic."
The paper might not be of much interest outside academia except that it appears to disprove several cherished theories about what makes a movie profitable.
Examining a random sampling of nearly 200 movies, Mr. Ravid said he found that lower-budget movies tended to be more profitable than big-budget pictures, though they often generated less revenue; movies with unknowns or lesser-known actors tended to be more profitable than star-driven films; there was no statistical correlation between the strength of reviews and profitability, but there was a relationship between the number of reviews, no matter how positive, and profitability, and the strongest correlation for profitability was a G or PG rating.
Sequels, he adds, tend to be more profitable than the average film.
Mr. Ravid, a lifelong film buff and a former radio journalist in Israel, said the conclusions in his paper, "Information, Blockbusters and Stars: A Study of the Film Industry," which is to appear in The Journal of Business later this year, surprised him. He said he had undertaken the study to understand the business rationale of paying top dollar for Hollywood stars.
"I wanted to know why would you hire an expensive star right up front for a movie," he said.
The figures contradicted much of the Hollywood wisdom regarding star power, he said. They also conflicted with some recent studies that have purported to show that stars like Mel Gibson and Michelle Pfeiffer (left) have been the biggest profit generators.
Among the reasons his study countered popular wisdom, he said, was that he focused on the profitability of movies, not just their box office revenues. In examining data on older movies, he also adjusted revenue and profit for inflation, so that valid comparisons with could be made with current movies.
"I was actually very much rooting for the stars in my analysis," Mr. Ravid said. "Once I saw which way the results were going, I tried several different definitions of a star, and I was wondering why it wasn't working out. But stars are not what they seem to be. They often bring in higher revenues, but the profitability is smaller."
Why would the studios persist in paying up to $20 million to get a major star in a movie if such films rarely generate big returns?
"I can only speculate, but in an atmosphere of great uncertainty, people try to play it safe," Mr. Ravid said. "They can say everyone else is doing it. That's my best interpretation."

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
Picasso's Ceramics: Seriously Casual

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH 

 BODY:
You should have fun with the exhibition of Picasso's ceramic work at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Picasso certainly seems to have enjoyed carving this particular notch in his cane of art conquests. That he did so during one of the happiest periods of his life may partly account for the unclouded lightness of these charming figures, wittily decorated plates, casseroles, pitchers, masks and glazed-tile paintings. Perhaps the second-class status traditionally accorded ceramics had a relaxing effect, contributing to the air of genius on holiday, veering in and out of focus, that permeates this show.
The best pieces are utterly transparent. They reduce Picasso's transforming genius to its most basic, accessible components; present his favorite subjects in a medium that seem to fuse painting, sculpture and drawing into a single, fluid process, and reveal another side of his easy familiarity with different artistic periods and styles. The less successful works parody those styles to the brink of kitsch and confirm the careless bravado that Picasso could almost always summon: even on automatic pilot he produced things that were at least Picassos and sometimes only that. And they reiterate his reflexive obsession with the female form. When is a vessel just a vessel? Almost never. 
 By the late 1940's, Picasso was withdrawing from the pressures of Paris and spending more and more time in the south of France, enjoying a brief period of family life with his young mistress, Francoise Gilot. In 1947 they had a son, Claude, and in 1949, a daughter, Paloma. Also in 1947, Picasso began to work at Madoura, the pottery factory of Georges and Suzanne Ramie in Vallauris, near Antibes. Blessed with ground that yielded excellent clay, Vallauris had been an important ceramics-producing center from Roman times to the 1920's, when metal cooking vessels began to replace the traditional earthenware. The Ramies extended the invitation to Picasso partly in the hope that his presence would help revive the town's depressed economy, which it did.
Soon Picasso was spending his summers and more and more of his winters at Galloise, a villa above Vallauris, renting an old perfume factory there as a sculpture studio and, for a decade, even producing linoleum-cut posters for the town's small summer ceramics festival. (They line the reading room in the Met exhibition and have the same offhand liveliness as the ceramics.) His involvement with ceramics, which was most intense during the late 1940's, eventually resulted in more than 3,000 objects that form the only patch of terra incognito remaining on the well-charted continent of his art. It is noteworthy that after his death, every art object in his estate was photographed except the ceramic works, which he owned in abundance. First exhibited around 1950, they were dismissed by influential potters like Bernard Leach in England and viewed with embarrassment by the art world.
"Picasso: Painter and Sculptor in Clay" affords the first extensive look at Picasso's ceramics while refraining from burdening them with undue claims. The show was seen last fall at the Royal Academy in London, where it was organized by a curatorial team that included Claude Picasso and Bernard Ruiz-Picasso, the artist's grandson. Other curators were Norman Rosenthal and Simonetta Fraquelli of the Royal Academy, and Marilyn McCully, a London-based Picasso scholar.
Showcased in the exhibition's opening gallery are works that hint at the range of styles, forms and subjects to come, as well as some of the ups and downs. On view are a large pitcher painted with robust flowers and a serpent in ultramarine and black; a tall, curving vase that Picasso converted into a female torso by adding a bright yellow bikini so crisply Minimal it might have been painted by Alex Katz; a jolly mask that suggests some kind of high-class touristware, and a bright green plate presenting a ceramic fish, fork and lemon slice, a cliche worn thin by the Surrealists and later thinner still by Robert Arneson.
Also here is a bare-to-the-waist draped figure, a little Venus de Milo with arms. And of course there is the artist himself, shown in Attic-style black silhouette on a green and white pitcher, painting and (on the other side) sculpturing from the nude model. In one of the show's better moments of tossed-off brilliance, the throat of the pitcher doubles as clerestory studio windows through which birds and treetops are visible. Such depictive finesse becomes excessive later in the show, in a group of elliptical platters and small bowls whose curves recreate that most macho of Picasso motifs, the bullring, with almost cloying accuracy.
The show has been beautifully installed by William S. Lieberman, the chairman of 20th-century art at the Met and a veteran of many Picasso shows. Happily, nearly everything can be seen in the round. Unhappily, some interesting pieces were not lent to the New York stop, including some early dabblings in ceramics dating from the late 1920's, in which Picasso painted images onto vases made by Jean van Dongen, the brother of the painter Kees van Dongen. Other works were simply trimmed from the display, among them a singularly rugged hybrid sculpture (1950-51) that consists of an earthenware vase embedded in a larger, cruder pitcher made of cast plaster.
At first, Picasso merely added glazed images and decorations to traditional plates thrown on the wheel by the potters at Madoura. Or he cleverly reshaped vases fresh off the potter's wheel, adding a few dents, dots, dashes and wavy black lines to create a woman in a billowing Fortunyesque gown, for example.
But he also began designing zoomorphic pieces, made of combinations of thrown forms that were often innovative departures from ancient jugs and amphoras. These include the reclining kid goat in the show's second gallery, and the man and woman mounted on a bull and a horse. The extended necks of these vessels, with curving arms attached, double as the human figures. The images of these animals are split and splayed ingeniously onto tilted bullet-shaped volumes -- one more round in the continual contest between two- and three-dimensional forms that began with the two-eyed profiles of "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon."
And naturally, Picasso began to rove through history, creating amusing fragments that parody the black and red vases of Classical Greece or depict arcadian fauns and flute players who began to re-enter his art in the 1920's. Most convincing in this category are the regal women inspired by Hellenistic Tanagra figures, who are shown draped in patterned robes.
The rims of certain plates have wonderful details, even when their central images fail to impress: decorative borders suggestive of French peasant pottery, or colored confetti that seems lifted from his own pointillist-flavored Cubist works of the late teens. And of course there are images of Francoise: on one plate she's depicted sentimentally as a doe-eyed beauty, on its neighbor in crude childish scribbles of red and blue punctuated by a sharp-pointed nose. Next to this, her face appears again, this time carved into a mask with powerful volumes and startled eyes. After 1954, there are portraits of Jacqueline Roche, the saleswoman Picasso met in the Remies' workshop, who became his companion and, in 1961, his wife.
While not overburdening Picasso's ceramics with claims of greatness, the exhibition and its catalogue, which includes essays by Claude Picasso, Bernard Ruiz-Picasso and Ms. McCully, also stops short of putting them in an appropriate historical context. But that's fine for now. This show opens new territory. A land-rush of research homesteaders will undoubtedly follow.
One hopes that future scholars will reintegrate Picasso's ceramics into his work as a whole and consider it in relation to the work of his contemporaries in the fields of both art and craft. Some of the ceramic pieces were cast in bronze, but only one example is included here, the gracefully streamlined "Centaur," from 1947-48, which carries a tiny water jug on his back.
How do Picasso's efforts in clay compare with Matisse's sojourn in the applied arts, which resulted in the chapel at nearby Vence? And what was their effect on ceramic art? Despite Bernard Leach's dismissal, a new book on 20th-century English craft by Tanya Harrod states that in the early 1950's, a younger generation of English potters found Picasso's ceramics liberating in their improvisatory high-spiritedness, their modernity and their disdain of function, qualities that provided alternatives to Leach's emphasis on Asian ceramic traditions.
Most interesting of all will be a consideration of their relationship to the work from Picasso's last decade, when his involvement with ceramics decreased and he turned to painting and printmaking, often working in bouts of feverish productivity. Mr. Lieberman has included two of Picasso's late paintings from the Met's collection in the exhibition's final gallery, creating a fascinating coda. Their blending colors and fluid forms could well have been influenced by both the unpredictable melting of glazes in the Madoura kilns and the abandon with which Picasso applied them. It is interesting to think that these untroubled ceramic pieces, intimating a pastoral idyll beneath an eternal Mediterranean sun, might have helped set the stage for the desperate turmoil of the late paintings, which often convey a portrait of the artist staring death in the face and working against the clock.
"Picasso: Painter and Sculptor in Clay" is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82d Street, through June 6.

Broadway
 
* "DEATH OF A SALESMAN." In the harrowing half-century anniversary revival of Arthur Miller's masterwork, you walk right into the mind of its decimated hero, played with majestic, unnerving transparency by Brian Dennehy. Robert Falls's shadow-shrouded, powerhouse staging never looks down on Mr. Miller's deluded Brooklyn dreamer or looks ennoblingly up to him as a martyr to a success-driven country. Instead, it demands that you experience Willy's suffering without sociological distance, that you surrender to the sense of one man's pain. Yes, there's no avoiding the clunky speechifying and symbolism. But this interpretation is, above all, committed to the work's tragic, conflicted familial love story. Even as it expertly conjures Willy's grimly distorted worldview, the production lets us see clearly his effect on those around him. Led superbly by Elizabeth Franz, who redefines the role of Linda Loman, and Kevin Anderson, as Willy's rudderless elder son, those people express, in highly personalized portraits, the genuine pity and terror given more abstract voice by the choruses of Greek tragedy. (3:00). O'Neill, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 P.M.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 P.M.; Sundays at 3 P.M. Tickets: $40 to $65; $25 rush tickets may be available the day of show (Ben Brantley). 

*+ "ELECTRA." The foul deeds of "Electra" may have been recorded nearly two and a half millenniums ago, but in this masterly modern-dress version, they are as raw as the lead item off the police blotter. The portrait of a family convulsed by violence and betrayal is so potent and harrowing, it leaves you dazed and weirdly giddy. A daughter plots murder; a mother is butchered; a son is up to his elbows in blood. And you couldn't be more delighted. With the astounding Zoe Wanamaker in the title role, giving the proverbial performance of her career, this "Electra" is the most significant restaging of a classic on Broadway since the revisionist "Doll's House" with Janet McTeer. It's a provocative evening that re-acquaints you with the potent, unprocessed power of Greek drama; you're swept along by the narrative, majestic in its directness and simplicity (1:30). Barrymore, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 P.M.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 P.M.; Sundays at 3 P.M. Tickets: $35 and $60; student rush tickets available on day of show, $20 (Peter Marks).
 
*+ "NOT ABOUT NIGHTINGALES." Tennessee Williams was 27 and living miserably with his parents when he created this fascinatingly conflicted melodrama, which is only now making its New York debut and has been given a superb Anglo-American production under the direction of Trevor Nunn. "It may be very good or very bad," the young Williams wrote in his journal. "I don't know." It is, in fact, both. The brutal story of a prison hunger strike, "Nightingales" follows the formulas of gritty, behind-bars potboilers from the 1930's. Yet like the play's restive prisoners its author twists and turns within the self-imposed confines of his generic plot, breaking through with an agonized lyricism and empathy for people in cages that's all his own. Led strongly by Corin Redgrave, as an evil warden, and Finbar Lynch, as a self-taught intellectual inmate, the sterling cast matches Williams's compassion with unconditional commitment. And every production detail melds to create an airless universe sapped of color and hope, a world in which death is just one step away and madness even closer (3:00). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 P.M.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 P.M.; Sundays at 3 P.M. Tickets: $60 and $65 (Brantley).
 
*+ "SIDE MAN." In its depiction of a young man struggling to remain the glue in the troubled marriage of his vacant, trumpet-playing father and unbalanced, alcoholic mother, this lovely play has an abiding power. But if you go to "Side Man" expecting tour de force portrayals or actorly pyrotechnics, you're liable to feel as if you've walked into the wrong neighborhood. Go instead for the more refined pleasures of Warren Leight's offbeat story and his true-to-life, as opposed to larger-than-life, characters. The production, directed by Michael Mayer, is a mirror of its Roundabout incarnation, with one important exception: the addition to the cast of the movie actor Christian Slater in the central role of the play's put-upon son and narrator. He delivers a performance that is courageously economical (2:30). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 P.M.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 P.M.; Sundays at 3 P.M. Tickets: $25 to $60; student rush, $20 (Marks).
 
Off Broadway
 
* "BEAUTIFUL THING." The generosity of spirit abundantly evident in Jonathan Harvey's script, and the well-matched, down-to-earth performances by Matt Stinton and Daniel Eric Gold are the principal assets of this endearing, lopsided smile of a British comedy about a boy who falls for the boy next door. The production is not without shortcomings, particularly in the attempt to render realistically, a la Mike Leigh, a slice of London life among the hard-pressed and depressed. Yet despite some distractions, "Beautiful Thing" is worth your attention, because even when Gary Griffin's direction falters, Mr. Harvey's characters hold their own. The offbeat love story unfolds so authoritatively, and in such sweet fits and funny starts, that you quickly grow comfortable in the young men's world. And more than that, the young men at the center of the story are teen-agers you're happy to root for (2:00). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 P.M.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 P.M.; Sundays at 3 and 7 P.M. Tickets: $45 and $47.50 (Marks).
 
++ "CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS." A very dull cruise. Despite a pleasingly uncomplicated performance by Treat Williams as a simple Portuguese fisherman who pulls a spoiled rich boy (Brandon Espinoza) out of the sea, this musical version of the Rudyard Kipling story never picks up much speed. For all its handsome rigging, for all the muscular chanteys and wistful sailing songs by the songwriting team of Frederick Freyer and Patrick Cook, the show itself is rather static and pale; it lacks the sense of momentum and profusion of color that should develop naturally in a musical drama that rides the swells of the Atlantic. The lusty men of the fishing trawler, posed in choirlike formations, sing of their love of the adventure of going to sea, but nothing that happens onstage makes us believe this is so (2:15). Manhattan Theater Club, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 P.M.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2:30 and 8 P.M.; Sundays at 4 P.M. Tickets: $60 (Marks).
 
++ "FAR EAST." A. R. Gurney's uneven but very poignant account of a young American naval officer, Sparky Watts (Michael Hayden) seeking to find (or lose) himself in the Japan of the 1950's. For Mr. Gurney as well as his alter ego Sparky, "Far East" represents a serious bid for escape from the world that has defined him: that of the well-bred WASP. The playwright tries hard to extend his reach, to find in Sparky's coming of age a mirror for America's rediscovering itself after World War II. It's too large a burden for this comedy's slender, gracefully sloped shoulders. Yet what is good here, especially the scenes portraying Sparky's ambivalent friendship with an officer's wife (played to perfection by Lisa Emery), is as good as anything Mr. Gurney has written. Under Daniel Sullivan's first-rate direction the production is a welcome reminder of the appeal of its author's gliding dialogue and structural elegance as well as of the troubled, rueful heart that informs all of Mr. Gurney's work (2:00). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 P.M.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 P.M.; Sundays at 3 P.M. Tickets: $55 (Brantley).
 
* "THE HOTHOUSE." Pinter for Pinterphobes. This fractured, little-seen farce from 1958, here given an exemplary production by the Atlantic Theater Company, suggests that the ever enigmatic Harold Pinter could have flourished as a member of Monty Python or "Beyond the Fringe." "The Hothouse" applies the rhythms of old vaudeville routines to the darker complexities of the modern world, in this case represented by a state-run convalescent home. The play has some ham-fisted (and unnecessary) detours into apocalyptic darkness, but like the best of Pinter, it reminds of just how surreal our own everyday reality is, and in doing so, it is criminally good fun. The director Karen Kohlhaas brings the discipline of a military drill to the evening's sublimely unseemly goings-on. And every member of the ensemble, headed by Larry Bryggman as the ultimate clueless man in charge, creates a distinctly individual comic construct while clicking right into the overall Swiss-watch precision (2:00). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 P.M.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 P.M.; Sundays at 7 P.M. Tickets: $35 and $40; student rush $10 (Brantley).
 
"THE MINEOLA TWINS." Playing both title roles in this political cartoon of a play by Paula Vogel, the wonderful Swoosie Kurtz gets to show off the highly refined comic exaggeration that first made her name in the New York theater. As the buxom, right-wing Myrna and the flat-chested, left-wing Myra, Ms. Kurtz scores personal, devilish points off familiar archetypes, and what she does with a simple straitjacket is a marvel. Unfortunately, as these characters squabble through four decades of American life, they are never much more than the sums of their slogans and fashion accessories. The production itself, with the resourceful Joe Mantello directing a stylish supporting cast, is first-rate, a sort of pop hymn to the transforming powers of theater. But in manipulating cultural cliches, Ms. Vogel (of the far superior "How I Learned To Drive") usually fails to transcend them, with jokes at least as old as the first season of "Saturday Night Live" (2:15). Laura Pels, 1530 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 719-1300. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 7:30 P.M.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2:30 and 7:30 P.M.; Sundays at 2:30 P.M. Tickets: $55 (Brantley).
 
*+ "THE MYSTERY OF IRMA VEP." Far and away the funniest two hours unfolding anywhere on a New York stage. The revival of Charles Ludlam's 1984 hit, played with a consummate sense of comic timing by that old Ridiculous Theatrical Company hand Everett Quinton and a bright newcomer, Stephen DeRosa, is just about all one could hope for in outrageous Gothic spoofing that incorporates such dainty devices as leering Egyptian mummies, blood-soaked oil portraits and bald men in billowing gowns. Mr. Quinton is priceless as both the insecure lady of the manor and a double-dealing tour guide to the pyramids who turns "sarcophagus" into the most hilarious word in the English-Egyptian dictionary. Mr. DeRosa is splendid as everything from an embittered maid to a swaggering lord of the manor. The quick-change routines alone are worth the trip (2:00). Westside Theater, 407 West 43d Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 P.M.; Saturdays at 7 and 10 P.M.; Sundays at 3 and 7 P.M. Tickets: $49.50 (Marks).
 
Long-Running: Broadway
 
Here are summaries of Ben Brantley's and Peter Marks's reviews:
 
*+ "LES MISERABLES." Like a faded fresco lovingly restored, the refurbished version of this Broadway warhorse has regained many of its original colors. Chief among the new assets are excellent cast additions. Still, as in the early days, you barely crack a smile in three hours of gorgeous harmony and pageantry (3:15). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 P.M.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 P.M.; Sundays at 3 P.M. Tickets: $15 to $75.
 
+ "MISS SAIGON." Age has both mellowed and invigorated this show. The staging is as sure and crisp as ever; the second-act evacuation scene remains a stunner (2:30). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53d Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. Mondays through Saturdays at 8 P.M.; Wednesdays and Saturdays also at 2 P.M. Tickets: $15 to $75.
 
+ "TITANIC." Going under without Leonardo or Celine and, for that matter, without tears. This is the hit musical blueprint of the legendary maritime disaster, a good-looking, cool and efficient piece of narrative that perversely fails to capitalize on its two obvious trump cards, sentimentality and suspense (2:35). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 P.M.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 P.M.; Sundays at 3 P.M. Tickets: $45 to $80; $20, for students and the elderly, available on the day of the show at the box office.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Climbed 7.6% In February

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Retailers' sales at stores open at least a year rose 7.6 percent in February, more than expected, as shoppers snapped up basic household goods at discounters like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and new spring fashions at clothing chains like Gap Inc., according to a report released yesterday.
The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi's report for sales at stores open at least a year, a standard industry measure, beat its forecast of a 5.5 percent increase. Wal-Mart's sales rose 10.3 percent, topping the industry leader's plan for a 5 percent to 7 percent gain. Sales rose 12 percent at Gap, whose chains also include Old Navy. 
 Retail sales have exceeded estimates five months in a row as the strong economy, low unemployment and rising wages leave shoppers confident and flush with cash. Spending is expected to stay robust through the first half of the year, analysts said.
"This is a gangbusters economy supported by consumer spending," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo in Minneapolis. "Some retailers are having problems keeping merchandise on the shelves."
Electronics and appliance chains saw strong sales of big-ticket items such as DVD players, satellite televisions and wireless phones. Same-store sales rose 11 percent at the Best Buy Company, the biggest chain, and at the Tandy Corporation's Radio Shack. Circuit City Group said strong sales, including a 12 percent rise last month, would help it exceed fiscal fourth-quarter profit estimates.
February's sales beat the 5.4 percent gain in the month a year ago and was the biggest for the month since 1992, said the Bank of Tokyo, whose sales index includes 83 companies. February is the smallest month of the year for retail sales, according to the National Retail Federation. Same-store sales are a key indicator of a retailer's business because they exclude new, renovated and closed stores.
Wal-Mart's sales gain was its second double-digit increase this year. The Kmart Corporation, the No. 2 discount retailer in the United States, reported a higher-than-expected 5.8 percent increase.
The Dayton Hudson Corporation, whose Target discount chain accounts for about two-thirds of its revenue, said same-store sales rose 8.3 percent.
Among the apparel chains, sales rose 13 percent at the Limited Inc., the biggest specialty clothing retailer, with chains including the Limited and Express. The Ann Taylor Stores Corporation's sales rose 21.4 percent on demand for women's career clothing. Talbots Inc.'s sales fell 7.1 percent, largely because the women's clothing retailer had fewer inventory markdowns to draw shoppers than a year earlier, analysts said.
Shoppers largely overlooked mid-price department stores for the brand names at the more expensive department stores, bargains at the discount chains or clothing styles at specialty chains.
The J. C. Penney Company's department-store sales declined four-tenths of a percent, while Sears, Roebuck & Company's rose eight-tenths of a percent.
Department stores that fared well include Federated Department Stores Inc. and the May Department Stores Company.
Federated, which owns Bloomingdale's, Macy's and other chains, said sales rose 1 percent. Sales at May, which runs the Lord & Taylor, Foley's, Filene's and Hecht's stores, increased 3.7 percent.

HEADLINE: U.S. Calls China Trade Talks 'Productive'

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 4

 BODY:
After two days of meetings, China and the United States have "made important progress" in defining terms for China to join the World Trade Organization, said the United States' senior trade official. But the official cautioned that there were still significant differences between the countries and "a number of issues remained to be addressed."
"The Chinese Government has exhibited a very serious attitude and strength of purpose that has helped to make this week particularly productive," said Charlene Barshefsky, the United States Trade Representative, who said that she had met for over two hours with Prime Minister Zhu Rongji. 
 Despite the many caveats, Ms. Barshefsky's remarks were by far the most optimistic assessment in many months of China's chances of joining the W.T.O., the Geneva-based organization that sets the rules for international trade. She said that her chief negotiators would remain in the Chinese capital to work on a more detailed plan, although she refused to elaborate on areas of concern.
China has long sought entry into the organization, but on the more lenient conditions offered to third-world countries. The United States has countered that China's economy is too large to be classed among the world's poorest nations.
Just three months ago, Chinese and American officials were saying that membership in the organization was a dead issue this year, convinced that China's current economic slowdown would make it impossible for the country to open its markets to the extent required for membership.
But the prospect of more stringent trade organization entrance requirements in the future, as well as the need for an image-lift before Prime Minister Zhu's visit to Washington next month, have rekindled interest in a deal. Today, Chinese officials seemed determined to make a run at membership in the organization, whatever the short-term economic pains.
Ms. Barshefsky said that two or three months ago, Chinese officials suddenly "indicated that they wished to re-engage in earnest" -- a request that has been followed by a series of negotiations, culminating in Ms. Barshefsky's visit to Beijing this week, "at the request of the Chinese Government."
Some experts say the new enthusiasm is related to the fact that Taiwan, which China regards as a breakaway province, is itself concluding membership negotiations. But a stronger impetus seems to be that the trade organization is expected to redraw the membership requirements this fall at a meeting in Seattle, and many believe that entrance requirements will get stiffer at that time.
"If China doesn't become a member before the Seattle meeting later this year, the issue will drag on for years," said Ji Chongwei, a senior researcher in the central Government's Development and Research Center. "I personally think it is hopeful that China can reach an agreement with the U.S. in the near future."
The need to mend fences before Mr. Zhu's visit to the United States next month has also put pressure on both sides.
The collegial relationship that the United States and China built up through early 1998, culminating with President Clinton's visit last summer, has been deteriorating since late last year, bruised by Beijing's renewed crackdown on political dissidents and other issues.
Although Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright took great pains to promote cordial engagement when she visited here this week, the two sides have exchanged harsh words over human rights, defense policy and technology exchanges in recent months.
In Beijing and Washington, there is hope that progress toward China joining the organization would patch up the facade if not the substance the relationship.
"Both China and the U.S. hope to make some breakthroughs on bilateral relations during Zhu Rongji's visit," said Xue Ning, a researcher at the World Trade Organization Shanghai Research Center, a Chinese Government research agency. "There won't be progress on issues like Taiwan, human rights, Tibet or religious belief. So to make the visit look good, both sides have the incentive to reach some agreement on W.T.O."
It is hard to imagine what kind of deal could emerge or what trade barriers the Chinese would be willing to drop at a time when many factories are idle and laying off millions of workers.
They have until now been extremely reluctant to significantly lower import duties, or to allow foreign companies to operate in such potentially lucrative sectors as insurance, banking and telecommunications.
A 100 percent import duty on foreign cars has insured that middle-class Chinese generally buy tinny domestic models. Many major Western banks and insurers have set up offices in China in the hope that the service sector would soon open, but their representatives now sit idle.
If tariffs were lowered and market access improved, "Chinese companies will lose some share" of the market, Mr. Xue said. But there are potential benefits as well, like greater access to Western markets at a time when China's exports to countries like Japan and Thailand have dried up with the Asian financial crisis.
Many experts say they believe that any deal would have to involve a timetable for the gradual lowering of tariffs and opening of markets over a period of years.
"If this is done overnight, many Chinese industrial sectors won't be able to handle it, since China's state-owned enterprises still have a lot of problems" said Mr. Ji. "This can only be done step by step."
Even if negotiators from the two sides can agree on terms, it remains to be seen if the United States Congress will go along.
Congress, which submits China's most-favored-nation trade status to an annual review, would have to vote to change that practice in order for China to be accepted into the W.T.O, since the organization's 134 members are automatically granted that status.
And at a time when the Senate is criticizing China's human-rights record, Congress will certainly require, at the very least, a solid deal.
"The W.T.O. package will be scrutinized -- it must be real, it must be tangible," Ms. Barshefsky said, adding, "Accession will only occur on commercially viable terms."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Computer IssuesRejuvenated, With Dow Up 191.52

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
After weeks of sour news on technology stocks, the sector received a boost yesterday when I.B.M. announced that it had won a $16 billion order from Dell Computer for parts like disk drives and displays.
That news gave the broader market a lift after more than a week of a general slide. But despite the 2 percent jump in the Dow Jones industrial average and the 1.5 percent surge in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, the market is still locked in the trading range it has been in since January. 
 "We are stuck in a trading range because we had prices get well ahead of earnings," said Douglas R. Cliggott, United States equity strategist at J. P. Morgan Securities. "Values are stretched so far it will be difficult for the market to make any headway unless interest rates go down."
So far this year, long-term interest rates have jumped more than half a percentage point despite the lowest inflation, according to some measures, in more than 40 years. The reason for the rise has been the refusal of the economy to slow down and the growing concern among investors that the Federal Reserve will have to raise rates to rein in growth.
With today's jobs report for February, investors will get a new indication of how strong the economy still is and, in turn, a signal on whether interest rates will keep rising. The consensus estimate for nonfarm payroll job growth is 245,000.
If the jobs report is stronger than expected, that will probably send interest rates higher. That should put more pressure on stocks because higher rates make their valuations more expensive. But investors, at least for a day, may decide that stronger economic growth will produce enough of a pop in earnings to overcome this drag.
The Dow rose 191.52 points, to 9,467.40. It is 176 points below the record it hit in January and is up only 1.4 percent since last July, when last year's selloff began. The S.& P. 500 climbed 18.94 points, to 1,246.64, while the Nasdaq composite index rose 27.69 points, or 1.22 percent, to 2,292.89. The Russell index of smaller-company stocks finished up 2.07 points at 394.02. While the three other major indexes are up slightly for the year, the Russell is off 6.6 percent.
While the I.B.M. announcement helped lift the broad market, its effect on technology shares was less than might have been expected. And that is because investors continue to have doubts about the outlook after a series of announcements of earnings and sales shortfalls from the likes of Dell, Micron Technology, Compaq Computer and 3Com.
Mr. Cliggott said that a report released yesterday showing that factory orders increased 1.7 percent in January, to a seasonally adjusted $349.6 billion, indicated that the growth trend for semiconductors was still healthy. But the data also showed that the growth rate for the personal computer and telecommunications sectors was slowing, he said.
Shares of I.B.M. finished the day up 4 1/4, to 171. But it was well off its high of 177. Intel rose as high as 117 7/8 in early trading but fell in the afternoon, finishing down 1 5/16, to 113 3/8.

Treasury Prices Move Little As Investors Await Jobs Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities were little changed yesterday, as anxious investors awaited the release of the Government's monthly jobs data today.
The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond slipped 2/32 , to 93 21/32 . Its yield was unchanged at 5.69 percent yesterday. 
 One manager said market participants feared that a number above 250,000 new jobs could scare away many investors and cause the yield on the long bond to rise to last summer's levels, heightening speculation that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates later this year to combat inflation.
But things could go the other way if today's number shows that fewer jobs were added to the economy in February, setting the stage for a rally in the bond market.
A surge in the economy during the first two months of the year has caused credit markets to reassess future monetary policy. And a diminishing flow of flight-to-quality buying has reversed some of the premium priced into bonds.
Though economic fundamentals appear to have turned against bonds, higher rates have also attracted some investors away from equity markets in favor of bonds.
Thomas E. Donne, vice president and senior portfolio manager at the Banc One Investment Advisors Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, said, "The fear in the market is really being driven by the seemingly ever- declining weekly initial unemployment claims."
Yesterday, according to the Labor Department, initial claims for state jobless benefits fell by 8,000 in the week ended last Saturday to a seasonally adjusted 286,000. The four-week average of 290,750 is the lowest average in a decade. It was 287,500 on Feb. 24, 1989.
Mr. Donne said the consensus for today's number was about 245,000 jobs created in February, with a range from 200,000 to 300,000. If today's number is under 250,000, he said, the long bond could rally down to a yield of 5.60 percent, but would have trouble declining further without more encouraging news.
"Comments by the Fed chairman recently have pretty much indicated that the central bank is not worried about the liquidity problem of last fall, which was caused by the hedge fund debacles when overseas markets fumbled," Mr. Donne said. "But what they are worried about is an overheated economy and high stock market evaluation."
How much the Fed might do at this month's Federal Open Market Committee meeting on March 30 has already been priced into the market, Mr. Donne said. "The answer is quite a lot," he said.
Some market participants like Mr. Donne say that rates at these levels are high enough to slow the economy.

Europe's Rates Stay Same
 FRANKFURT, March 4 (Bloomberg News) -- The European Central Bank left its interest rates unchanged today, resisting political pressure for a reduction.
As expected, the bank maintained its refinancing rate, a short-term benchmark for the 11-nation euro zone, at 3 percent until its next meeting on March 18. It left its floor deposit rate unchanged at 2 percent and its ceiling marginal-lending rate at 4.5 percent.

HEADLINE: Microsoft to Sell Business Internet Software

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

 BODY:
Projecting a vision of a world in which most buying and selling takes place between machines, the Microsoft Corporation yesterday announced its electronic commerce strategy, a range of software products and services designed to automate business.
Although Microsoft has generally been perceived to be trailing in Internet commerce systems, the company yesterday offered Biztalk, a new language, or a set of conventions, that it said would help draw together disparate business practices and electronic commerce technologies via the Internet. 
 "The Internet is the ultimate market," said William H. Gates, Microsoft's chairman and chief executive. "It's great news for businesses because they can reach out to more customers than ever before."
The new approach will offer businesses the ability to configure electronic systems for retail or business-to-business commerce in a "Lego block" approach, Microsoft executives said.
But they did not announce specific product availability dates or prices, saying only that they would be available shortly after the company's much-delayed Windows 2000 operating system, the successor to Windows NT, which is scheduled to be released before the end of the year.
Microsoft also announced Commerce Server version 3.0, a software program designed for Windows 2000.
As part of its new initiative, Microsoft also announced a variety of new business partnerships and the acquisition of Comparenet, a comparison-shopping Web site that it intends to integrate into its MSN Web portal.
Microsoft is trying to turn MSN into a marketplace by offering services that will make it easier for small businesses to build an on-line store.
Industry analysts said that although Microsoft was late and trailed competitors like I.B.M. in the electronic commerce space, the software company's new strategy appeared to be a systematic approach.
"They're definitely late; it's a me-too strategy compared to companies like Yahoo and America Online," said Michael Putnam, a business and technology analyst at Forrester Research Inc., a market research firm in Cambridge, Mass.
He added that the strategy was a good one but suggested that Microsoft might run into resistance from competitors and from its own customers and business partners in its attempt to evangelize a broad standard with the Biztalk language.
"I don't think Biztalk is a good thing," he said. "Standards are critical for the growth of Internet commerce, but this is like General Motors making the traffic rules."
Microsoft executives predicted yesterday that the accelerating pace of electronic commerce would shortly begin to transform some products that have been sold as physical objects into digital information.
Speaking in defense of what he has called "friction free capitalism," Mr. Gates said that products like music and books would increasingly be purchased in electronic form.
"A lot of products that today are in physical form will become digital," he said.
Industry analysts were skeptical that Microsoft would be able to achieve meaningful dominance in electronic commerce markets, because it will have difficulty harnessing broadly used Internet standards to its proprietary software.
The company has chosen to build its Biztalk "framework" around an industry Web standard known as XML, which is being used to connect data bases to the Internet.
"If they're not using industry-standard XML, they're out of luck," said Kimball Brown, a computer industry analyst at Dataquest, a San Jose, Calif., market research firm. "Microsoft is going to have to play by industry rules."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Brazil Increases a Key Interest Rate to 45%

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, March 4

 BODY:
The Brazilian central bank raised its benchmark interest rate today to 45 percent and granted its new president expanded powers to adjust rates in an effort to head off a surge of inflation and to stabilize the country's battered currency.
The monetary authority's actions were the first to be taken under Arminio Fraga, a former aide to the financier George Soros. Mr. Fraga was confirmed on Wednesday as central bank president by the Brazilian Senate after an acrimonious debate. At a news conference in Brasilia this afternoon, Mr. Fraga promised a vigorous response to the country's financial crisis, saying his administration would be "pro-active, not reactive." 
 The interest rate increase, from 39 percent, helped steady the Brazilian currency, the real, in trading today. The real has declined in value against the dollar by more than 40 percent since mid-January. After hitting an all-time low of 2.22 to the dollar on Tuesday, the real recovered strongly, closing at 2.07 to the dollar, up 3.9 percent from Wednesday. The stock market also reacted favorably, grateful for any indication that the Government was taking the offensive. Sao Paulo's Bovespa exchange rose 3.9 percent.
In remarks to reporters after announcing the interest rate increase, Mr. Fraga made it clear that his primary goal was to stem the sharp rise in consumer prices brought on by the devaluation of the real. "The exchange rate is important, but what will determine our success or not is the rate of inflation," he said.
With the real under siege, the central bank earlier this week announced, apparently at Mr. Fraga's behest, that banks' compulsory deposit requirements would be raised to 26.5 percent as of Friday and 30 percent later this month. The monetary authority said it was taking that step "to dry up liquidity" and "relieve pressure on the real."
In raising interest rates, Mr. Fraga was adhering to advice profferred by the International Monetary Fund. At a news conference in Washington on Wednesday, the fund's chief economist, Michael Mussa, said that while he hoped Brazilian "interest rates will end up this year substantially lower" than they did in 1998, "if the real continues to depreciate, they will probably need to push up interest rates further."
But not all analysts agree with that approach. In an interview with the Globo News cable channel on Wednesday, Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard University professor who has served as an adviser to several emerging countries, argued that Brazil should immediately cut the interest rate to 20 percent in an effort to create jobs and slow the increase of its mounting internal deficit.

HEADLINE: U.S. Starts Push to Salvage Kosovo Talks

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, March 4

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration is unleashing what it hopes will be a speedy diplomatic offensive to salvage the Kosovo peace proposal in an effort to avoid a reprise of the last inconclusive round of talks.
The goal was to have a deal ready to sign by March 15, said officials, But they said if that proved too ambitious they hoped at least to have the ethnic Albanians' agreement pinned down by the time the talks are scheduled to resume next week in France and to know exactly where the main impediment to a settlement, the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, stood. 
So far, Mr. Milosevic has stood on the sidelines in Belgrade, building his forces in and around Kosovo and watching as the threat of NATO air strikes against him subsided after the earlier talks in Rambouillet, France. But tonight he put up his first obstacle to the new American offensive.
The Administration has enlisted former Senator Bob Dole, a champion of the ethnic Albanian cause, to go to Kosovo to try to persuade the ethnic Albanians to agree to the settlement that they balked at signing more than a week ago in Rambouillet. Mr. Milosevic has, however, denied Mr. Dole a visa to enter Yugoslavia. He planned instead to have his meetings with ethnic Albanian leaders in Skopje, the Macedonian capital.
Waiting in the wings was a special envoy, Richard C. Holbrooke, who, officials said, was asked by the Administration this week to take the settlement, after the ethnic Albanians have signed it, to Mr. Milosevic for approval. The Yugoslav leader has continued to object strenuously to the main element of the plan, deploying 28,000 NATO-led peacekeepers, including 4,000 American soldiers, in Kosovo.
Despite the renewed efforts, the Administration appeared less than certain that the strategy would fall into place.
The plan to tackle Mr. Milosevic as soon as possible cannot get off the ground until agreement is won from the ethnic Albanians, who proved at Rambouillet to be unpredictable.
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright indicated the uncertainties tonight after arriving in Indonesia at the end of a three-country trip in Asia.
"We'll have to see whether this process will be successful this time," Ms. Albright said of Mr. Dole's mission at a news conference here. Of the ethnic Albanians, she said, "I don't know when they are going to sign is the answer."
On her first visit to Indonesia as Secretary of State, Ms. Albright has traveled here to encourage the Indonesians to hold free and fair elections on June 7. The first multiparty elections since 1955 occur as Indonesia, the country worst hit by the Asian financial crisis, is undergoing economic and ethnic turmoil.
Hours before Ms. Albright arrived, students who are calling for President B. J. Habibie to resign clashed with baton-wielding police officers in downtown Jakarta.
As Ms. Albright traveled from China to Thailand and now here, Kosovo has remained high on her agenda. It appeared quite likely that if Mr. Dole was successful in his mission that Ms. Albright would change her plans and fly to Brussels to meet him and the Supreme Commander of NATO, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, over the weekend.
Mr. Holbrooke's plans had not been decided, Ms. Albright said tonight.
The Serbian newspaper that is tightly controlled by Mr. Milosevic, Politika, said today that Mr. Holbrooke would arrive in Belgrade "within days."
The likelihood of a swift success by Mr. Dole was cast into doubt by Mr. Milosevic's actions. In the last several weeks his troops have been blocking the borders with Macedonia, which will make it difficult for the ethnic Albanian leaders to slip out of Kosovo.
After the setback at Rambouillet, where the ethnic Albanians rebuffed Ms. Albright and General Clark, the Administration began its concerted campaign to win them over and to work as much as possible before the talks resumed.
Instead of holding the talks at a French air base in Normandy, a situation that could lead to another set of rambling Rambouillet-like negotiations, the Administration was trying to persuade the French to hold the talks in Paris.
The deputy national security adviser, James Steinberg, met the eight-member board of the National Albanian American Council on Wednesday. According to the executive director of the council, Ilir Zherka, that was an effort to insure that the council used its influence to have the leaders of the guerrilla movement in Kosovo sign the agreement.
A main concern of the ethnic Albanians, Mr. Zherka said, was that Mr. Milosevic would be given the opportunity to wring concessions out of the peace plan after the ethnic Albanians had signed it.
Mr. Steinberg reassured the group that if Mr. Milosevic demanded concessions, the ethnic Albanians would have to give their approval or the peace plan would be dead, Mr. Zherka said. "If the Albanians say no to changes, then that's the end of it," Mr. Zherka quoted Mr. Steinberg as having said.
Mr. Dole sought a commitment from Ms. Albright that if he won an agreement from the ethnic Albanians that the plan would not be subject to the whims of Mr. Milosevic, according to Mira Baratta, a senior adviser to Mr. Dole.
In a telephone conversation with this morning, Ms. Albright told Mr. Dole that there could be no "material" changes to the peace plan by Mr. Milosevic, Ms. Baratta said.
Mr. Dole, who has been sympathetic to the ethnic Albanians since visiting Kosovo in 1990 and seeing the Serbian repression there, will be accompanied by a senior State Department official, Jim O'Brien, and a general from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Ms. Baratta said.
Mr. O'Brien, a lawyer who has been involved in the fine print of the peace proposal, will be taking with him a document ready for signing. The proposal calls for a three-year interim period of autonomy for Kosovo, now a province of Serbia, and for the withdrawal of Serbian forces and the demilitarization of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
Mr. Dole plans to meet the leadership of the guerrilla movement, as well as civilian leaders who represent a broad spectrum in Kosovo. Mr. Dole would meet Hashim Thaci, the leader of the ethnic Albanian delegation at Rambouillet who, the Kosovo Liberation Army announced this week, would be the prime minister of an unofficial provisional government.
Mr. Thaci was the holdout at Rambouillet, refusing to sign the peace proposal, apparently because it did not include a referendum on independence after three years. A referendum, which is anathema to Mr. Milosevic, would undoubtedly result in an overwhelming victory for supporters of independence.
"Senator Dole would like the plan signed as soon as possible, because the delay is taking the pressure off Milosevic," Ms. Baratta said. "It's his intention to walk away with the signatures."
As an inducement to sign the plan, the Administration invited members of the Kosovo Liberation Army to go to Washington next week for talks on how the United States could establish relations with the little-understood group.

HEADLINE: Pataki and Giuliani Pick Hudson River Park Board Members

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani appointed board members yesterday to govern a new park to be built along the Hudson River, ending a six-month delay that park advocates feared was jeopardizing the park's progress.
The appointments mean that the Hudson River Trust will automatically come into existence in 30 days. It will be responsible for the planning, design, construction, operation and continuing maintenance of the four-and-a-half-mile Hudson River Park, which will stretch from Battery Park City to 59th Street and will include piers, an esplanade with a bicycle trail and extensive landscaping. 
 "This park is the most important open space project for New York City since the creation of Central Park," the Governor said.
Park advocates had been increasingly critical of Mr. Pataki for delaying his appointments despite his strong backing of the park during his re-election campaign. The law defining and protecting the new park was passed in June, but the Governor waited until September to sign it. And he waited until yesterday to name board members, a delay that his staff has insisted was necessary to find the best candidates.
Park advocates have complained that the delay meant sacrificing cost savings that could have come from constructing the park simultaneously with the reconstruction of the adjacent highway, Route 9A. They have also said that a strong voice from the park board is needed in numerous land-use decisions all along the park.
"Now, we can move forward, and we need to move forward promptly," said Albert K. Butzel, chairman of the Hudson River Park Alliance, a coalition of 35 environmental and civic groups in favor of the park.
The Governor appointed James A. Ortenzio, who has been serving as chairman of the Hudson River Park Conservancy, as the chairman of the new panel. The Mayor and the Governor will alternate in filling the top post. Mr. Ortenzio, a major fund-raiser for both Mr. Pataki and Mr. Giuliani, owns the Long Island Beef Company in Greenwich Village directly opposite the park.
The Mayor appointed Randy L. Levine, Deputy Mayor for Economic Development and Planning, to be vice chairman. Mr. Levine, whose experience includes working as a labor negotiator for Major League Baseball, has been shepherding planning in City Hall for the park.
Mayor Giuliani said the park would "bring a world-class waterfront park to the neighborhoods on the West Side and to millions of New Yorkers."
The Governor's other appointments to the board included Theodore Roosevelt 4th, a managing director of Lehman Brothers who is active in environmental organizations and enjoys kayaking on the Hudson. The others were Diane Taylor, a former gubernatorial aide who is now vice president of Keyspan Energy, and two current officials in his administration, John P. Cahill, the Commissioner of Environmental Conservation, and Bernadette Castro, the State Parks Commissioner.
The Mayor's other appointments were Georgette Mosbacher, a top Republican fund-raiser; Richard Schwartz, a former mayoral adviser and parks official; Joseph B. Rose, Planning Commissioner, and Henry J. Stern, Parks Commissioner.
Earlier, the Manhattan Borough President, C. Virginia Fields, announced that her three appointments would be Franz S. Leichter, the former State Senator who fought for years for the park's creation, and two longtime advocates for the park, Madelyn Wils and Julie Nadel.
In an interview, Mr. Ortenzio denied that there had been a significant break in the momentum and expressed doubt that savings could have been achieved by proceeding with the road and the park simultaneously. He said this could have spawned enormous traffic jams. "And, really, the new highway is going quite nicely," he said.
He also promised to run a cost-efficient operation, perhaps even using an old bus or construction trailer for the trust's offices. "Keep it cheap, keep it clean," he said. "No big staff, no high expenses."

HEADLINE: With Its Deal for Level One, Intel Seeks New Area of Growth

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: SANTA CLARA, Calif., March 4

 BODY:
The Intel Corporation agreed today to buy Level One Communications Inc. for $2.11 billion in stock as it pushes into the fast-growing market for chips used in networking equipment.
Each share of Level One stock is to be exchanged for 0.43 share of Intel stock. That values Level One at $48.75 a share, an 80 percent premium to today's closing price of $27.125. Intel will issue 18.6 million shares for the purchase. 
 Buying Level One gives Intel products for a part of the semiconductor industry that has been growing faster than its traditional processor market, which is slowing along with personal computer sales. Intel's shares have fallen 16 percent in the last week and a half amid concern about sluggish personal computer sales and increasing competition from a rival, Advanced Micro Devices Inc.
"With the core PC market slowing, they need to look for other growth opportunities," said Ashok Kumar, an analyst at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, who rates Intel a strong buy.
In the next three years, sales of communications chips are expected to rise twice as fast as sales of microprocessors, which provide most of Intel's revenue, according to the market researcher Dataquest Inc.
Level One's chips, which have built-in communications features, are used by most large network-equipment makers to reduce the cost of their products.
Intel has been building more communications features into its chips and sells its own networking products.Those products now contribute less than 10 percent of the company's $26 billion in annual revenue, though the company said it would look for more networking purchases.
"We're continuing to look for other acquisition candidates," said Craig R. Barrett, Intel's chief executive.
The purchase of Level One, which is based in Sacramento, Calif., comes after Intel agreed to buy the Shiva Corporation, an Internet-equipment maker, for $185 million in October.
Level One and Intel already work together in a partnership formed last summer. The two are developing chips for controllers that send data over corporate networks using high-speed copper wiring. The first products from that partnership are not expected until late 1999 or early 2000.
Mark Christensen, vice president of Intel's networking unit, said that the company had no plans to sell networking products to large corporations or phone companies and would instead focus on equipment for small businesses.
Level One gets about 60 percent of its revenue from the repeaters, transceivers and other chips used in so-called Ethernet switches, the most widely used equipment for linking PC's to corporate networks. The remainder comes from chips used in equipment for high-speed Internet access.
Because Level One and Intel both make chips used in PC connector cards, the combined company "will have overlap issues in some product areas," said Ken Pearlman, an analyst at CIBC Oppenheimer.
Some Level One chips are used by top networking companies like Cisco Systems Inc. and the 3Com Corporation in low-cost equipment that competes with Intel's networking equipment.
Still, Robert S. Pepper, Level One's president and chief executive, said the purchase would not affect the company's original equipment manufacturer agreements with Cisco, 3Com and others.
Shares of Intel fell $1.3125, to $113.375. Level One fell $5.25, to $27.125, before trading was halted. The announcement was made after the close of regular trading.

Dow Up Nearly 200 Points As I.B.M. Lifts Stocks
After weeks of sour news on technology stocks, the sector received a boost when I.B.M. announced that it had won a $16 billion order from Dell Computer for parts like disk drives and displays. Despite the increase, the market is still locked in the trading range it has been in since January. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 191.52 points, or 2 percent, to 9,467.40. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 18.94 points, or 1.5 percent, to 1,246.64, while the Nasdaq composite index rose 27.69 points, to 2,292.89.

HEADLINE: Building Fame for $15 a Head;
For the Hip-Hop Set, the Local Celebrity Is the Barber

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY 

 BODY:
His name is on the lips of the hip-hop set in Sunset Park. The teen-agers in the baggy pants and Michelin Man jackets up and down Fourth Avenue in Brooklyn know Pedro Quinones, though not as Pedro Quinones. They know him as Casper, the sultan of the shape-up, the master of the Number One Fade, the quick answer to the bad hair day.
He is only 19, not yet finished with high school, but he seems to understand that hype is as important as haircuts for his chosen profession. His nickname is emblazoned across the windshield of his 1990 Oldsmobile. The clients who walk down the steps into his gritty Fourth Avenue shop, Casper's Cuts, are greeted by a floor-to-ceiling painting of Casper's cherubic face, a tribute courtesy of a customer from Canada known as Virus. 
 "Casper is the man!" proclaimed Andre Padilla, 18, a patron who came from Staten Island on Wednesday afternoon, one of a stream of teen-agers passing through the shop, some of them from Queens or distant points in Brooklyn, all of them coming just to place their heads in Casper's chubby hands.
Few loyalties are more sacred than the one between customer and stylist. In Manhattan, where money and vanity flow in equally deep streams, hairstylists have been vaulted to celebrity status by their female clientele, and charge the fees to prove it. Frederic Fekkai, the decade's premier celebrity stylist, charges upward of $300 for haircuts at his salon on East 57th Street. Clients at the John Sahag salon on Madison Avenue pay $275 just so a stylist will blow their hair dry in a way that creates the straight, sleek look.
But for men -- whose stylists are no longer just barbers -- the same cults of celebrity extend beyond the salons of Manhattan, even if the prices and the glamour do not. Ask the teen-agers gathered in Casper's ground-level shop if their barber has a rival, and they will scoff at the suggestion.
Customers interviewed in Brooklyn neighborhoods like Bay Ridge, Fort Greene and Sunset Park profess equal loyalty to their barbers. Some customers will follow a stylist from shop to shop for years. Others carry their stylists' beeper numbers. Some barbers make house calls for less than $30. Usually, the price of a cut is about $15 or less.
Loyalty, however, does not always extend to the relationships between stylists and their shops. Last week, a barber in Queens, Manuel Heredia, was shot to death inside his shop. The police said he had been arguing with barbers at a new shop that had lured away two of his employees. The owner of the rival shop and another man have been charged with second-degree murder.
How could such a violent end come between two men in such a genteel business? The murder did shock many barbers, but the root of the problem did not.
"It didn't surprise me with the fact that it was competitive and there was a beef between them," said Jose Nunez, a stylist with his own following at New York Style in Bay Ridge. "They did the same kinds of hairstyles and had the same types of customers. That doesn't surprise me at all."
Like rock musicians who begin their careers by playing in a garage, many barbers begin as teen-agers hacking away on cousins, siblings and friends, developing a following they often take with them when they move to a real shop after earning a license. With so many heads in New York City in need of grooming, barbers often enjoy the sort of low unemployment and ego gratification that brings a transience to the trade.
Whether because of spats over personality or money, or even a fit of artistic pique, many barbers say they are not at all fearful of changing locales.
"We're more like free agents," said Bert Calderon, 26, who works with Mr. Nunez in Bay Ridge, his fourth shop in about five years. "But we're unrestricted. As long as we're happy, and you don't get on our nerves, we're all good."
David Jenkins, 32, owns Legends II, a Fort Greene barber shop directly across Fulton Street from another barber shop, Barber's World. Sitting in the shop was Tom Colman, 54, who regularly travels from Manhattan because he trusts the way Mr. Jenkins cuts his fade hairstyle, shaving it close to the skin on the sides and letting it rise to a neat platform of hair on top.
With such loyal customers, Mr. Jenkins said there is plenty of business for all shops. But to stay competitive, he makes house calls for certain customers. He said he is careful when he hires younger barbers. He scouts barbering schools for new talent, keeping abreast of the latest styles, and he tries to find barbers who seem responsible and willing to stay put, knowing that they may not.
"Each barber is his own business," said Mr. Jenkins, who rents chairs to barbers for $150 a week.
The relationship between shop owners, usually older barbers trained to cut with scissors, and younger stylists, who build followings by shaving haircuts like fades with a razor and electric clippers, is mutually dependent, if delicate and often prickly. Margarito Flores, 59, owns two barber shops in Sunset Park and has been in business for 30 years. Aware that the young stylists bring in the young clients, Mr. Flores said he hires them. But rather than hire just one, he said he hires three -- to protect himself.
"There would probably be a problem if I lost all three at once," he said through a translator, Ruben Carrero, 27, who as it turns out has been coming to Mr. Flores for 20 years.
Sal Mannino, the owner of Astor Place on 77th Street in Bay Ridge, once hired Mr. Nunez. Now, Mr. Nunez works around the corner at New York Style. No hard feelings, Mr. Mannino said. Barbering, he said, is about talent and charisma. "They know only one haircut," he said. "The skin fade. That's it. So to me, that's not threatening."
Perhaps it is not surprising that anyone who earns a living scraping a razor across another man's neck must not only inspire confidence, but also have it. "If you're good," Mr. Calderon said, "you don't have to worry about competition. Once somebody sits down in my chair, it's rare they don't come back."
But Mr. Calderon's ego is not so inflated that he is blind to the betrayals of the profession. He said he once left a shop for a week, thinking it was temporarily closed, only to discover that the shop owner was stealing his clients. Now, he keeps a Rolodex of his clients beside his bottles of mousse, and he also sends out Christmas cards.
Working at the next chair, Mr. Nunez, 22, bent over a customer, shaving a fade with the languid confidence of a man fully aware of his own worth. He said he could recall several fistfights between competing stylists, though never a homicide like the one in Queens. Talent, he says, is the best form of occupational insurance.
"I've got kids who go to college as far away as North Carolina," Mr. Nunez said. "They won't get their hair cut until they come back home."
There are, of course, men who walk into whatever barber shop is nearby and make an appointment with whichever barber is available.
Not Vic Perez. He arrived Wednesday afternoon at Casper's Cuts. He had already gotten a "shape-up," the barbering equivalent of a tuneup, from his regular barber, Steven.
Mr. Perez, 21, said he gets one shape-up and one haircut every week for a total of $22. He will not leave Steven, not even for Casper, but he stopped in because he described himself as a "barber shop hopper," eager to listen to or start the chatter famous at barber shops.
Mr. Perez described his current haircut as a "pretty thug" look, meaning that he can dress it up or dress it down. If he goes on a date, he might get a Caesar, a stylish, modulated look. "Having your hair is like an attitude," he said. "Your hair shows who you are."
In the middle of the chatter, Casper works without talking or lifting his eyes from his work. His sidekick, Angelo Rivera, 16, takes customers in the second chair. Mr. Rivera said he used to cut hair at home, punching a hole in a garbage bag and using it as a cape to keep hair off the floor and the customer. Casper charges $8, and he says his clients include tow truck drivers and police officers. He is saving money, planning for the day when he can buy a building, maybe even a beauty supply business. He wants to be the shop owner and the stylist, like Frederic Fekkai, even if he has never heard of him.
"People see me as young. They think I'm a drug dealer," he said, attributing the attitudes mostly to his souped-up car. "They just assume the worst. They assume I got the money the wrong way."
But he admits that he likes the attention that comes to him because of his barbering. When he goes to the local McDonald's, children whisper his name. Cars stop in front of his shop, and drivers shout hellos.
"Yeah," Casper said, "I like the attention. It feels good. It's better than nobody knowing me."

HEADLINE: Unstable Autocracies in Central Asia

 BODY:
A series of car bombs recently exploded at the Government's headquarters in Uzbekistan's capital, Tashkent, killing 16 people. They narrowly missed the country's leader, Islam Karimov -- a sign that the stability provided by the dictators of Central Asia and the Caucasus can be quickly upended.
Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, stability has been the West's primary goal for these countries. The region borders such trouble spots as Afghanistan and Iran. It is also sitting on bountiful oil and gas reserves. While the United States has criticized the local leaders for their autocratic ways, it has treated them as partners, on the theory that their rule provides a stable climate for oil and gas investment. But the attempt on Mr. Karimov, and the failing health of President Heydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan, are reminders that autocratic rule could give way to instability when the dictators die. 
 Most of the leaders in the region have focused all politics around loyalty to themselves and blocked the development of political institutions. There are few serious political parties, parliaments or courts and no mechanisms for a peaceful transition of power. The most democracy is found in Georgia and Kyrgyzstan, and the least in Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, the most populous nation.
Many of the leaders encourage potentially volatile clan politics. Under Soviet rule, Central Asian republics were tightly controlled by Communist leaders appointed by Moscow -- many of whom are now their nations' presidents. They once relied on a network of local state farm and provincial bosses. Today these same men head territorial mafias that control jobs and government benefits. Virtually all Central Asia's strongmen favor a particular mafia or clan -- crucial in countries where such ties determine who gets rich.
Repression of religion is another practice that could cause future unrest. In Uzbekistan, the independent practice of Islam is banned, and President Karimov has closed hundreds of mosques in the last year. The crackdown on Islam has politicized the expression of religion and turned it into an outlet for protest against poverty and corruption.
While all the dictators claim to welcome foreign investment, most will not institute market reforms or anti-corruption measures that might stimulate economic growth. Mr. Karimov, for example, has lost foreign investment and International Monetary Fund loans because he continues to control access to hard currency. He does so to reward friends by allowing them to buy foreign currency cheaply, which they can then resell for huge profits. Instead of building stability through economic growth and the construction of political institutions, Central Asia's dictators count on smothering dissent. That kind of artificial, temporary stability often ends in explosive unrest.

HEADLINE: Where's the Outrage Over Taxes?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
William Safire (column, March 1) is wrong when he asserts that Social Security is not helped by keeping part of the surplus for Social Security instead of cutting taxes. He notes that the Social Security Trust Fund lends its money to the Treasury. But if there were a tax cut instead, the trust fund would have less to lend to the Treasury, and the Treasury would need to borrow more from the public. If the public lends more to the Treasury, it invests less in stocks, bonds and deposits, resulting in less investment and lower economic growth. 
 In the future, when Social Security needs more money, the trust fund has the return on its additional assets and the possibility of selling bonds back to the Treasury. Compared with a tax cut, this does not hurt the Treasury.

HEADLINE: REPUBLICANS' PLAN WOULD KEEP MONEY IN SOCIAL SECURITY

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 4

 BODY:
The Republican leaders of Congress agreed today on the broad outlines of a budget plan that they said would immediately wall off Social Security funds so that they could not be used to pay for tax cuts or new Government spending.
The budget framework for fiscal year 2000, hammered out in days of closed-door meetings among senior House and Senate Republicans, would adhere to the stringent spending limits enacted in the balanced-budget agreement reached two years ago by President Clinton and Congress. And it would provide for a relatively small tax cut in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 that would grow to a cut of as much as $800 billion over the next decade. 
 "We think we have a package that is historic," said Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, the chairman of the House Budget Committee. "For the first time we are making the argument that Government should not take any of the money that comes in for our senior citizens."
The outline represents the Republicans' effort to avoid the feuding and disarray of last year and sets the stage for a battle with Mr. Clinton over fiscal policy in an age of windfall surpluses.
The Republicans' plan is also intended to protect them from charges by Mr. Clinton and Democrats that they would use Social Security money to finance tax cuts for the wealthy. In fact Republicans hope that their plan will prove an impediment to Democrats, leaving them open to accusations that they are raiding Social Security if they want to increase domestic spending.
But the plan will force Republicans to give up their hopes of enacting a large tax cut before the 2000 election year. While the numbers for the budget outline were still being assembled, Republicans said the tax cut in the 2000 fiscal year would be about $10 billion to $15 billion.
The budget agreement will also require the House and Senate Republicans to make billions of dollars in spending cuts to stay within the budget limits set in 1997.
This will not be easy. For years money brought into the Government through Social Security taxes has been used to mask the true size of the Federal deficit and to pay for spending programs unrelated to retirement.
In the 2000 fiscal year, for example, the Congressional Budget Office has projected a surplus of $133 billion. But if Social Security funds are subtracted from the totals, the Government will actually have a deficit of $5 billion.
Mr. Kasich and Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, acknowledged that they still had to sell the blueprint to their rank and file. Some moderates could oppose the cuts in domestic spending the plan would necessitate. The two men hope to report the budget plan out of their committees later this month.
The White House tonight signaled that simply setting aside Social Security money would not be enough to satisfy Mr. Clinton. "Their plan still is nearly $700 billion short for Medicare," said Gene Sperling, the senior White House economic adviser. "And it's not clear whether they extend the life of Social Security a single day, or how they could put together a budget that would not lead to significant reductions in areas like education, environment and health care."
The Republicans countered that they were actually doing more to safeguard Social Security than Mr. Clinton's proposals would. Mr. Domenici cited a study by the Congressional Budget Office that said the President's budget would save only 58 percent of next year's Social Security surplus.
"He's running around saying he's the one saving Social Security," Mr. Domenici said. "If saving the trust fund and not spending it is the test, we're 100 percent pure, and he's 58 percent pure."
The Republican agreement today came as the party's Congressional leaders made a determined effort to avoid the mistakes of last year, when Mr. Clinton first proposed that surpluses be set aside to ensure the solvency of the Social Security trust fund for the baby boom generation.
His stand left Republicans divided over whether to save the surplus or enact large tax cuts. The House and Senate never enacted an agreed-upon budget plan.
The result was that President Clinton won increases in education spending and other domestic spending in a last-minute spending bill just before the election. Republicans lost any leverage because they were afraid of being accused once again of provoking a shutdown of the Government.
The move to wall off Social Security funds immediately was promoted by Mr. Domenici, who wanted to blunt any charges by Democrats that Republicans were raiding the popular Federal retirement program. Under the plan the Social Security surplus -- expected to reach 1.8 trillion over the next decade -- can be used for debt reduction or else for an eventual Social Security overhaul. To spend the surpluses any other way would require 60 votes in the Senate.
The proposal was initially resisted by Mr. Kasich, who had wanted to phase in such a plan over several years, in order to be able to dip into the surplus for a little bit longer. That would have made it easier for Republicans to craft a large tax cut as the centerpiece of an election year agenda.
But Republicans said that Mr. Kasich was ultimately pleased with the decision to stay within the budget limits set in the balanced budget law, despite pressure for more spending. And he took satisfaction in the Senate's agreement to a phased-in tax cut.
Republicans said their plan would also live within next year's spending limit of about $550 billion for discretionary spending in domestic and military programs. They said they would accomplish this while also raising military spending. Even if programs are frozen at this year's levels, Congress will still have to make savings of about $15 billion because of inflation. And that is before increases in military and education spending, which both parties want, are taken into account. There was no suggestion today where in the budget members of either party would turn to make cuts.
Mr. Kasich and Mr. Domenici did not say what kind of tax cut the Republicans would enact and the budget resolution is usually silent on that question, leaving it up to Congress' tax-writing committees to decide that later in the year. Republicans are deeply divided over whether to pursue an across-the-board, 10-percent tax cut, whether to enact tax credits for various social purposes, or whether to pursue other tax reductions, like a cut in the so-called marriage penalty.
One option that might make it easier for Republicans to stay within the budget caps, several Republicans said, would be for them to enact a tax cut, like a reduction in the capital gains tax, which they say could initially bring in more Government revenue by spurring economic activity.

HEADLINE: NYC;
Jim Crow Past Haunts a Life Lived in Exile

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
PEGGY KING JORDE has lived and worked in New York City for the last 18 years, but a piece of her heart has stayed in her hometown of Albany.
That's Albany, Ga., mind you, not the place up the Hudson. In that corner of southwestern Georgia, some will tell you that they're from Ahl-BEN-ny. Not Ms. King Jorde, who has been Yankeefied enough to pronounce it the same as anyone else from these parts. 
 "There is so much of myself that's still rooted in Albany," said Ms. King Jorde, who directs the Federal Government's African Burial Ground project in lower Manhattan. "I do consider myself a Southerner. It's a culture I'm very proud of."
But her pride does not extend to racially charged features of that culture, which have caused her family great pain since the late 1950's, when Jim Crow ruled the South and Ms. King Jorde's father, C. B. King, led the nascent civil rights movement in Ahl-BEN-ny. This tale, though, is really about her uncle, Preston King, who teaches political philosophy at Lancaster University in northern England.
For nearly four decades, Preston King has lived abroad, unwilling to come back for fear of being arrested on an old criminal conviction that he and others consider racially based. But he turned 63 this week, and sees time slipping away. He would like, however briefly, to go home again.
This is, admittedly, more a story about Georgia than New York, but some New Yorkers are key figures in an appeal to Washington to make Mr. King's return possible. Besides his niece, they include Elizabeth Holtzman, the former Congresswoman and Brooklyn District Attorney, who is a longtime friend of the King family. Last month, she met with the Deputy Attorney General of the United States, Eric H. Holder Jr., to see what could be done.
"I know he's sympathetic to us," Ms. Holtzman said. "But being sympathetic is one thing, and doing something is another." Thus far, the Justice Department has promised only to re-examine the case, which runs like this:
In the mid-1950's, the draft board in Albany approved a student deferment so that Mr. King could pursue a master's degree at the London School of Economics. Board letters to him began, "Dear Sir." It was all done by mail -- quite routine.
BUT one day in 1958, back from London, Mr. King called on the board in person. That's when the clerk there saw he was black. From then on, the letters were addressed "Dear Preston." To Mr. King it was about the same as being called "boy." He refused to respond.
"This had to do with keeping black people under control," he said by phone from Lancaster, an English accent poking through every vowel. "Understand my perspective. The board is entirely white. Everything around you is segregated by law. It's part of the air you breathe. And the cherry on the cake is this disrespect shown to people who bear the status of otherness."
While not "dying to serve in the Army," he was prepared to go, he said. All he wanted was to be called "Mister." That did not happen.
Mr. King lost his deferment, and was ordered in those pre-Vietnam War days to report for his Army physical. After he kept ignoring "Dear Preston" letters, he was charged with draft evasion, convicted in Federal court in 1961 and sentenced to 18 months in prison. Rather than go to jail, he jumped bail and fled the country.
"It would have been an absurdity to surrender," he said. "It doesn't have any sensible bite to me. It doesn't have any moral bite."
After studying and teaching in Africa and in Australia (he now has Australian citizenship), Mr. King settled in Lancaster in 1986. He has made a good life for himself in England. His daughter, Oona, is a member of Parliament. But Georgia keeps beckoning. There are nieces and nephews to see, and family graves to visit.
Beyond New York voices like those of Ms. King Jorde and Ms. Holtzman, the chorus for laying old Southern ghosts to rest is growing. Television networks have done stories. The Albany City Commission passed a resolution urging a Presidential pardon or amnesty to "correct a travesty of justice." Even the Federal judge who sentenced Mr. King, William A. Bootle, now 96 and long retired, has said that a white man would not have been put on trial.
To Mr. King, it is up to the Government to wipe the race slate clean. "If you want to expunge the past," he said, "then you must reverse one of the consequences of that past."

HEADLINE: El Al at a Turning Point;
A Mirror of Israel's Divisions Prepares to Go 49% Public

BYLINE: By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.

DATELINE: LOD, Israel, Feb. 26

 BODY:
As airline employees cheered, the shiny Boeing 737, a blue Star of David freshly emblazoned on its tail, touched down at Ben Gurion International Airport here, the first of eight new Boeing jets that El Al, the Israeli international flag carrier, is acquiring this year.
This $600 million fleet upgrade, the biggest aircraft investment in El Al's history, is the most visible and costly part of a campaign to prepare the airline to sell stock to private investors as early as April. With a redesigned logo, chic new uniforms and an income statement modestly in the black after recurring state-subsidized losses, El Al is trying hard to become what Tom Schick, executive vice president at Boeing, called in a visit here "a new, aggressive and customer-focused airline." 
 Like Israel itself, El Al is 50 years old, proud of a pioneering past and a proven ability to survive, even thrive, in adversity. Also like Israel, the airline must cope with deep divisions, both political and cultural, as it strives to compete as an equal in the world market, without compromising its security or special national identity.
Private ownership and private management are the keys to El Al's economic future, its executives say, taking their cue from dozens of other state airlines that have been converted into commercial enterprises in recent years. But El Al Israel Airlines Ltd. is no ordinary airline, and selling it is no ordinary marketing challenge.
Its history as a terrorist target has made it perhaps the most security-conscious carrier in the world. Every flight has its own undercover armed guard. Nearly every pilot is a former Israeli Air Force officer. At home and abroad, baggage inspections and pre-flight security checks are carried out in deadly earnest, with the company's own state-of-the-art equipment and specially trained personnel. Aircraft like the new 737's are fitted at company hangars with classified Israeli security hardware.
All this adds $70 million to $100 million a year to operating costs, El Al officials say. That is a daunting sum for a company that generates about $1.2 billion in annual revenues. Under state ownership, about two-thirds of this expense has been absorbed by Israeli security agencies, but the Government and El Al management are now debating how these costs should be shared, and calculated, once El Al is no longer wholly owned by the Government.
"This comes with a price tag," said Joseph Ciechanover, the chairman of El Al, "and the costs and the responsibility for the costs must be stated clearly, up front, in the prospectus."
Then there is the Sabbath.
As is the case with the rest of its planes, El Al cannot fly its expensive new Boeing jetliners from Friday evening to Saturday night, or on eight other sundown-to-sundown Jewish holidays. The Sabbath restriction was imposed in 1982 when the rightist government of Menachem Begin wrested control of the ailing company from its union. The company was restructured as the designated national carrier, with a pared-down work force and a guaranteed monopoly on international air freight and scheduled passenger flights.
Keeping its fleet grounded on the Sabbath costs the company some $36 million yearly in potential net earnings, according to a study conducted for El Al three years ago by the Boston Consulting Group. That is a make-or-break figure for a company that posted losses of $83 million in 1996 and $4 million in 1997, before turning a profit in 1998 that was estimated at $25 million.
"The Sabbath is more than 24 hours," Mr. Ciechanover said in an interview at the company's utilitarian headquarters at Ben Gurion airport. "Take our flights to New York. We fly overnight Thursday, land early Friday morning and stay there on the ground until late Saturday night. That is 20 percent of our workweek.
"This is a Jewish state," he continued, "and it is understandably important to many people that the designated national carrier be respectful of the Sabbath. But the cost is very high."
Part of that cost is an inability to compete at all in critical weekend tourist traffic. In a society with a six-day workweek, flights on Friday nights or Saturdays are the first preference of the secular vacationer. Foreign airlines now offer more than 80 regularly scheduled international flights to and from Ben Gurion on Saturday alone. Small private domestic airlines, not bound by Sabbath strictures, do a busy weekend resort trade.
The Government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, having promised to privatize the airline when it came to power two and a half years ago, is now scrambling to sell 49 percent of the company on the Tel Aviv stock exchange before the next national elections on May 17. But some officials say the sale, which analysts estimate will set a market value for the airline of as much as $250 million, may be delayed until after an expected runoff election on June 1 for Prime Minister.
The Government has backed away from longstanding plans favored by management to sell majority control to private investors, including a big international airline as a strategic partner. The Netanyahu Government also shelved plans to put El Al's initial stock offering on the market in the United States.
"I am very much for floating shares abroad," Mr. Ciechanover said. "Markets in New York would be better than Tel Aviv at evaluating an airline company. But it's better to get this process going. Once it starts, it won't stop."
Other disputes, though, must still be resolved before the stock offering can proceed. The Government and El Al's board are squabbling over how to divide the $100 million or more they expect to reap from the stock sale. The airline, unsurprisingly, thinks it should keep the money, while the Government says the earnings should go to the public treasury.
There is also disagreement with the union about how much of the stock will be offered at a discount to El Al workers. The Government wants to limit it to 10 percent; employees want more.
The most sensitive question, of course, is how much leeway private management will have over what has been considered an invaluable public asset.
Many of El Al's far-flung international routes were established more for strategic than commercial reasons, as Israel sought to expand transportation and diplomatic links in defiance of terrorist threats and Arab-led boycotts.
Its fleet still serves as a kind of civilian air reserve, on call to be pressed into service in times of war or national emergency.
Its passenger aircraft are commandeered for airlifts, often in situations of great risk. For example, El Al flew thousands of Ethiopian Jews to Israel in just 24 hours in 1991, when Addis Ababa was aflame with civil war. And special El Al night flights bringing hundreds of thousands of immigrants from the former Soviet Union continued throughout the Persian Gulf war, even as Iraq was lobbing missiles at Israel and other airlines suspended flights to the region. "We were flying around the clock," said Nachman Klieman, the El Al spokesman. "It took quite a toll."
Would a privatized El Al remain available for such patriotic duties? Management says yes, but not on the same essentially cost-free terms. And it would expect other private airlines here to do the same.
In addition, El Al cargo planes routinely haul classified materiel for the Defense Ministry and other state agencies. After an El Al 747 carrying chemicals ordered by a top-secret Government research lab crashed in October 1992 after takeoff from Amsterdam's airport and killed 43 people, the airline said little for almost five years amid contentions that the shipment was intended for the manufacture of nerve gas -- and the cause of health problems reported by residents of the neighborhood where the plane fell.
El Al officials, saying the airline is fully insured against any potential liability from local Dutch lawsuits. have since acknowledged that the plane was carrying dimethyl methyphosphonate, which can be used in making the nerve gas Sarin. Israeli officials said it was destined for use in tests of gas mask filters.
El Al's privatization was officially endorsed in 1995 by a Labor government, which received union blessing to divest itself of a majority of its holdings. When Mr. Netanyahu became Prime Minister in 1996, the Government promised to make the sale a centerpiece of a broader privatization program. In 1997, a commission recommended a 100 percent divestiture, while El Al's management assiduously courted American Airlines as a potential equity partner.
Yet concern among Orthodox Jews that private owners would overturn the ban on flights during the Sabbath -- known in Hebrew as Shabbat -- led the Government to cap the planned stock sale at 49 percent. No single investor will be entitled to buy more than 5 percent of the company, discouraging many prospective foreign buyers.
"It is not easy to sell El Al, especially because of the problem of Shabbat," said Moshe Leon, Mr. Netanyahu's chief economic adviser. "But it must be done, and it will be done."
Without a change in the Sabbath policy, the financial turnaround that was achieved last year could prove ephemeral, El Al officials say. Most of El Al's 1998 profit margin came from record-low fuel prices and unexpected local savings from the devaluation of the shekel last fall. The company is braced for more competition from foreign airlines -- Continental is inaugurating daily service here from Newark in August -- and from domestic cargo carriers, which are petitioning for regular international air freight routes.
In response, El Al's union has taken the Government to court to block air cargo competition unless El Al is allowed to fly freight on the Sabbath as well. With cargo accounting for a quarter of El Al's revenue, the loss of the freight monopoly coupled with the continued Sabbath restriction could doom the company, the union argues.
"That is the complexity of this country, where religion gets mixed up with the state," said Michael Kovachi, the chief El Al union representative. "What Hamas and El Fatah didn't manage to do, the religious have done, lowering the flags on the tails of our planes."
The decision to deregulate the air cargo business is now in the hands of Transportation Minister Shaul Yahalom. As a leader of the small National Religious Party, he must balance the demands of his devout Orthodox constituency against his avowed free-market beliefs.
Mr. Yahalom accuses El Al of "hiding behind its workers" in the lawsuit and trying "to torpedo moves that are aimed only at creating true competition and lowering prices for the benefit of the public." But he has continued delaying an expected ruling in favor of freight deregulation.
A paradox in the court battle is that a private local company, Cargo Air Lines, is already flying as many as seven freight flights out of Israel every Sabbath -- using leased El Al planes with moonlighting El Al crews. In an arrangement winked at by the Government since 1982, these Friday and Saturday freight flights help amortize the costs of El Al's equipment while insuring that cut flowers and perishable produce reach weekend markets in Europe.
El Al's local competitors have joined the call for the Sabbath ban to be lifted, but only as part of a broader deregulation of the industry. "El Al must be released from this limitation if they want to privatize," said Michael Weinstein, the chief executive officer of Aeroel, an Israeli company that runs foreign charter flights on Fridays and Saturdays.
"The market will adjust itself," Mr. Weinstein said. "El Al will continue to be the leader, because of its routes, but it may cut back on flights that are not so profitable. Competition will make El Al better."

HEADLINE: Budget Politics Is Delaying Relief for Central America

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 4

 BODY:
Nearly $1 billion in emergency aid to storm-stricken Central Americans ran afoul of partisan budget politics in the House and Senate today, dooming any chance that President Clinton could deliver the relief package when he visits the region next week.
Republicans in both houses were willing to approve the aid, but only on conditions the President would find unacceptable -- cutting an equal amount from programs like food stamps and welfare assistance. The House Republicans disregarded pleas from their new Speaker that they go along with Mr. Clinton's plans without causing problems. 
 "It seems that the Republican majority is looking more to play politics with some of the issues than in providing the very needed aid," said the White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, who denounced the proposed cuts.
The Senate Appropriations Committee unanimously approved $1.9 billion in new spending, which included $956 million to help countries like Honduras and Nicaragua rebuild after they were devastated by storms last fall. It also contained $100 million in aid to Jordan and $285 million in assistance for American farmers and ranchers hurt by the economic turmoil in Asia.
Senator Ted Stevens, an Alaska Republican who heads the Appropriations Committee, said the offsetting cuts came from programs that received extra money last fall, which would not all be spent this year. But he acknowledged that the cuts were politically sensitive and might not survive a White House veto or negotiations with the House.
Mr. Stevens and the Republican leadership are under strong pressure from fiscal conservatives to stay under the self-imposed spending caps, and not skirt the restrictions by giving the spending emergency status as Congress often does in providing aid for natural disasters.
In another jab at the Administration, the committee approved by voice vote an amendment from Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas, that would bar the Federal Government from recouping any settlement proceeds the states have negotiated with the tobacco industry.
The White House's five-year budget projections assume that the Federal Government would receive $18.9 billion from the tobacco settlements. Despite today's vote, the committee was sharply divided, foreshadowing a fierce floor battle.
Across the Capitol, a meeting of the House Appropriations Committee was canceled today after Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, also under pressure from budget hawks as well as top lieutenants like Tom DeLay and Dick Armey, both of Texas, ordered the panel to find offsetting cuts in its budget to pay for the Central American aid.
Mr. DeLay and Mr. Armey, taken aback by the Senate seizing the traditional House role of demanding fiscal responsibility, also expressed anger that the Government was willing to send millions to storm victims in Latin American and the Caribbean, but shortchange American farmers.
The House action dealt a setback to Mr. Hastert, who expected to benefit along with Mr. Clinton from quick action on the emergency foreign assistance. Mr. Hastert had not originally sought offsetting cuts for that aid, although lawmakers had done so for the assistance to Jordan.
"The simple fact is, a lot of our members want to be fiscally responsible," said John P. Feehery, Mr. Hastert's spokesman.
The about-face illustrates the problems Republicans face as they run into self-imposed budget restraints despite large projected surpluses. It also shows the challenges Mr. Hastert confronts in dealing with a six-vote House majority and rumblings that Mr. DeLay, the minority whip, is calling the shots.
Democrats seized on the Republicans' decisions to portray a Republican Party insensitive to the needs of the poor in this country and abroad.
"I find it puzzling that the offsets suggested by some of our Republican colleagues would cut food stamps and welfare assistance for the needy in this country to pay for assistance for the needy in Honduras," said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader.
But all of the committee Democrats voted for the bill, accepting Mr. Stevens' explanation, as did Tom Harkin of Iowa, or vowing to fight the cuts on the Senate floor or in House-Senate conference committee, as did Byron L. Dorgan of North Dakota.
The proposed cuts from the current budget include $262 million in food stamps, and $70 million in climate change and international environmental programs. The bill also included $80 million to provide new detention centers for Central American immigrants fleeing their storm-ravaged countries. To pay for most of this, the committee cut $65 million from border enforcement naturalization programs.
To win Democratic support, Mr. Stevens added $130 million in agricultural aid to the original bill, and created a new program for the steel industry that would guarantee up to $1 billion in emergency loans.

HEADLINE: Justice: A Man's Title and His 'Guiding Light'

BYLINE: ALISON ZIMBALIST


HIGHLIGHT: In this lesson, students reflect on the life of retired Justice Henry A. Blackmun, investigating major court decisions he influenced and understanding the impact of his voice in the Supreme Court on our society today. 

 BODY:
Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students reflect on the life of retired Justice Henry A. Blackmun, investigating major court decisions he influenced and understanding the impact of his voice in the Supreme Court on our society today.
Author(s):
Alison Zimbalist, The New York Times Learning Network
Suggested Time Allowance: 45 minutes
Objectives:
Students will: 
1. Define "justice" and discuss the role of justice systems in societies. 
2. Review and evaluate the role of the Supreme Court in the American legal system. 
3. Examine the influence of Justice Henry A. Blackmun through reading and discussing his obituary, "Retired Justice Blackmun, Author of Roe v. Wade Abortion Ruling, Dead at 90." 
4. Examine a Supreme Court case influenced by Judge Blackmun's voice as a justice.
Resources / Materials:
-student journals 
-pens/ pencils 
-Civics textbooks and other similar resources for investigation of the Supreme Court 
-copies of "Retired Justice Blackmun, Author of Roe v. Wade Abortion Ruling, Dead at 90" (one per student) 
-computers with Internet access
Activities / Procedures:
1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: In their journals, students respond to the following questions (written on the board prior to class): What does "justice" mean? What is the role of the justice system in American society (or any other society)? 

2. Discuss and evaluate the role of the Supreme Court in the American legal system. How do cases reach the Supreme Court? How are decisions made? How are the Justices of the Supreme Court chosen? Students may use civics textbooks or other similar resources to help them answer these questions if students have not yet thoroughly studied the Supreme Court. Students then brainstorm qualifications for serving as a Justice of the Supreme Court, and the teacher records their ideas on the board. 

3. Read the article "Retired Justice Blackmun, Author of Roe v. Wade Abortion Ruling, Dead at 90." In a discussion, students summarize the article and identify key aspects of Justice Blackmun's background, career, and tenure on the Supreme Court. What were some of the major court cases in which he was involved, and how did he side on each? What effect did his decisions have on his career as a judge and of others' perceptions of him? What insight do quotations from Justice Blackmun's colleagues offer about his life? What information about his upbringing and other personal information provide in understanding Justice Blackmun's character? Examine some of the quotations quoted from Justice Blackmun in the article, and discuss whether or not you agree. 

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Individually or in small groups, students conduct research of a Supreme Court decision in which Justice Henry Blackmun was involved. As Justice Blackmun served on the Supreme Court for 24 years, thus participating in an enormous number of cases, it may be easiest to have students research cases that Justice Blackmun authored in some way. The Oyez Project at Northwestern University is an excellent resource for easy searching and understanding of these court cases. Tell students to go to (http://oyez.nwu.edu/justices/justices.cgi?justice_id=98&page=cases) for a list of cases in the Oyez database in which Justice Blackmun participated. Students will see that some of the links to cases indicate Blackmun's authorship. When a link is chosen, students will see basic information about the case (docket number, subjects, dates, and other information) and will be able to choose from the following links to further resources for information: 
--Abstract: Briefly and basically presents Facts of the Case, Question Presented, and Conclusion. 
--Justices: Detailed biographies of all Supreme Court justices who sat on the case. 
--Oral Argument: On Real Player audio (some written text provided in some cases) 
--Written Opinions of the Court: A Link to FindLaw's Web page on the case, which provides the full text of the case. 
In their research, students should answer the following questions: 
a. What were the major issues of the case? 
b. What arguments were presented during the case? 
c. Who were the parties involved, and why was this brought before the Supreme Court? 
d. What was the final decision? 
e. If you were a member of the Court, how would you have voted on the issue, and why? 
f. What do you think is the significance of this case in American society today? Students should present their research findings to the class, either through oral presentation or by creating a poster to be displayed in the classroom.
Further Questions for Discussion:
--What is the basic procedure for determining cases that will come before the U.S. Supreme Court? 
--What Constitutional basis is there for the procedures of the Supreme Court? 
--Why does the Supreme Court sometimes reverse its own decisions? 
--How does the Supreme Court affect the lives of Americans? 
--What is the relationship of justice to American society as a whole?
Evaluation / Assessment:
Students will be evaluated based on written journal response, participation in classroom discussion, and thorough research of a Supreme Court case heard by Justice Blackmun.
Vocabulary:
status quo, liberal, tenure, terminate, consensus, prohibitions, divisive, ominous, coalesced, plurality, arbitrary, rationality, consistency, dissenting, rejoinder, conservatives, paradoxically, happenstance, nonpartisan, nonideological, diverged, brutality, antic, corollary, emancipation
Extension Activities:
1. Create a time-line of Justice Blackmun's life, including his education, occupations, important Supreme Court decisions, and family information. 

2. Research current Supreme Court justices and the important cases which they significantly influenced (current justices: William H. Rehnquist, John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter, Clarence Thomas, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen G. Breyer). 

3. Create a flow chart of how a court case (either a general case or a specific one) goes through the process of being heard in front of the Supreme Court. 

4. "Retry" one of the court cases researched in class. How would each student vote on this issue if he or she were a member of the Supreme Court? What information about American society can be determined by reviewing the case? (Particularly, what does this case tell us about society at the time in which the case was tried? Has anything changed?) 

5. Debate the underlying issues often tried in Supreme Court cases, supporting your views with examples of historic cases (possible issues to examine: freedom of religion, freedom of speech, search and seizure, privacy and personal autonomy, race discrimination, federalism, rights of the accused, due process). 

6. Diagram your state's judicial system and where it intersects with the federal court system. What is the difference between a case in federal court and a case in state court?
Interdisciplinary Connections:
Foreign Language- Find Web sites written in the language of study that discuss the court process or specific court cases. Translate and discuss the information. 

Global History- Research the supreme court or highest court systems in other countries (particularly Germany, Canada, Australia, Japan, Switzerland, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union) and compare them to the United States Supreme Court. 

Journalism- Write a news article about a newsworthy Supreme Court decision as if you are reporting from the court. 

Mathematics- Design, distribute, analyze and graph a poll about what people view as the most significant Supreme Court decision in their lifetimes. 

Teaching with The Times- Read several obituaries from The New York Times. What similarities do they share, and why?
Other Information on the Web:
The Federal Judiciary Homepage (http://www.uscourts.gov) provides extensive information about and links to the U.S. court system, publications and directories, news, and the Federal Judiciary Channel. 

FindLaw (http://www.findlaw.com/casecode/supreme.html) is a searchable database of Supreme Court decisions since 1893. 

The Oyez Project at Northwestern University's U.S. Supreme Court Multimedia Database (http://oyez.nwu.edu) is a searchable database of Supreme Court cases, biographies of justices, and a virtual tour of the Supreme Court building.

HEADLINE: Testing the Limits of Tolerance as Cultures Mix;
Does Freedom Mean Accepting Rituals That Repel the West?

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
In Maine, a refugee from Afghanistan was seen kissing the penis of his baby boy, a traditional expression of love by this father. To his neighbors and the police, it was child abuse, and his son was taken away. In Seattle, a hospital tried to invent a harmless female circumcision procedure to satisfy conservative Somali parents wanting to keep an African practice alive in their community. The idea got buried in criticism from an outraged public.
How do democratic, pluralistic societies like the United States, based on religious and cultural tolerance, respond to customs and rituals that may be repellent to the majority? As new groups of immigrants from Asia and Africa are added to the demographic mix in the United States, Canada and Europe, balancing cultural variety with mainstream values is becoming more and more tricky. 
 Many Americans confront the issue of whether any branch of government should have the power to intervene in the most intimate details of family life.
"I think we are torn," said Richard A. Shweder, an anthropologist at the University of Chicago and a leading advocate of the broadest tolerance for cultural differences. "It's a great dilemma right now that's coming up again about how we're going to deal with diversity in the United States and what it means to be an American."
Anthropologists have waded deeply into this debate, which is increasingly engaging scholars across academia, as well as social workers, lawyers and judges who deal with new cultural dimensions in immigration and asylum. Some, like Mr. Shweder, argue for fundamental changes in American laws, if necessary, to accommodate almost any practice accepted as valid in a radically different society if it can be demonstrated to have some social or cultural good.
For example, although Mr. Shweder and others would strongly oppose importing such practices as India's immolation of widows, they defend other controversial practices, including the common African ritual that opponents call female genital mutilation, which usually involves removing the clitoris at a minimum. They say that it is no more harmful than male circumcision and should be accommodated, not deemed criminal, as it now is in the United States and several European countries. At the Harvard Law School, Martha Minow, a professor who specializes in family and school issues, said that intolerance often arises when the behavior of immigrants seems to be "nonmodern, nonscientific and nonrational." She cites as an example the practice of "coining" among Cambodians, where hot objects may be pressed on a child's forehead or back as cures for various maladies, leaving alarming welts that for teachers and social workers set off warnings of child abuse.
Americans are more than happy to accept new immigrants when their traditions seem to reinforce mainstream ideals. There are few cultural critics of the family values, work ethic or dedication to education found among many East Asians, for example.
But going more than halfway to tolerate what look like disturbing cultural practices unsettles some historians, aid experts, economists and others with experience in developing societies. Such relativism, they say, undermines the very notion of progress. What's more, it raises the question of how far acceptance can go before there is no core American culture, no shared values, left.
Many years of living in a variety of cultures, said Urban Jonsson, a Swede who directs the United Nations Children's Fund, Unicef, in sub-Saharan Africa, has led him to conclude that there is "a global moral minimum," which he has heard articulated by Asian Buddhists and African thinkers as well as by Western human rights advocates.
"There is a nonethnocentric global morality," he said, and scholars would be better occupied looking for it rather than denying it. "I am upset by the anthropological interest in mystifying what we have already demystified. All cultures have their bad and good things."
Murder was a legitimate form of expression in Europe centuries ago when honor was involved, Mr. Jonsson points out. Those days may be gone in most places, but in Afghanistan, a wronged family may demand the death penalty and carry it out themselves with official blessing. Does that restore it to respectability in the 21st century?
Scholars like Mr. Shweder are wary of attempts to catalogue "good" and "bad" societies or practices. Working with the Social Science Research Council in New York and supported by the Russell Sage Foundation, he helped form a group of about 15 legal and cultural experts to investigate how American law affects ethnic customs among African, Asian, Caribbean and Latin American immigrants.
A statement of purpose written by the working group, headed by Mr. Shweder and Ms. Minow, says that it intends to explore how to react to "official attempts to force compliance with the cultural and legal norms of American middle class life."
"Despite our pluralistic ideals, something very much like a cultural un-American activities list seems to have begun circulating among powerful representatives and enforcers of mainstream culture," the group says in its statement. "Among the ethnic minority activities at risk of being dubbed 'un-American' are the use of disciplinary techniques such as shaming and physical punishment, parent/child co-sleeping arrangements, rituals of group identity and ceremonies of initiation involving scarification, piercing and genital alterations, arranged marriage, polygamy, the segregation of gender roles, bilingualism and foreign language use and many more."
Some sociologists and anthropologists on this behavioral frontier argue that American laws and welfare services have often left immigrants terrified of the intrusive power of government. The Afghan father in Maine who lost his son to the social services, backed by a lower court, did not prevail until the matter reached the state Supreme Court, which researched the family's cultural heritage and decided in its favor -- while making clear that this was an exceptional case, not a precedent.
Spanking, puberty rites, animal sacrifices, enforced dress codes, leaving children unattended at home and sometimes the use of narcotics have all been portrayed as acceptable cultural practices. But who can claim to be culturally beyond the prevailing laws and why?
Ms. Minow said that issues of cultural practice were appearing in more law school curriculums as Americans experience the largest wave of immigration since the 1880-1920 era. "Immigration is now becoming a mainstream subject," she said. "There is also definitely a revival of interest in law schools in religion," including a study of the relation of beliefs to social practices and legal constraints.
Some of the leading thinkers in this debate will discuss the issue at a conference at Harvard in April on the relationship between culture and progress. "If you believe that there is such a thing as a successful society and an unsuccessful society," said Lawrence Harrison, a conference panelist, "then you have to draw some conclusions about what makes for a better society."
Mr. Harrison, who wrote "Underdevelopment as a State of Mind" (Harvard) and "Who Prospers?" (Basic Books), said he believed there were universal yearnings for "progress" and that to refrain from judging every practice out there ignored those aspirations.
Paradoxically, while some Americans want judgment-free considerations of immigrants' practices and traditional rituals in the countries they come from, asylum seekers from those same countries are turning up at American airports begging to escape from tribal rites in the name of human rights. Immigration lawyers and judges are thus drawn into a debate that is less and less theoretical.
Mr. Jonsson of Unicef, whose wife is from Tanzania, says he has had to confront cultural relativism every day for years in the third world. He is outraged by suggestions that the industrial nations should be asked to bend their laws and social norms, especially on the genital cutting of girls, which Unicef opposes.
He labels those who would condemn many in the third world to practices they may desperately want to avoid as "immoral and unscientific." In their academic towers, Mr. Jonsson said, cultural relativists become "partners of the tormentors."
Jessica Neuwirth, an international lawyer who is director of Equality Now, a New York-based organization aiding women's groups in the developing world and immigrant women in this country, asks why the practices that cultural relativists want to condone so often involve women: how they dress, what they own, where they go, how their bodies can be used.
"Culture is male-patrolled in the way that it is created and transmitted," she said. "People who control culture tend to be the people in power, and who constitutes that group is important. Until we can break through that, we can't take the measure of what is really representative."
Other voices are often not being heard or are silenced. "People forget that inside every culture, there is a whole spectrum of ideas and values," she said. "There may be women in another culture who defend the practice of female genital mutilation, but in the same culture there will be women who oppose the practice. And men, too."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Counterfeiters Competing For Golf Equipment Market

BYLINE: By DENNIS BLANK

DATELINE: ORLANDO, Fla., March 5

 BODY:
Within hours after the Taylor Made Golf Company introduced its new $300 Fire Sole driver at the recent Professional Golfers' Merchandise Show here, counterfeiters were hustling their own versions for less than half that price at the same trade show.
That was just one example of a brazen and widespread underground in counterfeit golf equipment, a market that has been estimated at up to $4 billion a year, more than the entire $2.5 billion legitimate golf-equipment industry. 
 Also flooding the market are knock-offs, or imitations that do not try to pass for the real thing but might violate patent protections. The line between counterfeits and knockoffs can be blurry, but both are definitely having an economic impact on sales for an industry already in a slump. Despite an increase in the number of people golfing, sales this year are expected to be flat at best and possibly down as much as 10 percent.
"The problem is definitely getting worse," said George Abbott, managing director of the International Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition in Washington. Thomas Cove, vice president for governmental relations at the Sports Goods Manufacturers Association, said: "Counterfeiting chases the money. It is a criminal syndicate."
The Professional Golfers' Association declined to comment, but one lawyer said that knock-offs and counterfeits were being sold openly at the association's most recent trade show.
"It has a huge effect on the industry," said the lawyer, Timothy L. Epp, who represents Taylor Made, based in Carlsbad, Calif. "But we really don't know the size of this underground. I don't think we can ever stop the knock-off business."
The size of the problem is open to debate. While the United States Customs Service puts it at $4 billion annually, Mr. Cove says that estimate is far too high. He estimates the total United States sales of all counterfeit sports equipment, including apparel, at just $2 billion annually, compared with $60 billion in wholesale revenues from legitimate sales.
Taylor Made has won several judgments against Taiwan manufacturers. But, Mr. Epp said, the copyright infringements are costing the company sales and damaging its good will.
"These knock-offs and counterfeit goods are often misrepresented to unsuspecting consumers to be exactly the same as genuine Taylor Made products," he said.
Law enforcement is cracking down. At the end of the recent Professional Golfers' Association show, Customs agents arrested 12 people, including four Taiwan nationals, in Houston, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Savannah, Ga. The arrests concluded a two-year investigation that resulted in more than 300 seizures of phony golf clubs with an estimated total value of $6 million. By comparison, seizures by Customs in 1997 at ports like Los Angeles and San Francisco netted an estimated total of $1.1 million in counterfeit golf-club parts coming in from Asia.
The 12 men have all been arraigned in Federal courts on charges of trafficking in counterfeit goods, which carry sentences of up to 10 years in prison and $2 million in fines.
Customs said its agents had infiltrated the underground network and discovered that most of the counterfeit components were made in Vietnam, China, Taiwan and Thailand. Once in this country, the clubs are sold to distributors, who do business in hotel rooms and on the Internet.
One Web site that industry lawyers say is a particular cause for concern is Chip Shot Golf, which sells what it calls "Callaway wood lookalikes" for $139.99, far below the Callaway Golf Company's Biggest Big Bertha, which can retail for more than $500. Chip Shot Golf declined to comment.
Callaway Golf, the leading manufacturer of golf equipment, has more than two dozen civil actions pending in the courts and has put pressure on the authorities in Taiwan to arrest offenders. More than 110,000 counterfeit clubs have been seized there in raids on manufacturers.
"It is a brazen and reckless move to copy the technological innovations of others and blatantly infringe on patents granted -- a move that we cannot and will not allow to go unchallenged," said Steve McCracken, a lawyer for Callaway.
Last year, Taiwan authorities arrested Lin Ping-Chun, the owner of Lin Kou Golf near Taipei, who had already served a six-month sentence for counterfeiting violations. Tung Uei Industries in Taichung City was also raided, with the police arresting some company officials and confiscating an estimated $65,000 worth of counterfeit Callaway clubs.
"We will continue to wage the war against counterfeiters of our products because such activities hurt consumers, our retail accounts, as well as employees and shareholders," said Ely Callaway, the company's president.
Callaway's lawyers say Jason Tse Lung Lin, through a company called Impression Golf, capitalized on the popularity of Callaway clubs by using names like "Big Brothers" and "Big Bursar" and a logo virtually identical to Big Bertha's. Callaway was granted an injunction to put Impression Golf out of business.
One Customs agent, Joseph Henderson, said undercover agents infiltrated the network of Asian golf equipment makers and set themselves up as importers for two of them after making purchases. He said that he does not think organized crime is involved, but that these Asian companies "are organized like any other business in terms of marketing, distributing and shipping."
Mr. Abbott of the International Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition said it was difficult to compare losses resulting from counterfeiting with legitimate sales, because counterfeiting does not constitute theft of an actual product.
"It's often hard to tell who is robbing you," Mr. Abbott said.

HEADLINE: Debt of Consumers Climbed in January

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 5

 BODY:
Borrowing by United States consumers increased at a faster pace in January as all categories of debt increased, Federal Reserve figures released today showed.
Borrowing rose by $14.7 billion, to $1.316 trillion, in January, after a revised increase of $3.1 billion in December. 
 Consumer credit rose at a 13.5 percent annual rate during January, up from the 2.9 percent pace in December. It was the biggest increase in more than a year, the Fed said.
 "We don't think consumer borrowing is going to scale back" this year, because unemployment is low and incomes are rising, Gary Thayer, an economist at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis, said before the report was released. In addition, Mr. Thayer said, low inflation gives consumers more buying power.
Revolving loans outstanding, which include credit card debt, rose by $5.7 billion in January, up from a $3.9 billion increase in December. Auto loans rose $6.5 billion, up from $4.4 billion. Other types of installment loans rose by $2.5 billion, after falling $5.2 billion in December.
Economists watch the Fed's credit report because it helps them gauge consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of economic output. The report does not, however, track loans secured by real estate, like home equity loans.
With the economy expanding and unemployment close to a 30-year low, consumers have been spending money at the fastest pace in 14 years. Some of that spending, of course, has been financed by credit cards and other loans, and some economists caution that consumers may be taking on too much debt, especially if the economy sours.

HEADLINE: An Oxford Historian Whose Vox Is Populi

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING 

DATELINE: WINDSOR, England, March 1

 BODY:
Niall Ferguson likes to joke that he became a historian by default. "At Oxford, I discovered that I couldn't be a politician, I wouldn't make a terribly good journalist, I was a very poor double bass player and I was an absolutely appalling actor," he said. "I came to realize that what made me happy was to sit in a library reading about dead people."
His choice of A. J. P. Taylor as a role model, however, suggests he was not exactly yearning for seclusion. "Alan Taylor was the first historian I had ever heard of as a schoolboy," he recalled, "and I had heard of him because his books were commercially successful and he did television, newspapers and radio." At the age of 20, then, even before graduating from Oxford, Mr. Ferguson had understood it was possible to be both a respected academic and something of a public figure. 
 What perhaps the soft-spoken Glaswegian did not imagine was that he would achieve this double-billing -- "The Intelligent Populist," as The Spectator weekly magazine has called him -- so early in his career.
Now, just weeks before his 35th birthday, he is a Fellow of Jesus College, Oxford, and author of an appropriately learned tome, "Paper and Iron: Hamburg Business and German Politics in the Era of Inflation, 1897-1927," published by Cambridge University Press. But he is also the most talked-about British historian of his generation, thanks to frequent newspaper articles and interviews on television and radio, along with two new books aimed at nonacademic readers.
"The World's Banker: The History of the House of Rothschild," published as a single 1,309-page book in Britain by Weidenfeld & Nicholson, has been split into two volumes in the United States, with the first 608-page volume, "The House of Rothschild: Money's Prophets," issued by Viking in December. Mr. Ferguson's other new book, "The Pity of War," about World War I, which appeared in Britain in November under Penguin's Allen Lane imprint, will be published by Basic Books in the United States next month.
Eager to have the books read, Mr. Ferguson (who pronounces his first name NEEL) chose to publish them with commercial houses, which helped assure him a large number of reviews -- almost all excellent -- as well as a fresh flurry of press interviews.
The books in themselves also stirred debate since both present what historians would consider new discoveries (for example, that Nathan Rothschild was almost bankrupted by Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo or that Scottish soldiers in World War I routinely killed their German prisoners of war).
For Mr. Ferguson, though, the main difference between, say, his German inflation book and "The Pity of War" lies in their presentation. "Cambridge University Press will produce a book that is intimidating to read, the print is small, the footnotes are on the page," he explained. "Penguin will produce a book which has pictures, good charts, looks nice, and then they will market it. But if you look at the texts of the two books, it's not that big a shift."
Mr. Ferguson knows he is risking the disapproval of his academic peers when he reaches out to the general public. "I think it is a minus in the eyes of the majority of academics, who are deeply suspicious of 'media dons' as a phenomenon," he said, sipping mineral water in a hotel in the shadow of Windsor Castle.
Yet he insists that he is continuing an old tradition. "The idea of the academic as somebody who is dedicated purely to scholarly activities, who will address only an inner priesthood who speak the higher jargon, is a very modern idea," he said. "I think that, for a modern historian, engagement with the media is terribly good for you."
In fact, by his own admission, Mr. Ferguson specialized in economic history and German history because he felt expertise in these areas might serve him well outside the academic world. But he also believes that knowledge of history can enrich debates about contemporary affairs, whether the topic happens to be post-cold-war Europe, the Bosnian conflict or even whether the stock market bubble is about to burst.
Since the late 1980's, then, he has embraced journalism. "Zola said that journalism is the anvil on which everyone should bash their prose into shape," he noted, adding that aggressive editing of his early work taught him to write more clearly. And he answers his academic critics by challenging them to expound and defend their views in public. "It is much harder to convince television viewers than your students," he said.
Mr. Ferguson actually looks the part of a "media don." He cuts a dashing figure, with his tousled hair, fresh good looks and dapper clothes (he wears the corduroy suit of an intellectual and the "power" suspenders of a banker), while his marriage to Sue Douglas, a former editor of The Sunday Express, keeps him close to the world of journalism. But he is also not short of opinions he is ready to share.
His political foes call him a right-wing historian or, more generously, an intellectual conservative, although he describes himself as a liberal fundamentalist. Either way, he seems to be a product of Britain under Thatcherism: he believes strongly in the market and in individualism and is opposed to government intervention in the economy. Recently he spoke out against Britain's joining the new European currency, the euro, although he claims to be "a very European person culturally."
As a Scot, he has raised eyebrows by criticizing Britain's Labor Government over its efforts to increase Scotland's autonomy by creation of a Scottish Parliament. "There's huge hypocrisy about Scottish nationalism," he said. "Their nationalism starts and stops at the entrance to sports stadiums. In reality, all the talk of independence is just a strategy to get more money out of the Treasury."
And yet he insists that he is skeptical about ideologies. "I think being a historian is a terribly good cure for ideological rigor," he said with a laugh, "because it's very hard to see any ideology withstand the experience of 200 years of modern history."
Thus, if Mr. Ferguson had to name an underlying belief, it might be old-fashioned research, like the four years he spent working on his doctorate on German inflation. His massive history of the Rothschilds, which covers the period from 1780 to 1918, was the result of five years' work financed partly by a research fellowship from the British branch of the Rothschilds, who also arranged for him to become the first outsider to gain access to the family's archives. "The Pity of War," originally inspired by his grandfather's stint on the Western Front, also involved extensive research, which led him to go against the conventional historical tide and conclude that World War I could have been averted. This prompted some critics to tag the book "revisionist."
This week, he was in Windsor working in the castle's Royal Archives in preparation for his next book, a history of the Saxe-Coburg family, which supplied much of the 19th century's European royalty (including Prince Albert, Queen Victoria's consort). On a year's sabbatical from Oxford, Mr. Ferguson is also spending time at the Bank of England working on a long-term study of the bond market.
Meanwhile, he has been teaching modern history at Oxford as well as working on other books, including "Virtual History: Alternatives and Counterfactuals," a collection of essays about the "what ifs" of history.
"Virtual history" stands at the center of his approach to the past. Specifically, by examining the uncertainties, dilemmas and options of history -- for instance, "Would World War II have occurred without Hitler?" -- he challenges the inevitability of history and the supremacy of ideologies.
"I began to realize we have a fundamental problem with historical philosophy," he said. "Some people just don't think the past could be any different. And that leads to the belief that history repeats itself. I think there's nothing more dangerous than people who exercise the power of prophecy on the basis of a deterministic theory of history. As Alan Taylor said, all we can learn from history is how to make new mistakes."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Japan Lowers Rates Again, And for Banks It's a Big Zero

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 5

 BODY:
Japan's central bank pushed overnight interest rates to the unprecedented level of effectively zero this week in one of its boldest attempts yet to invigorate the economy -- basically allowing Japanese banks to borrow free.
The Bank of Japan's move, which partly contributed today to a 5 percent surge in the Japanese stock market, represents a gamble that banks will use this borrowed money to increase their own lending to businesses and individuals. The hope is that such a move will stimulate spending and generate a recovery in the world's second-largest economy, which is stuck in the worst recession since World War II. 
 Lending rates in the overnight money market, a critical part of the banking system, have been well below 1 percent for a while -- a sign of how fragile both the weakly capitalized banks and the economy have become over the last few years.
Last month the Bank of Japan announced it would bring the rate down to 0.15 percent. This week the central bank poured between the equivalent of $10 billion to $15 billion each day into the market, and the rates fell to 0.04 percent, then to 0.03 percent, then to 0.02 percent, then to 0.01 percent on Thursday. Today, the rate settled at 0.02 percent, or just one-fiftieth of one percentage point.
That means the rate is less than one two- hundredths the comparable level in the United States. At such a rate, a bank could borrow $1 million overnight and pay just 27 cents in interest the next day.
Nobody, including officials at the Bank of Japan, is sure whether the astonishingly low rates will work. There are also significant hazards -- a mass flight of capital as investors seek higher returns in investments overseas, for example, or a plunge in the value of the yen. Indeed, the yen fell to a three-month low of 123.72 to the dollar in Tokyo today, and some forecasters now say it could weaken to 130 fairly soon and far further later this year.
The biggest risk is that even with such low borrowing costs, the Bank of Japan may still not be able to coax banks to borrow and use that cheaper money to expand lending to companies throughout the country. A critical problem now is that banks have been so absorbed in treating their mountains of bad debt that they have been simply unwilling to make new loans and have even been cutting their lending.
"This is still a trial period," said Kazuo Momma, an official at the Bank of Japan. "It takes time to evaluate what is happening in the market."
For today, at least, the market liked it. Encouraged by the central bank's moves this week, as well as a formal application for public money by the nation's biggest banks, investors sent stocks rallying in the biggest one-day surge this year. That pushed the benchmark Nikkei 225 share average up 710.55 points, to 14,894, its highest level since December.
The Bank of Japan's moves also brought down long-term bond rates, which last month were triple the level of October. The Government is trying to expand the economy with more spending, and this has spooked investors who had dumped bonds and sent their yields soaring. Higher yields can choke an economic recovery by raising long-term borrowing costs.
The yield on the 10-year Japanese Government bond, a benchmark for long-term rates, fell to 1.57 percent today, a three-month low.
The Bank of Japan was able to reduce overnight lending rates by flooding the overnight money market with funds. The $230 billion market is the lifeblood of the banking system and is a commonly used tool for banks and other financial institutions to borrow and lend short-term cash.
"It's amazing," said Akihiko Yokoyama, a fixed-income analyst at J. P. Morgan in Tokyo. "Can you imagine who would lend out money at zero percent?"
The answer seems to be: fewer and fewer lenders. And that could emerge as a problem. Insurance companies and investment trust funds no longer want to park their money there, and are putting it into regular bank deposit accounts or into longer-term money markets, such as one-month or three-month maturities.
Bank of Japan officials are suggesting that they may next try to lower interest rates in the money markets for one-month or three-month borrowings. But that could ultimately lead to capital flight, as investors move money abroad for higher returns.
"It's definitely a problem at the moment," said Clifford J. Shaw, president of Mercury Asset Management Japan Ltd. "Having rates at zero has all sorts of implications."

HEADLINE: The Nuclear Power Elite;
A Small Circle of Companies Seeks Control of Reactors

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

DATELINE: PLYMOUTH, Mass.

 BODY:
FOR SALE: Five buildings on 1,600 acres of woodland. Cape Cod Bay vu. 26 years old. Original owner. Good condition.
 The property that was put on the market last summer was a nuclear plant -- the Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station here -- and that alone might have made it a tough sell. 
 For one, nuclear energy has been very unpopular since the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island. And the opening of electricity markets in states like Massachusetts adds to the financial risks of running a nuclear plant: the costs of plant shutdowns, for instance, can no longer be passed along, with the blessing of regulators, to customers. And the operator no longer has a monopoly.
For these reasons, Pilgrim's owner, the Boston Edison Company, said that if a buyer could not be found, the plant would be shut and decommissioned sooner rather than later. For Plymouth, a town of nearly 50,000 and the home of Plymouth Rock, the loss of its biggest employer would have been a huge blow.
So the 670 managers and employees of the Pilgrim plant were understandably nervous when teams of executives from other utility companies toured the plant to see if they wanted to make a bid. The floors and walls of the plant glistened; the telephones were even polished by hand. Some of the maintenance and operating workers wore ties and dress shirts for a time.
"Until a buyer was found, you did not know what the future held," recalled Frank Clifford, a service reactor operator at Pilgrim.
While the offers did not exactly pour in, two bids were eventually made for the plant. The Entergy Corporation, a huge utility based in New Orleans, was the winner with an $80 million bid. It was just the second sale of a nuclear plant in the United States.
It's a buyers' market, but the fact that there is a market at all in nuclear plants is a sign of how deregulation is reshaping the power industry. Entergy and companies like the Peco Energy Company and Dominion Resources are in the forefront of a group of bargain basement shoppers who see remaining value in nuclear energy. Instead of spending hundreds of millions of dollars or more to build a new power plant capable of generating the same amount of electricity, they are able to buy older nuclear plants for tens of millions -- a mere fraction of their book value. (The last reactor to be built in the United States was ordered in 1973.)
These companies, which own more than one nuclear plant, say they have developed the skill and size to run nuclear plants more efficiently. The possibility of costly operating shutdowns does not frighten them, they say, because they will have the expertise, manpower and equipment available should a problem arise.
And the price is so cheap that it pays to deal with the generally higher costs of operating nuclear power plants compared with that of running other electricity sources.
Nuclear plants in newly open markets like Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Jersey are particularly attractive. Under deregulation, a number of the utilities in those states are shrinking to become transmission companies. They will concentrate on the delivery of electricity and on servicing business and residential customers. Utilities like the Consolidated Edison Company of New York, for example, will buy power at the lowest price from pools where companies like Entergy, Dominion and Peco will sell power.
The buyers of nuclear plants contend they can thrive in such open markets. When the plants are run well, they can compete on price with low-cost plants that run on hydropower, coal and natural gas. And local nuclear plants are particularly attractive compared with power plants outside the region, which face more expensive transmission costs.
"People who are buying the nuclear plants are very smart," said Robert Rubin, a utility analyst with Bear, Stearns. Despite the image of nuclear power as an industry with no future, he said, it still has many years of life yet.
Entergy, which will have five nuclear plants once the Pilgrim acquisition closes, has identified nuclear generation as having tremendous potential.
Many utilities, however, especially those with only one nuclear plant, see only potential liabilities. At the same time, regulators in Massachusetts and elsewhere have been pushing utilities to dispose of their generation plants to help open the market to competition.
For those utilities that are transforming themselves into transmission companies, state regulators often make allowances for their nuclear plants because of the uncertainty over whether there would be buyers. But most utilities have not needed much prodding to sell.
Mr. Rubin estimates that 25 to 30 plants will soon be put on the market and will either change hands or be shut. In a decade, he predicted, most of the nation's 103 operating reactors will be owned by just a handful of companies.
In what may be the next such deal, the two units of the Nine Mile Point nuclear plant, which employs 1,350 workers, are up for sale. The Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation of Syracuse owns one unit. A consortium of utilities, which includes Niagara Mohawk, owns the other. They are in negotiations with Amergen, a joint venture formed by Peco Energy, a utility based in Philadelphia, and British Energy of Edinburgh, one of Britain's largest generators of electricity.
The fate of the plant, on the shores of Lake Ontario, is causing apprehension in Scriba, N.Y., a town of about 8,000.
"Is the new owner going to be a good citizen in our community?" asked Norman Seiter, a lawyer for the town board of Scriba. The two units pay about 85 percent of the property taxes of the town and 39 percent of Oswego County's taxes. If the units are sold, as expected, for less than their book values, the town would be under pressure to reduce the plant's valuation sharply, causing property tax revenues from the operations to fall.
In July, Amergen was the buyer in the first nuclear plant sale in the United States, agreeing to acquire the functioning unit of Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, the site of the nation's worst nuclear accident. The seller was GPU Inc., a utility that serves parts of New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Amergen has also received the exclusive right to negotiate an agreement to buy the Vermont Yankee Nuclear plant in Vernon, Vt., owned by a group of 13 New England utilities.
But not every nuclear plant put on the market will end up with a buyer. Some plants have been so ridden with problems or have such complex ownership and regulatory hurdles that they are likely to be decommissioned early because they cannot be counted on to offer reliable power at competitive prices.
Last year, GPU, for example, tried to sell its Oyster Creek plant, situated about 35 miles north of Atlantic City, but talks broke down, and it was going to be shut. Now, the sales of the Three Mile Island unit and the Pilgrim plant have encouraged GPU to make another effort to find a buyer for Oyster Creek.
Peco had looked at the Maine Yankee plant in Wiscasset, Me., but backed off. The plant will be shut for good.
The prospect of a permanent shutdown worries people in Scriba the most. "We want these plants to stay here and keep operating," Mr. Seiter said. If buyers are not found, he noted, "we will still have a nuclear site in our backyard with the waste being stored for some time."
As more nuclear plants come on the market or are decommissioned, similar concerns are likely to be felt by dozens of communities.
For Boston Edison, a subsidiary of BEC Energy, the decision that its one nuclear plant would not be a part of its future was made after a review two years ago. The utility decided that Pilgrim should be run by a company that had a number of such plants and could take advantage of economies of scale, said Carl Gustin, the senior vice president for corporate communications at Boston Edison.
"It was the best way for Pilgrim to keep operating in the future to have an owner committed to nuclear power," he said.
Entergy got a bargain, industry analysts say. Of its total bid of $80 million, $67 million was for nuclear fuel. This meant that in effect Entergy paid only $13 million for a plant whose book value is about $700 million. A trust fund of $466 million to offset the cost of decommissioning, whenever that should be needed, is also being passed along to Entergy.
The company bought the Pilgrim plant at a time it was running at 97 percent of its capacity and producing 670 megawatts of power -- enough to serve a small city.
But the plant has been troubled in the past. For a time, it had one of the worst operating records in the nation. In 1986, the plant was already under criticism from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission when it suffered two shutdowns because of equipment problems.
Pilgrim remained shut for two years while it underwent an extensive overhaul. Adm. Ralph G. Bird, an outside expert with a background in nuclear submarines, took charge and put in new management and tightened operations and safety procedures.
Entergy has succeeded in turning around other troubled plants. Two of its plants, Arkansas Nuclear One and River Bend in Louisiana had particularly poor operating records in the late 1980's. The plants, which had been operating at as low as 60 percent of capacity, have been operating at an 88 percent level recently.
"You are taking a risk when you assume these assets," Mike Bellamy, the vice president for operations at Pilgrim for Entergy Nuclear said. "If they are run well and you buy them at a good price, the opportunity is there to make a nice profit."
In Plymonth, the sale of Pilgrim Nuclear "has brought real mixed feelings," said Robert Bradley, the office manager at the Pilgrim Sands Motel, whose house overlooks the plant. "There have been times when people were real nervous and wanted it shut down. It has also been a real financial boon to the town."
Indeed, the plant was warmly greeted when it opened in 1972. Thousands of the town's residents, many of them Italian and Portuguese immigrants, had once worked for the Plymouth Cordage Company, the world's largest rope maker. There were also several textile mills. But nylon and other materials replaced the Plymouth-made ropes, which were made from hemp, and the last mill closed in the mid-1950's.
Entergy is not expected to make major changes at the plant, Mr. Bellamy of Pilgrim said, adding that earlier job cuts had left the plant with a lean and efficient work force.
Still, workers and managers may have to change their way of thinking in a newly competitive industry.
Employees had the attitude that "Mother Boston Edison will take care of me," said Cristine Maimaron, a manager and an important member of the marketing team that sold the plant. "It was hard to make the break."

Chart: "Nuclear Autumn"
Nuclear power, once seen as a nearly unlimited source of energy, today accounts for a relatively modest share of electricity output. While the cost of running a nuclear plant can be relatively modest, construction costs soared out of control, making many plants so noncompetitive that they can only be sold at bargain-basement prices.

HEADLINE: Trans-Atlantic Transitions

 BODY:
The United States and Europe are quarreling over bananas, airplanes and beef, working together to secure peace in Kosovo and tangling over the future of NATO. This improbable confluence of events reflects important changes taking place in trans-Atlantic relations. Perhaps more clearly than at any time since the end of the cold war and the collapse of the Soviet Union, America and its European allies are confronting the economic frictions of globalization and adjusting to a world no longer shaped by the clash of ideologies.
Though there are new stresses in America's relations with Europe, there are also encouraging signs that Europe may emerge from this period prepared to take a greater role in maintaining security on the Continent. That would be healthy for both Europe and America. 
 The most promising evidence of this shift is the negotiations over Kosovo. European countries have shown themselves willing to take on more political and military responsibility than they did in Bosnia four years ago. France and Britain have been especially assertive. But the latest American effort to lock up a deal before the formal peace talks resume later this month in France suggests that Washington's leadership and leverage will not be easy to replace.
NATO is another arena of change. While the alliance is preparing to mark its 50th anniversary next month with the admission of three new members, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, all is not harmonious. There is vigorous and potentially divisive debate within NATO about the alliance's reliance on nuclear weapons and how it should react to threats from beyond Europe. These discussions are drawing new energy from a younger generation of European leaders, especially Germany's new Chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, and Britain's Prime Minister, Tony Blair.
With Russia no longer a military threat and three of its former allies about to join NATO, the question of whether the alliance still needs to threaten nuclear retaliation against conventional attack deserves discussion, as Germany has suggested. Also, most European NATO members rightly bristle at some of Washington's more ambitious notions for enlisting NATO forces to defend common Western interests on distant battlefields.
Trade relations are in flux as well, primarily because of increased global competition. The rapid integration of world markets over the past decade, symbolized by new decision-making bodies like the World Trade Organization, is challenging the cozy protectionist policies Europe used during the cold-war years to shelter its companies and workers from risk.
Europe is now trying to tilt its market in favor of local banana importers, aircraft manufacturers and beef farmers and ward off cheaper American competition. Since open protectionism is no longer respectable, Europe cloaks its efforts with arguments about air pollution, dangerous beef hormones and the devastation that free trade in bananas would produce in former Caribbean colonies. While not entirely without merit, these arguments disguise the real motives of European governments and impede reasonable solutions. A trans-Atlantic trade war is in nobody's interest.
Europe and America may also be headed for troubles in other economic areas. The introduction of Europe's new currency, the euro, could force European governments into restrictive monetary policies that could retard needed economic growth, slowing America's own economy and worsening trade tensions. The European Union's slowness to admit members from Central and Eastern Europe is distorting the political and economic development of the entire Continent.
Further frictions are likely as America and Europe adjust their relationship to new circumstances. That is fine, as long as the problems are resolved constructively and not allowed to undermine the vital trans-Atlantic partnership.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Markets Rally Sharply as Economic Fears Fade

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Investors, who were braced for bad news from the February jobs report, got a pleasant surprise yesterday that helped push bond yields down sharply and stocks higher. The Dow Jones industrial average set a new high, rising 268.68 points, to 9,736.08 -- just 264 points from 10,000.
Instead of a jobs report reflecting surprisingly strong growth and threatening higher interest rates, investors got a more benign result. 
 On the plus side for stocks, the jobs data showed that the economy was still growing at a strong pace, which is good for those hoping for a rebound in corporate earnings. On the plus side for bonds, the data did not show that the economy was too strong, which would have heighten fears of an increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve later in the year.
Added to this was the fact that bond investors had probably become overly pessimistic about the possibility of an interest rate increase recently. So the pop in the bond market after the 8:30 A.M. release of the employment report was big, with the price of the 30-year bond jumping more than two points. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.54 percent in early trading from 5.69 percent on Thursday.
Stocks followed when they opened, with the Dow up 202 points, or 2 percent, in the first half-hour of trading.
The rally shows that investors are still willing to bet on stocks, even if it means choosing to ignore traditional signs of danger. These include a stock market that is markedly overvalued for the earnings it is offering and rising interest rates that can undermine earnings and attract money from stocks.
"All you needed to do was to halt this sharp rise in interest rates," said Thomas McManus, the equity strategist at Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities. He said that the stronger-than-expected economy this year helped a "return of confidence in earnings that enabled the market to be resilient in the face of rising yields." Since February, long-term interest rates have jumped half a percentage point.
But the news is not good for all investors. The gains in the market, as they have been for some time, have been concentrated in the big-name, big-company stocks, from General Electric, which rose 3 3/16, to 103 11/16 yesterday, to Microsoft, which jumped 2 11/16, to 154 15/16.
The underperformance of the rest of the market can be seen in the Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks. It is down 5.7 percent this year, while the Dow is up 6 percent.
In addition, 50 percent of the stocks trading on the New York Stock Exchange are 30 percent or more below their 52-week highs, according to Jeffrey M. Warantz, senior equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney.
Mr. Warantz has another barometer, called the laggards indicator; it shows that the last 12 months 73 percent of more than 5,500 common stocks rose 1.2 percent while the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks climbed 19 percent.
"Many, many investors didn't come near that," he said, referring to the 19 percent, "because the market was incredibly narrow and only a few stocks produced those gains. And if investors are diversified, as they should be, their portfolios, chances are, underperformed the market in the last year."
And for all investors, the tension in the market between rising interest rates and the Federal Reserve, on one side, and the outlook for corporate earnings and the stock market, on the other, still remains. And if the economy continues to look too strong, fears of a rate increase by the Fed will intensify, despite yesterday's bond market rally.
Kathleen Camilli, chief economist at Tucker Anthony, said that February's increase of 275,000 jobs certainly "was not weak." She is telling her clients that given the signs of a rebound in manufacturing, which was signaled in recent data from purchasing managers and January factory orders, she is thinking of raising her economic forecast for the year one percentage point, to 4 percent.
Many economists believe that kind of growth, which matches the pace of the last two years, will force the Fed to raise rates to slow the economy and ward off a rise in inflation.
But Ms. Camilli believes that interest rates will not go much higher. She contends that the threat of another global financial crisis and fears of disruptions because of Year 2000 computer glitches will keep the Fed from raising its interest-rate target. In addition, she expects the first three months of this year to be the strongest quarter of 1999, followed by a pretty sharp slowdown in the second quarter. She said this sign of slowing ought to keep interest rates from going much higher and predicted the peak for long-term rates would come this month or in April.
In late bond trading yesterday, the 30-year Treasury bond had given up some of its morning gains, with the price closing up 1 11/32, to 95, while the yield was down to 5.60 percent, from 5.69 percent on Thursday.
Traders said that another spark for the rally was a report in Business Week magazine that said Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, was not inclined to raise interest rates because of concern about another global financial crisis. In addition, the jobs data showed that there was only a tiny increase in wage pressures last month, another sign that inflation remains in check.
The price of futures contracts based on the Federal funds rate, which is the Federal Reserve's target interest rate, also rallied, showing that investors were less worried, at least yesterday, about a rate increase later this year.
Semiconductor, computer, phone, drug and financial stocks led the stock market higher. Intel rose 1 1/4, to 114 5/8; I.B.M. jumped 7 3/8, to 178 3/8; SBC Communications climbed 2 7/16, to 51 13/16; Merck rose 2 5/16, to 82 3/4, and American Express jumped 5 5/8, to 118 5/8.
The Dow, which rallied at the end of the day, to close up 2.84 percent for its first close ever over 9,700. For the week, the Dow rose 4.6 percent. The S.& P. 500 climbed 28.83, or 2.31 percent, to 1,275.47 and is just four points from its highest level, which was reached at the end of January. It rose 3 percent for the week. The Nasdaq composite index, which has many technology stocks, also rallied sharply at the end of the day to finish at 2,337.11, up 44.22, or 1.93 percent. Because of of its recent selloff, it is still 173 points, or 7.4 percent, from its record high. For the week, Nasdaq was up 2.1 percent.
The Russell 2000 index rose 3.99, or 1 percent, to 398.01, and was up 1.5 percent for the week.

HEADLINE: Albright, on Visit to Indonesia, Meets Detained Timor Leader

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, March 5

 BODY:
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright met today with the East Timorese separatist leader, Xanana Gusmao, who was brought from house arrest in a downtown bungalow here to the Indonesian Foreign Ministry for the encounter.
Mr. Gusmao, 53, who was jailed by the Indonesians in 1992 and released from prison to a lighter form of detention last month, is seen by many as holding the key to a peaceful transition to independence in East Timor. 
 Ms. Albright's visit to Indonesia, the first by a senior American official since President Clinton's in 1994, was dominated by talks over how to prevent a repeat of the civil war in East Timor, a former Portuguese colony that Indonesia invaded in 1975 invaded and then annexed.
Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim country and the fourth most populous, has been hit hardest by the Asian economic crisis, with a steep drop in living standards and a continuing economic slump expected this year. Ethnic violence has risen sharply in many parts of the country.
President B. J. Habibie startled the United States and regional powers in Southeast Asia last month when he announced that he was prepared to grant East Timor autonomy, and if that was unsatisfactory to the population there, independence.
Ms. Albright listened to proposals from both Mr. Habibie and Mr. Gusmao about how the transition on East Timor, a desperately poor region of 800,000 people on the eastern edge of Indonesia, should be managed.
In a speech after her meetings, Ms. Albright said the United States favored an "international presence" in East Timor but was not specific about what kind. A senior official traveling with her said that such a presence could be from the region, the United Nations or both.
Most disturbing to the Administration is the recent arming, apparently by the Indonesian military, of people on East Timor who are in favor staying part of Indonesia.
Between 7,000 and 10,000 "pro-integration" people have been armed in recent weeks, according to some estimates, and Administration officials have expressed strong concern that the violence on East Timor will rise. More than 100,000 people are reported to have died in the fighting after Indonesia's occupation of the territory in 1975.
The Secretary told the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Ali Alatas, that the Administration believed the arms were being provided by "elements" in the Indonesian military, a senior Administration official said. "We don't know if it's an authorized policy, but we know it's going on," the official said.

Strong Job Creation Shows The Economy Is Still Robust
Another big burst of job growth in February showed that the nation's economy was still on a roll while wage pressures remained subdued. Driven by booms in construction and consumer spending, employers added 275,000 new jobs to their payrolls. Since Thanksgiving, the economy has been adding jobs at the staggering pace of 3.2 million a year. Even so, the unemployment rate edged up one-tenth of a percentage point, to 4.4 percent.
The strong jobs creation figures touched off a rally in the stock market and sent the Dow Jones industrial average to a new high of 9,736.08. Traders also drove long-term interest rates down. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond declined to 5.60 percent, from 5.69 percent Thursday. Page A1. 

Borrowing by consumers rose by $14.7 billion, to $1.316 trillion, in January. Consumer credit jumped at a 13.5 percent annual rate in January, up from 2.9 percent in December. C14.
 
Tough Times for Indonesian Banks
It is clear that nursing Indonesia's ruined economy back to health will not be easy. But efforts to overhaul the devastated banking system have discouraged even the most hardened realists, who say the postponement of a crucial step toward bank reform last week was a telling example of why the country will take so long to heal. C2.
 
Adelphia Buys Cable Operator
Adelphia Communications is buying Century Communications for $3.6 billion in a deal that will make Adelphia the nation's fifth-largest cable television system operator. The deal is the second cable purchase by Adelphia in less than a month. C14.
 
Alaskan Oil Spill's Legacy Lingers
When the Exxon Valdez ran aground in Alaska's Prince William Sound after midnight on March 24, 1989, the ship's captain told the Coast Guard the supertanker was leaking oil. "We're going to be here for quite a while," the skipper, Joseph J. Hazelwood, reported by radio. Nearly 10 years after one of the nation's worst environmental disasters, the Exxon Valdez is in many ways still there. A1.
 
Republicans Offer a Budget Plan
A Republican budget proposal calls for ending the longstanding practice of spending money earmarked for the retirement system. Instead the legislators recommend setting the funds aside either for use in any plan to shore up the system's finances or to reduce the national debt. A9.
 
Furniture Maker Accepts Bid
Winsloew Furniture, which makes aluminum furniture for patios and offices, agreed to be acquired for about $223.5 million in cash by a management group led by its chairman. The $30-a-share offer represented a 12 percent premium over Winsloew's closing price on Thursday of $26.75. C3.
 
Counterfeits Pinch Golf Market
The market for counterfeit golf equipment has grown to $4 billion a year, more than the $2.5 billion legitimate golf-equipment industry. Store shelves are also flooded by knock-offs, imitations that do not try to pass for the real thing but might violate patent protections. Together, they are hurting sales in an already slumping industry. C2.
 
ABN Amro Moves Into Italy
ABN Amro Holding said it would buy 8.75 percent of Banca di Roma for about 660 million euros, or $715 million. Under the agreement, ABN Amro's longtime Italian partner, Banca Antoniana Popolare Veneta, would then bid for a Banca di Roma unit, Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura. Those two banks combined would rank among Italy's top 10. C2.

HEADLINE: New York Puts On a More Hospitable Face

BYLINE: By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN 

 BODY:
New York City has often had a love-hate relationship with its tourists. Sure, their money fuels the economy, but they also crowd Manhattan streets and make it even tougher to get restaurant reservations. And while locals do offer directions to out-of-towners, albeit reluctantly, the city continues to be a daunting place for visitors to master.
Yesterday, the city took a step toward greater hospitality with the opening of a computerized visitor information center in midtown that is designed to help tourists navigate a maze of cultural offerings using state-of-the-art technology. It will let visitors purchase tickets to a multitude of events and get up-to-the-minute information on many of the city's cultural and recreational offerings. Its operator, the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau, calls it the most technologically advanced center of its kind in the world. 
 But the welcome mat is being rolled out only so far: In true New York fashion, the center will not have public restrooms. Nell Barrett, a spokeswoman for the Convention and Visitors Bureau, said space constraints would not allow anything but a single toilet for use by the staff members. The center occupies 2,200 square feet.
"Obviously, if someone is in dire need they can use it, but it's not being promoted," she said.
Despite its lack of comfort facilities, the center, at 810 Seventh Avenue at 53d Street, signifies that New York has finally caught up with other cities in trying to cater to its tourists, said Fran Reiter, president of the Convention and Visitors Bureau, a not-for-profit organization that relies on public-private ventures to promote the city's tourism industry.
"Previously, we have not served visitors as well as we might," she said. "We were so big and so exciting that we assumed we didn't have to sell the city so hard."
New York has more than enough reasons to be accommodating to its tourists. An estimated 35 million visitors will come to the city this year, representing an increase of 53 percent since 1991, according to the Convention and Visitors Bureau. These visitors will pump $14.5 billion into the city's economy, the bureau estimates.
The center, which cost $400,000 to set up, will be open 365 days a year and will be staffed from 8:30 A.M. to 5:30 P.M. on weekdays and from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. on weekends by four clerks who speak a multitude of languages. Its three computerized information kiosks with touch screens allow visitors to find information on attractions like zoos, museums and avant-garde theater.
The center was built in partnership with American Express, Eastman Kodak and an Internet company, CitySearch. It replaces one at 2 Columbus Circle, which helped 250,000 tourists a year and closed in September 1997. While the old center offered "a lot of information," Ms. Barrett said, it had no "bells and whistles."
The new center is intended to market New York's offerings in the information age. The bureau plans to eventually install 17 more kiosks in heavily trafficked areas throughout the five boroughs, Ms. Reiter said. The machines are expected to sell tickets to attractions like the New York Hall of Science in Queens and the New York Skyride at the Empire State Building.
The kiosks may ultimately appear abroad, Ms. Reiter said. There are plans to install one in a tourist center in London that offers information about New York. "We need to be the most welcoming city and the most informative because we have this embarrassment of riches," Ms. Reiter said.
Yet the bureau's sentiments are apparently not universal. As Ms. Reiter unveiled a new street sign labeled Visitors' Way yesterday, a group of passers-by offered an opinion from the other end of the spectrum. "We don't like visitors," they yelled.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC GROWTH STILL AT FAST PACE AS HIRING SURGES

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
Another big burst of job growth in February showed that the United States economy was still on a roll while wage pressures remained remarkably subdued.
For bond and stock investors yesterday, that combination eased fears of inflation, setting off a wild celebration. Traders drove long-term interest rates down and the Dow Jones industrial average up, with the Dow gaining 2.8 percent, or 268.68 points, to close at a record 9,736.08. 
 Fueled by a boom in construction and consumer spending, American employers added 275,000 jobs to their payrolls, the Labor Department reported yesterday. Since Thanksgiving, the economy has been adding jobs at the staggering pace of 3.2 million a year.
"The economy isn't losing any steam," said Kenneth Goldstein, an economist at the Conference Board, a private research organization. "It's going to be a very strong first half."
Despite that, the jobs report -- which also showed that the unemployment rate edged up an insignificant one-tenth of a percentage point, to 4.4 percent, and that hourly wages barely budged, rising a cent -- reassured Wall Street that the Federal Reserve would not feel compelled to raise interest rates soon.
"Remember the movie 'As Good as It Gets'?" asked Daniel Eagan, senior portfolio manager at Black Rock, a Philadelphia investment firm. "We are about as close to that as we can be."
But many economists said the euphoria on Wall Street was overdone. Richard Rippe, the chief economist at Prudential Securities, warned that the latest evidence did not settle the question of whether the Federal Reserve might need to act later this year to try to cool an overheated economy. "The labor market may not have gotten tighter last month," he said, "but we're still creating jobs at an unsustainable pace."
The bump in the unemployment rate, for example, does not necessarily mean that workers are getting easier to find. The Labor Department says that any change of less than two-tenths of a percentage points carries little if any significance. In February, the change reflected a sharp drop in employment as measured by the so-called household survey. But it is not unusual for the household survey -- on which the jobless rate is based -- to give a weaker reading than the more reliable employer survey of actual payroll changes, according to Bruce Steinberg, the chief economist at Merrill Lynch.
In fact, employment growth in the household survey has lagged behind for several years. The survey asks individuals about employment among members of their household and uses a much smaller sample than the employer survey. It is also an extremely volatile survey, having shown a gain of more than 700,000 jobs in January, three times the increase in the payroll survey, but then showing a drop of 200,000 last month.
Wage pressures appeared to ease last month. Hourly wages of rank-and-file workers, after jumping by a nickel in January, moved up only a cent in February, to $13.04.
Yet outside of manufacturing -- which cut 50,000 jobs as industry remained under relentless cost pressure -- virtually every indicator of current and future job activity was flashing green.
Weekly jobless claims, for instance, have fallen steadily, with the measure now at a 10-year low. The Conference Board's help-wanted index, which measures demand for workers, jumped sharply in January. And the latest quarterly survey from Manpower Inc., a temporary-help company based in Milwaukee that regularly polls 16,000 employers, showed that 29 percent expected to expand payrolls this spring while just 6 percent foresaw cuts.
"We see no deterioration of hiring strength," said Mitchell Fromstein, the chief executive of Manpower.
While job growth this fast is a boon for workers, especially the youngest, the least educated and the lowest paid, it poses risks for the economy.
If the recent hot pace were to continue, unemployment would fall below 4 percent within months, and the economy would be back in territory not seen since the late 1960's, when demands for higher wages started to burst out into inflation after a long period of quiescence.
True, inflation -- instead of rising as many economists had predicted -- has declined even as unemployment has remained below 5 percent for well over a year. The question is whether it makes sense to extrapolate that pattern into the future.
Some researchers think the labor market is getting more efficient. "It looks like something might have changed," said Alan Krueger, a labor economist at Princeton University, who is studying whether the expanding role of temporary help may be enabling companies to attract scarce workers without pushing up the entire wage scale.
Others, like Robert Gordon at Northwestern University, contend that the nation has had some lucky breaks -- rock-bottom prices for oil and other commodities, a stronger dollar and cheaper imports -- that are bound to disappear when the rest of the world's financial woes ease.
Whatever the future, the juxtaposition of strength in the mammoth service economy that employs most Americans and the weakness in manufacturing has persisted since the Asian financial crisis erupted in the summer of 1997. The size of the industrial job cuts in February, however, was something of a surprise because there had been a flurry of other indicators suggesting that the pain there was diminishing.
Some of the cuts were in industries that have long been ailing: the garment industry lost another 15,000 jobs. Others were in seemingly healthy sectors, although the Labor Department warned that the decline of 8,000 in auto employment was probably a statistical fluke.
Factory workers were not the only ones getting the ax. With gasoline as low as 80 cents a gallon in parts of the country, another 10,000 or so oil workers were cut from rigs, probably to sign on to construction crews.
Building continued to boom despite a few signs that higher interest rates might be starting to dampen mortgage applications. With mild weather and strong demand for everything from housing to new shops, 72,000 workers joined construction payrolls in February, bringing the total added since Labor Day to more than a quarter-million.
The lines at cash registers help explain why retailers are struggling to hang on to workers they might have laid off during what in most years is the slower winter season. They added 123,000 workers, adjusted, as are all the figures, to take account of past seasonal variations. And business services have been soaking up workers, adding 40,000 new jobs in areas like computer processing and management consulting. Health care employment, which has been stagnating for a while, jumped, too, as home-care agencies added more nurses and aides.
Even though hourly earnings barely rose, the measure can show flukes because its coverage is limited to rank-and-file workers and its month-to-month changes are often dominated by fluctuations in the types of employees who happened to get hired that month. Still, the rise from a year ago was just 3.6 percent, a slowdown from last summer.

HEADLINE: Turning the Tables

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 5

 BODY:
In the initial skirmishes last year over how to allocate potentially huge Federal budget surpluses, President Clinton triumphed politically by casting himself as the prudent protector of Social Security against irresponsible Republican tax cutters.
Now Republican leaders have taken a shot at turning that dynamic on its head. Putting aside more than a year of squabbling among themselves, they presented a broad budget outline on Thursday that will almost certainly prove impossible to turn into detailed legislation but that gives the party a unified set of principles with which to face the White House. 
 At the heart of the Republican approach is a pledge to be even purer than Mr. Clinton when it comes to Social Security. The Republican plan would end the longstanding practice by Congress and successive Administrations of spending money earmarked for the retirement system, and instead would set it aside for use in any plan to shore up the system or to reduce the national debt.
By taking Social Security out of the equation, Republicans hope, they no longer have to worry that tax cuts will be portrayed as benefiting the wealthy at the expense of the elderly. At last, they say, they have a shot at neutralizing an issue that has played to the political advantage of Democrats since Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Social Security into law 64 years ago and that Mr. Clinton has used with particular skill.
"We've escaped from the box Bill Clinton built for us," a senior Republican aide said today.
Not likely. At least not completely.
The White House pivoted neatly today and turned the debate to whether Republicans were doing enough to make sure that Medicare, the health insurance program for the elderly and a political touchstone second only to Social Security, could weather the aging of the population. (There is plenty in their plan for Medicare, Republicans responded.)
Many of the biggest legislative battles are still ahead, especially the fight over whether Social Security should be remade to include private investment accounts, as most Republicans want.
Moreover, the Republican budget framework, however effective and appealing in the abstract, could face difficulties when it comes to putting it into the form of a budget resolution, the tax and spending guideline on which Congress plans to vote within six weeks.
The most pressing problem for Republicans is that their plan will require deep domestic cuts in order to live up to the party's pledge to stick to spending limits imposed by the 1997 budget deal. That is ground on which Republicans have fought several times and lost, badly, since they won control of Congress in 1994.
Belt-tightening makes sense to many Republicans as a negotiating position across the table from a President who has repeatedly outfoxed them to win financing for political and policy priorities. But there is limited enthusiasm within the party for wading back into an ideological battle over the size of government.
Moderate Republicans, who hold the key to passage of the party's legislation, are especially wary of such a fight. And Republicans on the appropriations committees, which have to pass specific spending bills, said the budget outline left them in an impossible situation, since they see no realistic way to remain within the spending caps while also accommodating calls from within their own party for increased spending on the military and education.
"Maybe there's some magic way to make it work," said one Republican aide to the House Appropriations Committee. "If so, we're eager to hear what it is."
The Republican plan would also make it difficult to enact a sizable tax cut for next year, a goal that only a month ago the party considered nonnegotiable. Taking Social Security revenues out of the budget equation will leave the Federal Government running a $5 billion deficit next year, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
There are various ways of paying for a moderate tax cut next year, including closing loopholes or cutting the tax rate on capital gains, a step that would paradoxically increase revenue for the first year or two as investors rushed to sell stocks that had appreciated in value. But Republicans said their secret weapon when it came to tax cuts was the economy, which continues to grow faster than expected and therefore to generate more tax revenue than the budget office has so far recognized.
Several Republicans said today that the party's leadership expected the projection of a deficit (not counting Social Security) for next year to be transformed into a sizable surplus by the time Congress turns to writing a tax bill this summer. Such a surplus, one House aide said, would provide enough money both to ease the pressure on the spending limits and to enact the first phase of what would grow to be a substantial tax cut over the next decade.
One thing that has become clear is that surplus politics could be just as bitter and complicated as deficit politics were. "G.O.P. Stops Clinton Raid on Social Security," proclaimed the headline on a news release today from Representative John R. Kasich, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the House Budget Committee and a Presidential hopeful.
The more aggressive posture among Republicans was also evident in comments today by the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, who assailed the Administration for proposing to finance hurricane relief to Central America out of this year's surplus, all of which is accounted for by Social Security revenue.
"I will oppose any effort to steal the Social Security funds that rightly belong to our senior citizens," Mr. Lott said.
White House officials praised the Republicans for the broader agreement to save a big part of the surplus for Social Security. But Administration officials are confident of their ability to hold the fiscal high ground by concentrating their attacks on the vagueness of Republicans when it comes to providing new money for Medicare.
"It's hard to think of something that would be more irresponsible fiscal policy," said Gene Sperling, the White House economic policy director, than to commit all the projected surpluses "to other things when we know Medicare is running out of money in 2008."

China Stole U.S. Secrets For Its Bombs, Officials Say
China has made a leap in the development of nuclear weapons -- the miniaturization of its bombs -- by using nuclear secrets stolen from an American Government laboratory, Administration officials said. The espionage probably occurred in the mid-1980's, officials said, but it was not detected until 1995. Government investigators identified a suspect, an American scientist at the Los Alamos laboratory, where the first atomic bomb was developed. A1 

Chinese Premier's Address
Zhu Rongji, reporting on his first year as Prime Minister, told the annual session of the National People's Congress that despite the "grim environment at home and abroad," China would forge ahead with the overhaul of state industries and a streamlining of Government bureaucracy. He implicitly acknowledged the unrest that has flared as urban unemployment grows and farmers protest taxes and corruption. A4

Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema told President Clinton that he was shocked at the acquittal of an American pilot in the deaths of 20 people in a cable car in Italy last year, and said he would not be satisfied until someone was punished. A5
 
U.S. Presses for Kosovo Peace
Western envoys flew into the Balkans to pressure the warring sides in Kosovo to agree to a peace accord, as the province suffered another day of shelling and casualties. Former Senator Robert Dole arrived in Skopje, Macedonia, to meet ethnic Albanian delegates to the peace talks. A5
 
International officials dismissed the Bosnian Serbs' elected president and took the strategic city of Brcko away from their exclusive control, in a challenge to hard-liners opposed to the Dayton peace agreement. A5
 
Israeli Brings Up Lebanon Issue
The Labor Party candidate for Prime Minister, Ehud Barak, introduced the possibility of bringing Israeli troops home from southern Lebanon as a campaign issue, prompting each of the other candidates to declare support for withdrawal. Opinion polls showed most Israelis reacting suspiciously. A3
 
Albright Discusses East Timor
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright met with the East Timorese separatist leader, Xanana Gusmao, in Jakarta. Ms. Albright's visit to Indonesia was dominated by talks over how to prevent a repetition of the civil war in East Timor, a former Portuguese colony that Indonesia invaded in 1975 and then annexed.

Federal Court Strikes Law On Violence and Women
A 1994 law that allows rape victims to sue their attackers on grounds that their civil rights were violated was declared unconstitutional by a Federal appeals court in Virginia. The 7-to-4 ruling held that the law was a "sweeping intrusion" into matters traditionally handled by the states. A lawyer for the plaintiff, a woman who said two college football players raped her in 1994, said an appeal to the Supreme Court would probably be made. A9
 
Aftermath of an Oil Spill
Nearly 10 years after the Exxon Valdez struck a reef off the Alaska coast, spilling at least 10.8 million gallons of oil, things are still not back to normal, not environmentally, not commercially and not psychologically for many of the people for whom the water is life and livelihood. And the tanker's skipper, Joseph J. Hazelwood, who was convicted on a misdemeanor charge of negligent discharge of oil, will return to Alaska this summer to serve a community-service sentence of picking up trash in Anchorage. A1
 
Suspicious of Lumber Company
Many environmentalists and others who have kept close watch on Pacific Lumber for nearly 15 years do not believe the company can live up to an agreement it signed on Monday, when it sold to California and the Federal Government 10,000 acres of ancient redwood groves for $480 million. A7
 
Clinton Wishes Lewinsky Well
President Clinton said he was sorry about all that Monica Lewinsky went through in the last year and he wished her "a good life." He said he had not watched a television interview with Ms. Lewinsky that ABC broadcast on Wednesday. A9
 
Republican Senator Bowing Out
Senator Connie Mack of Florida will not seek a third term next year, people close to the Senator said. One of those associates said that Senator Mack, 58, had simply decided that "it is time to move on." His departure is expected to draw interest from numerous prospects in both parties. Mr. Mack is the first Senate Republican to announce that he will not run next year; three Democrats have said they will not seek re-election. A8
 
Sticking With Civil Rights Chief
President Clinton again nominated Bill Lann Lee to be Assistant Attorney General for civil rights, a post that Mr. Lee has held on an acting basis since his nomination was rejected more than a year ago. Conservative Republicans in Congress believe that Mr. Lee enforces affirmative-action laws too zealously. Mr. Lee was sworn in as acting head of the Justice Department's civil rights division in December 1997, a month after the Senate Judiciary Committee rejected his nomination. Last month, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who heads that committee, urged Mr. Clinton to give up on Mr. Lee. (Reuters)

Price Paid Dairy Farmers Is Poised to Plummet

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 5

 BODY:
Milk producers enjoying record high prices will experience a sharp drop in the next month, the largest change in one month in history, the Agriculture Department said today.
Consumers should begin to see a decline in the prices of milk, cheese, butter and other dairy products by midsummer, economists say. 
 The Agriculture Department said the basic milk price received by producers would drop to $10.27 per hundred pounds of milk from $16.27.
The largest month-to-month decline ever recorded was a $2.52 dip, said Chris Nubern, an economist with the National Milk Producers Federation.
The Government determines the price each month by surveying manufacturers about the price paid to producers and then announcing the figure as a guideline for the industry.
The coming drop is earlier than normal. Prices paid to producers usually fall in the summer when it is hotter and milk production declines.
The decrease is partly a result of increased production prompted by the record prices, Mr. Nubern said, adding, "We're in a market where a lot of milk is being produced, and that's driving prices down."
But milk producers will have a cushion, because Congress included $200 million for dairy producers in last year's emergency farm aid.

THE SECRET LIVES OF CITIZENS
Pursuing the Promise of American Life.
By Thomas Geoghegan.
240 pp. New York:
Pantheon Books. $25.
TODAY'S young adults are the first generation born this century to have missed the passion of American liberalism. Previous generations witnessed the crusading muckrakers and suffragettes, the zeal of the New Dealers and of the labor leaders Sidney Hillman and John L. Lewis, the vigor of John and Robert Kennedy, the righteousness of Martin Luther King Jr. and the freedom riders, the ardor and agony of the Vietnam War protesters and the fervor of the women's rights movement. There were excesses and hypocrisies all along the way, but also a thundering insistence on broader democracy and a more inclusive prosperity. 
 Now, at the century's end, most liberals would be content to save Social Security, not exactly an issue that gets the blood flowing. In this era of the most conservative Democratic President of the century, political passions seem the exclusive province of the right, those who want to slash taxes and end affirmative action and abortions.
What happened? Thomas Geoghegan, a crafty writer who moonlights as a Chicago attorney, blames the hollowing of America's great Northern cities, which were once incubators of progressive politics, and the withering of the Federal Government, which once gave such a politics a national scope. In Geoghegan's view, the states have quietly sucked the energy out of both and substituted lowest-common-denominator governments more responsive to the rich and the wacky than to the blue collars and the underdogs.
Geoghegan does not actually make this argument in "The Secret Lives of Citizens." Instead, he circles it like a dog chasing a scent. His is a whimsical, personal journey that never quite gets anywhere but stops at a lot of interesting and oddball spots along the way. The trail begins and ends in Chicago. The city is shrinking, surrounded by ever-expanding suburbs run by faux governments (DuPage County to the west, transportation authorities, mosquito abatement districts, the Northeastern Illinois Planning Commission) that meet secretly in hotel conference rooms to decide things like where to locate new runways and tollways. Once seething with ethnic ward politics, Chicago has become dull and soulless, Geoghegan says, filling up with young corporate achievers who don't even know where the wards are.
What's worse, power has tilted toward the Sunbelt states. New baseball teams don't even bear the names of cities anymore -- they're Texas Rangers, Arizona Diamondbacks and Florida Marlins. The original sin, according to Geoghegan, was Franklin Roosevelt's failure to apply the New Deal to the South. The ploy enabled Roosevelt to get legislation through Congress, but it proved a long-term curse. The South had no labor unions or wage bargaining. "It was as if a hole had been punched in the bottom of the New Deal. The wages, the jobs could leak slowly into the South. . . . Drip, drip, at first. Then gushing, in a flood." After revenue sharing became the core of Richard Nixon's Southern strategy, the Sunbelt got the infrastructure it needed to attract Northern industry. As competition intensified, the South's population and share of the gross national product exploded. And places like Chicago began emptying out.
Devolution to the states is all the rage now in Washington, whose officials seem oblivious of the states' tradition of corruption and ineptitude. Geoghegan remarks that United States attorneys could exist simply to prosecute state governments. After all, the savings-and-loan scandal happened after the states took on responsibility to regulate the companies. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court is busy reviving the ghost of John C. Calhoun, who once claimed that states could nullify laws of Congress. But if the Calhounists were correct, Geoghegan asks, how could we have ever abolished slavery? It's not just Roosevelt who's under attack now; it's Lincoln. The progressive writer Herbert Croly had warned early on: if the states got stronger and Washington weaker, all the old evils would return -- inequality, stagnant wages and big business running the country.
What's a citizen to do? It's the serious question that lies at the heart of the book, but Geoghegan answers it ironically. Democratic Presidents used to give Americans things to do, he writes. Roosevelt told us to join a union, Kennedy asked us to join the Peace Corps, Johnson to go to the inner city and teach children. But Carter didn't say. And although Clinton urged us to volunteer, he was evasive. "Volunteer for what?" Geoghegan asks. "Join a militia in rural Michigan?" National Democrats haven't a clue what to do, other than raise campaign money. You can't even find out at a place like Harvard's Kennedy School, where it's "all microeconomics. Cost benefit. Deregulation. Getting prices right -- which usually implies, I have found, getting wages wrong." A young woman at the school sobs, "I came here because I wanted to help people, and now, now . . . now they say . . . I can't do anything!"
What's Geoghegan himself to do? His grandfather, we learn, was a popular county commissioner during the Depression. "It would take us half an hour to walk a block, people coming up to shake his hand," he boasts. But Geoghegan won't run for office ("the shame was: I'd never live like my grandfather"), and he never quite decides what else would be worth doing. He comes to Washington in the 1970's, an idealistic young lawyer (from his previous book, "Which Side Are You On?," we know he worked for a time with the unions); gets a job at the Energy Department, which turns out to be a big bumbling bureaucracy; moves back to Chicago and campaigns for Harold Washington, but once Washington becomes Mayor his program is blocked by a group of white aldermen.
Later, Geoghegan considers suing Chicago for failing to control an outbreak of tuberculosis but then realizes it won't end the poverty that lies at the root of the disease. He considers a public-interest lawsuit to challenge residential parking, but it won't help the poor either. He wants to prevent poor youngsters from working, but it's not practical. He fantasizes about becoming a teacher. He briefly volunteers to help poor kids get jobs as movie ushers. He ponders how to get speedier trials for jailed defendants but is told by a public defender that a brief stint in jail may not be so bad for them.
This is a sly and ultimately sad book, written more as a prose poem than a serious argument. Geoghegan's language is playful, as when he describes regional governments as "little asteroid bits" that "float around, with no clear boundaries," and sometimes purple ("Every city in America seems the same now, doesn't it? One half: Girls, in tennis whites, dawdling over cat calendars. The other half: Babies, in crack houses, sitting in feces"). The paragraphs often run no more than one or two sentences, personal reminiscence mixing with historical anecdote, dipping into complex themes and then out again, mood shifting from wistful nostalgia to dark comedy.
At the end, Geoghegan finds himself at an interracial, interfaith, urban-suburban rally on crime control. Afterward, he drives home with a friend who asks what the group is going to do. "I don't know," he answers. "But that's the problem, nobody knows what to do." Geoghegan liked the meeting anyway, because it brought people together. The conclave was a symbolic gesture, and he gives it a metaphorical shrug. What to do besides shrug? With liberal passions gone and Chicago hollowing out, the author never quite decides.

THROWIM WAY LEG
Tree-Kangaroos, Possums, and Penis Gourds -- On the Track of Unknown Mammals in Wildest New Guinea.
By Tim Flannery.
Illustrated. 326 pp. New York:
Atlantic Monthly Press. $25.
"IT is always slightly unnerving arriving at a new location" in New Guinea, Tim Flannery says. "You have no idea what the locals will be like or how you will be received." What an understatement! This man walked alone into a village for the first time and overheard three locals agreeing to kill him, and that is far from the most threatening situation he found himself in. The title of his book, "Throwim Way Leg," is pidgin for going on a journey. Flannery, a celebrated mammalogist and paleontologist at the Australian Museum in Sydney, made 15 long research excursions into New Guinea beginning in 1981, when he was 26; in a dozen years he identified at least 17 new species of mammals, and his "Mammals of New Guinea" (1990) is the standard scientific guide. But "Throwim Way Leg" is more than an account of his fieldwork. It is an enthralling introduction to the mountain people of New Guinea -- unimaginably remote, charming, cunning, cruel, subtle and appealing -- and to their magnificent land. Flannery is not always an eloquent writer, but his evocations of the New Guinean landscape carry you away. 
 About 12,000 years ago, when the ocean swallowed an ice-age land bridge between Australia and New Guinea, life on the island was cut off from the world. In a place with no pack animals, where walking is the only locomotion and passage in any direction requires scaling mountains rising from 5,000 to 15,000 feet, people became so isolated from one another that today almost 1,000 languages are used. Equatorial monsoons sweeping the mountains create alpine swamps in the clouds, and on such wet vertical terrain arable tracts and dwelling spaces are few and distant, so the islanders formed tribes in tiny villages, warring with one another for 500 generations. No common identity developed and there is no political history -- kingdoms, pyramids, common religion, shared culture, all that.
Early in this century the Netherlands claimed the western half of the island and Australia the eastern half. But they stuck to the coast. Only in the late 30's was much contact made with mountain people, the vast bulk of the population. Now the world is moving in. In 1963 Dutch New Guinea became Irian Jaya, a province of Indonesia, and in 1975 the Australian territory became a nation, Papua New Guinea. There are still almost no roads on the island, and none across it; but small airstrips multiply, and international companies operate gold and copper mines. So the tribesmen are moving in a lifetime from the Neolithic period into the global Westernized economy.
Flannery's intimacy with them was necessary: to find unknown species of mammals he needed local hunters. They could eat their prey and he got the skin and bones for his natural history museum. Soon he needed the tribesmen for their rich companionship; readers will share his respect for their intelligence and his delight in their cutting sense of humor, especially about sex, and in their practical jokes, childish but shrewd tests of the wit of their targets. Rightly, Flannery honored the tribesmen in scientific names he gave a few species. (He had an amusing payback in kind through a youth who helped him clean dead animals and took as reward a gut parasite from them, which he swallowed alive. A parasitologist to whom Flannery sent one of these creatures found it was a new species and named it Flannery's tapeworm: Burtiela flanneryi.) The tribesmen spring vividly from these pages, speaking in their own voices, and you will remember many by name.
Some are cannibals. A lot of lurid speculation has been published about New Guinea cannibalism over the last 50 years, so the sobriety of Flannery's account is a relief. A village headman told him a revealing story about where his son, a young man Flannery admires, came from: The headman's village staged an attack on a neighboring community, killed all the adults, gutted their carcasses to carry home for food and raised the children as their own, among them a baby hidden in a tree -- his son. His wife added: "We ate his . . . parents. . . . They gave me all the milk I needed to nourish two children." Flannery says cannibalism was never ubiquitous in New Guinea -- nothing is -- but other cannibals appear here, including a great hunter who, in a fit of blinding grief, hatcheted his daughter and commanded his family to feast on her.
Flannery offers no excuses, and few judgments. He does say that in some tribes child mortality nears 100 percent and, with governments now curbing the traditional village raids, certain communities face extinction. In fact, the whole population does, every day, from cholera, malaria, ringworm, amebic dysentery, pig tapeworm, tropical ulcers, intestinal roundworms and scrub typhus (not to mention hypothermia on mountain passes where people wearing little more than penis gourds or grass skirts can easily end up as wild-dog food). Flannery's own experience of several of these diseases is grim reading; you know he must love his work.
There can be no animal he is not fond of -- the possums and marsupials he is the world's leading student of, certainly, but also singing dogs, wild pigs, shrieking frogs, a spider that does a Christo number on whole trees and a brilliant array of birds of paradise (their displays, in his words, can raise goose bumps). He has a toe-tickling dalliance with a preposterously affectionate giant anteater and lingers over a yard-long cave rat that "let out a loud, doglike snarl" at him. He even likes a 10-foot black python that nearly bested him in what he calls a match between "the snake and its prospective meal." His passion is tree kangaroos -- they took to the canopies of rain forests when food got scarce below -- although it is unfeeling of him, I think, to say they look "rather clumsy in the treetops." The high point of his scientific career, he says, was his classification of a black-and-white species that was legendary among the tribes but had never been seen by an outsider before a hunter brought him one. He named it dingiso, which is what the locals call it. (It should be said here that Flannery's American publisher gives him little help. He often compares animals in New Guinea with those in Australia, and an American who does not know a wallaby from a wombat is left to wonder. Also, while there is a small gallery of his photographs, only a couple are of animals; pictures or drawings of others are so obviously needed that their absence is a bit insulting.)
ONE wonders: can such rare animals long survive? Taboos are the only protection for some, Flannery says, and the lifting of a taboo or the invasion of a sacred territory by a distant tribe can wipe out a species in months. In 1975 the skull and bones of an ice-age bat of singular rarity were found. The animal entered the scientific roster as Bulmer's fruit bat, the world's largest, extinct for 12 millenniums. In 1977 an anthropologist sent to a bat expert in Sydney a skull saved from a banquet of roast bat he attended in New Guinea. It was a Bulmer's fruit bat. The expert rushed to the cave where the mountain people had gathered their feast and found no sign that a single bat was left -- Extinction II. What had happened was this: The tribe living near the cave observed a taboo against touching the bats. But hunters from another tribe lowered a man on a rope into the cave, armed with a pernicious piece of Western technology: the anthropologist's shotgun. He blasted away at the cave ceiling and thousands of bats fell. Other tribes heard about this and devoured the rest. But not quite all: 10 years later Flannery saw a few bats emerge from the cave. One night, hanging by fingers and toes from treetops teetering over a 1,000-foot-deep shaft above the cave entrance, he and a colleague caught a live Bulmer's fruit bat in a net. If the local tribe can now make outsiders observe its taboo, the species may survive.
The traditional life of the mountain people is unlikely to, despite Flannery's wistful hope. That many younger people are so intrigued by Western clothes, gadgetry, machinery and, most tellingly, money does not augur well for what the tribesmen call "the old ways." The prospect brings a tone of discontent with Western civilization into Flannery's voice -- not complaint but low background noise, perhaps left over from the big bang of political correctness 20 years ago. Thus he repeatedly snipes at Christianity for trying to change morals and clothe nudity. But his own testimony contradicts him: the only outsiders in his book who compete with the locals in vital eccentricity are two European Roman Catholic priests who in dramatically different ways inspire the tribes to hang onto as much of the old ways as they can.
Flannery's fear that Irian Jaya will combust is more compelling. Jakarta promotes migrations of Indonesians into the island and relentlessly tries to impose Javanese social order. Only a large armed force keeps control, and it has killed thousands of tribal people. In 1996 Flannery found that most mountain villagers he visited assumed there would soon be a war between them and the Indonesian Army. A symbol of the situation is a huge gold mine in the Irian mountains, run by an American company. Tribesmen say they could live with the company if it were truly autonomous, but it is as entwined by Jakarta as Flannery was by the python. The Government has built near the mine a Javanese city for 25,000 people (expandable to 250,000) in the midst of a rain forest, gleaming new and as yet unoccupied when Flannery saw it -- a chilling, empty monster. Yet the mining company supported his research, and he dedicates the book to its chairman and those of other mining interests in the region "in the hope that . . . they will understand a little better the people whose lives they so profoundly change."
In fact, he owes to the miners the most lovable character of all, appearing in a few emotionally charged pages at the end that evince the wonder and sweet sadness of the whole book. In 1994 a miner called Flannery in Sydney, summoning him urgently. He returned to find, in a miniature rain forest constructed on a porch, a young male dingiso that had wandered into the mine site, the first living one he met. The miners called it Ding. "As I opened the screen door to peer in, Ding . . . hopped out of the foliage and came towards me," he says, and its gentle personality comes right off the page into the reader's heart. After a few days Flannery and a pilot airlifted the tree kangaroo into the mountains: "When we released him into the alpine herbage, Ding hopped away very slowly, sampling leaves as he went. He was in no hurry to leave us, and it was only after several minutes that he disappeared into a dense tangle of bushes."

Beyond the Old Woman In The Shoe

BYLINE: By Witold Rybczynski

 BODY:
What is it with these people? Do they wake up one day and say, "Let's move to that abandoned missile silo" or "Why don't we buy an old plane and turn it into a house"? What drives people to do something this, well, bizarre? Economics, surely, isn't the only reason. Unlike Diogenes, who lived in a tub, they don't appear to be ascetics. Maybe they want to be different, to be noticed; not just to own a conversation piece but to live in one. In fact, these are some of the same sentiments that motivate the clients of high-style architecture. After all, living in a caboose is no more odd than living in a house with all-glass walls or in a house perched over a waterfall, to name but two famous architectural landmarks.
Of course, there is a difference between saying that "a house is a machine for living in," as Le Corbusier did, and making a house out of a real machine. High-style architecture, especially modern high-style architecture, often thumbs its nose at comfort and convenience. It challenges its owners to do without. The challenge for aspiring caboose dwellers is different. Once they have made the plunge -- admittedly a high dive -- they usually work hard to transform their unfamiliar surroundings into something resembling a house. It is not easy to turn a missile silo or a Boeing 747 into a more or less cozy home. Where do you put the bathtub? How do you get in? What about closets? Like Robinson Crusoe, the builder makes do and improvises with whatever is at hand. 
 Curiously, unlike high-art houses, which sometimes appear arrogant, these distinctly quirky homes actually reinforce our shared sense of domesticity. A quaint colonial porch light immediately transforms the vaultlike entrance to an underground missile site. A television in a mausoleum sends an unmistakable signal. A school bus up on cinder blocks is just a vehicle, but a school bus with flower boxes, lace window curtains and a door knocker is somebody's home. Such is the potency of our household symbols.
These odd houses are endearingly makeshift. I am reminded of the nursery rhyme "There was an old woman who lived in a shoe." I think that part of the fascination with improvised dwellings has to do with childhood memories. Children, so conservative in many ways, are inveterate and inventive house builders. Something as simple as a card table, a chair and a blanket can become a house; or the cardboard carton that the refrigerator came in, holes cut out for doors and windows, turns into a bungalow. I remember constructing playhouses in trees, building sand castles on the beach and digging forts deep in translucent snowbanks. Now I live in a house, just like everyone else. Well, almost everyone.

GRAPHIC: Photos:On the fringes of Cairo, what was built as a warren of grand mausoleums for the dead has gradually become, in essence, a suburb. From the outside, the necropolis appears empty still, but within, spaces are made over into apartments -- into homes -- for some 200,000 people. (Photographs by Richard Barnes); After a 1995 earthquake in Japan left sections of Kobe's housing in rubble, the architect Shigeru Ban created homes with walls of paper -- surprisingly resilient paper tubes, specifically. The project was of a piece with Ban's work designing emergency shelters for the U.N. High Commission for Refugees. The homes were built quickly and cheaply, but they were built to last. (Photographs by Hiryuki Hirai (above right) and Takanobu Sakuma (right) ); About 100 miles east of Los Angeles, in the desert near the Salton Sea, hundreds of people live in vehicles parked on concrete slabs that are all that's left of a former Marine base. Among them is the owner of this 1974 Ford school bus. (Photographs by Richard Ross); Edward Peden and Dianna Ricke-Peden live in an 18,000-square-foot abandoned missile site near Topeka. A tunnel connects the launch-control building (the living room used to be the control room itself) to the launch service space, where the missile used to reside. The couple now sell similar sites -- from New York State to Texas -- through a company called 20th Century Castles. (Photographs by Timothy Hursley); Built in 1891 to serve a single nearby mansion, this 45-foot-high water tower had outlived its usefulness by the 1920's (when a water-and-electric plant was built) and was turned into a living space, with about 1,000 square feet spread over four floors. Today the owners, Dan McGilvray and Lorna Moore, enjoy the top-floor bedroom's 360-degree views. (Photographs by Richard Ross)

HEADLINE: THE HUMAN HABITAT;
The Real World of Interiors.

BYLINE: By Michael Pollan

 BODY:
The twilight struggle between Life and Design surely counts as one of the great long-running stories of the century now ending. This clash of terms has given us battles drenched in both tragedy and farce, on fronts as different as the Iron Curtain and the curtain wall, Soviet collective farms and Corbusian villas, American urban-renewal projects and, if I may add a somewhat less famous skirmish to the list, the redecoration of my parents' apartment in the early 1970's. It was during this episode, which took place when I was 15, that I first understood how easily our dreams of a more perfect order can founder on the shoals of everyday life.
In my family's case, the dream of a more perfect order was supplied by a man named William Machado, the interior decorator my mother chose from the pages of a home-design magazine to redo the dated and gloomy Manhattan co-op my family had moved into the year before, making the big step up from our ranch house on Long Island. In memory, Machado looks exactly like Jerome Robbins, with the same scrupulously clipped salt-and-pepper beard, the erect dancer's bearing and an austere, somewhat formal manner not at all in keeping with the times. It was always an occasion when he came by to present his color schemes and fabric swatches, my mother according him the deference due a maestro, while my father grumpily eyed his watch and mentally patted his wallet. 
 The summer of the renovation, my parents removed the whole family to the beach for the duration, and it was there that one of the unsolved mysteries of my childhood unfolded -- one that, in retrospect, should have served as fair warning to us all that living under (or up to) Machado's design was not going to be easy. It concerned Binker, our English bulldog. Bought on sale from a pet store by my father, Binker was in every respect a horrible creature. She attacked children without provocation. With a snorty flick of her great, bejowled head, Binker could fling a ropy lariat of drool 20 feet, and if that didn't empty the room, her staggering smell would finish the job. We surmised that Binker's digestive and respiratory tracts had somehow been crossed, for her breath seemed to come from someplace other than a lung. Binker also suffered from eczema and incontinence, though the latter condition may have represented nothing more than an extreme manifestation of her laziness. Either way, Binker's existence, which might be said to represent the antithesis of good design, posed a mortal challenge to Machado's work in progress, and as the renovation progressed, my parents could often be heard fretting about the dog's future in the new apartment.
Then the mysterious thing happened. One morning a few days before we were due to move back into the finished apartment, Binker quietly and conveniently expired in her sleep. It would never have occurred to me to suspect foul play -- Binker was getting on in years -- except that my father made such a big show of taking her to the animal hospital for an autopsy. He returned brandishing an official-looking document declaring that Binker had died, and I quote, of "natural causes."
When I saw the new apartment, I knew right away that Binker was better off having departed this world for what could only be a more imperfect one. All our old stuff was gone, and the living room had been transformed into a meticulously composed tableau, a spacious, tranquil room, done in shades of wheat and sand and clay, that occupied an existential plane somewhere between high-tech and Zen. I remember thinking that it looked just like a magazine, and wondered if the new living room was going to get the sort of velvet-rope treatment I'd run into at some kids' houses. There was one friend's place I must have been over a thousand times before even setting (unshod) foot in the living room, a plushly carpeted Danish Moderne space as blue and airless as the sea.
A few days after we moved in, Machado himself showed up to put the finishing touches on his masterwork. He spent an entire day arranging the wall of books in the living room, until he had satisfied himself that he had achieved the ideal composition of upright Modern Library volumes alternating with great slabs of art books stacked on their sides, and here and there the occasional jaunty leaner canted at a precise 60 degrees off plumb. Books whose spine color or typography he judged unesthetic were exiled to the bedrooms, along with all our paperbacks. To give the whole wall the proper amount of compositional air, he left spaces between the book clusters for a collection of considered objects -- a pair of kachina dolls, a carved Inuit stone and various pre-Columbian tchotchkes. Some of this stuff I recognized as my mother's, but a lot of it I'd never seen before.
I had to admit that the bookshelves were beautiful, as much a work of art as half the volumes perched on them, yet they soon became a symbol of the vague oppression Machado's design had visited on our daily lives. Though to their credit (and peril), my parents never ruled the new living room off-limits to minors, Machado's bookshelves quickly emerged as a source of family tension. My mother informed us that each time we removed a book from the Wall, we were to leave a little slip of paper in its place so the book could be returned to its designated spot. As you might expect, this regime didn't survive very long, and in short order several of the Modern Librarys were found lying down, and a few of the leaners began looking less casual than sloshed.
The creep of entropy took its psychological toll on my mother, but her fidelity to Machado's art never quite exceeded her devotion to her children (a proposition we sought daily to test), because she continued to let us take out books. What we didn't know then was that she had made a graph-paper sketch of Machado's tableau, recording each book's precise address and the cosine of every leaner, and after we went to bed she would set to work putting the Wall right again, holding the picture perfect for one more day.
I realize now that my mother's sketch of Machado's bookshelf arrangement was her way of defending his design against the inevitable frictions of time and habitation -- arguably the Achilles' heel of 20th-century design. Ever since the modernists, whose rise happened to coincide with the advent of architectural photography, much of the energy of interior design has been directed toward that single pristine moment my mother was struggling to preserve: the day the finished but not yet inhabited house gets its picture taken, freezing it in time. This is the moment memorialized in the magazine layout, the still point on which designers' careers turn. After that, it's downhill. "Very few of the houses," Frank Lloyd Wright once complained, were "anything but painful to me after the clients moved in and, helplessly, dragged the horrors of the old order along after them."
A designer's "horrors" are nothing other than the client's favorite stuff -- the furniture, pictures, curios, books, mementos and keepsakes accumulated over a life. We prize these things not necessarily for their beauty, and certainly not for the harmonious way they fit together, but because they tell a story about us, individuals with a particular history that, over time, gets written on the walls of our homes. The problem is, that story is not necessarily the same one a designer wants to tell. He doesn't want his work of art haunted by our past or, for that matter, left open to the imprint of our futures.
All art aspires to the condition of timelessness, but what, in a house, is time? It is simply us, going about our lives, taking books off the shelf and putting them back wrong, adding a souvenir from a vacation to the mantle, taping a report card to the fridge, leaving crescent moons of coffee on the new butcher block. (Did I mention the new kitchen counters? For years my mother would apply a nightly poultice of Bon Ami to the butcher block, hoping to bleach out the traces of the day.) As inevitably as weathering, the process of inhabiting a space leaves the marks of time all over it, and so constitutes a declension from the designer's ideal.
It was the modernists who first came up with a solution to this design problem, a way to keep our stuff and all the other traces of habitation out of the picture. They would insist on designing their interiors down to the very last detail, not only the bookshelves and cabinets (Farewell the chests of yesteryear," Le Corbusier had declared) but also the furniture (built in wherever possible) and window treatments, and even in some cases the light fixtures and teapots and ashtrays. This way they could control everything in the picture. And some didn't stop there: Wright went so far as to design new clothes for one client, the better to insure that her presence in his rooms wouldn't spoil their color schemes. The wonder is that there are clients who actually like the idea of having their lives professionally designed. Architects get asked to arrange not only their clients' books but also the toothbrushes in their bathrooms and even the groceries in their pantry. I've seen blueprints prepared for the express purpose of showing a client where to put her olive oil.
Not many of us would ever think to have a designer pre-position our salad oils, and yet we're avid to look at the homes of the kind of people who do -- that is, the scrupulously styled rooms splashed across the spreads of shelter books like House & Garden and Metropolitan Home. At least, I know I am, even after having spent part of my childhood trying to live within the confines of such a magazine spread. We look, even though we understand no one really lives like that, even when we know a not-very-bookish stylist has handpicked the bedside reading, that the ottoman was brought in to bestow a credit on an advertiser and that the Phalaenopsis has already gone back to the orchid-rental guy.
Yet there's a powerful fantasy on offer here, and it's not just a fantasy of wealth, though surely that comes into it. For me, at least, it's a daydream of a more ordered and coherent existence (not to mention a really good housekeeper). In this other life, the wave of clutter and information threatening to break over us has somehow been tamed. Notice how rarely a TV or computer or even a magazine disturbs the peace of these rooms; indeed, the images themselves implicitly deny the existence -- the pressures -- of the very world that produced them. Also, the harmonious tableaux bespeak an equally harmonious marriage, a meeting of the minds on how two people, or a family, can live happily together. (Never mind that few interludes can ruin a marriage quicker than the building of one of these places.) So, yes, these rooms ask us to suspend our disbelief, and we do, accepting these frozen signs of habitation for the flowing, tangled thing itself.
The picture in the magazine also gratifies our voyeurism, for how often do we get to peer into the kitchens or bedrooms of perfect strangers? Yet we seldom get to see how other people inhabit their houses, which is to say, live their private, at-home lives. Shelter magazines offer only the thinnest sampling of the myriad forms domestic life can take. Even today, when "good design" is no harder to find than the nearest Crate & Barrel, most of us continue to make our places according to our own idiosyncratic lights. We'll buy one of those from there, borrow this idea or that from Martha Stewart or the people next door, but mostly we're happy to let life's accidents and passing fancies shape and reshape our interiors. We might start out with a picture, but we usually end up with a story.
I'm thinking of a couple of rooms I've been in recently, rooms in which the crosscurrents of personal history have exerted a stronger pressure than design or even good taste. The first is a woodsy New England home decorated in what might best be called Amateur Natural Historian. Wasps' nests balloon from tree branches crisscrossing the ceiling; a snake's skeleton stretches out along the mantle; cactuses thick as phone poles tower in the kitchen; a stuffed barn owl supervises the dinner table. Then, in central Florida, a soaring white church of a living room presided over by a floor-to-ceiling hutch displaying, exclusively, a collection of hand-painted Walt Disney plates, each of them tenderly held in a circle of halogen. One more: the handmade house of a friend who died recently, where, on the mantle, his daughters have composed a modest shrine consisting of his first novel, his pocketknife, a family portrait from a sunny time, a guitar pick and a shell from his hunting rifle. The real world of interiors is a far stranger and more wonderful place than any designer or magazine editor can conceive.
The pages that follow -- documenting the insides of homes from Cleveland to Taipei, Brooklyn to Bangkok -- offer abundant, even extravagant proof of this proposition. Taken together, they tell a story of how we go about inhabiting the places we live in, how we make them our own. And though this process is inevitably inflected by the particularities of culture and class, certain elements of the story seem the same just about everywhere.
One is the importance of our stuff -- Wright's "horrors" -- in making, and marking, our places. A novelist could tease entire lives from the contents of a bachelorette's bathroom, or from the boxed dowry items carefully set aside in an Indian farmer's living room, or even from the ghostly marks of furniture pressed into the carpet of an unoccupied house foreclosed on by the bank. Indeed, the emptiest rooms make the point most eloquently -- that, far from being inanimate or mute, our things breathe life into a room. Matter matters.
Particular as we like to think our places are, they seem to pass through predictable phases, not unlike our bodies, and on the walls of our rooms you can read the ages of man. Singles have a specific way of organizing the traffic jam of an apartment share, and the newlywed couple's tentative stabs at interior decoration will tend toward the generic, taking care not to insist on anything too distinctive just yet -- except, of course, images of the newlyweds themselves. Later on our places grow emphatic: think of the richly inhabited, overripe rooms of people who have lived in the same place for 50 years, or the brutally edited last quarters of elderly people who have had to decamp to nursing homes. To peer into such rooms is to realize that what we call "a sense of place" has very little to do with design or space, but is really a function of time.
It was House & Garden that eventually came to photograph our apartment, though in the end my mother wouldn't let them run the pictures. The magazine's stylist had insisted on hanging paintings on the walls and plopping a rented ficus tree on the coffee table in the living room. Machado himself was willing, but my mother refused to go along; if she wasn't going to let her children alter the room's composition, then she certainly wasn't about to let a magazine.
But over time, the press of life got the better of the design. After my grandfather died, my grandmother -- in her 90's and not well -- came to live with us. Machado's living room, where she spent her last afternoons, was gradually transformed by her nurse into a kind of hospital day room, with lots of mismatched chairs for her visitors and a big rented TV on casters. The summer of my freshman year in college, I lived in the apartment with a friend, and we put burns in the butcher block no amount of Bon Ami could erase, though I scoured them till my wrists ached. Books began to migrate more freely in and out of the living room, and new objects gradually infiltrated the Wall, until the whole thing had pretty much relaxed into an unphotogenic normalcy. By then my mother had relaxed, too, and now she'll smile when reminded of her graph-paper sketch.
But the final insult to the design was inflicted by my father, who one day got the bright idea of bringing home another pet store special -- this time a Maltese, a breed he reasoned would be better suited to life in a Manhattan co-op than a bulldog. But though Chauncey may have looked the part, he proved only slightly less awful than his predecessor. He was a macho little mop of a dog who left a white wake of fur and insisted daily on marking every right angle in the apartment, and it wasn't long before it became the sort of place where old Bink might have felt at home.
Looking at the apartment today, a quarter-century after the renovation, it doesn't feel very much like Machado's creation anymore. No, now it seems very much my family's creation, if that's the right word for something shaped by so little intention. The perfect picture has faded almost past recognition, but in its place there's this story -- of one marriage, four childhoods, now a bunch of grandchildren. The last time I was over I noticed that one of my sister's horse- show trophies had found its way onto the Wall, next to my ratty high-school copy of "The Catcher in the Rye." And though the apartment these days can sometimes feel like a museum of my teen years, with my father's original cast album of "The Me Nobody Knows" still on the turntable, one of my wife's paintings recently won a spot on the mantle in the living room, so it's not as though time has stopped here. Le Corbusier, whose own design strove so heroically to escape the press of time, nevertheless knew how it had to end. "Life," he said, "always has the last word."

HEADLINE: The Way We Live Now: 3-7-99 -- On Language;
Soonerathernlater

BYLINE: By William Safire

 BODY:
Whenever a President or other world leader uses a phrase in a highly charged situation, it echoes through the language. Sooner rather than later, it loses its referent and becomes a freestanding idiom; people use the familiar phrase out of voguish habit, forgetting the source that initially popularized it.
On Jan. 22, 1998, during a photo opportunity with a nonplused Yasir Arafat, President Clinton told reporters inquiring about nonforeign relations, "I'd like you to have more rather than less; sooner rather than later." 
 The phrase was repeated supportively by his press secretary, as well as by his former chief of staff, Leon Panetta: "There is going to be a time, and I think it has to be sooner rather than later, where the President has to say to the country what the situation is." As lawyerly counsel was taken and this policy was abandoned, the President's critics used the phrase to beat him about the head. "The President himself states," argued the independent counsel before the Supreme Court, "in January of this year, that the American people are entitled to more rather than less, sooner rather than later."
The phrase was quickly compressed in speech to soonerathernlater and spread far afield. Jane Brenner, a councilwoman from Punta Gorda, Fla., who is striving to save its 1927 courthouse from demolition, told The Sarasota Herald-Tribune, "We're hoping to get the courthouse worked out, and sooner rather than later." A securities analyst in Fort Washington, Pa., asked by Dow Jones about the public offering of Goldman, Sachs, used the phrase as an adjective: "anticipating the sooner-rather-than-later offering of its stock to go public."
The phrase is an outgrowth of sooner or later, the lexicographer Sol Steinmetz informs me. In 1577, Barnaby Googe wrote in his translation of the Dutch author Conrad Heresbach's "Heresbach's Foure Bookes of Husbandry" that "The stones, stickes, and suche baggage . . . are to be thrown out sooner or later." In 1933, J.M. Campbell, writing in Speculum, illustrated both root and branch: "But if efforts to overtake the meaning of a stubborn passage always include the Church Fathers sooner or later, then why not sooner than later?" The earliest citation I can find of S.R.T.L. is in an article from the journal published by the Royal Economic Society in June 1895. Referring to the "Boot War," W.B. Hoffman wrote: "The most we can expect is that repetition of the late disastrous war will not occur for some time to come, but even that hope may be shattered sooner rather than later."
This followed the action of settlers who rushed into Oklahoma before April 22, 1889, to be ready to stake their land claims before the official opening date, and became known as the "Sooners." (Those who followed were called, presumably, the Laters, but left no impact on the language. I put this in as a service to readers in Oklahoma who may not know the origin of their nickname.)
The etymological analogy holds for Mr. Clinton's "more rather than less": that's based on more or less, from 1589, give or take a few years. Give or take, however, in its 1958 sense of "approximate," has not spawned "give rather than take" because it was not used in a crisis of the Presidency.
In stretching out stock phrases resting on the fulcrum of or -- from one thing or another to here or there -- we must ask ourselves, Is this extension necessary? Does the redundancy detract from precision? Is S.R.T.L. any sooner than the unadorned soon? At the end of the day, are we slipping into the easy acceptance of a series of bromides as bad as at the end of the day?
Decide for yourself, one way rather than the other.
 
The New Globality
Globalization was last year's hot word at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Forget it; the world has passed it by. This year's theme was "Responsible Globality."
Coinage was attributed to Daniel Yergin, author of "The Commanding Heights" (appropriate reading in a ski village), who wrote in the May 18, 1998, Newsweek, "We are now beginning to see a reality beyond globalization -- the world of globality."
Reached in Boston, Yergin further explained the term: "What bothered me about globalization," he said, "was that it describes a process. We needed a word to carry it into a state of being. Globality suggests a condition of community and interconnection."
Few feelings are as exhilarating as the thrill of coinage. Some unknown diplomat involved in the normalization of relations smacked his forehead one day and cried, "I've got it -- we've reached normality!" Someday, a soldier denied fraternization with the local girls will long in print for fraternality, an uncoined word to shorten the equally sexist "brotherhood of Man."
Globality is not yet in the dictionaries, though it will be sooner rather than whenever. But sorry, Dan, coinage cannot be claimed; somebody almost always crops up to claim first use of a noun formed from a common adjective.
The correspondent Frank Gervasi wrote in 1943 of "a sense of the globality of the war." The Merriam-Webster files also turn up "even in 1942 a final obstacle to complete globality remained," in the 1942 "Global War," by Edgar Ansel Mowrer and Marthe Rajchman. Econometricians liked it, too: Kiyoshi Kuga observed in the July 1972 Econometrica that "the problem of globality is always important in this topic" of the factor-price equalization theorem, my copy of which does not come readily to hand.
But cheer up, Dan; aside from a 1988 use by an explicator of a papal encyclical (a holy ghostwriter?) and a few murmurings by Eurocrats, globality was awaiting a push. Yergin was the unchallenged popularizer in its current politico-business sense. Globalization, panting, has at last arrived; here we are in a state of doggy-dog globality.

HEADLINE: Chroniclers of Wayward Souls

BYLINE: By ANN POWERS 

 BODY:
COUNTRY has long been packaged as the classical music of simple American folks. The transformation of hillbilly entertainment into an official repository of our national traditions has extended from the fancy naming of the Grand Ole Opry in 1927 to the appointment of William Ivey, the director of the Country Music Hall of Fame, to the chair of the National Endowment for the Arts in 1998. Not only Nashville's music industry, but also the "alternative" country made by rock- and folk-schooled rebels can be discouragingly orthodox, its vintage trappings turning cultural preservation into historical tourism.
Yet country music is also grounded in dislocation -- in the stories of people facing upheaval in their home towns, their families, their daily life. This is a modern music, tied like the blues to the journeys of working people across America and the encroachment of the city on rural life. The poor wayfaring stranger is as much a honky-tonk cliche as Mama making cornbread, and as country's patina grows ever more nostalgic, even that character's vagrancy becomes strangely fixed. Exile has become another form of home in country, invoked with a warm glow. 
 Country music finds its power in the tension between nostalgia and the need for change, a contradiction mined on two new albums by established iconoclasts. "The Mountain," by Steve Earle with the Del McCoury Band, investigates country's most classical form, bluegrass. "What I Deserve," by Kelly Willis, is more eclectic. Both Mr. Earle and Ms. Willis succeed where many of their contemporaries fail by keeping their focus on restlessness.
"The Mountain" (E Squared, CD, CD 1063-2) is an art project in denim and work boots, a self-conscious effort by Mr. Earle to pay homage to the bluegrass pantheon if not enter it. "My primary motive in writing these songs was both selfish and ambitious -- immortality," he writes in the album's liner notes, and on some songs he has achieved an almost eerie timelessness. It's hard to believe that the murder ballad "Carrie Brown" or the funeral hymn "Pilgrim" hasn't been sung by anonymous town criers for a century, but it's also easy to forget that the plaintive form of "country jazz" that Mr. Earle is reproducing emerged a mere half century ago.
Working with the virtuoso ensemble the Del McCoury Band, Mr. Earle matches venerable themes of heartbreak and war, workingman's struggles and outlaw romance to his casually expert compositions. His patented rocker's snarl meshes with Del McCoury's unearthly wail to form a link across the generations of country renegades. The album's musicianship is notable; its guest roster features many of bluegrass's finest players plus the alternative-country stars Emmylou Harris, Gillian Welch and Iris DeMent. But Mr. Earle's songs make "The Mountain" more than a fine generic exercise as they trace a path of displacement throughout American history.
Mr. Earle has often chronicled the violence of modernization; his early forays into country-rock updated that theme with a Southernized Springsteen sound and a countercultural attitude. Like those early albums, "The Mountain" uses its musical focus to further a strong social agenda. Mr. Earle seeks a common voice grounded not in wistful memory but in thorny reality; his ramblers are the former high school football heroes, drug dealers, gas station attendants and homeless people of the New South. "The Mountain" finds counterparts for those characters in Civil War tales and corny love songs.
The album begins with "Texas Eagle," an ode to trains made unsentimental by its acknowledgment of the American rail system's economic woes. It moves through Irish immigration and the Depression's Dust Bowl before settling in heaven's waiting room with "Pilgrim." There is nothing but motion on "The Mountain," nothing but anxious progress. Mr. Earle drives this point home with the album's title track, in which the miner who declared his undying pride of place in "Harlan Man" finds his beloved mountain ravaged and himself devastated by the march of industrial capitalism. In Mr. Earle's ruthless vision, those who stand fast against cruel change can only hope for obsolescence. By setting his anthology of wandering to the lonesome tones of bluegrass, Mr. Earle disturbs the complacent aura that can sometimes overwhelm country classicism.
Kelly Willis challenges a different set of rules with "What I Deserve," her new album for the independent label Rykodisc (CD, RCD 10458). Ms. Willis made three albums for MCA Nashville in the early 1990's and had modest success, but she never fit into the industry machine. Living in Austin, Tex., she allied herself with the line of singer-songwriters that travels between country, folk, and rock.
Free to explore fully the place where those poles meet, Ms. Willis has emerged with a rich representation of the unsettled life. It begins, like so many in pop, with a bad love affair. "Take Me Down," written with Gary Louris of the Jayhawks, is a sweet swoon of co-dependency; the title track, also written with Mr. Louris, chronicles a more complicated crisis. Set to a loping beat knocked off-kilter by Chuck Prophet's phase-shifted guitar, "What I Deserve" is the confused lament of an ambitious woman. Refusing to take solace in prayer, the beauty of nature or any other old-fashioned balm, Ms. Willis lambastes herself for never slowing down and the world for suggesting that she should.
THIS particularly feminine, very current perspective on emotional ambivalence enriches "What I Deserve." Ms. Willis has a honey-lemon voice that can be as soothing as a lozenge, and it works that way on a lullabye like Paul Kelly's "Cradle of Love," but she mostly she uses it in the service of more wayward desires. She offers painful tales of lost love but then expresses the resolve to move on. Hovering between romantic fantasy and deflated realism, Ms. Willis taps a rare subtlety of feeling.
"What I Deserve" often returns to the subject of contentment, something Ms. Willis doesn't pretend to grasp fully. "If I ran so far that my life can't follow me, would it keep the world from up and swallowing me?" she sings in "Fading Fast"; with such a phrase, she makes the saga of the wayfaring stranger internal and completely contemporary. Like Mr. Earle, Ms. Willis knows that the itinerant world is no paradise, but she's not willing to pretend that there's any other place like home, even for a simple country girl.

HEADLINE: DANCE;
Nijinsky's Inner Choreography

BYLINE: By DANIEL GESMER 

 BODY:
VASLAV NIJINSKY, the world-renowned dancer and choreographer of the Ballets Russes, began a diary on the afternoon of Jan. 19, 1919. That evening he gave what would be his last public performance, a disturbing solo recital, "Marriage With God," at a hotel in St. Moritz, Switzerland, where he and his family had taken up wartime residence. For the next 45 days, sometimes all night, the 29-year-old Nijinsky wrote feverishly in four leather-bound school exercise books.
He stopped abruptly on March 4, when his wife, Romola, and her family, took him to Zurich to see the noted psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler. The verdict: schizophrenia, a diagnostic term Bleuler had recently coined. This doomed Nijinsky to a course of recurrent hospitalization and extreme therapies that continued until his death of renal failure on April 8, 1950, in London. 
 The journal has been published before, in an expurgated version edited by Romola in 1936. Now Farrar, Straus & Giroux has come out with a new, complete version, "The Diary of Vaslav Nijinsky," translated from the Russian by Kyril FitzLyon and edited by Joan Acocella, the dance critic of The New Yorker, who also wrote the introduction. This moving document, the original of which has been in the dance collection of the New York Public Library for the Peforming Arts since 1994 and had been circulated among private collectors and publishers since 1979, fully reveals Nijinsky's increasingly knotted inner world. It begs fresh interpretations of his life, artistry, ideas and psychological history.
Nijinsky's advancing mental disturbance and limited verbal skills obscure his expository methods and argument. Despite pervasive evidence of schizophrenia, a close reading suggests that the journal was meant to be a literary work, as experimental as his choreography. Further, his quasi-mystical philosophical ideas, though expressed in jumbled prose, did not emerge from a vacuum and are, in fact, intriguing.
Nijinsky's original journal -- a handwritten 381-page manuscript with virtually no margins -- reveals strikingly neat penmanship. The visual impression is of a man overflowing with a need to express himself. The content itself reveals a man consciously disciplined about writing unself-consciously. "I write without thinking," Nijinsky claims, and that was probably the literal truth. His definition of "thinking" was quite specific, but this writing technique went beyond his doctrinal preference for "feeling." "I don't care what my hand writes." Indeed, midway through the journal he explains a break: "I could not go on writing, because I started to think about my writing."
A doctor had recently given Nijinsky word-association tests, which may have encouraged him to treasure the raw output of his subconscious. He explains at intervals in the journal that he will not edit mistakes in grammar or spelling. He complains often of discomfort in his writing hand. Increasing manic excitement and the goal of publishing in Zurich, where he knew weeks in advance he would be taken to meet a famous "nerve specialist," helped fuel Nijinsky's marathon writing sessions. But part of his intent was simply to keep his pens and pencils in constant motion, faithfully recording his stream of consciousness no matter the cost to style, flow or intelligibility.
Here Nijinsky was in step with the avant-garde of his time; one thinks of James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, Gertrude Stein. This journaling technique is now commonplace among artists striving to override the intellect and plumb the unconscious. It would account for some of Nijinsky's meandering, self-contradiction and obsessive repetition, which otherwise embody the known pattern of schizophrenic writing.
Nijinsky also practiced automatic writing in his diary. To believers, this is a form of "channeling," whereby God or a disembodied entity writes through the hand of a person in a trance. Early on, Nijinsky addresses God: "I shall feel and You shall write. I am writing because You are writing. I shall stop when You stop." Later he adds, "I am a man in a trance . . . I can write in a trance . . . I am in a trance of God."
Nijinsky had long exposure to esoteric ideas. He was well-read and had frequent contact with educated, cultured people. Automatic writing, Ouija boards and trance channeling were trendy subjects. Madame Blavatsky and Rudolf Steiner were prominent figures, and Wassily Kandinsky's "On the Spiritual in Art" had entered European intellectual currents by 1912. Other avant-garde artists, like the Surrealist writer Andre Breton and the Dada painter Hans Arp, were experimenting with automatism.
Nijinsky's diary describes a seance he attended at a classmate's home during his school days. According to Romola, she and her husband experimented in St. Moritz with Ouija boards and "trance dancing." Nijinsky also tried automatic drawing "with remarkable success," Romola wrote. One of the Nijinskys' St. Moritz governesses shared her experiences of "fakirs and yogis" in India, prompting Nijinsky to study these subjects and correspond with the mystic Belgian Symbolist writer Maurice Maeterlinck, the author of "Pelleas et Melisande."
The famous psychic Eileen Garret, whom Romola frequently consulted in the 1930's, reportedly claimed to know Nijinsky well and called him "a perfect psychic subject." Though he rejected Eastern and Occult terminology, Nijinsky was a conscious, willing medium. "I know people who are saying that everything I write is a spiritualist trance. I would like everyone to be in such a trance," he writes. In fact, Nijinsky may have tried to devise a means for God to write through others as well. He intended to patent and market a new pen technology under the brand name "God." Though the pen was never described in the notebooks, the private Nijinsky family archives include drawings of it.
In other respects, Nijinsky's diary is confessional, an attempt to psychoanalyze himself. He confides his sexual history and emotionally charged episodes from his past. He shares his deep commitment to Tolstoyan ascetic precepts and preoccupation with bodily processes. He discusses the arts, politics and personal relationships, alternately with penetrating insight and astounding naivete. He tries to expose the selfish hypocrisies of the elite classes much as does the title character of his last major ballet, "Til Eulenspiegel." Finally, he reveals his growing inner conflicts, delusions and paranoid fears.
 The diary is also a scattershot discourse on Nijinsky's spiritual and philosophical views. He pleads for love, unity, happiness, environmental conservation, socialist economics and wise use of technology. Most important, he argues for the primacy of "feeling" in the universe, though with virtually no rhetorical organization. Lacking a well-developed vocabulary, he burdens a handful of simple terms with enormous weight.
At the top of Nijinsky's philosophical lexicon, "feeling" represents a quasi-mystical form of intuitive, empathic perception. It alone can lead humanity to enlightenment. In his metaphysics of feeling, other primary concepts orbit this central theme. Mental development or discernment is "reason" if grounded in feeling, "intelligence" if not. "Life" is any action, condition, individual or institution that embodies or promotes "feeling"; "death," the opposite. "God" is the Creator of Being, but also a synonym for "feeling," "reason" and "life." "Love," poetically, is "the feeling of God in men."
Nijinsky's emphasis on perceiving and knowing through feeling is typically Russian, typically Romantic and archetypally feminine. According to folk wisdom in "Mother" Russia, the insane have stopped feeling and begun thinking too much. The Russian authors Nijinsky studied, and his collaboration with the pantheistic philosopher-painter Nicolas Roerich on "Le Sacre du Printemps," anchored Russian lore in his mind. The Romantic tradition he inherited and enacted with genius sank deep roots in his psyche.
Nijinsky's philosophy of "feeling" is inappropriate in realms like science, but he was a creative artist. Labeling his system of thought pathological, as his wife and doctors did, is arguably sexist, patriarchal and ignorantly dismissive of Russian folkways and Nijinsky's artistic inheritance.
Another facet of Nijinsky's diary too easily labeled pathological is his frequent self-equation with God and Christ. His doctors, and most subsequent psychological writers, read this as megalomania, an inferiority complex or a desperate attempt to deny the onset of madness.
Although certain passages are self-aggrandizing, for Nijinsky sympathy literally bred identity. As a corollary of his profound faith in the power of feeling, to love (or love like) God or Christ meant in his mind to actually be God or Christ. He writes: "I want to love everybody, and therefore I am God . . . I know many people will say that Nijinsky pretends to be Christ. I do not pretend, because I love his actions." In fact, "feeling" alone sufficed to establish divine union: "I am God if I feel." Despite his verbal limitations and advancing illness, Nijinsky tried to assert the divine unity of all Being through feeling.
The diary records what Nijinsky sincerely experienced as a mystical awakening, real or delusional. This was marked by feelings of universal love (which he literally shouted from the hilltops), a sense of unity with all Creation and experiences of precognition and omniscience. The world became animated, with trees literally speaking to him.
Perhaps the Western psychiatric paradigm is not yet adequate to fully explain his disintegration.
 
'I Was Not Mad, Because I Felt'
Here is an excerpt from "The Diary of Vaslav Nijinsky, Unexpurgated Edition," published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux.
ONE day I was in the mountains and got onto a road that led up to a mountain. I went along it and stopped. I wanted to speak on the mountain because I felt the desire to do so. I did not speak, because I thought that everyone would say that this man was mad. I was not mad, because I felt. I felt not pain, but love for people. I wanted to jump from the mountain into the little town of St. Moritz. I did not shout, because I felt that I had to go farther. I went farther and saw a tree. The tree said to me that one could not speak here, because men did not understand feeling. I went farther. I was sorry to part with the tree, because it understood me. I went on. I went up to a height of 2,000 meters. I stood for a long time. I felt a voice and shouted in French, "Parole." I wanted to speak, but my voice was so strong that I could not speak, and I shouted, "I love everyone, and I want happiness!" "I love everyone." "I want everyone." I cannot speak French, but I will learn it if I walk by myself. I want to speak loudly so that people will feel me. I want to love everyone and therefore want to speak all languages. I cannot speak all languages, and therefore I write, and my writing will be translated. I will speak French as best as I can.

HEADLINE: FILM;
The Millennium In Perspective, Without Hoopla

BYLINE: By KAREN DURBIN; Karen Durbin is the film critic for Mirabella magazine. Her most recent article for the Arts and Leisure section was about Liv Ullmann and Ingmar Bergman.

 BODY:
IT'S Dec. 31, 1999. Jesus arrives in New York with his assistant Magdalena on his arm and a vexing question on his mind: should he start the Apocalypse or not?
In Paris, a travel agent invites his closest friends to escape the millennial hoopla by retreating to a primitive island paradise off the French coast, only to discover that, freed from the demands of his busy urban life, he becomes someone he can't stand. 
 The inhabitants of a serenely beautiful red-clay village in Mali pass the time visiting, doing chores, listening to the radio and trying to call distant relatives from the post office telephone. Desperately poor, they live with the kind of unself-conscious simplicity that the Parisian travel agent seeks.
These are story lines from "2000 Seen By," a series of roughly hour-long millennial films from seven countries that opens in New York on Friday at the Cinema Village for the first leg of a tour around the country. The three films described are, respectively, by the American director Hal Hartley, the French filmmaker Laurent Cantet and the Mauritanian-born Abderrahmane Sissako, whose family lives in Mali.
The series also includes a smartly silly screwball comedy from Spain's Miguel Albaladejo; a tale of star-crossed Hungarian lovers by Ildiko Enyedi (the only woman filmmaker in the group); a darkly comic dystopia by the Taiwanese director Tsai Ming liang set in a crumbling, rain-soaked housing project whose inhabitants fall prey to a mysterious plague, and a politically pointed fable by Alain Berliner in which Belgium marks the millennium with a vicious civil war between its two main ethnic groups, the Flemish and the Walloons.
Portmanteau film projects tend to be traps for second-rate work, but this collection is an exception to the dismal rule. Mr. Ming liang's " Hole" and Mr. Sissako's "Life on Earth" are the standouts in the series, but even the least successful films are far from duds. If Mr. Hartley's jazzy-looking "Book of Life" is more than a tad literal-minded, things pick up whenever Martin Donovan's grumpy Jesus appears on screen in a Brooks Brothers suit with the singer P. J. Harvey as his punk Magdalene. Similarly, the terminal romanticism of Ms. Enyedi's "Tamas et Juli" is redeemed by a bluntly graphic sex scene lighted and staged with such startling originality that it remains etched in one's mind long after the rest of the film has faded into one of the picturesque mists that the director favors.
"2000 Seen By" is the brainchild of Carole Scotta and Caroline Benjo, two young partners in Haut et Court, a French production and distribution company specializing in independent cinema. The women struck a deal with Arte, the European cultural television channel, which provided seed money in exchange for broadcast rights. To insure the project's global scope, they solicited proposals from an international roster of directors and selected 10 for production. (The Brazilian, Canadian and German films broke away from the series and are being released individually.) The only full-length feature that remains is "The Hole," at 89 minutes, with the other six films running 60 to 70 minutes.
Like all but the best short stories, movies of less than feature length can feel like minor work. But the brevity of these films turns out to have unexpected virtues. With "The First Night of My Life," for example, Miguel Albaladejo manages to pack eight vivid characters, an ingeniously complicated plot, stylish visuals and deft social commentary into little more than an hour. At a time when American films have fallen prey to a mystifying case of bloat, such artistic economy is both a tonic and a reproach.
Of course, the specter of another sort of bloat is invoked simply by the occasion. Fox Lorber, the series' United States distributor, is releasing these films now, says Wendy Lidell, a company vice president, because "I want to be ahead of the curve."
"There's going to be so much of this millennium branding, so much stuff coming out, I don't know when interest will peak," Ms. Lidell says.
Indeed. The approach of the last millennium triggered mass panic and the threat of hysterical violence. Today, Y2K glitches aside, the worst danger we're likely to face is hysterical boredom. The most overanticipated New Year's Eve in 1,000 years is threatening to roll in on a tidal wave of conspicuous consumption and commercial tie-ins. The T-shirts alone may bury us all.
As a subject for a movie, the millennium arrives pre-bloated, at once too grand and too trivial. On one hand, it seems to demand work that not only predicts the future but survives it. On the other, people can't even agree on when it begins (mathematically, with the first nanosecond of 2001, but viscerally, a year earlier, when all those nines turn into zeroes). Like all attempts to fix time, to pin it down and make it stop, "the millennium" is an artificial construct, fragile and doomed to deflate. Once the last horn is tooted, what remains but the novelty of writing the date with odd-looking numbers?
Most of "2000 Seen By's" directors solved this problem with their own deflationary tactics, treating the subject obliquely and with humor. "The concept of the year 2000 was really a pretext to gather filmmakers together whom we believed in," Carole Scotta says. "When they submitted their synopses, we were happy to see that they dealt with the subject in very personal ways." By far the most personal film is Mr. Sissako's "Life on Earth." Ms. Scotta describes the way he worked. "Abderrahmane convinced Arte to let him go to his father's village with an idea but no script. He stayed for two weeks, taking notes. Then, still with no script, he went back with a four-person crew. The actress in the film wasn't planned; this beautiful woman on her bike passed in front of his camera, and he decided to make her a central character. Abderrahmane really conceived this film in the editing."
The result is a movie of such uncommon delicacy and melancholy grace it looks like the result of months of careful planning. Deploying a soundtrack that moves seamlessly from a Schubert quintet to the artful tenor of the great Malian singer Salif Keita, Mr. Sissako weaves his day-in-the-life footage into a compelling lament for a beloved country impoverished by colonialism and stranded in time. The village is African, but French is the only language anyone speaks: the eloquent French of the anticolonialist Martinique writer Aime Cesaire ("Do not be a sterile spectator/ A screaming man is not a dancing bear") being read aloud on the local radio station, and, finally, the millennial broadcast from Paris, babbling inanely about the Eiffel Tower as the symbol "of our entry into the 21st century." The villagers, who have all they can do to maintain a shaky foothold in the 20th, listen carefully, and then pick up their chairs and go home.

 BODY:
It takes more than hammers and nails to turn a boarded-up city building into a home or office. It also takes a knowledge of the rules and a familiarity with programs that can provide aid. The state Department of Community Affairs has published a brochure called the Urban Tool Kit aimed at individuals, community groups or city officials considering urban renewal projects. For example, the brochure points out that last year New Jersey instituted what it says is the first building code in the country written just for older structures gives a phone number for more information. The brochure also includes information on getting low-interest mortgages or seed money, on tapping loans for demolishing dangerous buildings, and on programs for revitalizing downtowns and for returning vacant property to productive use. The overall idea is to encourage local people, rather than the state, to take the initiative in renewal. The Urban Tool Kit will be sent free to those who write to the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs, Office of Commmunications and Policy, 101 South Broad Street, Post Office Box 800, Trenton, N.J. 08625-0800, or call (609) 292-6055.

HEADLINE: Those Who Retire to Work or Volunteer

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
EVERY morning, Abraham Landau commutes from White Plains on the 8:26 train to his job as sales manager for Performing Arts magazine in the Graybar Building over Grand Central Terminal. His days are so busy, he sometimes has to rush to make the 4:47 home.
"It's an exciting job, a lot of fun," Mr. Landau said. "I look forward to going to the office. In the 18 months I've been there I've never been late or taken a sick day." 
 Although advertising may be thought of as a youth-oriented profession, Mr. Landau does not fit the profile. "I'm 78, a three-time great-grandfather," he said, "and had been retired six years from a career in advertising and marketing, which included 16 years with Playbill magazine, when I got a job offer I couldn't resist." He had also been an adjunct professor of selling and marketing at the School of Continuing Education at New York University. "Before I went back to work full time, I was active in R.S.V.P., the Retired Senior Volunteer Program, in White Plains, working as a mentor and consultant. "
Mr. Landau is among a growing number of older retired workers who are being drawn back into the work force as the pool of young job seekers drops. Companies are pursuing older potential employees, said Judith Whitted, program specialist in the County Office for the Aging.
The latest county unemployment figures of 2.8 percent, as of mid-January this year are even lower than the 3.4 percent of the preceding year, Ms. Whitted said. "The lowest unemployment figures in history make this the best time ever for mature people to find work," she said. "Right now, we have more requests for qualified older workers than we can fill from companies ranging from mid-size medical and educational organizations up to I.B.M."
Charles Pintchman of Pleasantville has had not one but three jobs since he retired in 1985 as deputy director of corporate affairs at Reader's Digest in Pleasantville.
"It was the first voluntary early retirement program at the Digest," he said. "Yet at 55 I felt I still wanted to work, so for several years I taught the learning disabled, first at a private school in Rye Neck, then at Boces until three years ago, when I retired again, this time to become a full-time volunteer at Blythedale Children's Hospital and School in Valhalla."
When he was offered a full-time job as a substitute teacher at Blythedale, he promptly took it. He did so, he said, because "self-esteem plays a part and so is the feeling of accomplishment that comes with the job, which in my case is teaching disabled kids who range in age from 8 to 13."
Mr. Pintchman also likes the discipline imposed by the job. "As a volunteer, I called the shots," he said. "Now I go where they tell me, and I kind of welcome that. Also on the plus side is the contrast between working and not working. Things like sleeping late and vacations become a real treat again."
Making older workers eligible for a variety of jobs is encouraged by training they receive under the Job Training Partnership Act, Ms. Whitted said. .
"Many are entry-level positions in offices, but we have also placed people in bookkeeping and computer slots," she said. "Employers rave about the job performance of seniors. They are dedicated, have good work habits, they show up on time, and they are very good role models for younger employees."
Toni Wirth, head of the human resource council of the Westchester Chamber of Commerce in White Plains , said: "This past year, we've had a high volume of calls from companies across the board looking for older employees. Banks, in particular, want people with clerical skills."
Businesses are also wooing people 55 or older who are volunteers for nonprofit agencies, said Phyllis Hersh, programming coordinator for the Retired Senior Volunteer Program. "Some of our volunteers, chiefly those with financial backgrounds regardless of their age, have been recruited for paying jobs," she said.
Ruth Ahern, director of the Retired Senior Volunteer Program, cited the County Planning Department's estimate for 1997. "There are 214,467 people who are 55 years and older in Westchester County," she said.
Karen King-Parke, director of the Senior Personnel Employment Council office in White Plains, which helps people 50 and older to find a job, said there were "considerably more jobs now open to seniors, especially in smaller companies and not-for-profit organizations."
Yet mature workers must have updated skills, Ms. King-Parke emphasized. "For a $10 registration fee," she said, "we not only help seniors prepare their resumes but we also link them up with free or reduced-fee computer training courses they need to do office work. And we make our fax and computers in the office available to them."
But given the shortage of workers, Ms. King-Parke said companies should be more flexible in their requirements, if they want to fill jobs. "When it comes to job sharing and flexible work hours, most companies are inflexible, even though we have qualified seniors who want to work four to six hours a day," she said. "This is true especially in the winter when days are short and many prefer not to drive home in the dark."
Another age group, 50 to 65, would also like to work part time to be eligible for reduced health insurance under company plans. Ms. King-Parke said, "They are willing to pay for it themselves."
Getting jobs for people in their 70's and 80's is not unusual, either, Ms. King-Parke said. "We place some as companions for other seniors," she said. "But many have jobs in industry,"
Richard Hobby is one of them. Mr. Hobby, 72, said he has always worked and does not plan to retire. "I've seen what has happened to friends of mine who have retired," he said. "They lose interest in everything. I work 40 hours a week and enjoy it. My last three jobs have come through Senior Personnel. The one I have now is doing clerical work at Mobile, the AT&T wireless company in Mount Vernon. And what makes it really good is that it's close to my home."
Should you expect to find the over-50 crowd flipping hamburgers at McDonald's? Maybe, said Peter Samaha, president of Alps Management in Armonk, which owns 12 McDonald's restaurants, employing 500 people in Westchester and the Bronx.
"We love seniors," Mr. Samaha said. "They fill a variety of jobs. Some have been with us for years; others are new hires. We offer them training and flexible work hours, either day or night."
Mr. Samaha gives older workers very high marks.He said: "They are very reliable, great workers, good with customers. And they rarely miss a day of work."

Hartford's Bushnell Theater Growing by a Third

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

DATELINE: HARTFORD

 BODY:
THE BUSHNELL in downtown Hartford will break ground this spring on an 88,000-square-foot, $30 million addition that will give the 69-year-old, 2,800-seat theater a 950-seat modern auditorium for smaller productions.
"But this is also about economic development and activity in the downtown," said Douglas C. Evans, the Bushnell's executive director. "Phantom of the Opera," he said, brought 135,000 people to the Bushnell's Great Hall from August to October 1995, a record, and grossed $6.7 million. But the impact on the community, for everything from apartments for the cast to meals for theatergoers, was estimated at more than twice that. 
 "The arts community has been slow to embrace that concept, that philosophy, that arts is a driver of the economy," Mr. Evans said. "When we first started discussing it, it was taboo. The economic aspect was considered dirty. But one of my platforms since the day I arrived has been that arts are good for the economy, good for the community."
H. Scott Phelps, president of the Greater Hartford Convention and Visitors Bureau, agrees.
"When you're promoting Hartford as a convention destination, you're not just selling the convention space," he said. "People want to get out and see and do things , and having something like the Bushnell in the downtown is critical."
Arnold C. Greenberg, president of the Bushnell's board of directors, said a fund-raising campaign had set a goal of $45 million, not only to cover the costs of construction but to establish a larger endowment for the expanded theater. The campaign is halfway to its goal, including a $1.25-million gift from a trustee, Anthony D. Autorino, and a $4-million gift from Maxwell M. Belding, a trustee emeritus, and his wife, Ruth R. Belding, of Old Lyme.
"The economic climate now is much healthier than the early 1990's, and I think the vision now is much more compelling," Mr. Greenberg said. "There's an appreciation of what this will do not only for local arts and community groups, but to bolster the economic revitalization of Hartford."
Within the next decade, the city expects a total of more than $1 billion in new construction downtown, including Adriaen's Landing, the $374-million stadium for the New England Patriots; a convention center; a community technical college and 1,000 units of housing, according to figures from the state's Department of Economic and Community Development.
Bushnell's new theater will rise on an employee parking lot at Capital Avenue and Trinity Street to the east of the existing hall.
Glass walls at the front of the addition will enclose a three-story Grand Stair Hall, featuring a curved stairway, as well as a cafe, gift shop and concierge office on the ground floor.
The second floor will be for intermission space or cabaret-style performances. A luxury suite will provide a setting for corporate functions.
"Since we're only increasing the capacity by about one-third, we don't expect the net effect to be that great," said David A. Dalena, the Bushnell spokesman. "Obviously, we'll have to make some changes operationally, such as staggered starting times for the performances, but that is all part of the planning process."
In addition to angling the addition away from the main hall, the site slopes slightly down to the east, which further decreases the impact of the new building on the old, said William D. Clegg Jr., an architect with Schoenhardt Associates in Simsbury, which is working with Wilson Butler Lodge of Boston on the plans.
THERE were some thoughts about enclosing the old building's east portico in glass, but it's an important part of the building and we felt the best way to preserve it was to leave it open," Mr. Clegg said. "It was tough, and it was tight, but it came together."
Mr. Clegg, who specializes in historic preservation, said that the Bushnell was close to his heart. In the late 20's, his wife's grandfather, Howard Christian Peter, assumed the duties of head carpenter on the Bushnell construction on the death of his father-in-law, Ludwig Miller. Mr. Clegg's mother-in-law, Verna Carlson of Bristol, still has pictures of the construction.
"This is not just a project for me, it's a part of my heritage," Mr. Clegg said. "When I found out we had the job, I called my wife and told her to go buy a dozen roses and we went over to tell her mother. As I gave her the flowers I said, 'The heritage continues.' I look forward to taking her to the first show."
The Bushnell project, which has a $10 million grant from the state and $2.5-million from the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, is currently being reviewed by the Connecticut Historical Commission.
"It's a very significant structure," said Susan R. Chandler, a staff historical architect with the commission. "It's a cultural landmark as well as a historical landmark. It's one of the most important stand-alone historical resources in the downtown."
Although she has not completed her review, she noted that the designers of the addition had taken an innovative approach, angling it away from the main hall so the east face of the building, with its blend of Georgian-style columns and Art Deco exterior, would still be visible from the street.
Since Mr. Evans arrived to head the Bushnell in 1990, it has strengthened considerably. When he arrived, about 180,000 tickets were being sold each year. This year, it expects to sell 400,000 to 500,000 tickets, thanks to some of the lavish Broadway productions he has attracted to Hartford. Large Broadway shows currently take up 25 percent of the theater's schedule, but account for 90 percent of the revenues.
But the growth also meant a tightening of availability for shows by the Bushnell's tenant organizations -- the Hartford Ballet, Hartford Symphony Orchestra, Connecticut Opera Association, and Chamber Music Plus.
"The addition of the second hall means there's more flexibility in getting dates, and there are a number of ballet shows that we would rather do in a more intimate setting, that sort of cry out for a smaller hall," said Trevor A. Cushman, president of the Hartford Ballet. "So on both counts, we're looking forward to it."
In a normal season the ballet might do four shows, two full-length and two triple-bills, or repertory shows. The repertory shows might sell 800 seats, or fewer, on a slow night, which means almost one out of four seats in the Great Hall would be vacant -- not the message an arts organization wants to send.
"The Hartford Symphony is always squeezed for time in the big hall, and if our vacating some slots in the big hall gives them more time to get in there, we're all for it," Mr. Cushman said. "And in Bushnell II, as we're calling it, there's going to be better seats for our purposes. They're going to be closer to the stage, so everyone is going to be better served."

CECIL BRIDGEWATER was insistent. "I don't care if you don't play the right notes," he told the nine young musicians seated in front of him at Roosevelt Junior-Senior High School. "But you've got to get the right rhythm. Put those instruments in your lap, and let's clap."
Patiently, Mr. Bridgewater, the veteran jazz trumpeter, led the youngsters in sustained rounds of clapping to improve their rendition of a blues scale he had given them the previous week to practice. It was his third meeting with members of the school's jazz band during an eight-week residency sponsored by Friends of the Arts. Clearly, he was still in the preliminary stages of honing the skills -- and interests -- of teen-agers brought up mainly on rap and rhythm-and-blues. 
 Mr. Bridgewater's residency here is just part of a quiet, little-heralded revolution under way in schools all over Long Island: the coming of age of arts-in-education programs.
These programs can be as simple as inviting a calligrapher to teach students "art with a pen" or as complex as investing an entire year in creating ways of using the arts to teach academic subjects like mathematics, science, social studies and language arts. On the Island, the programs will cost $5 million this year, ranging from $100 for a single classroom visit by an artist to $170,000 a year in a four-year pilot project to devise an integrated curriculum.
The money comes from school districts, parent-teacher associations, local arts groups, foundations, and Federal and state agencies. These include the National Endowment for the Arts and the New York State Council on the Arts, which has made 300 grants totaling $2.6 million this year to arts-in-education providers throughout the state. Since 1985, the council has spent nearly $30 million to bring the arts into the schools.
Along with regular classroom instruction in the arts, these programs have traditionally been the first eliminated as frills when budgets are reduced. After substantial cuts when state aid diminished in the late 1980's and early 90's, arts classes have stabilized and even increased on the Island, administrators say.
"Even high school electives seem to be coming back," said Kevin McGuire, superintendent of the Half Hollow Hills School District and president of the Suffolk County Council of School Superintendents.
Salvatore Randazzo, director of art and music in the East Islip School District, said: "When I came here three years ago, we had 16 music teachers and 11 art teachers, which was already up from the late 80's when the staff was reduced by about 6 positions. Now, we're up to 18 music teachers and 12 art teachers, and I sense that this is the case elsewhere."
No arts courses were eliminated during the budget crunch in Wantagh, but "a marvelous arts-in-education program that we had, a 'poet in the school' who for years came and worked with the kids and cost only $5,000, was cut," said George Besculides, the school superintendent and head of the Nassau County Council of School Superintendents.
Like Wantagh, which has budgeted about $20,000 for arts-in-education this year -- up $2,500 from last year -- other districts have experienced a similar growth. "When we bring these cultural programs into the district, we motivate the kids and the community," Mr. Randazzo said. "They're a shot in the arm and help our regular programs build." His district will spend $21,000 on arts-in-education this year.
In Roosevelt, which has budgeted $10,000 for arts-in-education this year, the Friends of the Arts project, underwritten entirely by the Bell Atlantic Foundation, has struck a responsive chord.
"Me and jazz were so-so," said Shantell Cameron, a 12th-grade saxophonist and clarinetist. "I was never really interested in it before. But you know, I'm learning to like it and play it." She hopes to study performance and music education at Ithaca College. Now, jazz is "turning out just as beautiful as classical music and what I play in band," she said. "And some of my friends wish they could do what I'm doing. Get into it, not just get it."
The rhythm tentatively absorbed, Mr. Bridgewater -- a musician, composer and arranger who has appeared with the Max Roach Quartet, the Thad Jones-Mel Lewis Jazz Orchestra and the Horace Silver Quintet -- turned, with quiet humor and dogged perseverance, to translating the sounds into something resembling music. In addition to coaching and cajoling, he filled the session with asides about jazz's history and relationship to the music the students know best ("99 percent of what you hear today, including rap, is based on the blues") and biographical snippets about Sonny Rollins, whose "Tenor Madness" they were about to play.
"Can't we play it faster?" a trumpeter asked.
"Tuning up first would have been a good idea," Mr. Bridgewater replied.
"Your ears are your most important instrument," he continued. "It's kind of like eating things. You bite in, expecting something sweet, but you get something terrible, something that makes you twitch."
Although at various levels of musicianship, all the youngsters paid rapt attention to what Mr. Bridgewater was saying and doing. After all, they were motivated enough to have volunteered for this after-school program, which meant they had to juggle transportation schedules and chores like baby-sitting for siblings. Some ignored class pictures to get to jazz band on time.
The band teacher, Thomas Vojcik, was another attentive participant, listening carefully and even playing in the saxophone section. "I know jazz, but I'm getting a broader knowledge from Cecil," he said. "I'm learning different ways of doing different things. He's giving me more stuff to work with. And the kids are getting more out of it. I mean, coming from someone else -- someone like Cecil, who is a full-time musician -- it means more than if it was coming just from me."
By the end of the session, all involved had gotten what they wanted out of the 90 minutes. Curtis Golding, a drummer in the 11th grade, had picked up pointers on his technique. Shakema Appleton, an eighth-grade saxophonist, had learned "how to listen and know that I'm in tune." And William Turcios, a ninth-grade saxophonist, had accepted the fact that sharpening his prowess "was done step by step, without trying for perfection right now."
The youngsters will test their achievements on March 19 when, at the end of the residency, the jazz band performs at the school with Justin DiCioccio and His Ensemble, a Manhattan-based professional quintet that has been appearing in districts throughout the Island in Friends of the Arts' Jazz-Link program.
Dr. Regina Cohn, assistant superintendent in the Roosevelt school district, came away convinced that her decision to participate in the Friends of the Arts program was right. "If we can affect the lives of 15 kids, then we've made an impact," she said. "They won't necessarily all become musicians, but just their contact with someone who lives and breathes music is important."
As for Mr. Bridgewater, "seeing them respond, sparking something in them, is the greatest joy that I find in the work I do in the schools," he said. "Sure, I like it when the kids become more literate musically and learn to appreciate jazz. But the music also helps them gain confidence in their ability to do other things, and when you feel confident, you can go farther."
 
THE REASONS
Learning by Doing, And Not Just the Arts
Raising self-esteem is just one goal of arts-in-education, an umbrella term that covers anything beyond classroom instruction. The instruction itself varies from district to district because the state requires only one semester each of art and music through eighth grade and another year in high school. Membership in a band or chorus meets that requirement.
The current spurt of growth in both arts-in-education and arts courses can be attributed, Dr. Besculides said, to "the healthy economy" and, to the fact "that increasingly, educators and parents are realizing that the arts are as vital as any other instructional program and can't be eliminated is you want to produce a well-rounded person."
To support their advocacy of more arts instruction, proponents point to studies that suggest the arts play a pivotal role in the learning process. These studies show that "arts help develop creativity and critical thinking," said Marc Summer, who runs the arts-in-education program in the Freeport schools. "And artists themselves are marvelous role models because they're so passionate about what they do."
A study of 1995 S.A.T. scores, for example, revealed that students who had taken four years of arts classes in high school scored much higher in both verbal and math tests than those who had taken few or none.
"Different students learn in different ways, and the arts help kids learn other disciplines," said Dr. David Meoli, the coordinator in Port Washington.
Arts-in-education programs have been around for more than a decade. At first, they were essentially treats -- assemblies, perhaps -- that entertained students but had minimal or peripheral educational content.
But two things happened that increased both the need for and the availability of this type of programming. Cultural organizations began realizing that their audiences were "graying out," and that they needed ways to develop new audiences. And parents became more sophisticated in demanding arts exposure for their children but, in many cases, were less able to provide them directly because there were so many two-career families.
"It's a long-range approach, but yes, you could consider our programs audience development," conceded Amy Wynn, who heads the outreach program at Tilles Center in Brookville. "But they're also a way of contributing to the community and its quality of life." In its seventh year, with a budget of $180,000, the Tilles program will bring in more than 6,000 youngsters from 70 schools for six performances and hold teacher and student workshops based on them.
 
THE PARTICIPANTS
On and Off the Island, Plenty of Willing Hands
Like Tilles, other major Long Island performance groups, presenters, museums and individual artists are heavily involved in arts-in-education. They join New York City organizations involved on the Island, including American Ballet Theater, the Metropolitan Opera and the Brooklyn Philharmonic, and even the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington.
In addition to the residency pilot program in Roosevelt and another trial 10-week residency, Hands-On Shakespeare, with sixth graders in the Herricks school district, Friends of the Arts' Jazz-Link brings performances and workshops to eight schools for about $100,000. The Long Island Philharmonic, too, has an extensive program that will spend $250,000 this year to take more than 12,000 students from 88 districts to youth concerts and send professional musicians to schools.
Last June alone, Suffolk County schools were involved in 176 arts-in-education programs, ranging from a session of gravestone rubbing to a lesson on "Science in the Kitchen" to a performance by clowns.
"When I took this job 14 years ago, we served 23 school districts that spent $200,000 on programming," said Lynette Bianchi, who directs arts-in-education for the two Suffolk Boards of Cooperative Education. "This year, we're handling at least $2.7 million and working with 67 of the county's 70 districts."
The Nassau board this year is serving 52 of the county's 56 districts, which are spending just under $2 million. Throughout the state, Boards of Cooperative Education screen and assess arts providers and help the districts contract them. If they work through the boards, the schools are eligible for reimbursement from the state. On Long Island, the return could be as little as 36 percent of the cost for wealthy districts or as high as the average of 60 percent for those with more limited funds.
Suffolk and Nassau lead the state in arts-in-education spending through the boards. The seven Long Island school districts that are not availing themselves of the services this year -- Kings Park, New Suffolk, Southold, Malverne, Elmont, Garden City and East Rockaway -- are not necessarily ignoring arts-in-education; East Rockaway and Southold, for example, are relying on parent-teacher associations for programs or making their own arrangements. Some districts just prefer not to pay the boards' fees for their services, 16 percent of the program's cost in Suffolk and 17.5 percent in Nassau.
 
THE GOALS
The State Sets Standards, Then Offers Help
The current spurt of growth in arts-in-education can be attributed, in part, to the "Learning Standards for the Arts" adopted by the state Department of Education in 1996. These four standards establish criteria for "creating, performing and participating in the arts," "knowing and using arts materials and resources," "responding to and analyzing works of art" and "understanding the cultural contributions of the arts."
Statewide assessments, through tests, of how students are meeting these standards are being developed, said Roger Hyndman, an associate in arts curricula and instruction in the Department of Education. "And we anticipate that the entering ninth-grade class in 2001 will sit for those assessments in the spring of 2002."
Paradoxically, similar standards adopted for academic areas threaten those very goals for the arts. The Board of Regents' decision to require students to pass Regents' examinations to graduate alarms some arts advocates.
"Will there be time for the arts when additional attention might have to be paid to prepare youngsters for the Regents?" asked Dr. C. Jeremy Sykes, who supervises arts-in-education for the Nassau board. "Or will this very important part of growing up as a human being disappear?"
To protect their turf by helping students meet the standards, arts-in-education providers are rushing to incorporate them into arts experiences. In the most extensive attempt to prepare students for the arts standards and keep the arts in the schools, the state Council on the Arts and the Education Department have joined forces to create the Empire State Partnerships Project.
"We are putting significant money into this project in order to go deeper, expand the role of the arts," said Nicki Clarke, executive director of the State Arts Council.
The Empire State Partnerships initiative is a way of seeing that the arts, "which are still not a priority," survive in an atmosphere that is fueled by "pressures on the core areas of learning," said Elissa Kane, executive director of the New York State Alliance for Arts Education. Her agency is helping the state Education Department run weeklong summer professional development course for teachers in the partnership.
To apply for a grant, an arts group joins with a partner school to come up with a project that promises to meet the goals. The State Arts council puts up 50 percent of the the money, requiring the school to provide 35 percent of the total cost and the arts group to come up with 15 percent.
After an initial grant of $10,000 for planning and pilot projects, the council will provide up to $100,000 a year for three years. This year, the council has allocated $3.5 million for 57 projects throughout the state. The state education department pays for the teacher training.
On Long Island, Circle of Dance, a Huntington-based modern-dance company that has been involved in Arts-in-Education since 1982, joined the East Meadow and Westbury districts to become the first local recipient, with the goal of integrating dance into the core curriculum. Now in its third year, the project received $85,000 from the council this year.
Two new local partnerships received initial financing this year. Long Island Traditions, a folk-heritage organization based in Port Washington, is working with the Freeport schools to create a multicultural, multi-ethnic curriculum, and the Port Washington schools are joining American Ballet Theater, the Martha Graham Dance Company, the Nassau County Museum of Art and Meet the Composer to devise a new, arts-fueled approach to teaching the academic basics.
The success of these and other partnership projects could have a far-reaching impact throughout the United States, proponents say. The new curricula could revolutionize what and how all children learn, said Ms. Kane of the Alliance for Arts Education.
And "this would happen just in time," she pointed out, "for jobs in the next millennium will require people to think creatively and use visual images -- traits that the arts help develop."

As Caldor Fades, Retail Market Is Unfazed

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE

 BODY:
WHEN Caldor, the discount-store chain, announced in January that it was closing its 145 stores, including 28 in New Jersey, William A. Farber was struck by a sense of deja vu.
Mr. Farber is chief operating officer at Levin Management Corporation of North Plainfield, which owns and manages 66 shopping centers, 45 of them, totaling nearly 4 million square feet, in New Jersey. 
 Over the years Levin worked through the bankruptcies of W.T. Grant and E.J. Korvettes. Now it is faced with the same situation because Caldor anchors five of the company's centers, having replaced Korvettes in the 80's. The centers are in Paramus, West Orange, Woodbridge, Watchung and North Brunswick.
The future of the stores in those centers will signal what impact, if any, Caldor's bankruptcy will have on the state's retail market, and on landlords like Levin. Two of its stores -- one on Route 4 West in Paramus, the other on Route 22 in Watchung -- are already spoken for by Kohl's, a discount department store chain based in Menomonee Falls, Wis., which is looking to build its presence in the New York metropolitan area. If the leases of the other three stores are not taken over by other retailers, Mr. Farber said the space would be reconfigured for new users.
"We're starting with a sound retail market and good real estate locations, where land for new construction is scarce, so even though one retailer couldn't make it, another one will," he said.
Most retail analysts and brokers said Caldor's bankruptcy was not expected to have a harsh impact on the overall market, and might come and go without incident, much like the closing last year of the Rickel stores, said Matthew J. Schnurr, senior vice president of the investment services group at the West Orange office of Grubb & Ellis, the national commercial brokerage.
Many of the home-improvement chain's 53 stores, 40 of them in New Jersey, were taken over by Staples, the office-supply store, said Mr. Schnurr, whose firm handled the disposition of the Rickel stores.
A key reason why analysts are optimistic is that the closing of Caldor stores, which average about 84,000 square feet, come at a time when the state's economy and retail market continue to be strong. Projections are that it will remain so at least through the end of the year.
"Because of the booming economy along with the fact that many Caldor stores are in prime locations, very few are expected to be hurt," said Ted Kraus, who heads TKO Real Estate Advisory Group, a retail consulting firm in Mercerville.
The statewide retail vacancy rate is hovering between 3.5 and 4 percent, virtually unchanged from last year, and rents continue to rise, albeit not as aggressively as in the past, according to TKO. For example, the firm puts the rents for stores of 70,000 to 100,000 square feet for stores in good locations at $10 to $13 a square foot, up about $1 from last year.
Even as Caldor closes its stores, other national and regional retailers continue to expand in or enter the state, said Jonathan Schultz, president of the Schultz Organization, a brokerage in Woodbridge.
Some, like Kohl's, as well as Wal-Mart and Kmart, are looking to grow by picking up some of the leases on the stores left behind by Caldor. Under bankruptcy laws, bidders for the company would be able to assume the leases at the same rents Caldor was paying, which may be significantly below today's rents since many of the leases were negotiated years ago.
"It is way for growing companies to get into a tight market in a much quicker and less expensive way " said Mr. Schultz. That, in turn, may "slow development in the state, keeping supply in balance with demand," he said.
ONE negative, added Mr. Kraus of TKO, is what will happen once new retailers take over the Caldor stores. "Some merchants who survived because Caldor was a weak competitor will need to work more aggressively or lose out to the new competition," he said
Late last month Kohl's received approval from the bankruptcy court to buy for $142 million the leases of 33 Caldor stores. Eleven of them are in New Jersey, including the two stores at Levin's centers. They will be added to the six stores Kohl's already has in the state.
"We've been expanding into the mid-Atlantic region over the last two years," said Gary Vasques, executive vice president of marketing at Kohl's. Taking over the Caldor leases is a logical move "and allows us to enter the New York metropolitan area with a critical mass of stores," he said.
The plan, he said, is to invest a total of $165 million to renovate all the stores and open them by the spring of 2000.
At the same, time Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, which is based in Bentonville, Ark., was given the green light to buy 12 store leases for $75 million, none in New Jersey. And Kmart, of Troy, Mich., put in a bid for 11 stores. Just one, a Levin property in West Orange, is in the state.
The bidding for the leases, analysts said, is likely to continue for another two months and may bring in more bids from the same players or new ones from other retailers. In addition, retailers who may not want to get involved with the bidding process -- waiting instead for the leases to go back to landlords -- are said to be eyeing the stores. Likely candidates are other so-called big-box users, including discounters like Target, Ames and Bradlees, the latter two of which worked themselves out of bankruptcy.
Stores in choice locations -- in densely populated areas with strong demographics and next to and visible from major highways -- will be snapped up quickly, said Mr. Schnurr of Grubb & Ellis. Landlords with stores in less than prime spots "will have to become creative and come up with adaptive reuses," he added.
Mr. Farber of Levin Management said that his company sees opportunities.
In cases where the Caldor stores in his company's centers are taken over by a new retailer at a rent that "is out-of step with today's market," he said, there is room to renegotiate certain aspects of the lease that pertain, for example, to rents based on sales volume. He said there was also the possibility that the new tenant would not need all the space, giving his company the chance to take back any excess space and rent it to other tenants at market rates.
MR. FARBER said that was the plan at the Paramus center, a 270,000-square-foot community shopping strip anchored by a 130,000-square-foot Caldor store.
There Kohl's intends to use only 90,000 feet, enabling Levin to take back the rest, he said, noting that in tandem with Kohl's plans to renovate the store's facade his company will invest $2.5 million to refurbish the center.
Levin intends to repeat that plan at its 400,000-square-foot Watchung Center, which is anchored by a 138,000-square-foot Caldor store.
The center is in the process of a $5 million rehabilitation, which Levin is undertaking with Federal Realty Investment Trust, based in Washington, D.C. That, together with Kohl's arrival, "gives the center a shot in the arm to remain competitive," he said.
The Caldor stores at Levin's other three centers are still up for grabs and Mr. Farber said his firm would be just as pleased if it got back those leases. The first choice would be to lease the space to a single user or to two smaller anchors and "fill in everything else from there," he said, noting that the alternative was to carve up the space for multiple smaller uses.
In cases where the stores are on two stories or have a basement level, he said his firm would do what it had done many times before: lease that space to complementary uses like health clubs or day care centers.
"History has shown that retailers have a limited life span, but as long as the location is viable and the economics are sound, life for the real estate goes on," Mr. Farber said.

HEADLINE: Habitats / Fifth Avenue Near 125th Street;
To Open a B & B, She Takes the A Train

BYLINE: By TRISH HALL

 BODY:
IT'S a common enough dream. Ditch the corporate job, buy a big old house, open a bed-and-breakfast and live rent-free while you serve coffee in the morning to interesting guests who want to check out your little part of the world.
But when Jane Alex Mendelson decided to follow that dream, she didn't go to some little hamlet in Vermont. She went to Harlem. 
 After getting a bachelor's degree from the University of Pennsylvania, and then a master's in city planning, she did housing and construction forecasting, first for Chase Econometrics and then for McGraw-Hill. She was getting tired of the work but stayed on. "For the longest time, I felt I couldn't ever give up that paycheck," Ms. Mendelson says. But then, she says, "something happened in my life, something kind of personal, and I just made the decision."
At about the same time, she had gone to Vermont with some friends to see the leaves -- and, of course, to stay at a bed-and-breakfast, a staple of Vermont tourism. When they returned to New York, she and a friend who was also disaffected with her work began looking at houses with the intent of opening a bed-and-breakfast together.
They looked at houses on the Lower East Side, in the Village and in Harlem. There was no contest. In terms of the "value for the price," she says, Harlem offered much more.
That knowledge, of course, is theoretical. It's one thing to know a neighborhood is right. It's another to finally cross the threshold of a house that feels destined. They looked at a number of houses in Harlem, but nothing pulled them in for a second time. Her friend decided she didn't want to leave her work after all.
And then one day, Ms. Mendelson stepped into a house on Fifth Avenue near 125th Street, and she knew. The 18-foot-wide by 50-foot-long building, empty of life, had been chopped up into little rooms when it had been a single-room-occupancy hotel. It was owned by a woman who had hoped to renovate it, but by the time all the tenants moved out she found herself unable to carry the project forward.
Ms. Mendelson couldn't easily see the ultimate shape of each floor, because so many hallways and partitions had been added, but she could see the fanciful, curlicued moldings, and the colorful mosaic tile floor in the hallway.
She bought the house for $125,000, closing the deal in February 1997. She left her apartment on the Upper West Side and moved into the top floor, where she lived initially without heat or hot water. It took far longer than anticipated to get the right to renovate, because proof had to be obtained that no tenants had been illegally removed.
FINALLY, after a year and a half and a tight budget of $200,000, she had created a ground-floor office and bedroom for herself, a parlor floor with a living room, dining room, and kitchen, and two floors above with guest rooms, some with their own kitchens and baths, some shared. The moldings were all stripped back to the original wood, and new oak floors were installed throughout.
Last June, her Urban Jem Guest House -- in a building that is part of the Mount Morris Park Historic District, which stretches from 117th to 125th Street and Fifth to Seventh Avenues -- began accepting guests.
When she is making biscuits and muffins in the morning, does she ever miss the corporate life, the paycheck, the suits, the security? She makes a face that looks as if she has just tasted something sour.
Obviously not.
Does she ever find it intrusive to have people in her house, to have to make small talk in the morning with strangers?
Not at all. "I've had such interesting guests," she says. "They're fascinating people." Recently, for instance, Sobonfu Some, a West African author who was in New York to give a workshop on healing rituals, stayed at her bed-and-breakfast. And for New Year's, she was host to a couple who were about to be married and took the two rooms on her top floor.
Because each room in the house has its own cable television and telephone, and some have kitchens, she and her guests have more distance from one another than is typical in some guest houses.
And yet, her guests are clearly drawn by the opportunity to stay in the home of a New Yorker. Many, she says, want to be photographed with her cat, Jessie.
The visitors, who pay between $90 and $120 a night, depending on whether they share a bath, find her through word of mouth, or her Internet site, www.urbanjem.com. Many come from Japan or Germany.
When she has no guests, she has the house to herself, to share with her family and friends, who sometimes come for lengthy stays and repay her by helping with housekeeping. While it might be easier to just rent several floors as apartments, she says, she would lose the house. It would become a place belonging to others. This way, it remains totally hers.
This summer, she hopes to add a deck off the dining room and replace the crumbling sidewalk in front. Maybe the bluestone that will be lifted out can be used in the back, she says. Thriftiness like that has helped her keep down costs. Most of the fixtures were purchased at Home Depot. She used an architect to file her plans but did the design work herself, using a computer program.
She has furnished the house with a mixture of pieces from every style and era. "I'm a pack rat," she says. "I've been collecting things." In one room, guests can sit at the desk she was given at age 10. Another has an old veneer desk that belonged to her grandmother. A gilt mirror was found at a thrift shop.
MANY of her own paintings are on the walls. In the parlor, her most elegantly furnished room, a sofa is upholstered in brown and black, the same colors that intricately adorn her young pit bull, Petey. There is a photograph of her great-great-grandfather, who lived in Michigan during the Civil War era, the time her house was built.
Also hanging are brightly colored earrings made from clay cooked in the stove. Over the fireplace, she has embedded stones she collected on the beach at Davis Park, many of them with the distinctive purple swirls typical of Fire Island. Sharing a house there, she says, showed her that she would like "big house living," and communal space.
Although she ended up in the neighborhood because it offered the best space for the money, she has become conscious of some old ties that bind her even tighter. As a child, she says, coming in from Long Island with her parents, she always traveled across 125th Street on the way to see her grandparents, who lived near Columbia.
Her enthusiasm for a neighborhood that feels part of her childhood seems to be reciprocated by her new neighbors. Many of the recent signatures in her guest book are from local people who just stopped by to see what the new owner had done.
As in her old business, there are trends to follow, and forecasts to consider. Recently, she attended a convention for the owners of bed-and-breakfasts and discovered that the hot new amenity is an outdoor Jacuzzi.
Well, maybe someday.

HEADLINE: Getting Ready for Baby With a Helping Hand;
Five-Minute Doctor Visits Can Be Replaced With Midwife-Led Support Sessions

BYLINE: By BILL RYAN 

 BODY:
IT is midmorning on a Thursday and women in their teens and early 20's straggle in, one by one, to a conference room at Waterbury Hospital until there are seven of them, bound together in a common -- and obvious -- sisterhood: They're all pregnant.
Each checks her weight on a scale (sometimes with a gasp of dismay), then her blood pressure with a small monitor and records the information from both on a form. Then they will settle back on chairs set in a semi-circle, to chat a bit with each other but mostly to listen a lot to Sharon Schindler Rising. 
 Mrs. Rising is a nurse-midwife.
To many people, the word midwife -- a term for a woman who helps other women in childbirth -- might seem obsolete today, suggestive of the American frontier of the last century or crowded slums at the turn of this century, certainly not part of medicine as the 21st century nears.
But midwifery is growing in Connecticut and elsewhere in the United States. Connecticut now has close to 100 certified midwives and nurse-midwives, Mrs. Rising says, and nationally a professional organization of midwives has set a membership goal of 10,000 by next year.
In addition, the role of the midwife has changed from the woman who traditionally delivered babies at home, mostly to poor families. Today, Mrs. Rising says, "birth centers are becoming more popular, with some very creative practices, some with midwives working independently, others with midwives and physicians working together." Rules about midwives and doctors vary from state to state, even from hospital to hospital. Mrs. Rising says she has delivered babies at Waterbury Hospital, but only with a doctor in attendance because of the hospital's rules. She doesn't agree with the rule, she said, but doesn't worry about it very much because she has little time to deliver babies anymore.
What is commanding her attention, and indeed attracting attention elsewhere around the country, is a system she has devised of having a midwife work with groups of pregnant women in prenatal care.
Mrs. Rising calls it "Centering Pregnancy" and since its inception seven years ago in a pilot program at Waterbury Hospital it has involved several hundred women in Connecticut and an unknown number in eight other states where it has been copied, from Louisiana to Maine to Illinois, even to Vancouver, British Columbia. Centering Pregnancy, Mrs. Rising says, takes pregnant women "out of exam rooms" and into a group setting for most of their prenatal care.
The exam room, is a doctor's office. The usual drill for a pregnant woman there, Mrs. Rising says, is well established: "She checks in, waits, finally gets to see the doctor, and maybe they have five minutes together." That, she maintains, is not enough time for the woman to know what is happening to her body and affords no opportunity to compare the progress of her pregnancy with other soon-to-be-mothers.
What her system advocates, Mrs. Rising says, is that a women see a doctor about four months after she finds she is pregnant and then again before giving birth, both times at such length that the doctor can get a comprehensive idea of her condition.Between the two visits to the doctor, the woman should attend 10 regularly scheduled, hour-and-a-half sessions with a small group of pregnant women with similar due dates, conducted by a midwife.
Mrs. Rising says the sessions afford pregnant women the opportunity to ask questions, talk over concerns and take routine tests.
The system, she says, is based on two premises that are now accepted as fact. One is that the more prenatal care women receive, the healthier babies they will deliver. The other is that pregnant women want to socialize and discuss their mutual concerns and problems.
The plan is not anti-doctor, Mrs. Rising says. In actuality, it is not even exclusively pro-midwife. She has written a 150-page handbook for it and in an explanation has written: "It is an ideal model for nurse-midwives and nurse practitioners to conduct: however, it also lends itself to parent educators, social workers and physicians."
In addition to the "Stay Well" sessions she holds at Waterbury Hospital for the city's community health clinic, she also holds some for a private obstetrics-gynecology office, the Center for Women's Health, with three doctors (Frederick Cohn, Anne McNulty and Jonathan Foster) and another midwife, Gina Novick.
Dr. Cohn, the first to join up in the physician-midwife alliance, is an enthusiast for the added dimension Mrs. Rising's system brings to the office. In addition to the benefits to pregnant woman, the sessions are beneficial to many soon-to-be-fathers who attend and consequently, he says, "are more help in labor and then with the babies when they come home."
Mrs. Rising, now in her 50's, and mother of two college students, is a Midwesterner by birth and a midwife rather than a doctor by choice. "I never wanted to be a doctor," she says. "I'm not interested in doing surgery. I like the more nurturing aspect of health care, working with families."
She first came to Connecticut to attend Yale School of Nursing in New Haven, then stayed on for half a dozen years as a faculty member. In the 70's, she was hired away by the University of Minnesota to help create its Childbearing Childrearing Center. "They sort of recruited me," she says. "They were interested in developing a graduate program in nurse-midwifery at the school of nursing there."
She stayed in Minnesota for seven years but then returned to Connecticut with her husband, Ronald Rising, a minister and graduate of the Yale School of Divinity, who was offered a job in a rehabilitation clinic for youngsters with emotional and addictive problems. By this time, Mrs. Rising had a handle on what she wanted to do, and it could be done in Connecticut as well as Minnesota.
She tested her "Centering Pregnancy" idea in 1993 and 1994 at Waterbury Hospital with 13 groups of eight pregnant women, 3 groups just of teen-agers. She has been at it since, expanding it to the private doctors' office, watching it spread into other states, which, she says, has delighted her.
Sometimes she is called to be a consultant for new groups, but even if not she says it doesn't bother her. "I have copyrighted the handbook," she says, "and it would have been possible, I guess, to franchise as a new health provider system, but I just want people to work with this. I have no great desire to oversee it. And I'm starting to run instructional workshops, including one proposed for San Francisco. I want to get people excited about the concept."
One thing is certain: the pregnant women she works with at the hospital are excited enough to show up regularly, and in good spirits, for the weekly sessions.
The one on a recent Thursday was probably fairly typical. Only one woman was missing but she had a good excuse: she was elsewhere in the hospital, a patient with a medical problem unrelated to her pregnancy.
Three young men were also present, but didn't say much. Mrs. Rising always calls the men who attend partners and knows them by name. "I guess basically I don't use the term 'husband' much anymore," she says. Nor does she ask the women who come to her whether they are married.
Two little girls were also present, one white, one black, both adorable and looking like a great poster for one world. They were out of the toddler stage and into the tearing-around and making noise stage. Eventually they were taken out and amused elsewhere by Mrs. Rising's assistant, Joan Seabury, a nurse.
The women talked to each other, weighed themselves, took their own blood pressures, then were, in turn, given a brief examination by Mrs. Rising. "A woman's belly becomes very public during pregnancy," she noted.
She started the talking part of the program, using two props: a small soft doll about the size of a newborn baby and a simulated pelvic skeleton, explaining the process of birth, what is normal, what isn't. And no college professor ever had a more rapt audience.
She talked on, a pleasant, smiling woman selling a blend of common sense and encouragement: how to make labor easier -- "picture a big wave when you're breathing"; eating better -- "I don't worry about the amount you eat but the quality of the food you eat" and hope -- "Don't worry when you see your baby for the first time, they're all a little bit bluish."
After the session was over, she said that women in general don't really know very much about the birth process, regardless of their economic status or their level of education.
Several mothers accompany their daughters to the sessions at the private doctors' office, she said, and they listen in genuine awe. Then they confess: "I just never knew these things."

HEADLINE: Where Public Housing Meets the American Dream

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH 

 BODY:
CAROLYN BELLAMY, standing near a large bay window in the living room of her brand new two-story house in Bridgeport, is trying to decide where to put her television set when she moves in later this month.
Ms. Bellamy is excited about the move from Trumbull Gardens, public housing in the North End of Bridgeport, where she has lived for the last 20 years, to a house -- the first that she will have ever owned -- in what is to be known as Pembroke Green in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Bridgeport. 
 The attractive, cream-colored two-story house also includes a unit adjacent to Ms. Bellamy's that she can rent out under a pioneering affordable housing concept. So far, 15 of the 21 two-family houses have been built -- ranging in size from 1,100 to 1,300 square feet -- and four of the owners have moved in.
What makes Pembroke Green noteworthy is that it is a Bridgeport Housing Authority program with homes that will be owned by their occupants, symbolizing a somewhat revolutionary approach to public housing in Connecticut.
Also noteworthy is that Pembroke Green is situated on part of the 37-acre site of the Father Panik Village, which, starting in the 1960's, became so crime-ridden and dilapidated that it came to epitomize the decline in the old concept of public housing.
Built just before the United States entered World War II, in December of 1941, Father Panik Village was named for the Rev. Stephen Panik, a priest and housing activist from St. Cyril and Methodius Church. During World War II, when Bridgeport military plants employed thousands of workers and was fond of calling itself "the arsenal of Democracy," hundreds of residents from Father Panik Village walked to work at nearby factories such as the Bridgeport Brass Company, Remington Arms and the Singer Sewing Machine Company.
The complex, which housed 4,000 people in three-story brick structures, was torn down between 1991 and 1994 and the tenants were relocated to other sites.
Now, on five acres of the old site, stand the neat frame homes, in a variety of hues, directly across from the Hall Neighborhood House, the longtime neighborhood community center and in the shadow of the abandoned Singer and Remington buildings and close to the rubble from the demolition of Bridgeport Brass.
"I had almost given up hope of owning my own home," said Ms. Bellamy, a 42-year-old account supervisor with Cablevision of Connecticut in Bridgeport. "And I'm just thrilled about the thought of moving in." Ms. Bellamy, who has three sons, has a bright and airy three-bedroom duplex that, like the other houses, will eventually have landscaped lawns in front and back.
Closing on Ms. Bellamy's house is March 18, and with an annual income of $35,000 and a good credit rating, she meets the Housing Authority's criteria for Pembroke Green. The houses cost just over $90,000 and she expects to be able to make a down payment of $4,500 (which the Housing Authority sets as a goal for prospective buyers) and the closing costs. Buyers who need help with the down payment, closing costs or mortgage can get aid from several sources including the Bridgeport Community Block Grant Program and Chase Bank, Citibank and People's Bank.
One feature of the program is a $6,000 "buy down" grant through Citibank under the Federal Home Loan Bank's affordable housing program. Under it, each home buyer in Pembroke Green automatically receives a $6,000 grant toward their mortgage, thus reducing the overall purchase price.
"The entire notion of public housing changes with this program," said Collin Vice, the deputy director of the Bridgeport Housing Authority. "And it changes the perception of the area by creating home ownership opportunities and a tax base for the city." Ms. Vice said that Pembroke Green would also serve as a model that the authority expected to expand to other parts of the city.
Ms. Bellamy will also be reducing her monthly housing costs: her monthly mortgage payment will be less than her rent at Trumbull Gardens. "I pay $692 now," she said, "but will be paying only $536 a month at Pembroke Green." And Ms. Bellamy will also be receiving $675 in rent from the tenant who will occupy the adjacent two-bedroom duplex unit.
Ms. Bellamy learned about the home-ownership opportunity from notices sent to residents of the city's housing projects.
Others heard about Pembroke Green at their churches. Among them was Juana Sasso, who became interested when the Bridgeport Mayor, Joseph Ganim, discussed Pembroke Green while speaking at the Church of Christ Assembly of God. Ms. Sasso and her 34-year-old son, Alejandro, were the first family to move in. "It is wonderful," said Mr. Sasso, a shipping clerk, while sitting in his new living room.
For some buyers, moving into Pembroke Green means going home again, since several had lived in Father Panik Village. "Many people who lived here as children want to come back to their old neighborhood, where they grew up," said Melody Thergood, the Bridgeport Housing Authority's family initiatives coordinator for Pembroke Green who lived in the area in the late 60's.
Waldo Emerson Williams, a vice president of residential lending at People's Bank, recalled the evolution of the drug dealing that led to the demise of Father Panik Village. "When our family moved into the Village in 1970, the drug dealers were a laughingstock," said Mr. Williams, who went on to attend Wesleyan University on an academic scholarship. "Then by the time we moved out in 1984 they had become role models to young kids. Fortunately, I had very positive role models, including my mother."
"Now, it's very rewarding to help create home ownership opportunities for a lot of people who I grew up with," added Mr. Williams during an interview at Pembroke Green.
Financial support for the Pembroke Green project also came from the State Department of Economic and Community Development, which contributed a $700,000 infrastructure grant, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which is providing subsidies to those who rent units from new home owners.
In addition, the Murphy Sign Company donated advertising space to promote the program and two Bridgeport-based companies, United Illuminating and O & G Industries, provided $75,000 in tax credits.
Ms. Vice, of the Bridgeport Housing Authority, said that Pembroke Green was the first step in a revitalization effort at the old Father Panik Village site. "We hope to build another 20 homes on the site -- all single-family -- half of which would be sold outright while the others would be rented. In addition, we're been talking with a manufacturer, who is interested in building a light-industry plant there with a long-term lease, and with a church that would like to build on the site."
Ms. Vice added, "We're all very excited about the program, and, of course, so are the buyers, most of whom have never owned a home of their own. And many of them are going to be doing it in the neighborhood where they grew up."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property / Great River, Long Island;
From Defense Technology to High Technology

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

DATELINE: GREAT RIVER, N.Y.

 BODY:
NOT surprisingly, William Rudin sees parallels between Rudin Management Company's pioneering high-tech building at 55 Broad Street in lower Manhattan and his high-tech joint venture with Cogswell Realty Group that is about to open in an old Northrop Grumman building here on Long Island..
The end of the cold war drastically reduced the demand for the defense electronics that were designed and produced in the 350,000-square-foot plant just south of Sunrise Highway in the Town of Islip. The last employees left in December 1997, and Cogswell bought the property last year, paying about $10 million. 
 "Both buildings needed to be retooled for the 21st century," Mr. Rudin said. "The Long Island Technology Center is like 55 Broad laid on its side." Indeed, the two-story Long Island building stretches over acres of flat land while the 30-story building at Broad and Beaver Streets shoots up vertically on a crowded downtown block.
As the Rudin organization did at 55 Broad, the Long Island partners plan to equip the vacant building, on a 82-acre site, with the latest in high-speed voice and data communications, video conferencing capability and a telephone system that will operate wirelessly within the center. Internet access at a variety of capacity levels will also be available.
The building will also have high-capacity communications links to other Rudin properties, including 55 Broad, 110 Wall Street and, eventually, to the Reuters building that the Rudin organization is building on the west side of Seventh Avenue from 42d to 43d Street,, designated 3 Times Square.
The partners plan to spend about $21 million renovating the property, including putting up office walls inside the building. This prebuilding of interior space is contrary to typical industry practice, but Mr. Rudin said his organization found that high-technology companies like to move into finished space rather than wait for the interior construction work to be done.
"We found at 55 Broad that it was a case of 'If you build it, they will come,' " Mr. Rudin said. Virtually all the 410,000 square feet in the Broad Street building have been filled by dozens of information technology companies since the conversion was completed in 1996, and there is a waiting list of companies that want to get in.
On Long Island, the space will be built out with open, rather than dropped, ceilings for easy installation of overhead cabling, with the first 150,000 square feet of space expected to be available within weeks. Annual rents are expected to be in the low $20's per square foot. The Long Island center may differ from 55 Broad in that it is expected to be populated by a broad range of business and industrial software and technology companies, rather than the strong new-media concentration at the Manhattan location.
Although the conversion of 55 Broad was considered risky when it was first undertaken because of the depressed real estate market in the area, the success of the project has led to imitation. The local business improvement district, the Alliance for Downtown New York, and the city's Economic Development Corporation developed the Plug 'n' Go program, which makes Internet-wired space available to start-up companies at below-market rental rates. That program is now in its third year.
Since people working in rapidly developing technology industries tend to work long hours (24/7 is the industry shorthand for around-the-clock operations), they expect amenities where they work. At the Long Island Technology Center those features will include a fitness center, a recreational area equipped with a pool table and other activities, a child-care center and several classrooms. Outside areas will be landscaped and furnished to encourage outdoor dining in good weather; a volleyball area is also planned.
One of the features at 55 Broad is what the Rudin organization called the Global Community Sandbox, a video conferencing center that provides real-time voice and pictures of people who may be continents away.
IN a recent demonstration of the technology on Long Island, Rudin Management's chief operating officer, John J. Gilbert 3d, conducted a conference with participants in Malaysia, Singapore, Germany and Chicago. A permanent conferencing center is to be built as part of Phase 2 of the Long Island project, scheduled to open in the fall of this year.
The conferencing centers and the classrooms at both locations are intended to help bring people from different companies together so they can trade ideas, form partnerships and develop a community of shared interests.
That community appears to be developing rapidly on Long Island. When the Long Island Software Technology Network was formed a little over a year ago, the organizers hoped they could find 50 to 70 companies willing to contribute a few hundred dollars each to promote software development on the island. When the network recently published its first annual report, it listed 514 member companies and organizations -- and the roster is still growing.
LISTnet, as the organization is known, will be the first tenant of the technology center when it moves into 1,000 square feet over the next few weeks. The rapid growth of the organization is an indication of how much software and other technology is being developed in Long Island.
"There are a lot of people out there who are in the same category of business who really don't know each other," said Peter Goldsmith, the chairman of LISTnet. "You can't tell what a company does by its name."
He said he hopes the technology center will be seen as a neutral site where companies can locate and develop their businesses without fear of being steamrollered by a larger company. "The small companies are always afraid the big companies will gobble them up," Mr. Goldsmith said.
He said that many people are drawn by the attractions of Long Island living and that the presence of the the technology center gives them the opportunity to continue that life style while their business has high-capacity connections to the rest of the world.
"We hope to break down barriers between companies at the technical center," Mr. Goldsmith said. "We think this will help people form alliances."
Some of those alliances are forming already. Richard W. Kruse, a senior vice president of Stratem Computer Group in Hicksville, said he met executives of a company called ARvee Systems at a LISTnet meeting. He said they have arranged for Stratem to market ARvee's imaging products.
Mr. Kruse said that although many companies say they can do a complete technology installation, from cabling to software debugging, most really cannot. "Instead of fighting with each other we should be getting together," he said. "If I can do 60 percent of a job, that's what I should do and get Company A and Company B to do the rest."
The leaders of LISTnet are forging alliances with technology development centers such as Brookhaven National Laboratory and the island's educational institutions. At a recent meeting at the tech center site, Brookhaven displayed its latest developments, seeking business people who can convert them into products. Mr. Goldsmith said he expected Brookhaven to lease an office in the center to stay close to the commercial world.
Yacov Shamash, dean of the college of engineering and applied sciences at the SUNY Stony Brook campus, who is a member of the LISTnet board of directors, said his school would be involved in training programs at the center.
"There are thousands of technology companies on Long Island, but they are scattered all over the place," he said. The technology center, he said, will provide a focus, for the companies that locate there or attend educational sessions or trade association meetings.
The center is also a natural location for companies who outgrow the business incubators being established on Long Island with state assistance, Mr. Shamash said.
Incubators, which are often associated with educational institutions, provide subsidized office and laboratory space for companies in their first years of existence. If successful, the companies are expected to move on to commercial space. One such incubator is at Stony Brook, and Mr. Shamash said there is a state-backed program to develop six more on Long Island.
Mr. Kruse of Stratem said that he had proposed establishing another technology center at another former defense location on Long Island but that it would likely be a long time before the first one was filled. In addition to the 350,000 square feet of space already on the site, the developers have the as-of-right option to build 787,000 more square feet of space on the sprawling site.

HEADLINE: IN BRIEF;
Port Authority Sale

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has announced the $9 million sale of its remaining 20-acre property at the Yonkers Industrial Park to Hudson View Associates, a private company in Greenwich. The sale represents the public agency's continuing "movement back to its core mission of transportation," the Port Authority said.
"In 1985, we began transforming an idle and aged manufacturing facility, the former Otis Elevator plant, into a thriving, refurbished industrial park employing more than 540 people," Chairman Lewis M. Eisenberg of the authority said. "Now the time is right to turn it over to the private sector and let the Port Authority focus its resources on its main mission of improving the region's transportation systems and economic competitiveness." 
 The new owner, an affiliate of National RE/sources, a real estate investment company, plans to continue to operate the property as an industrial park.
Two buildings were sold in 1996 and 1997. The other properties include five buildings and about 424,000 square feet of industrial and office space.
The new owner is committed to continuing the operation as an industrial park, retaining among other tenants Kawasaki Heavy Industries, which makes rail cars for the New York City Transit Authority, Long Island Rail Road and the City of Baltimore, the Port Authority said.

Job-Saving Plan

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki has started the second round of his "Power for Jobs" program by announcing that 615 jobs will be created and 19,697 protected under new allocations of low-cost electricity recommended by the State Economic Development Power Allocation Board.
The plan is meant to work by converting the savings in energy into more jobs. 
 For Westchester, that means concessions on power use to Hudson Valley Hospital Center in Peekskill, which will in turn be used to create 350 jobs and save 647 existing jobs; Reliable Automatic Sprinkler, Mount Vernon, to create 500 new jobs and save 513, and St. Joseph Medical Center in Yonkers, to create 550 jobs and save 1,136.
Governor Pataki said he would sign low-cost power extensions for 16 Power Authority business customers recently approved by the State Economic Development Power Allocation Board. The 16 businesses, which together employ 6,082 New Yorkers, receive the low-cost power through economic development power programs meant to protect jobs. The power is produced at the James A. Fitzpatrick Nuclear Power Plant on Lake Ontario near Oswego.
In Westchester, the companies are the International Business Machines Watson Research Center of Hawthorne and Yorktown Heights, 2,265 jobs, and J. J. Cassone Bakery of Port Chester, 350 jobs.
The terms of the extended contracts include a price freeze for three years, a near-term reduction for the Power Authority electricity production price and an agreement by the Power Authority to absorb part of future price increases related to the transmission and distribution of power.

Architectural Gem Theft
 
Q. About 30 years ago, as the Washington Market area in lower Manhattan was cleared for urban renewal, the city dismantled an early cast-iron building and stored the pieces. The building, an architectural gem as I recall, was to be re-erected at a future date. What became of it?
 
A. It was stolen.
James Bogardus, a pioneer in the design and construction of cast-iron buildings, built a group of stores for Edward H. Laing at Washington and Murray Streets in 1849. Using prefabricated cast-iron columns and panels, along with wooden spans and brick walls, Bogardus assembled the four-story structure in two months, an astonishing feat for the day. 
 The Laing Stores represented one of the earliest uses of curtain-wall construction using mass-produced, modular iron parts, and in a sense all skyscrapers are its grandchildren. Scheduled for demolition in 1967, the little building somehow survived on the site until 1971, when preservationists gingerly disassembled the facades, numbered the parts and stored them on a nearby vacant lot. The building was to be reassembled next to its original site, on the campus of the new Manhattan Community College.
In 1974, however, three men were discovered loading cast-iron panels from the Laing Stores onto a truck in a storage lot at Washington and Chambers Streets. Though 22 broken sections were later recovered in a Bronx junkyard, horrified city officials discovered that almost two-thirds of the facade had already been sold for scrap, at $90 a truckload. The remaining panels were immediately placed under lock and key.
A hybrid Laing building, combining original and recast components, was planned for the new South Street Seaport, but, incredibly, all the remaining pieces were stolen in 1977. A facsimile of the building, lacking a single molecule of the original, was built at Front and Fulton Streets in 1983. It remains intact.
 
13 Pillars All in a Row
 
Q. In the woods just west of the Old Putnam Trail in Van Cortlandt Park, near the Parade Ground, are 13 tall stone pillars standing in a row. What is or was their purpose?
 
A. Around 1900, it became clear to Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt, owner of the New York Central Railroad, that his Grand Central Depot would have to be rebuilt. The city demanded that steam locomotives be replaced by electrified trains, and the depot on 42d Street was in perpetual expansion and rearrangement.
Sometime before 1903, Vanderbilt arranged for several stone quarries to deliver some huge sample slabs, which were placed outdoors and exposed to the elements. The upper facade of the new Grand Central Terminal would be built with the type of stone that weathered the most handsomely. The slabs were set upright along what was then the New York Central Putnam line, which traveled through Van Cortlandt Park on its way to Boston.
Marianne Anderson, a spokeswoman for Van Cortlandt and Pelham Bay Parks, said the second stone from the south, Bedford limestone from Indiana, was chosen for Grand Central Terminal, not for the beauty with which it aged, but because it could be transported cheaply on Vanderbilt's rails from the quarry to New York. The pillars have been painted battleship gray, she said, to cover the inevitable graffiti.
The Putnam Trail was created when the rails from the Putnam Line were pulled up in 1994. Remnants from the railway, including parts of a chain-link fence, are still evident along the route, which carried passengers until 1958.
 
The Urchins' Champion
 
Q. Whence comes the name Drumgoole, as in Drumgoole Road on Staten Island?
 
A. Born in Ireland in 1816, John C. Drumgoole was the champion and benefactor of New York City's thousands of street urchins, particularly homeless newsboys and bootblacks. Drumgoole was for many years a sexton and janitor at St. Mary's Church on Grand Street, where it was said that he let homeless children sleep in the basement. Ordained a priest at 53, he became chaplain for the St. Vincent's Home for Newsboys at 55 Warren Street and founded a newspaper called The Homeless Child.
In 1881 he founded the Mission of the Immaculate Virgin at 80 Lafayette Street, which provided beds for more than 2,000 homeless children. The mission later moved to the south shore of Staten Island, where it continues today. A bronze statue of Father Drumgoole stood at Great Jones and Lafayette Streets from 1894 until it was moved to Staten Island in 1921.

For Young Entrepreneurs, A Step Past the Classroom

BYLINE: By PAUL WISENTHAL 

 BODY:
MOST every day after school and on weekends, Federica Bautista, 18, sells fruit, vegetables and flowers from a pushcart stationed at the entrance to Flushing Meadows Corona Park in Queens. When it's cold outside, she takes delivery orders by telephone at her home, a two-bedroom apartment she shares with seven relatives. Her weekly earnings of $100 to $150 on sales of $400 help support her widowed mother and her 2-year-old son, Abraham.
Ms. Bautista, a single mother who emigrated from Mexico in 1991, used to fear for her financial future. But last year, she helped her family escape welfare by completing an after-school program offered by the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship. The foundation provides students in poor urban neighborhoods with training and seed capital to start their own businesses. 
 The group is one of about 20 nonprofit agencies authorized by school boards across the country to teach business literacy. The largest of these, Junior Achievement, reaches more than 3.1 million students, up 17 percent last year, by bringing business people into the classrooms.
"So many of our kids are disconnected from opportunities and options available to them from our economic system," said James B. Hayes, chief executive of Junior Achievement, based in Colorado Springs. "For many, their only example is playing for the Chicago Bulls or selling narcotics."
Some of the groups are going a step beyond the literacy training by teaching students to run their own businesses.
The National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship had its own origins in New York, after Steve Mariotti, a high school teacher in the South Bronx, saw the effects of narcotics and violence on his students. Though they had little understanding of how the economy worked, many still dreamed of having their own businesses.
To teach them, Mr. Mariotti established the foundation in 1988. Eleven years later, it has a budget of $5 million a year, with 22,000 graduate entrepreneurs and offices across the country. Major donors are the Koch family foundations, the Heinz endowments, Fleet Bank, the W. K. Kellogg Foundation, Microsoft and the Ronald McDonald House Charities.
Ms. Bautista turned to the foundation after seeing a poster at school. She learned everything from how to write a business plan to how to negotiate with wholesalers. Later, she received $50 toward the cost of opening her flower and fruit stand.
Among other agencies, Rural Entrepreneurship Through Action Learning, or REAL Enterprises, based in Durham, N.C., trains entrepreneurs in rural areas across the country. Among its successes are Spencer Hall, 18, who started Expertise Computers in 1994 in Deer Park, Wash. Today, with $750,000 in sales and five employees, Mr. Hall installs computer systems for small businesses, professionals and schools.
EVERY state has some form of entrepreneurship education. But tight budgets often limit the offerings to relatively few students.
To expand the reach, the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship, in partnership with Microsoft, plans in May to start BizTech, an on-line entrepreneurial learning system at www.nfte.com.
Some past sponsors of entrepreneurship programs have had second thoughts. Gary Kaplan, executive director of Jobs for Youth Boston, ran entrepreneurial programs until 1991. He now says that with 25 percent of the population functionally illiterate, "teaching entrepreneurship is not a substitute for teaching reading, math and science."
Last year, a measure that would have allocated $60 million to states for entrepreneurship education in public schools stalled in Congress. Its sponsors plan to try again this spring.
As for Ms. Bautista, she now plans to go to college. "I want to become a teacher or perhaps study medicine," she said. "But I will still want to have my own business."

Preserving Medicare's Roots

BYLINE: By FRED BROCK; Fred Brock is an editor at The Times. His column on the approach to and arrival at retirement appears the first Sunday of each month. E-mail may be sent to fbrock@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
WHEN Thomas C. Matzzie graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 1997 with a degree in economics, he decided not to follow many of his classmates into high-paying careers on Wall Street or elsewhere. Instead, he took a lower-paying job, as a policy analyst at the Institute for America's Future, a liberal research organization in Washington.
Mr. Matzzie, 23, who grew up near Pittsburgh, credits Medicare -- of all things -- with giving him the chance to follow his interests rather than chase a big salary. "When I was a senior in high school, my grandmother -- who has since died -- became very ill," he recalled. "Medicare was there and helped pay the expenses that would otherwise have bankrupted our family. Because of Medicare I was able to go on to college and then have the freedom to do nonprofit work that pays less, because I know that the burden of taking care of my parents will be a lot less with Medicare." 
 Though he won't use Medicare himself for another 40-plus years, Mr. Mattzie sees how his well-being depends on it. If only the same could be said for the broader public, whose awareness seems to have dimmed.
In the current debate over the program's future, many people have forgotten and others are too young to know what it was like before 1966, when Medicare began. Back then, young people feared that caring for a sick parent, retired and no longer covered by health insurance, could ruin them.
THEODORE R. MARMOR, a professor of politics at the Yale School of Management and the author of "The Politics of Medicare," (Aldine, 1998) says a founding principle of Medicare was the "importance of relieving children of the financial catastrophe that illness could mean for their parents and then for them."
"That understanding has been weakened to the point of amnesia," he added, partlybecause Medicare's benefits have come to be taken for granted, and partly because the financial relief they offer has been blunted by growing drug and nursing home costs, which the program doesn't cover.
Another founding principle of Medicare is threatened by a proposal to split it in two, allowing a choice between the traditional plan, with the Government paying the bills, and the chance to shop for private insurance whose premiums the Government would largely pay. "This so-called premium-support proposal, which is really a voucher plan, would undermine Medicare as a social insurance program," Professor Marmor said. "People would face a dizzying array of private plans and would have to pay the difference between a Federal voucher and the cost of a health plan. This would shift the risks of inflation to the elderly and to health plans and away from the Medicare program itself."
"This is an ideological attack and an effort to reject by stealth the social insurance premises of the Medicare program," he said. "It rejects the original notion that Medicare should be a common program for everybody who is over 65. "
Under the proposal, wealthier elderly Americans could have better coverage. That, he argues, would encourage one Medicare program for the affluent and another for everybody else.
This solution is hardly the only way to rescue Medicare, Professor Marmor said. He cites Congressional Budget Office figures showing that raising the Medicare payroll tax to 2.02 percent, from 1.45 percent, would keep Medicare's hospital insurance trust fund in balance through 2025. Someone making $40,000 a year would pay an additional $228 a year, or 62 cents a day. "Are we to believe that the public is unwilling to accept tax increases of this magnitude to support the growing numbers of their parents and grandparents who become eligible for Medicare?" he wrote last year.
Phyllis Mayer certainly wouldn't object to such an increase, both to insure the program's future and to pay for prescription drugs. Ms. Mayer, 83, of New Bedford, Mass., is the oldest student at the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth, where she will receive a B.A. degree in June.
Remembering the days before Medicare, she sees the program as a reflection of our values. "It's important to us as a society that we take care of people," she said.

Untangling Gridlock On the Union Pacific

BYLINE: By BARBARA WHITAKER 

DATELINE: HOUSTON

 BODY:
FOR Troy Slinkard, the worst days of the Union Pacific Railroad's service crisis came in late 1997. About a year after the U.P. had merged with the Southern Pacific, the two railroads' combined train traffic was choking to a standstill in the crucial nest of tracks around and through Houston, the heart of the region that Mr. Slinkard helped direct.
"It was 12 to 15 hours a day of complete misery, doing everything in your power to clear it up," he remembered. "And it went on day after day." 
 At the height of the crisis, which flared on and off for 18 months, the gridlock in Houston backed up trains as far away as California and Chicago. The sidings that allow trains to pass each other were persistently full. Freight cars were left stranded for days or weeks, or temporarily lost. Shippers screamed about millions of dollars in losses.
Today, the worst of those headaches are behind Mr. Slinkard. The Union Pacific has become much more adept at managing the country's largest railroad, with 36,000 miles of track sprawling across 23 states in the West and South.
Train speeds through Houston have rebounded from an average of just 12.5 miles an hour last March to 18.2 m.p.h. for the week ended Saturday, Feb. 20, about what they were before the merger, according to the railroad's figures. Several major shippers' claims arising from the debacle have been settled out of court, and safety problems related to the snarl have abated.
Even as the crisis led some critics to call for greater regulation of railroads, coping with it has taken the Union Pacific beyond tactical problem-solving to making fundamental changes in the way it operates.
Giving up on centralized control came first. "We learned this is such a large company that we could not manage it from a single center in Omaha," said Dick Davidson, chairman of the Union Pacific. So it delegated operational control to regional centers in Houston, Omaha and Roseville, Calif., near Sacramento.
And in Houston, the epicenter of the crisis, the U.P. went even further, creating a joint operating center with the Burlington Northern Santa Fe, its main rival.
That's where Mr. Slinkard works now, as a joint director, reporting to both railroads. He is a referee of sorts, making sure that the two sides' dispatchers, who now sit in the same room, coordinate their train movements, and that all trains are handled fairly.
"We have a saying here," Mr. Slinkard said. "We don't care what color the locomotive is, as long as it's pulling cars and leaving town."
So pleased were the railroads with the improvements in Houston that they are planning similar joint operations centers to control trackage in the Powder River Basin in eastern Wyoming and the areas around Los Angeles and Kansas City.
The Union Pacific also simplified train routing in Houston by designating certain tracks for permanent one-way traffic. It stepped up capital spending and hired 6,000 new workers, 1,100 in the Houston area. And Mr. Davidson dispatched a personal representative, Joe Adams, to mend fences in Houston. "We do a great deal of business here, and we want to be partners with Houston and participate in economic development," Mr. Adams said.
WHILE shippers and government officials generally compliment the Union Pacific on its steps to end the crisis, there is still backing for a rethinking of railroad deregulation in Washington.
"Regardless of what happened with the Union Pacific crisis, the industry has consolidated beyond where it makes sense," said Diane C. Duff, executive director of the Alliance for Rail Competition, a Washington-based lobbying group representing shippers who depend heavily on rail service.
Ms. Duff said service is still substantially worse than before the merger. The Society of the Plastics Industry, which represents a large number of rail shippers, said its members' bulk rail shipments took an average of 11 days in December, better than the 15-day average in March 1998 but nowhere near the 6-day average in December 1995. Shippers' groups say lack of competition is to blame: The country's major railroads have dwindled from 42 in 1980 to just 4 today.
Before regulations were lifted by the Staggers Act, enacted in 1980, the Government controlled many aspects of railroad rate setting. The Surface Transportation Board still oversees matters like railroad safety but, critics say, no longer does much to combat unfair pricing practices.
During the service crisis, a coalition of smaller railroads, shippers and state and local representatives asked the board to force the Union Pacific to relax its grip on Houston, where it controls about 80 percent of all track. The coalition wanted running rights on U.P. track for rival railroads and a new independent entity to move traffic through Houston. The U.P. objected that these measures were unnecessarily drastic, and that any area customer served by two railroads before the merger still had access to a second carrier. In the end, the board ordered a few minor measures.
Critics of the railroads have now turned to Congress, backing legislation that would require the board to promote competition among railroads and assure that "captive shippers" served by only one railroad were charged reasonable rates; studies suggest that such shippers now pay 30 percent more, on average, than other rail customers.
Mr. Davidson called the bill shortsighted and said customers would benefit as the Union Pacific corrected mistakes. "We went to hell, looked the devil in the eye and came back," he said. "It has been a profound experience. We have all made a blood-oath commitment that we're going to learn from the desperate situation we were in and come out of it a far better railroad."

Some Advice for Mr. Gates: Have Your Day in Court

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
Both sides in the Microsoft trial have retreated to their corners until mid-April, when the antitrust battle will resume in a Washington courtroom. Then, both the Government and Microsoft will have the opportunity to call a couple of rebuttal witnesses.
The company has not ruled out the option of rolling out its ultimate weapon, William H. Gates. Here is an example of an E-mail one of his advisers might send, urging him to take the stand and suggesting what he might discuss.
 
DEAR BILL: 
 It's not Paris, but Washington in April isn't bad. You should show up in court and have your say.
Heck, if an I.B.M. corporate bureaucrat like Frank Cary could be a star witness for his company in its successful defense against the Justice Department, a field general of the future like you ought to be able to wow 'em.
O.K., you got some bad advice for that taped deposition, which the Justice Department has played endlessly at the trial. It seemed as if some other guy showed up in your body -- evasive, forgetful and out of the corporate loop. Everybody knows you are the loop at Microsoft. The answer-nothing approach was a real mistake. Bad P.R. and bad legal tactics.
So go to Washington to restore your credibility, and do what you can to revive your legal defense. It needs help.
One thing I've found puzzling is this: When Microsoft executives have been asked whether they wanted to crush the Internet upstart, Netscape Communications, they are almost apologetic. They speak of trampling rivals as if it were a regrettable byproduct of competition.
Talk about undermining your own credibility! No one thinks that anybody at Microsoft believes that for a nanosecond.
SO when asked, you should just tell Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson what you believe with your every breath to be the truth:
"Yes, we like nothing better at Microsoft than loosening the bowels of our competitors. We get up early and we go to bed late to create products, market them aggressively and revolutionize the industry.
"We call that capitalism, and, yes, we take our capitalism pretty much straight-up in the New Economy. It's why things move so fast in our industry, why companies succeed and fail quickly. Yes, it can be brutal, but it also goes a long way toward explaining the phenomenal dynamism of the American economy.
"Judge Jackson, you may think it makes sense, after hearing all the tales of woe from our competitors, that something should be done to level the playing field in our industry. And having the Government intervene to fashion a more controlled style of capitalism can often seem humane. I know you're thinking about it. And it may be that we got a little over-enthusiastic in the browser wars, crossing the line here and there with a couple of our contracts.
"But I'd urge you to be cautious. The Justice Department has said it is using this case to establish new ground rules of competition in the information age. But the economies where the governments play a stronger role in fine-tuning the rules of engagement are the economies now trying to emulate the United States.
"Japan is finally being forced to dismantle its system of corporate socialism, and the traditional social democratic model of Europe is in retreat.
"And, your honor, I would invite you to visit ground zero of our alleged predation -- Silicon Valley. What do you see? A local economy where there is virtually no unemployment, where seven-figure home prices are the norm in many neighborhoods, and where corporate parking lots are filled with $70,000 sports cars.
"Even the Government's economic witness, Frank Fisher of M.I.T., had to acknowledge he could find no current consumer harm from what our accusers call our monopolistic bullying of the entire computer industry. He says he's worried about the future. Well, so am I -- which is why, if you want to observe the 'quiet life' of the monopolist, you shouldn't come to Redmond."
WELL, Bill, the bad news is that this would mainly be a speech, not related directly to the specific charges in the suit.
Yet if the judge cuts you off, telling you to just answer questions with a "yes" or a "no," you would have a solid basis for a "judicial bias" challenge on appeal -- given all the digressive speeches he let the prosecution witnesses make.
But Judge Jackson won't cut you off. He'll be flattered that you showed up in his courtroom.
Besides, you'll give him plenty to think about, especially when he is weighing whatever sanctions might be imposed on Microsoft if you lose the case.
Things haven't been going well for Microsoft in the trial so far. So at least in this first round -- before any appeal to a Federal appeals court or to the Supreme Court -- you're fighting to limit the damage.
Just do it.

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT;
Beyond The Bounce In Bond Yields

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
MAYBE it's the weather. Or the post-Christmas, pre-April 15 blues. Whatever the cause, over the last 15 years bond traders have tended to push up interest rates, in some cases quite sharply, in the first few months of the year. And in the process, they have unsettled markets.
The impulse hasn't lasted long, though, because rates have been in a general decline since the early 1980's. 
 Much to the chagrin of equity investors and would-be home buyers, bond yields have moved up again this winter -- in what the market calls a backup -- with the 30-year Treasury at 5.60 percent. Worries abound that the Federal Reserve will exacerbate the trend by tightening credit conditions.
Ian A. MacKinnon, a managing director of the Vanguard Group and head of its fixed-income funds, spent some time last week to share his views on the state of Bondland.
 
Q. What is your explanation for the recent increase in interest rates?
 
A. In the fall, after Russia defaulted and Long-Term Capital almost collapsed, it looked like the world was going to hell in a handbasket. The Federal Reserve Board responded by cutting short-term interest rates three times. But there was a feeling the Fed would need to do more. What we have seen over the last several months is a dissipation of that feeling. In the Treasury market, that has led to the unwinding of flight-to-quality positions established during the crisis.
 
Q. So bond traders are putting primary importance on what is happening in the American economy?
 
A. Last fall there was a feeling the economy would falter. But it has proven to be amazingly resilient, impervious to any sort of shocks from abroad. So the bet no longer is that the economy will weaken. If anything, people are now factoring in some fear that the Fed will tighten monetary policy. But we don't think that is going to happen. The Fed is blessed with a miraculous economy that will grow at a 3 percent rate this year with no inflation to speak of.
Over the last four or five months, long-term Treasury bond yields have risen by almost a full percentage point. But in no way has the inflation outlook worsened by that much. Treasuries represent a very good bargain relative to inflation.
 
Q. Corporate and municipal bond yields didn't fall much at all last fall. How have those groups held up during the recent rise in Treasury yields?
 
A. When there was the flight to quality, all of it went into Treasuries and virtually nothing into corporates. So Treasuries have backed up in yield, and corporates have been pretty stalwart in the face of that. In fact, corporate securities have outperformed Treasuries quite significantly over the last couple of months. And with expectations that the economy will do better this year, corporates ought to do pretty well.
 
Q. Which sectors of the investment-grade corporate bond market do you like?
 
A. In certain sectors, like real estate investment trusts, you can get bonds with yields of close to 7 percent. We also like electric utility bonds and companies in some cyclically insensitive areas, like telecom, cable and supermarkets. All of those ought to do pretty well this year, given that we are looking for moderate-to-brisk growth in the economy and no acceleration of inflation.
 
Q. Last fall, the thinking was that we might fall into a recession in 1999. As you said, that is no longer the prevailing wisdom. Shouldn't a growing economy be good news for high-yield junk bonds as well?
 
A. Yes, it should. The only caveat with junk is you have to be mindful of the earnings pressure these companies are under.
 
Q. Last fall, interest-rate spreads between Treasuries and high-quality municipal bonds disappeared. Are munis still a buy?
 
A. Municipal bonds are still attractive, but not as attractive as they were for weeks and weeks during the fall. Now, with the backup in Treasury yields, AAA municipal bonds yield about 92 percent of Treasuries. If your perspective is longer than the last six months or a year, that is screamingly attractive. But for weeks and weeks last fall those yields were 102 percent of Treasuries.
Still, an insured municipal bond due in 2020 can be had at a 5.10 percent yield. For people in the 28 percent tax bracket, that is a pretax equivalent yield of 7.10 percent. So there are still good deals.
 
Q. Given your economic outlook, have bond yields reached their peak?
 
A. Yes, I think they have, and I think you will see them move lower during the spring and summer. But I see a couple of speed bumps.
One is Y2K. I think there is some likelihood companies will beef up production before year-end and that the increase in inventories will artificially boost gross domestic product, perhaps by one-quarter percentage point or more in the fourth quarter. That might frighten the market.
Also, if we continue to see robust strength in employment, that would make us less positive.

It's High Time for a Fair Shot

BYLINE: By MARTHA ACKMANN; Martha Ackmann is a women's studies professor at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Mass.

 BODY:
The N.B.A.'s second chance has begun. Not the second chance for the Bulls, the Pacers and the like with their truncated season and nail-biting anxiety over fan loyalty. The moment has arrived for the N.B.A. to take a second look and pump up its less indulged offspring. For the N.B.A., an unprecedented opportunity now exists to use its power and money to give women's professional basketball the visibility and respect it has always deserved.
As the owner of the Women's National Basketball Association, the N.B.A. controls the only game in town. With last December's demise of the American Basketball League, the number of fledgling women's professional teams has been cut in half, down to the 12 remaining teams in the W.N.B.A. Fans of the three-year-old A.B.L. with its longer season will have their loyalty tested. Should they turn their support to the rival W.N.B.A. or should they wait and see how the Connecticut Attorney General's inquiry turns out? 
 Less than a month after the A.B.L. went bankrupt, Attorney General Richard Blumenthal issued the N.B.A. a subpoena seeking evidence that the N.B.A. conspired to force the collapse of the A.B.L. "There's evidence that the N.B.A. used sharp economic elbows to exclude the A.B.L., a well-positioned competitor, from fair play -- including access to essential financial rights like TV and product sponsorship," Blumenthal stated.
The N.B.A. delivered the required documents to Blumenthal last Friday. Blumenthal is looking for any material that would indicate the N.B.A. unfairly pressured advertisers, sponsors and TV networks to sign with the W.N.B.A. California has joined the investigation, and other states have expressed interest as well. "It's not against the law to be big, powerful and successful," Blumenthal said. "It is against the law to use that domination to block access to competition."
While some people suspect the N.B.A. squeezed out the A.B.L. in order to create a monopoly on women's basketball, few believe a smoking gun will be found. Historians of women's sports say they have seen it all before.
What's familiar is the takeover by men of women's sports. A similar move occurred in the early 1980's when the National Collegiate Athletic Association swallowed up the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women. Once the N.C.A.A. assumed control, women were virtually locked out of administrative positions on N.C.A.A. governing boards and lost substantial power in shaping policy, choosing personnel and determining the direction of women's collegiate athletics. For women of the A.I.A.W. who had worked diligently to secure a future that would not include the problems that tarnished men's sports -- recruiting abuses, creation of stars first and teams second, and academic shortcomings, to name a few -- the takeover had devastating consequences.
Nowhere were the results more obvious than in coaching statistics. Before N.C.A.A. governance, female coaches led 90 percent of all women's teams. When the N.C.A.A. took over, critics claim it used its men's-club influence to tap collegiate athletic directors who in turn hired male coaches. As a result, the number of women in coaching positions nose-dived to 47 percent.
Many women's sports advocates fear female coaches and sports administrators are already being locked out of the W.N.B.A. Instead of women with long and successful records of collegiate experience being hired, former N.B.A. coaches have been selected for W.N.B.A. teams -- men often with little insight or commitment to women's sports who view working in the women's league as a tolerable transition between "real coaching" and retirement.
Although the W.N.B.A. may point out that only 25 percent of its coaches are former N.B.A. coaches, one can only imagine the reaction if 25 percent of N.B.A. coaches were women with no experience coaching men's teams. Providing female athletes with less than first-rate resources -- coaches with direct experience in the women's game -- is reminiscent of the days before Title IX when the girls' intramural squad played in the antiquated backup gym in 10-year-old uniforms with equipment the boys didn't want.
Of course, salary is another factor that works against the hiring of top female coaches. Few outstanding female college coaches would even think of coaching in the W.N.B.A. They wouldn't make as much money. Nor would they want to trade their full-length season for the brief W.N.B.A. summer one.
Not only do coaches have a right to fair salaries, so also do athletes. And they deserve to play a longer season during traditional basketball months. The A.B.L. crowds at New England Blizzard games in Hartford strongly indicated that fans would support winter games. To be satisfied with only a short summer season that might be incrementally expanded tells women to be grateful for what they have and sit patiently waiting for the "right time" for equality.
In an ideal world, perhaps a women's professional league not controlled by men could make it. But history tells us the chances of that happening are slim. Men's and women's collegiate teams at Tennessee and Connecticut have certainly begun to find a way to share the court. Now it's time for the N.B.A. to move from allowing women in the door to giving them an unblocked shot at success.
Sports are not just fun and games. Jackie Robinson and Billie Jean King knew that. Our world is a better place because they -- and others who supported their struggle for civil rights -- were not eternally patient and demanded more from the sports they loved.
It's time for fans of professional women's basketball to be impatient. Actively so. While we wait and see what becomes of the Connecticut Attorney General's antitrust inquiry, we can demand that the N.B.A. step up its commitment to women. We can go to games, call for competitive salaries, health-care benefits and retirement plans that attract top college coaches and athletes. We can petition television networks to carry games in prime time, and even urge the N.B.A. to shorten its normally outstretched season so that women can share the winter.
"I welcome everyone's impatience," the W.N.B.A.'s president, Val Ackerman, said. "It's flattering."
Now may be one time flattery actually gets women somewhere.

HEADLINE: PRIVATE SECTOR;
Seeing a Forest to Save the Trees

BYLINE: By JON CHRISTENSEN 

DATELINE: PALO ALTO, Calif.

 BODY:
WHILE environmentalists were chained to thousand-year-old redwood trees in the Headwaters forest of northern California, Thomas S. Reid was chained to his computer. He was putting those same trees, along with seabird nesting areas and salmon streams, into a simulation that proved essential to protecting the forest, the largest privately owned grove of ancient redwoods.
Last week, the towering trees were saved from the saws in a last-minute deal involving the Federal Government, the state of California, and the Pacific Lumber Company, owned by Maxxam, a holding company based in Houston. 
 The Federal Government agreed to pay $250 million and California $242 million to acquire the Headwaters forest -- at 10,000 acres, two-thirds the size of Manhattan. The company also agreed to forgo logging for at least 50 years on 7,900 acres in a dozen other old-growth groves.
The day after the deal was reached, Mr. Reid, dressed as usual in casual pants and running shoes, was on the phone trading congratulations and gossip with key negotiators. He is on good terms with all of them, in no small measure because he says he is not one of them. But all sides agree that his contribution was crucial. His richly detailed, computerized maps with color overlays showing those trees, bird habitats and fish streams gave the players a common ground.
"We weren't at the negotiating table," Mr. Reid said, "but we helped build the table back in the shop so that others could negotiate."
Quiet, but earnest and direct, Mr. Reid in fact conducted the negotiations behind the negotiations. He shuttled among the California officials who hired his environmental consulting company, their Federal allies and company executives to secure common understandings on environmental and economic facts and consequences.
Mr. Reid, 51, is one of a new breed of environmentalists who rely on the power of scientific and economic information in their quest to save endangered species or limit pollution.
Using software originally developed for the oil industry, he enabled the negotiators to calculate precisely the trade-offs between cutting timber and saving birds and fish. As each proposal was mapped on his laptop, they could see the economic and environmental gains and losses.
His firm, Thomas Reid Associates, is based in a warren of offices in a rundown building in downtown Palo Alto. Its space is crowded with three computers, boxes of documents and a library of environmental regulations.
The only sign of Mr. Reid's passion for the environment is an inconspicuous poster of a redwood tree that says in small type: "Should something that has lived for 2,000 years die for next quarter's earnings?"
Mr. Reid is proud of his ability to keep his passion out of his work.
"I was not out in the woods hugging trees," he said. "The role that is more useful for us to play is to sustain some objectivity and perceived independence, so that we could give information and not have anybody worry that we're cooking the books."
The agreement, called a habitat conservation plan, was designed to protect coho salmon and the marbled murrelet, a seabird that lays its eggs only on the huge branches of redwood trees that are hundreds of years old. Both are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.
Dozens of participants framed the agreement, from Charles Hurwitz, Maxxam's chairman, to the Interior Secretary, Bruce Babbitt, to the teams of Federal, state and corporate officials, lawyers and biologists.
But those involved say Mr. Reid's work was the foundation for their own.
"It was a tremendously powerful tool," said Phillip J. Detrich, a biologist with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the lead scientist on the Federal negotiating team. "Without it, I can't envision how we could have done this whole process. Those maps that Tom made were the core of that negotiation."
John Campbell, president of Pacific Lumber in Scotia, Calif., said Mr. Reid's work allowed the balancing of competing interests.
"He produced an image that people could interpret and understand," Mr. Campbell said.
Mr. Reid is no stranger to such deals. He left a graduate program in biology at Stanford University in 1972 to start his own consulting company. In 1983, he developed the nation's first endangered-species habitat conservation plan to save the Mission Blue butterfly on San Bruno Mountain in South San Francisco, Calif. A result was 2,750 acres of open space, but also eight development projects -- including homes, offices and hotels -- that were approved on 600 acres. His firm still manages this grassy habitat and its restoration for San Mateo County.
MR. REID'S company has helped create nine other conservation plans in California. His consulting business has grown to about $1.2 million in annual billings, with 16 employees. The Headwaters project was done under a $470,000 contract with the California Department of Forestry.
The Sierra Business Council, representing 500 businesses in the Sierra Nevada region, recently hired Mr. Reid to help plan for economic development and growth while protecting open spaces and threatened species. "He's a biologist, but he's a realist," said the council's director, Lucy Blake. "He understands the economics. He is committed to habitat planning within the constraints of landowners. He is trying to get as much for the resource as he can without having a deal fall apart, which is tricky."
Still, some environmentalists deride the results of Mr. Reid's efforts. The Environmental Protection Information Center in Garberville, Calif., is considering a lawsuit to stop the Headwaters plan, which allows logging on some land in order to protect the rest. "Close to 9,000 acres of marbled murrelet habitat will be liquidated under this plan," said Kevin Bundy, a spokesman for the organization. "Killing endangered species in order to save them doesn't seem that rational."
But even Mr. Bundy praised Mr. Reid's expertise. "I found his work more useful than anyone else's in figuring out what this plan will do," Mr. Bundy said. 'I think he did a good job of making clear what this plan sacrifices. The numbers don't lie."

Less Crime, More Criminals

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN 

 BODY:
LATER this month, the Government will release new figures showing how many Americans are behind bars, and the numbers will reveal that the bull market for prisons is still charging ahead. Nearly 1 of every 150 people in this country is in prison or jail, the Justice Department will announce, a figure no other democracy comes close to matching.
Soon, the total number of people locked up in Federal and state prisons and local jails will likely reach the two million mark, almost double the number a decade ago, as the ranks of prisoners grow enough each year -- to fill Yankee Stadium and then some. For an American born this year, the chance of living some part of life in a correction facility is 1 in 20; for black Americans, it is 1 in 4. 
 Most experts failed to predict that the inmate population would triple from 1980, and now nobody seems to know how to stop the buildup. By all logic, prisons should be experiencing a few vacancies, and the cost of arresting, prosecuting and putting away an army of criminals should be at ebb. After all, the economy could hardly be better, and crime has fallen steeply six years in a row. But a prison peace dividend is nowhere in sight.
Instead, the guessing game now is: At what point does the world's largest penal system hit a plateau -- 2.5 million inmates, 3 million? Surely, if crime continues to fall, the number of new prisoners must also fall.
Not quite. No matter how much crime plummets, the United States will still have to add the equivalent of a new 1,000-bed jail or prison every week -- for perhaps another decade. Federal officials say. Some even believe the prison boom could be permanent, at least for another generation.
A big reason is that so many of the new inmates are drug offenders. In the Federal system, nearly 60 percent of all people behind bars are doing time for drug violations; in state prisons and local jails, the figure is 22 percent. These numbers are triple the rate of 15 years ago.
Americans do not use more drugs, on average, than people in other nations; but the United States, virtually alone among Western democracies, has chosen a path of incarceration for drug offenders. More than 400,000 people are behind bars for drug crimes -- and nearly a third of them are locked up for simply possessing an illicit drug.
"America's internal gulag," is what Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the nation's drug czar, calls the expanding mass of drug inmates. Many of those have committed any number of crimes. But a growing number of them have broken no laws other than the ones on drug use.
In the 1980's, Congress and the states passed drug laws that required judges to put people in prison -- even first-time offenders, or those caught with small amounts of an illicit substance. Mandatory minimum sentences, as they are called, leave no room for a judge to consider special circumstances, or options such as treatment instead of jail.
The idea was that more arrests would lead to more convictions, which would put more people in jail, and the crime rate would fall. That did happen.
ANOTHER dividend was supposed to be a drop in drug use, but that has not happened. Arrests of people who use drugs just hit an all-time high, the F.B.I. reported. At the same time, drug use has gone up among the young, and for drugs like heroin or methamphetamines. Over all, drug use has not budged for 10 years. For virtually all other crimes, of course, the figures are stunning -- with huge drops in murder, robbery and assault. Whether this is because the United States will soon have two million people locked up is subject to much debate.
But many of the authorities who argue that the prison boom has taken the worst criminals out of circulation -- and has thus been the biggest factor in reducing crime -- are at a loss to explain the drug-use figures.
"I am in favor of the Federal Government ceasing and desisting the war on drugs," said Dr. Morgan Reynolds, director of the Criminal Justice Center at the Dallas branch of the National Center for Policy Analysis, a free-market think tank.
He described himself as being on the conservative side of the debate over prisons and crime; he says the crime drop can be directly attributed to the prison boom.
But he is less sure that the Federal Government's war on drugs has an effect on crime rates and drug use.
For liberals and libertarians who have long claimed incarceration has failed to do anything but run up the bill in the drug war, conservative cover is welcome. Last week, Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, introduced a bill to restore discretion for judges in sentencing low-level, nonviolent drug offenders.
"We may be getting to the point of diminishing returns -- the more you expand the prison system, the more small fry you put in there," said Marc Mauer, assistant director of the Sentencing Project, a nonprofit group that has been critical of the prison buildup.
Even some of the architects of punitive drug policies now argue that stuffing the prisons with ever more drug offenders is not a wise investment. Edwin Meese 3d, who was Attorney General under President Ronald Reagan, when most of the drug laws were rewritten, has started to look favorably on treatment for low-level offenders rather than jail.
"I think mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenders ought to be reviewed," said Mr. Meese in an interview. "We have to see who has been incarcerated and what has come from it."
Beyond the laws that send drug offenders to prison with reflexive certainty, there are now institutional incentives to keep locking up more people -- a trend that some people call the prison industrial complex.
The stock price of the Corrections Corporation of America, the nation's largest private jailer, has increased tenfold since 1994. The company's stock is now privately held. But Corrections Corporation has created a popular real estate investment fund to get a return on all those new prisons being built at the rate of one a week.
Unions representing prison guards are the fastest-growing public employee associations in many states. In California last year, the union was given a raise of 12 percent, which brought the salary for a seasoned prison guard up to $51,000.
It is the rare rural community that rejects a new prison in its backyard, with the prospect of permanent, high-paying, benefit-rich government jobs.
The prisons in California, as in virtually every other state, are near capacity, even though the state has built 21 new institutions in the last 15 years. Soon, it will cost nearly $4 billion a year to run the state's prison system. Should the Legislature propose some change in the law that might bring down the growth in prisons, they are likely to hear howls of outrage from the union that has most benefited from the growth in prisons.
"Once you have a society committed to building new prisons and keeping them, it's very difficult to close them down," said Mr. Mauer. "Particularly in rural areas that come to depend on them. It's like trying to close a military base."
The states also have an incentive to keep people in jail a long time. A Federal law passed in 1994 provides matching funds to states to keep violent criminals in prison longer by denying parole. This act and other so-called truth-in-sentencing laws are reasons why the ranks of prisoners will not soon drop, even as crime levels off.
"We've got crime going in one direction, and social policy going in the other," said Dr. Allen J. Beck, the Justice Department's lead statistician on criminal justice trends.
The one thing that may finally slow prison growth, said Mr. Beck, are budget concerns. It costs taxpayers $20,000 a year to house and feed every new inmate -- and that does not include the cost of building new prisons and jails. The states are spending nearly $30 billion to keep people in jail -- about double the rate of 10 years ago.
SOME states are starting to balk. California legislative leaders say they will build no new prisons in coming years, but they have not said what they will do with excess prisoners. In Washington state, a bill that would abolish mandatory minimum prison terms for drug offenders has gained support from judges, prosecutors and tough-on-crime Republicans.
Washington was a pioneer state in enacting laws requiring long lockups, with no chance of early release or leeway for judges to consider other options. But prisons now are the state's fastest-growing part of the budget -- even as crime has nearly bottomed out.
But it will be difficult to change the pattern, with new prisons rising in depressed rural areas. Cleaning up after a crusade, some lawmakers said, has proven much harder than they anticipated.

HEADLINE: The World;
So Much for Grand Theories

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IN the space of a week Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright has searched for a way to use the threat of American military power to end civil war in the world's smallest would-be nation, Kosovo, and for a way to use American economic power to change the behavior of the world's largest and oldest nation, China.
As foreign policy conundrums, the two have little in common, except that both are familiar and both have grown more resistant to American influence. Neither the last-ditch efforts to salvage a peace proposal for Kosovo nor the ritualistic exchanges in Beijing last week are likely to be recalled warmly in Mrs. Albright's memoirs. 
 But these radically different encounters have something odd in common: They have come to mark the two extremes of the Clinton Administration's six-year struggle to bring coherence to American foreign policy in a time that often seems incoherent itself -- a time of confusing ethnic and economic rivalries, of elbowing for position in the pecking order of power.
So as it begins the final quarter of its eight-year game, President Clinton's team still trips over itself setting foreign policy priorities or fully explaining them to Americans, or seeking leverage over foreign potentates, whether in a tiny corner of the Balkans or the vastness of China.
It's no wonder that throughout the 1990's, both the Administration and its critics have flailed about for some grand Unified Field Theory of Foreign Relations -- something as neat as the concept of containment during the cold war -- to define what it should be doing, and in what order.
In 1996, Michael Mandelbaum, a Johns Hopkins University professor, issued a searing critique of the Administration's troubles separating the peripheral from the central; it resonates more loudly today than ever. Kosovo, he says, is "the ultimate social work" and has become "something between a hobby and an obsession" for the Administration. In contrast, he says, "China is truly important, the most strategically vital foreign policy problem we face." Nonetheless, China policy -- like Japan and Russia policy -- is endlessly bounced between the State Department and the Treasury, and efforts at coordination are sporadic. Perhaps it is no surprise that Mrs. Albright's interchanges with Beijing last week about human rights and China's integration into the world economy appeared to have barely moved the conversation much beyond where it was in 1994.
Back then, the Administration thought it had found something approaching a Unified Theory -- that comprehensive economic engagement and "enlargement" with great and small powers would lead, sooner or later, to the spread of both free-market capitalism and democracy. In Mr. Clinton's speeches, the two were usually tightly linked, part of a web of global forces that was moving history America's way. China was the great example, followed immediately by Russia. But it didn't stop there:
Economic engagement explained why peace talks in Northern Ireland or the Middle East were always followed up by an economic conference focused on creating jobs and "enterprise zones" in hopes that prosperity would bring contentment, then hope, then lasting peace.
But these are tough times for unified theories of all kinds. "It's fair to say," one of Mr. Clinton's longest-serving aides mused recently, "that over time we have learned and relearned the lesson that other countries shape their own destiny to a far greater extent than we believed."
Perhaps that explains why Mr. Clinton offered no grand theories in a speech 10 days ago that was billed as an outline of his agenda for the remaining two years of his Presidency. The President delivered what amounted to a list of agenda items: supporting peace (with the use of as few American troops as possible), supporting financial stability (with the use of as little American money as possible), containing weapons of mass destruction and the countries and terrorists who are trying to get hold of them.
WHAT was missing was any attempt to describe which items on the list went to the heart of American interests, or how they interrelated. Even Mr. Clinton's critics expressed some understanding. "Trying to get the bumper sticker term for our foreign policy is a waste of time," said Robert Zoellick, a former Bush Administration official who now heads the Center for Strategic and International Studies here. "But you can have a foreign policy with priority values," he said, "rather than one that is case by case, reactive and designed to immunize political threats at home."
Not surprisingly, there are plenty of grand theories kicking around Washington. That, after all, is what out-of-power foreign policy wonks do. Samuel Huntington, the Harvard political scientist, writes constantly about how ethnic tensions are the nexis of the post-cold war world. Others argue that the key to modern American hegemony is leadership, and thus the United States must get involved in the Bosnias of the world. The spectacle of contagious economic failure has given rise to prescriptions for expanding the powers of international institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, so that they can dictate domestic economic policy to countries on the brink.
And then there are the old cold warriors, some of whom met over lunch last week and raised the possibility of re-creating the Committee on the Present Danger, a Reagan-era anti-Communist group. They spent the rest of lunch debating what constitutes the Present Danger. A weakened Iraq? A starving North Korea? China in the midst of its economic high-wire act?
Their confusion arises from the difficulty in defining national interest these days. And that is the real meaning of the Bosnia to Beijing bookends.
The Clinton Administration came to power far from convinced that Bosnia was a central interest of the United States, then decided that the Balkans (along with Somalia and Haiti) must be, as the horror of it all unfolded on television. But the reality is that while Americans are perfectly happy to see the Secretary of State jetting around the world to strike peace agreements, their willingness to put lives at risk for such causes is limited.
Over time, though, both the public and Congress have come to recognize a second type of national interest: averting economic implosions that could affect American prosperity. Congress screamed when the Administration bailed out Mexico, a move that most now believe avoided a long, ugly recession on America's border. By the time the Asian crisis hit, the objections began to dissipate, and there was barely a peep when the Treasury helped organize the rescues of South Korea and Brazil.
But the Administration's luck ran out when it came to Russia. Ever since the $17 billion I.M.F. package failed last summer, both the Russian economy and Moscow's relationship with Washington have been in a downward spiral.
AND now comes China, the most complex case. No one doubts that Chinese are enjoying greater economic freedom. Or that China iscracking down on political organizers, reverting to elements of a state-run economy and adding to the missiles facing Taiwan.
So Washington has reverted to a mixed message, encouraging moves to get China into the World Trade Organization -- part of that web of economic engagement -- while talking about building a regional missile defense that drives the Chinese up the wall. The Chinese say they recognize America's real strategy and it is both old and familiar: containment. They may be wrong, but at least it's a coherent theory.

Growth Wins Overseas, Too

BYLINE: By RICHARD TEITELBAUM 

 BODY:
Since 1994, United States growth funds have trounced their value-oriented brethren in performance. But it seems that foreign funds, which aren't usually divided by their growth or value orientation, have experienced a similar phenomenon.
According to Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago, foreign funds with a consistent and pronounced growth orientation in their portfolios have beaten their value counterparts in each of the last four years -- 11.33 percent to 10.82 percent in 1995, 14.88 percent to 14.79 percent in 1996, 6.54 percent to 5.4 percent in 1997 and 17.15 to 9.8 percent in 1998. 
 Why the similarity between domestic and foreign funds?
"You've had similar conditions, particularly when you look at Europe versus the United States," said Kevin McDevitt, a Morningstar analyst. Among them, he said, were falling interest rates, low inflation and strong earnings growth. RICHARD TEITELBAUM

HEADLINE: A New Tack for Republicans

 BODY:
President Clinton put Republicans on the defensive when he proposed to tap most of the budget surplus in the next 15 years to shore up Social Security and pay down the national debt, not to cut taxes as they wanted. Most voter surveys show that Americans embrace Mr. Clinton's choice. Now, in their first formal response to the President's budget, the Republicans have tried to outdo him by setting aside even more money for Social Security than Mr. Clinton proposed. They would also defer their tax cuts for at least two years. Their new approach is a step in the right direction. But it has many flaws, including unacceptable cuts in Medicare and other domestic spending.
The Republican move reflects a clear recognition that the party's lawmakers cannot be seen as less than zealous about protecting Social Security. At present, the system generates a surplus. But while economists disagree on the timing, it will plunge into insolvency as baby boomers retire. For many years the Social Security surplus has been used to pay for other spending in the budget, and the Republicans now say they want to end that practice right away. The problem with such a step is that, as some Republicans have acknowledged, it would require steep budget cuts next year. The Republicans have already said they want spending increases in defense and some education programs, so the cuts would have to come in myriad other programs that they have not yet specified. 
 There are always places to find budget savings. The White House's proposal for an increase in cigarette taxes would provide some revenue to avoid cuts. Representative John Kasich, chairman of the House Budget Committee and a likely Presidential candidate, has long promised to get tough on unnecessary Federal subsidies to business known as "corporate welfare." But even if these savings materialize, it is doubtful that the Republicans can reach their goal without gutting vital programs in health, nutrition and the environment.
The new Republican budget is a little more realistic on tax cuts. It deals a rebuff to Mr. Kasich, the House's biggest advocate of immediate across-the-board tax cuts, by recognizing that there is not enough money available for significant tax cuts right now. But the plan violates common sense by proposing tax cuts for the years ahead. No one can be sure what the economy will look like in three years, and tax cuts should not be enacted until Congress figures out how to rescue the nation's other big program threatened with insolvency, Medicare, which is due to run deficits in less than 10 years. The White House's call for Medicare reform, including an expansion of some services like prescription drugs, ought to be one of this Congress's biggest priorities.
For all their problems, the Republicans are to be commended for beginning to wrestle with the budget problems. Nothing can be done unless each positive step by one side is met with a positive gesture by the other side. The conventional wisdom in Washington is that in the current poisonous atmosphere, Congress and the White House cannot think big thoughts or do big things. The new Republican budget proposals are vague and full of pitfalls, but they could also hasten serious negotiations and compromises in everyone's interest.

HEADLINE: Stock Markets, Facing Threats, Pursue Changes

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
Threatened by competitors that are grabbing a growing share of America's booming stock-trading business, the nation's biggest stock markets are trying to transform themselves by forming alliances with their foes and adopting some of their practices.
If the transformation works as its advocates hope, it could provide investors, big and small, with better service at lower prices. But if it goes awry, it could damage a stock market whose strength and fairness have attracted foreign capital, fostered the growth of new businesses, and provided opportunities for many millions of investors. 
 In recent weeks, the New York Stock Exchange, where traders have met on a central trading floor for 207 years, has said it might build or buy its own electronic trading network, where brokers or customers could trade stocks -- especially popular stocks like Intel or Microsoft -- listed on other exchanges. The Nasdaq market, an electronic marketplace linked by telephones and computer terminals, has acknowledged it is discussing possible alliances with private trading networks. And the largest such network, the Instinet unit of Reuters Group P.L.C., said it had talked with both Nasdaq and the New York exchange about alternative ways to trade stocks.
Some experts fear that the changes afoot will shatter the existing marketplace into many smaller and more volatile markets, making it harder for investors to be assured the best price for their trades. They also worry that as the New York Stock Exchange competes for business with other trading networks, it will be less insistent on enforcing the tough standards it imposes on companies that want to be listed there. Those standards, such as requiring that a majority of a company's board be independent outsiders, are intended to protect shareholders and are stricter than Federal securities laws.
Finally, the changes could put pressure on the American market to allow big investors to operate with greater secrecy, to the disadvantage of small investors.
"Competition is a good thing, but it can have some unintended consequences," warned John C. Coffee Jr., securities law professor at Columbia University and a member of advisory committees at both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.
Despite the dangers, market officials and professional traders say that preserving the status quo is no longer an option. As technology improves, investors are demanding faster, cheaper ways to trade securities -- and if America's existing markets don't respond to those demands, someone else will.
"You can't get in the way of the market," said Frank G. Zarb, chairman of the National Association of Securities Dealers, which operates both the Nasdaq and the American Stock Exchange. "The old methods of exchanging stocks just no longer meet the needs of the investing community."
That community has undergone drastic change in recent years. Unprecedented numbers of Americans are participating in the stock market in unprecedented numbers, directly and through mutual funds and pension plans. Moreover, they have easier access to the markets than ever before, thanks to low-cost on-line brokerage accounts, Internet investing sites and the new trading networks. Finally, they and their counterparts abroad are more readily investing far from home.
All of this has touched off a stunning acceleration in the competition among the institutions that provide stock-trading services, said Richard A. Grasso, the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange.
The exchange and the Nasdaq, not-for-profit associations accustomed to competing only with one another, now face a plethora of new private trading networks called electronic communications networks, or E.C.N.'s. The owners of these trading services aim to make money by providing an electronic meeting place where stocks can be traded, and by collecting commissions on each trade.
In addition, the New York exchange, a leader in foreign stock trading, is anticipating a foreign threat. Now that Europe has a single currency, a pan-European stock exchange may soon emerge, perhaps this year.
To be sure, this competition, which one legal scholar said had become "as contagious as chickenpox in the third grade," is driving down the commissions that investors pay to trade. "Competition can create confusion, but on balance, the individual investor is being empowered," said Hans Stoll, a finance professor at Vanderbilt University.
But that confusion is unsettling, many market participants said. "The technology is the tail wagging the dog," said Scott H. Saber, a former trader and senior vice president at VIE Systems, an institutional software provider. "No one is saying: 'Is this the best way? How will this impact the market?' They just say, 'We can do this and make money.' "
His concern, while echoed by others, does not do justice to the time that both the N.A.S.D. and New York exchange -- and their regulators -- have applied to the question of building a better stock market. But it does reflect how problematic their preliminary ideas are turning out to be.
Take the New York Stock Exchange's consideration of building or buying its own electronic network for trading stocks not listed on the exchange. Mr. Grasso, the exchange's chairman, said he expected to report his opinion on the proposal to the board by the end of June.
But if the Big Board readily trades stocks of companies that have not met its tough listing standards, it may find it harder to enforce those rules, Professor Coffee said.
And some of those standards provide important protections for American investors, he added. For example, the New York exchange requires listed companies to have wholly independent audit committees and a majority of independent directors -- neither of which is required under Federal securities laws.
Mr. Grasso insisted that protecting the standards and reputation of the exchange would be paramount as his board considered adding a second trading service. "You may well be asking the question that causes us not to do this," he said.
The boom in electronic communications networks was actually encouraged by rule changes intended to improve the Nasdaq market.
Those rules allowed electronic communications networks to post orders from their customers on Nasdaq computer screens. Each time one of these orders was filled through the Nasdaq system, the E.C.N. received a small commission.
Those potential profits encouraged big Wall Street firms and others to form their own private trading networks.
There are now at least a half-dozen of these private networks, which make it harder for even professional investors to find the best trading prices. "The concept of a central marketplace has gone out the window," complained Victor Babin, senior vice president and director of equity trading for the Oppenheimer Funds. "I now have to check four, five, or even six different markets to be sure I'm getting the best price."
Market fragmentation is especially onerous for amateurs, said William C. Freund, a market economist at Pace University. Individual investors may not realize that low commissions for on-line trading may not make up for the extra money they can spend if they do not find the best market price for their shares.
Nasdaq is trying to knit its market together again. By the end of the year, for example, the prices at which trades are conducted on E.C.N.'s will be included in Nasdaq's consolidated price quotations.
It has also proposed more sweeping changes that would incorporate features of the Big Board's face-to-face trading floor into Nasdaq's electronic environment. Specifically, Nasdaq dealers would be able to electronically match up buyers and sellers, for a fee.
That would help Nasdaq compete with the electronic trading services, a senior market official said. But the N.A.S.D., like the Big Board, has also been discussing the possibility of joining forces with some of those trading services, notably Instinet, to create a new Nasdaq structure.
Mr. Zarb of the N.A.S.D. would not discuss the talks, but Douglas Atkin, chief executive of Instinet, said the conversations had grown "more frequent and serious in the past six months."
Instinet and many of its counterparts now have a substantial competitive edge. Unlike Nasdaq and the Big Board, they allow investors to trade anonymously. Influential investors like Fidelity Investments can sell a substantial amount of stock more easily if others do not know that they are shedding shares.
But some market experts worry that Nasdaq and the New York exchange will be pressed to extend the same secrecy to large investors, or risk losing trading volume to the competition.
Foreign competition could ratchet up the pressure, Professor Coffee said. Some foreign exchanges do not require stock prices to be reported as promptly as in the American market. Nasdaq prices must be disclosed within 90 seconds; in London, the deadline is 24 hours -- a boon to major investors but a big disadvantage to smaller players.
Both Mr. Grasso and Mr. Zarb said they were confident that market leaders and the Securities and Exchange Commission could preserve the transparency and fairness of the American marketplace.
But they emphasized that regulators must take "a leadership role." With an informal nod from the S.E.C., the N.A.S.D. is recruiting a committee of top Wall Street executives to study how the public will be affected by these pressures, senior market officials said Friday.
Meanwhile, Americans face the possibility that their market leaders may still be working on the ark when the rain begins. What happens if stock prices plunge, spreading panic among the ranks of newly empowered investors, before the marketplace is finished reinventing itself?
Most likely, market leaders agreed, investors will stampede back to the time-tested institutions -- the Big Board and the Nasdaq.
"If there's a downdraft," said Mr. Zarb of the N.A.S.D., "the trading comes back to us."

HEADLINE: For the Homeless, Rebirth Through Socrates

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER 

DATELINE: SOUTH BEND, Ind., March 2

 BODY:
The students, mostly in sweat shirts and jeans, sit around a long table dotted with soda cans and cookies and consult their highlighted copies of Plato's "Apology." Two professors guide their debate over whether Socrates, on the verge of execution, was arrogant or humble. Outside, the sun sets on the neogothic campus.
There could hardly be a more archetypal college scene than this one in the University of Notre Dame's O'Shaughnessy Building, with its seven stained glass windows representing the seven liberal arts, ancient disciplines from rhetoric to astronomy. Yet the 10 students in this weekly seminar fit no typical profile for Notre Dame or any university. They are current or former residents of the South Bend Center for the Homeless, men and women with the weathered features and oblique emotional balances of those who have spent many nights in the streets. 
 It may seem quaint, if not useless, to bring philosophical literature to the homeless, an idea conceived in some pristine ivory tower. But that is not how the students view it.
"Those of us in the grip of addiction use this process to rethink our lives," said Michael A. Newton, 50, originally of New York City, who has been homeless for 16 months. "Socrates makes clear that you have to have the courage to examine yourself and to stand up for something. A lot of us have justified our weaknesses for too long a time."
This class, which includes works by Shakespeare, Montaigne and Melville, was inspired by Earl Shorris, a New York author, who created a humanities course for the poor, although not necessarily homeless, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan four years ago.
There are now seven such courses in the country and 40 more are planned in the next five years. Money is coming from various sources, including the Federal Department of Education, foundations and state commissions on the humanities. Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson in Dutchess County is taking a central role and offering credit to those who complete the courses that it is sponsoring.
"Martin Luther King Jr. said years ago that a man can't ride your back unless it is bent," said Louis M. Nanni, executive director of the South Bend Center for the Homeless. "This is just one more way for our guests to straighten their backs."
There is evidence that these courses have impact. Mr. Shorris said the first course he offered at the Roberto Clemente Family Guidance Center on 13th Street in 1994-95 began with 31 students.
"Along the way," he said, "1 died of AIDS, 3 became pregnant, 2 seriously ill. We had 17 who completed the course. Of those, 14 earned six credits from Bard. Of those, 11 are enrolled today in a four-year college, 5 of them at Bard."
Students in the eight-week course here earn a Notre Dame credit if they do the reading, attend class regularly and pass the examination. One student, Karyn Tanis, a former heroin addict who has been something of a class star, has high hopes of starting Notre Dame next fall with financial assistance.
Other students say they love the feeling that coming to class at Notre Dame gives them and the regimen of reading and discussion. Their personal stories often have the weight of classic tragedy -- abuse, addiction, economic ruin -- and their relationship to the texts can be deeply personal.
For example, a recent class dealt with Melville's "Billy Budd," whose title character does not know his parents' identity.
Timothy W. Ferguson, 43, a recovering crystal methamphetamine addict, who has lived at the homeless center since January, knows that feeling. He was adopted as a child. When he found his birth parents seven years ago, he discovered that they, too, were addicts. The experience set him reeling. He lost his job, his wife and his home, a story he shared in class.
Another student, Ted West, 39, from Goshen, Ind., with sunken cheeks and a handlebar mustache, explained the value of the course this way:
"When you come out of the fog of addiction, you thirst for knowledge. You feel there is so much you missed. For 20 years, I never had a goal beyond where my next glass of vodka was coming from. When Socrates talks about the pleasure of knowledge, I know exactly what he means."
He added by way of background: "My health was miserable, my life was failing. I was vomiting blood, I weighed 139 pounds. I was hanging around with crazy people. I couldn't even light a cigarette, I was so shaky. It took me a couple pints of vodka to go to sleep at night. Now I need structure in my life and reading these books has become an important form of structure."
For the course's two professors, F. Clark Power and Stephen M. Fallon, both in the program of liberal studies, teaching the homeless has been a revelation.
"It may sound odd but I feel grateful to have the chance to look at these texts through their eyes," said Professor Power, who is a developmental psychologist by training.
When the issue of mortality came up, one student said simply, "Anyone who has been an addict understands mortality."
When "The Tempest" was discussed, Professor Fallon, a literary critic, recalled: "They grasped the mix of Man and Nature that Shakespeare meant. They have insights into the texts I had not heard."
The idea of teaching the great books beyond the traditional classroom dates at least to the 1920's, when Mortimer Adler, the psychologist who went on to become director of editorial planning for the Encyclopedia Britannica, began offering seminars in New York City to working adults. It was, he argued, a requirement of American democracy that all citizens become educated and articulate. Later, Robert Maynard Hutchins further developed the great books idea for the public at the University of Chicago.
Mr. Shorris went to Chicago in the Hutchins era and was deeply affected by his years there. But it was not until he was exploring the nature of American poverty for a 1997 book, "New American Blues" (Norton), that he had an insight into how the great books could help the poor. It occurred, epiphany-like, when he met Viniece Walker, a prisoner in the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility in Westchester County.
"You've got to teach the moral life of downtown," she told him cryptically. It turned out she meant high culture: plays, museums, concerts, literature. The way out of poverty, Mr. Shorris said he believed, was politics. Ms. Walker was saying that to grasp politics, to enter the public world, the poor first had to learn to reflect. Art and the humanities were a gateway to reflection.
As Mr. Shorris put it in his book and a September 1997 Harper's Magazine article derived from it: "The poor did not need anyone to release them; an escape route existed. But to open this avenue to reflection and politics a major distinction between the preparation for the life of the rich and the life of the poor had to be eliminated."
Mr. Shorris has formed a non-profit organization, the Bard College Clemente course in the humanities, whose board includes former Mayor David N. Dinkins and Starling Lawrence, editor in chief at W. W. Norton, which has donated to the courses many copies of its books, including "World Masterpieces Anthology."
Martin Kempner, a philosopher, has been hired to direct the Bard College program and the five-year expansion to almost 50 sites. Of the existing seven courses, four are in New York City and one each in New Brunswick, N.J., Seattle and Anchorage, Alaska. Abroad, Mr. Shorris has started or is planning similar courses at the University of British Columbia and in Yucatan, Mexico, and Marseilles, France.
This fall, Bard College hopes to start courses in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Oklahoma City, Tampa, Fla., Portland, Ore., Boston, Holyoke, Mass., and two or three in Connecticut.
The Bard courses all follow a rigorous pattern and are longer and more extensive than the one offered at Notre Dame. Classes meet twice a week for two semesters and cover a wider array of texts. The Notre Dame professors say they drew their inspiration from Mr. Shorris but have limited their courses to eight weeks because of the transitory nature of those living in the homeless center. But, they add, a number of students continue from session to session.
Denis Kazmierczak, 54, a former flower arranger and actor, is one of them. He says the course has been a "sanctuary, someplace I can go where people appreciate me for my mind."
Then Mr. Kazmierczak elaborated: "It is hard to find beauty when you are in the situation we are in. But I have come to realize through the reading that, in some ways, everybody is homeless. You can be sitting in your fancy penthouse apartment looking out at the world but your life can be hollow. Now my mind is active, I have picked up a lost thread. Who knows? Maybe one day I'll write the great American novel."

HEADLINE: West Virginia Pares Welfare, but Poor Remain

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: CHARLESTON, W.Va.

 BODY:
They cannot fit many more people into the St. John's Episcopal Church auditorium, where free breakfast and lunch are available daily to the needy. In recent weeks, volunteers have set up tables on the stage to accommodate crowds now reaching 250 a meal.
Not far from the church, at the West Virginia Health Right free clinic, doctors are tending to so many patients, about 12,000 a year, that plans are under way for a new building, three times the size of the existing one. Patricia H. White, the administrator, said the doctors are likely to see 15,000 patients this year. 
 Sojourners, a shelter for women and families near the clinic, has been at full capacity, 75 people, for months. "At times, we're overwhelmed," said Margaret Taylor, the director. "But we've got fold-out cots, cribs, even dresser drawers for babies."
These scenes and others around West Virginia reflect what people who provide services to the poor here regard as the unintended consequences of the welfare overhaul, in which the Federal Government shifted responsibilities to the states and the states imposed time limits for people to find work.
Since West Virginia's system was expanded from 9 counties in its first year, 1997, to all 55 last year, the state has achieved a caseload reduction of 61 percent, ranking fifth in the nation. But as one of the poorest states, where unemployment is high and the national economic boom is little more than an echo, West Virginia has performed much better in paring welfare rolls than in helping people find jobs.
In large measure, the state's caseload reduction has been achieved by knocking off the rolls the families of poor disabled children who were receiving Supplemental Security Income, a Federal program for people with special medical needs. And in a system that requires people to find jobs after two years of receiving assistance and sets a five-year lifetime limit on benefits, little more than a third of former welfare recipients have found jobs -- well below the national average of about 50 percent, recent studies show.
While the caseload reduction has saved the state money -- $63 million through last year -- it has also left thousands of people who were on public assistance, including many with minimum-wage jobs, to depend on free community services for the barest essentials.
Many advocates say that West Virginia is carrying the cost-cutting ethos of the welfare overhaul too far. Recent Federal data showed that West Virginia had proportionately more unspent Federal welfare dollars from savings, about 65 percent, than almost all other states.
But as state administrators debate how to spend the savings, people are struggling.
"There are families out there in terrible shape, and we don't know how they are surviving," said State Senator Martha Y. Walker, chairwoman of the Senate's Committee for Health and Human Resources.
And people who provide services here predict that conditions will grow worse as more people lose benefits in the years ahead.
"There are going to be a lot of devastated people out there," said Sandy McGrath, assistant director of Sojourners. "The state jumped in too quickly for people to meet the guidelines without doing the research on how it will affect them. Five years looks good. But then you have circumstances like the job search, arranging child care, finding transportation. How are they supposed to do all that?"
Ms. White, the clinic administrator, said: "In three to five years, we will be having more women being arrested. The reason is, they are not going to let their kids go hungry. So they'll steal, and we'll build more prisons to house them."
Officials at the State Department of Health and Human Resources say the declining number of people receiving welfare benefits proves that the new system is working.
But they concede they were unprepared for the wide discretion they got when the Federal Government shifted responsibilities to the states to run their own welfare systems. Facing no major objections from Gov. Gaston Caperton, the out-going two-term Democrat, from state lawmakers or even from the state's leading service providers, welfare officials said they believed the program they began developing in 1995, West Virginia Works, would work.
But a lack of middle-class jobs, along with a recent court challenge attacking the state decision to count Supplemental Security Income as family income for determining welfare benefits, has prompted state welfare officials to admit they need to re-examine their efforts.
"Our program still needs tinkering," said Jack B. Frazier, Commissioner of the Bureau for Children and Families. "Some counties simply don't have the jobs to apply for. The employment base is not there."
To ease the transition off welfare, state officials included several amendments to the new time limits, like allowing recipients just entering the work force to earn income that is not used to determine eligibility for cash assistance and offering a 10 percent increase in welfare benefits to a couple if they are married as an incentive to promote family stability.
But people like Ms. White and Ms. Taylor argue that officials did too little to ease the sting, underestimating some of West Virginia's indigenous characteristics that work against reform, like rugged terrain that makes transportation a problem, the large number of families who have relied on welfare for generations and the lack of programs that adequately prepare people with virtually no work skills.
Those conditions have contributed to chronic poverty in West Virginia, a state of 1.8 million people. Last year, unemployment in the state was 6.6 percent, the lowest in 20 years but well above the national average of 4.5 percent.
Nonetheless, West Virginia has been among the most aggressive states in reducing the percentage of welfare recipients, ranking behind only Idaho (85 percent), Wyoming (84 percent), Wisconsin (77 percent) and Mississippi (64 percent). But after the largest category of former recipients in West Virginia -- the 35.3 percent of people who found jobs -- the next biggest reason for the decline resulted from the decision to count Supplemental Security Income like all other unearned income, including child support and veterans benefits, as income.
The new Federal welfare law gave states the option to count S.S.I. in determining welfare support. Idaho was the only other state to do so, and a spokesman for the State Department of Health and Welfare said it had no plans to reconsider.
Here, that decision alone accounted for almost a fifth of the decline in the number of welfare recipients, saving $16 million. But it also prompted legal action against the state by two mothers of children receiving S.S.I. benefits. The mothers argued in a class-action lawsuit in Federal District Court that that benefit for children was unrelated to the overhaul of the welfare system and should not be counted as income.
Margaret Sanders, 35, an unemployed woman who is not involved in the lawsuit, is typical of those who would be helped by it. She said she lost $149 in monthly welfare benefits when the state began counting her 13-year-old son's S.S.I. benefits of $494 as family income. "Even with that, it was hard to survive," she said after lunch at the church. "Now, I don't buy myself anything, clothes, tennis shoes or anything."
Last month, a judge ruled against the state and directed officials to outline how family income would be determined without using S.S.I. benefits for children. Mr. Frazier said the state was preparing to comply with the ruling, and two state lawmakers have introduced legislation that would eliminate all S.S.I. benefits from welfare considerations, measures that are expected to pass.
Restoring welfare benefits lost through S.S.I. is one way the state plans to disburse savings. Mr. Frazier said officials also intended to spend $20 million to raise monthly welfare benefits for the first time in more than a decade; $8 million to help job prospects who need such basics as eyeglasses and false teeth, and $8 million for transportation.
But Ms. White and others worry that those efforts could fall well short of the need if welfare recipients are held to the new time limits or if the state economy takes a downturn.
"It's very sad," said Wanda Long, who has been assistant director of the church soup kitchen for nine years. "A lot of these people have apartments, and some even work small jobs. They can pay for rent. But they have no money left over for food or personal items, like soap powder. We usually give them a small can of food or a sandwich or a container with leftovers. Otherwise, they wouldn't have any supper."

HEADLINE: Handful of States Still Tax the Very Poor

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
After seven years in which surging revenues have allowed 41 states to cut taxes, 19 states continue to tax the incomes of those below the Federal poverty line, according to a study by a Washington research group. Six of those states, including New Jersey, tax people who have so little money that even if they doubled their incomes, they would still be officially classified as poor.
Last year, however, two more states, Kansas and Mississippi, revised their income tax laws to exempt the poor, according to the study, by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonprofit organization that studies how government policies affect low-income people. 
 Taxing the incomes of poor people at a time when governments are trying to move people off welfare and into work illustrates how tax policies can create obstacles to changing welfare. Most people leaving welfare find only low-income jobs, often just the minimum wage.
"Clearly, changes in the tax system can help efforts to move people off welfare and into work," said Scott Mackey, chief economist for the National Conference of State Legislatures. "That is why a handful of states have adopted or expanded their earned income tax credit program, to provide more of an incentive to work."
Elizabeth Nichols, co-author of the budget center's study, agreed. "Income tax relief," she said, "is one of the simplest ways states can help low-income working families to meet the costs of child care, transportation and other expenses and thereby become self-sufficient."
Kentucky imposes the heaviest income tax burden on poor families, followed closely by Alabama and Hawaii, the budget center said. Kentucky taxes the incomes of families of four making as little as $5,000. A family making the Federal poverty-line income, which was $16,655 last year for two parents with two children, paid $550 in Kentucky income taxes last year, the center said.
State Representative Jim Wayne, a Democrat, said Kentucky had a progressive tax system in the 1940's, when the state first taxed incomes.
"Today, because taxes haven't been adjusted for inflation for a half-century, Kentucky's system is regressive," Mr. Wayne said.
Someone earning $19,000 would pay Kentucky income, sales, property and other taxes equal to 10.5 percent of income, he said, compared with only 8.2 percent for someone earning $214,000.
Kentucky is tripling its standard deduction over three years as part of a strategy to reduce the income tax burdens on the working poor, said Melissa Forsythe, press secretary to Gov. Paul E. Patton, a Democrat.
New Jersey, which has passed some of the biggest tax cuts in the country over the last few years, is another of the six states that tax people making less than half the poverty line. The other states are Alabama, Hawaii, Illinois and Virginia.
In Trenton, Assembly Speaker Jack Collins and Joseph V. Doria Jr., the minority leader, have sponsored a bill that would remove 200,000 low-income people from the state income tax roles. Gov. Christine Todd Whitman has said she supports the bill.
Last year was the first time in recent decades that a majority of states exempted the poor from their income tax systems, the budget center said. Of the 42 states with an income tax, 23 exempt families of three or four whose incomes are at or below the official poverty line.

HEADLINE: Unforeseen, Strife Eases For Algeria

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: ALGIERS, March 6

 BODY:
As the afternoon call to prayers rang through the cobbled alleyways of the Casbah, Mouloud Takdjout settled into a comfortable niche in the old city wall and watched fellow Muslims hurry past.
Dangling a cigarette from his mouth, the 50-year-old "wall man" -- the nickname Algerians give to their millions of unemployed -- tapped his foot to the mesmeric beat of a Berber pop song playing on his transistor radio, and talked of an Algeria that may at last be emerging from a nightmare. "Everything has an end, including this, and we are within sight of the finish," he said, referring to the savage war between Algeria's military rulers and Islamic guerrilla groups that has taken at least 80,000 lives since it began in 1992. 
 The strife erupted after the shadowy group of generals who hold real power in this nation of 28 million canceled a second round of elections that were on the verge of securing a parliamentary majority for a militant Islamic party.
The Casbah, a maze of streets in the old Turkish quarter of Algiers, became for all but its long-term residents almost completely off-limits, its vitality dulled by the lurking presence of Islamic guerrillas who used it as a base for bombings, ambushes and assassinations, terrorizing Algiers as their allies outside the capital terrorized much of the rest of the country.
In many cases, the dead were civilian women and children, sometimes babies only a few months old. Often the killers cut victims' throats, burned them alive, gouged out their eyes, or hacked them to pieces. Few foreigners ventured into the legendary Casbah, even with the usual posse of armed bodyguards. Rumors of Government complicity in the violence have abounded, but -- despite promises -- the generals have never allowed international human rights groups to investigate the allegations.
Now, to the surprise of many Algerians, the situation has eased. A presidential election, scheduled for April 15, has come alive, with 11 candidates representing an array of political opinions, and a promise from the army not to interfere, as it has in the past. There is, however, widespread concern that the generals have so far refused to allow independent election observers, a proposal endorsed by the European Union and the United States.
Still, there have been many positives. The group of generals who control the Government, known to French-speaking Algerians as "Le Pouvoir" -- The Power -- reached a cease-fire pact in 1997 with the Islamic Salvation Army, the guerrilla group that started the war. In September, the retired general who held formal power as President, Liamine Zeroual, stunned the nation by resigning 19 months before the end of his five-year term, ushering in the ballot in April.
Many Algerians have concluded that a faction among the generals, known as "The Conciliators," have been so shocked by the years of violence that they have decided they should begin transferring at least some power to elected politicians if Algeria is to have any hope of ending its crisis. Senior Government officials are among those who say there can be no final answer until Algeria rebuilds its economy and finds work for millions of unemployed, especially in the 70 percent of the population under 30, commonly described here as "a standing reserve force" for the guerrillas.
"Just like the power structure in the Soviet Union, we have been ruled by a monolith, but it is a monolith with deep internal fissures," said Hocine Ait-Ahmed, a 73-year-old presidential candidate who was one of nine men who in 1954 founded the National Liberation Front, which led the Algerian war of independence against France. "The generals are divided among themselves, and that has given us a small opening."
Mr. Takdjout's laid-back demeanor was emblematic of the new mood. Only 18 months ago, edicts by the Armed Islamic Group, a guerrilla faction known for its brutality, imposed a fearful conformity on the Casbah that included mandatory attendance at prayers and bans on music and cigarette smoking. Women were barred from venturing out unveiled, or unaccompanied.
Since the cease-fire, the violence has plunged. Fewer than 200 people died in terrorist attacks during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan that ended in February, compared with more than 1,600 in that period in 1998. Even the generals and the Islamic hard-liners seem to have turned against intolerant politics.
 
Disillusionment With Both Sides
"The Islamists? They are rubbish, killers and thieves, nothing more," said Mr. Takdjout, his face shaded by a sailor's cap acquired when he worked in the customs house in the port of Algiers. That was before strife and plunging oil prices sent the economy into a free fall, before he lost his job, and before Islamic guerrillas burst into the home of his brother Omar, a policeman, and shot him to death in front of his family.
Like scores of other Algerians interviewed recently, Mr. Takdjout seemed equally disillusioned with the military rulers. "They're finished now, the Islamists, and good riddance to them, I say," he said. "But it's finished for the generals, too. Algeria's going to be a democracy, you'll see."
Not all Algerians are as quick to write off the guerrillas or the Islamic Salvation Front, which won the support of half the voters in the aborted election in December 1991. With the party banned and its leaders imprisoned, there is no way to know the Islamic group's intentions. Foreign reporters, who are accompanied everywhere by Government bodyguards, are told that the leaders are not available for interviews.
The same goes for Mr. Zeroual and the generals, making it hard to assess how they see the future, particularly the prospect that the April ballot might lead to a South Africa-style investigation into alleged Government involvement in massacres.
The Armed Islamic Group still accounts for dozens of victims each month. This week, it was blamed for an attack in Ain Defla, southwest of Algiers, in which nine members of two families were killed. The throats of four, all children under 10, had been cut. Only days before, a bomb attributed to the group killed four in nearby Khemis Miliana.
The Armed Islamic Group, which the State Department calls one of the world's most dangerous terrorist groups, continues to tie up an Algerian security force of as many as 500,000 soldiers and police officers. Little is known about the group beyond the fact that some of its leaders trained as volunteers against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. Western intelligence estimates have put its strength at about 3,000 men, but this is little more than a guess.
 
A History of Power Wielded From Shadows
And Algeria's politics remain opaque, as they have been since 1965, when the army swept aside Algeria's first President only three years after independence. Riots in the late 1980's forced the generals to accept a multiparty political system and an independent press. But much remains unknowable. The men who exercise real control are only seen when their armored cars race up to heavily protected compounds overlooking the Bay of Algiers.
Some things about the coming election have run ominously true to past form. Two parties that are effectively controlled by the military oligarchy, the National Liberation Front and the closely linked National Democratic Rally, have chosen as their candidate Abdelaziz Bouteflika, a 61-year-old former Foreign Minister. Mr. Bouteflika's last role here was in the 1970's, under the dictatorial rule of the country's first military leader, Houari Boumedienne.
For at least 16 years, until he returned to Algeria last month, Mr. Bouteflika is said to have made a living in Switzerland as an adviser to nations in the Persian Gulf. Editors of the independent newspapers that have sprung up in Algiers in the 1990's say they have little to judge him by; he has made no public comments on Algerian issues in years. And, since entering the election, he has made no policy statements.
About the only issue he has addressed has been his health, following reports that one of his last calls in Switzerland was at a Geneva hospital. Friends say he suffers from kidney disease. Presenting his nomination papers this week, Mr. Bouteflika said only, "Just as some people exercise their right to speak, I exercise the right to remain silent."
Among the other candidates are several with long histories of serving as civilian ministers in military-led Governments. Three of them are former Prime Ministers, including an engineer, Sid Ahmed Ghozali, 61, who issued the edict voiding the December 1991 elections in which the Islamic Salvation Front appeared headed for a parliamentary sweep.
The field also includes a moderate Muslim, Ahmed Taleb Ibrahimi. A 67-year-old doctor who spent five years in French jails for his role in the independence struggle, he was a stalwart of military-led Governments through the 1970's and 80's, rising to Foreign Minister. But partly because his father was one of Algeria's leading Islamic scholars, he is expected to draw support from those who gave their votes in 1991 to the Islamic Salvation Front.
This alone, many Algerians believe, could make him Mr. Bouteflika's strongest challenger in a free vote. But Mr. Ibrahimi and several other candidates remain fearful of a backlash by a hard-line military group known as "The Eradicators" for their policy in the early years of the violence to eliminate the guerrillas and their political leaders by whatever means necessary.
With Algerian newspapers putting every Government electoral maneuver on their front pages, Mr. Zeroual went on television last month to offer assurances of a fair vote. Then came an interview in an army magazine, El Djeich, in which the commander, Gen. Mohammed Lamari, pledged neutrality, saying the army's only concern was the security of the 16 million voters. Suggestions to the contrary, he said, were "pernicious and tendentious" and aimed at deceiving Algerians.
But political veterans note that similar assurances have preceded other rigged elections. .
Mr. Ghozali, the former Prime Minister, said in an interview that attempts to sway the vote in Mr. Bouteflika's favor had already begun, by using local authorities to help gather the 400,000 signatures that backed his nomination papers, at least double the number presented by any other candidate. "Nothing has changed," he said. "The Algerian Army has always been a political institution, and it remains so now."
If the hard-liners stay their hands, said Mr. Ibrahimi, he believes that he can defeat Mr. Bouteflika and steer Algeria toward a society that would be both democratic and Islamic, but without the excesses of Islamic takeovers elsewhere. "What most Algerians want is an Islam of tolerance and moderation, not the Islam of Afghanistan," he said. "Now, after this trial of blood, with the winds of democracy blowing, we have a chance to achieve that. If we succeed, we will create a model for the rest of the Arab and Muslim world."
But skeptics see powerful reasons for the generals to see Mr. Bouteflika elected and then act through him to protect their power. And that could thwart any probe of their past, although several candidates, including Mr. Ibrahimi, have suggested an amnesty for all but the worst outrages.
 
In 'Triangle of Death,' A Cry for Peace
In an attempt to answer suggestions of Government complicity, officials arranged for a reporter and photographer from The New York Times to make a trip this week, accompanied by a police guard, to the so-called "Triangle of Death," an area of newly constructed townships 15 miles east of Algiers, where nearly 500 people were killed in two separate attacks in the fall of 1997.
Survivors in the poverty-ridden townships of Bentalha and Rais seemed wary of blaming either guerrillas or the Government, referring only to "terrorists" who spent hours hacking families to death.
A tour of the nearly deserted townships made it clear that, whatever the optimism elsewhere, the attacks destroyed faith in all political groups, including the Islamic Salvation Front, which drew overwhelming support from Bentalha and Ras in the 1991 election.
"Whether we vote for one candidate or another, it will make no difference," said Malika Aboub, a 36-year-old who clutched her son Krimo, 9, as she spoke. "All we want is peace. Anybody who can give us that will have our support."

HEADLINE: A Dark Side Of Expansion: Housing Costs Rise Rapidly

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6

 BODY:
A strong national economy that is rewarding many Americans through steady employment, low interest rates and rising stock prices is hurting millions of the nation's poorest people by delaying their access to affordable housing, a new report by the Federal Government says.
Research collected by the Department of Housing and Urban Development found that as the economy has expanded, poor people have been waiting longer for public housing units, rental costs have been increasing and the number of affordable units has been falling as landlords seeking greater profits get out of the public housing business. 
 In some cities, as many as 25 percent more families are on waiting lists for affordable apartments than there were last year, the report said.
"The rising economic tide is raising many boats, but it is also drowning some," said Housing Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo, reflecting a report the department plans to release this week. "As an unintended consequence of this amazingly strong economy, there is less affordable housing stock and the prices are beyond the reach of those at the bottom of the income spectrum."
Those conclusions are generally shared by advocates for the poor who have campaigned for years for more affordable housing. Maria Foscarinis, executive director of the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty, said the findings of the report reflected "the convergence of many different trends in the private markets and public policy that are squeezing poor people the most."
"It's a paradox of booming times," Ms. Foscarinis said.
In addition to citing economic conditions for the housing problems, the report, "Waiting in Vain: An Update on America's Housing Crisis," strikes a familiar note in blaming the Republican-led Congress. Echoing one of Mr. Cuomo's frequent complaints since he succeeded Henry Cisneros as secretary in 1995, it points to a decision that year to stop increasing the amount of money to expand rental subsidy programs after money had been appropriated for an additional 230,000 households each year from 1978 to 1984 and for 126,000 households from 1985 to 1995.
Sean Cassidy, a spokesman for Representative Rick Lazio of Long Island, chairman of the House housing subcommittee, said Mr. Lazio had not read the report and could not comment on it until he did.
A House banking committee staff member who works on housing issues and spoke on the condition of anonymity, defended the decision, saying that Congress stopped paying for new subsidies because HUD could not account for money it already had.
After the department put into effect plans to improve efficiency and programs to weed out fraud and abuse in housing programs, Congress passed new public housing legislation and agreed last year to a request to authorize 100,000 new Section 8 vouchers, which entitle the holders to rent subsidies. The staff member said lawmakers would authorize "a reasonable number" of new vouchers in President Clinton's 2000 budget request.
The new vouchers eased some of the growing demand for affordable housing, but pressure has continued to build.
Mr. Cuomo said the most alarming finding is that the time poor families spend waiting for housing assistance -- a public housing unit or a Section 8 voucher -- has grown longer, especially in big cities.
The report said the average waiting time for a public housing unit increased to 11 months last year, from 10 months in 1996, and the average waiting time for a voucher had increased to 28 months last year, from 26 months in 1996.
Researchers found that the wait for housing had increased to 8 years in New York, 6 years in Oakland and up to 5 years in Oakland and Washington; the wait for a voucher had stretched to 10 years in Newark and Los Angeles, 7 years in Houston and 5 years in Chicago and Memphis.
The report also said a comparison of 18 cities in the last year showed a 34 percent increase, to 660,000 from 500,000, in the number of families waiting for a voucher.
Among the economic conditions that most strikingly show how the booming economy has progressed at the expense of the poor, according to the report, is housing costs.
While home ownership has reached a record level of 66.3 percent, largely because low interest rates have offset rising home prices, the rise in rents, 6.2 percent from 1996 through 1998, surpassed the rise in income for the 20 percent of households with the lowest incomes, Bureau of Labor Statistics says.
The report does not mention any potential impact on housing costs from welfare changes that began in 1996. A study by the General Accounting Office in December said it was too soon to determine the effects of lost welfare benefits on housing for the poor.

HEADLINE: Sheik Isa, 65, Emir of Bahrain Who Built Non-Oil Economy

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, March 6

 BODY:
The Emir of Bahrain, Sheik Isa bin Salman al-Khalifa, who collapsed and died today at 65, shaped his country into an important ally of the West during nearly four decades in power.
Bahraini officials said the cause of death was a heart attack, which the Emir suffered at his palace in Manama, the capital, just minutes after a meeting with the visiting Defense Secretary, William S. Cohen. Page 4. 
 A diminutive man with twinkling eyes, Sheik Isa was very much a man who enjoyed life, ruling with a mischievous touch.
He had dozens of wives -- though never more than four at a time, in keeping with his Muslim religion, and presided until late in life at what was known as Emir's beach, to which foreigners but not Bahrainis were welcomed. Female beachgoers who caught his eye were routinely invited to join the Emir for coffee, on a terrace overlooking the Persian Gulf.
Even today, in their last conversation, Mr. Cohen said later, he had chided Sheik Isa, a longtime friend, telling him that his next destination in the United States should be Las Vegas, not New York.
It was with a similar impetuousness that Sheik Isa ruled Bahrain since 1961, winning his country many friends and considerable wealth but sometimes offending people in the process.
He declared Bahrain's independence from Britain in 1971, then maintained a pro-Western line in foreign policy. The country is now the base of the United States Fifth Fleet, which has also provoked resentment at home against the foreign military presence.
The Emir's policies also angered Iraq, the tiny Emirate's giant neighbor, whose leaders remember that Sheik Isa allowed Bahrain to be used as a Western air base for attacks on Iraq during the Persian Gulf war in 1991.
With an early eye to economic diversification, Sheik Isa also presided over bold changes that established Bahrain as a major financial center.
Though oil was discovered in Bahrain as early as the 1930's, it was never found in large quantities, and as a headquarters to foreign banks and other businesses, Bahrain became proof that it was possible to prosper in the Middle East without vast energy reserves.
But Sheik Isa was careful also to maintain an alliance with the region's economic and military powerhouse, Saudi Arabia, with which it is connected by a causeway and from which it receives oil from a shared field.
When it came to sharing power, however, Sheik Isa was often at his most mercurial. A Constitution adopted in 1973 established Bahrain as only the second gulf Arab state, after Kuwait, to have an elected Parliament. But Sheik Isa dissolved Parliament in August 1975 after a showdown with left-wing members over domestic and regional policies. The Constitution was also suspended.
In 1992, Sheik Isa consolidated the retreat away from even limited democracy by issuing a decree that replaced the National Assembly with a 30-member consultative council, with its members to be appointed by the Emir.
That kind of heavy hand often served to maintain an atmosphere of domestic tranquillity in Bahrain, even as the Iranian revolution of 1979 and instability in Iraq served to underscore the dangers of the region.
But it never fully capped the anger felt by many Bahrainis, particularly the majority population of Shiite Muslims, toward Sheik Isa and his ruling Khalifa family, who are Sunnis.
In the Emir's final years, that bitterness was exposed in a significant way, through a low-level campaign of violence that claimed some two dozen lives after 1994 and resulted in the jailing of hundreds of Shiite Muslim activists.
Many Government opponents said their only demand was that Parliament be reestablished. But Sheik Isa preferred to remain impervious, greeting visitors to his palace with generous gifts while his aides advised them not to try to question him on domestic political subjects.

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
Fixing Social Security, Even in the Flush Times

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6

 BODY:
Without any changes, the Social Security system will remain solvent well into the next century. So why are the politicians here, who normally put off difficult decisions as long as possible, tackling the subject now in the absence of a crisis?
Granted, most economists and social policy analysts believe that acting now is the responsible course to take. Ultimately, they say, a crunch is bound to arrive because so many baby boomers will be in retirement, and the sooner the shortfall is addressed, the more gradually the remedies can be applied and the less painful they will be. 
 But the reason President Clinton and the Republicans who control Congress are seriously talking this year about the herculean task of overhauling the Social Security system has almost nothing to do with long-term responsibility and almost everything to do with the politics of the moment.
Last year, when economic forecasters unexpectedly began projecting large Federal budget surpluses, Republicans eagerly began to discuss ways of returning this money to the public in the form of tax cuts.
To counter that, the President played his wild card. The issue, he asserted, was not, as Republicans maintained, whether the surplus should go for tax cuts or Government spending. Rather, he said, it was whether the money should be used to give tax benefits to the wealthy or to save Social Security.
Republicans knew they could not win that argument. The most popular Government program ever created in this country, Social Security was begun by Democrats during the New Deal over Republican opposition, and it has been the Democrats' strongest suit ever since. In recent years, President Clinton has triumphed and Republicans have been badly burned every time he has created a contest between Social Security and Medicare on one hand and tax cuts on the other.
So Republicans took another tack. They proposed strengthening the system by allowing workers to invest at least some of the Social Security taxes withheld from their paychecks in private stock market accounts that would be preserved for their retirement. This meshes the public's infatuation with the booming stock market and the Republicans' ideological preference for a private retirement system.
The issue is now joined. And as counterintuitive as it seems, since no sword is hanging over their heads, the President and Congressional leaders seem committed to try to pass the most sweeping legislation in terms of the number of people affected since at least the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and possibly since the Great Society era of the 1960's.
But two immediate problems are standing in the way.
One problem is that the crucial matter of how burdensome and politically distasteful it will be to put Social Security on sound footing depends in large part on how big the shortfall in the financing will be and when it will appear. That in turn depends on how well the economy and the stock market perform over the next generation. And no one can predict that with any confidence.
Just two years ago, the Clinton Administration and the Congressional Budget Office were projecting large budget deficits indefinitely. But the economy has been so strong that forecasts show a surplus of about $4.5 trillion over the next 15 years.
Put another way, Social Security actuaries projected in the spring of 1997 that Social Security reserves would be insufficient to pay benefits in 2029. The economy over the next year was so much stronger than anticipated that, last April, the actuaries pushed the date back by three years, estimating that the system would remain sound until 2032.
The economy was even stronger in 1998, and it is a safe bet that the date of insolvency will be extended even further when the actuaries make their 1999 report next month.
An even more difficult problem politically is that the ultimate solution to Social Security's long-term financial difficulty will require higher taxes, lower retirement benefits or both. So far, neither side has been willing to concede that.
Republicans, in fact, have not agreed on a specific Social Security proposal. At the request of Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Democrat who heads the House Ways and Means Committee, Kenneth J. Kies, a prominent tax lawyer and lobbyist who is the former chief of staff of the Joint Congressional Committee on Taxation, is drafting a measure for Republicans in the House to use as a starting point.
At this stage, the Republican plan would use the budget surplus to give workers a tax cut if they invested in stocks and bonds in private retirement accounts within Social Security. If the market improved, their retirement benefits would increase.
Even if the market turned sour or they made bad investments, workers would be guaranteed that their retirement benefits would never be lower under the new Social Security plan than under the current one. So they could invest, not risking a dime.
If this sounds like an unrealistic free lunch, it is. But President Clinton and his allies can hardly complain. The proposals he made in his State of the Union Message -- using most of the surplus to pay off the national debt and transferring bonds from the general treasury into Social Security reserves -- are just as misleadingly pain-free.

HEADLINE: Clinton to Begin Visit to Central America

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: SAN SALVADOR, March 6

 BODY:
When President Clinton visits Central America next week, he will witness a region forged by one tragedy or another over the last several decades and, more often than not, forgotten in its intervals of renewal.
The President is to open a four-day visit to El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala on Monday, the day after Salvadorans vote on a new President and further cement a remarkable democratic transformation after 12 years of civil war that left more than 70,000 people dead. 
 "It's almost a miracle what's happened here," said Anne W. Patterson, the United States Ambassador to El Salvador.
But compared with the clamor of the 1980's, when the region's upheavals dominated American foreign policy, that change has occurred nearly silently. Instead, it has taken one of the worst natural disasters to rampage through the hemisphere in modern times -- Hurricane Mitch late last year -- to refocus attention here.
With this visit, many Central American experts agree, President Clinton has a chance to engage the region once again -- with increased aid, trade preferences and protected status of Central American immigrants, for example -- and to nurture young democracies that emerged only recently from armed conflicts and remain fragile.
"The question is, do we use this moment of political stability to help strengthen the countries so they don't suck us back into the whirlpool?" said Robert A. Pastor, former national security adviser for Latin America under President Carter, who now teaches at Emory University in Atlanta.
As opposed to the cold war concerns that drove Washington's interest here a decade ago, Mr. Clinton's agenda for this visit will reflect the global issues of today -- free trade, immigration and drug trafficking, in addition to repairing the damage from Hurricane Mitch.
But past interventions and traumas still color the region's relations with the United States. And they are especially likely to confront Mr. Clinton in places like Guatemala, where just last month a truth commission blamed Guatemalan military rulers assisted by Washington for acts of genocide against the country's Maya population during a 36-year war.
Besides helping the armies of El Salvador and Guatemala wage wars against guerrilla forces, the United States financed the counterrevolutionary war against the Sandinista rebels, who took power in Nicaragua in 1979, using Honduras as an operational base for the contras.
Mr. Clinton, who first visited the region in 1997, when he met with Central American leaders in Costa Rica, will travel with Hillary Rodham Clinton and on Monday and Tuesday will tour areas in Nicaragua and Honduras that were devastated by the hurricane.
He is scheduled to give the major address of the visit before the El Salvadoran legislative Assembly on Wednesday, then travel to Guatemala for a round-table discussion on that country's moves for peace on Wednesday evening. On Thursday, he will meet with the Presidents of the four countries, and leaders from Costa Rica, Belize and the Dominican Republic, at a summit conference in Antigua, outside Guatemala City, before heading home.
Of the previously war-torn areas President Clinton will visit, El Salvador, a country of about 5.8 million, has moved the furthest toward consolidating peace. The former guerrilla movement, the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, is now the country's leading opposition party, boasts the second-largest bloc in the national assembly and controls a large and growing number of mayoral posts, including the capital's.
The governing Nationalist Republican Alliance, a party founded by extreme-right-wing leaders associated with death squads, has undergone a remarkable transformation of its own and now accepts the left's gains and negotiates with them on all levels of politics.
This week, in the working-class neighborhood of San Jacinto, several thousand euphoric supporters of the former guerrilla party marched down a street past auto body shops and hot dog vendors, waving red flags and chanting revolutionary slogans, though it was clear that the change they sought would come only through the ballot box.
On a stage set up a few feet away from the presidential offices here, two former guerrilla commanders, Facundo Guardado and Nidia Diaz, addressed the crowd.
"You can't be indifferent," Ms. Diaz, still going by her nom de guerre, told them, closing out the campaign on Wednesday and urging supporters to turn out for the vote, which her party is not expected to win. "It's your future, it's what's going to happen to El Salvador, what is at stake."
But peace has not come easily to this country. Since the 1992 political settlement that ended the war, American aid to El Salvador has dropped dramatically, as it has in the rest of the region, to $34 million a year compared with $292 million in 1992 and more than $500 million at the peak of the conflict, American Embassy figures here show.
The country heavily relies on remittances sent home by Salvadorans who left during and after the war and now live in the United States. That money, an average of about $85 million a month, or more than $1 billion a year, forms El Salvador's largest source of foreign exchange.
Not surprisingly, the possible deportation of some of the 1.2 million Salvadorans estimated to be living in the United States is at the top of El Salvador's agenda for President Clinton's visit.
Administration officials say they are seeking legal status for about 200,000 Salvadorans and Guatemalans in the United States. But a temporary suspension of deportation proceedings against undocumented Salvadorans and Guatemalans -- whose numbers surged after Hurricane Mitch -- expires on Monday. Mr. Clinton's Deputy Chief of Staff, Maria Echaveste, said this week that the Administration saw no need to extend the grace period because "the countries can absorb the return of illegal immigrants."
Eduardo Zablah-Touche, Minister of Economy in El Salvador, disputed that view and said his Government would push for inclusion of Salvadorans in the amnesty benefits granted to Nicaraguans in 1997.
"These are poor, small countries that have suffered internal conflicts and now have had a decade of doing things right," Mr. Zablah-Touche said in an interview. "But it's costing a lot and we need a hand."
The help Central American governments uniformly want, and contend best serves the interests of both sides, is a free-trade agreement that would extend to Central America the benefits Mexico receives under the North American Free Trade Agreement. The Clinton Administration announced this week that it was seeking temporary enhancement of the Caribbean Basin Initiative program for textile and apparel -- Central American products -- as another way to deal with post-hurricane recovery.
But the countries say that free-trade-agreement parity is crucial to compete with Mexico for foreign trade and investment and to generate jobs, and the topic is sure to dominate discussions at the regional summit meeting with President Clinton in Guatemala.
"These countries have undertaken in the last five years big reforms -- reducing inflation, trying to put their house in order," said Enrique Iglesias, president of the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington. "It'd do a lot of good if they had more investments and more exports, and that's why cooperation with the United States is extremely important."
The thrust of Mr. Clinton's trip, though, is to survey first hand the damage caused by Hurricane Mitch, which killed at least 9,000 people, left thousands more missing, mostly in Honduras and Nicaragua, wiped out export crops, wrecked roads and wells and caused damage estimated at $7 billion to $10 billion.
The President has asked Congress for $956 million in emergency reconstruction funds for Central America and for the Caribbean countries damaged by Hurricane Georges, in addition to the about $300 million already spent on disaster relief.
Administration officials said their relief package also includes a deferral of $600 million in interest payments for Honduras and Nicaragua, the two severely indebted countries in Central America, with an external public debt of $3.7 billion and $6.2 billion respectively.
A preliminary assessment by international financial institutions found that Hurricane Mitch affected about one quarter of the total population of the four countries in one way or another. A sharp fall in exports like bananas and coffee is expected, while inflation, unemployment and fiscal deficits are sure to rise, the institutions said.
The emergency comes at a time when the countries are still grappling with the political and social effects of the violence that ripped apart their societies. More than nine years after their civil war ended, Nicaraguans remain divided to the point of paralysis on economic and political issues.
In El Salvador, one of the highest crime rates in Latin America is attributed to the availability of arms after the war.
But the aftermath is starkest in Guatemala, where a war of more than three decades caused more than 200,000 deaths and disappearances and the exile or displacement of thousands more.
Many Guatemalans and Central American experts say Mr. Clinton, who is visiting at a critical moment in the efforts to maintain peace, should give his unequivocal endorsement to carrying out peace accords brokered by the United Nations in 1996 and bringing war criminals to justice.
Some also advocate that Mr. Clinton acknowledge American support of repressive armies and offer an apology in light of the truth commission report, which recommended that Guatemala's President and guerrilla leaders, who have regrouped as a political party, ask the forgiveness of all Guatemalans.
"If he were keen, he should apologize and declare that his policy is to never again support deviations such as the ones that occurred," said Alfonso Bauer Paiz, who served in the administration of President Jacobo Arbenz, a left-leaning elected President who was removed in a military coup in 1954 engineered by the C.I.A.

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
So Far, Steinbrenner Has a Silent Spring

BYLINE: By Murray Chass 

DATELINE: HAINES CITY, Fla.

 BODY:
At another time, in an earlier season, George Steinbrenner would have fumed.
"This guy won how many Cy Young awards?" the Yankees' impatient owner might have blurted. "Who did he pay off? We gave up my good buddy David Wells for him? You know that was the general manager's trade. I'm going to have to talk to that young man. He might be a bright young executive, but he got snookered on this one." 
Steinbrenner was not at Baseball City Stadium to watch Clemens pitch his first game for the Yankees yesterday. He was not here to see the Kansas City Royals pepper Clemens for three runs and six hits in the first two innings. Even if he had been, though, the owner most likely would not have expressed outrage that Brian Cashman (acting strictly on his own, of course, wink, wink) had traded Wells, the perfect-game pitcher and New York cult hero, for Clemens.
It's not that Steinbrenner has mellowed, but he has learned that spring training is not a mandatory time for pitching perfectly and winning daily. In his past, he had legendary blowups with Billy Martin over that subject, and Martin was never able to get Steinbrenner to understand that spring training, especially the early exhibition games, is a time for players to get into pitching and hitting shape for the season.
On one March day years ago, Steinbrenner sat in the stands at Pompano Beach, Fla., and watched Dennis Rasmussen give up three home runs in the first two innings as the Texas Rangers hit routine fly balls that the gusty wind carried over the fences.
"Columbus, here we come," Steinbrenner said as he watched the third home run, suggesting that the left-handed Rasmussen had earned a ticket to the minor leagues. When that season ended, Rasmussen, who never was exiled to Columbus, had been the team's No. 1 pitcher.
Clemens did not give up any home runs. Most of the seven hits the Royals got against him in his three-inning outing weren't even produced by hard-hit balls. Nevertheless Clemens said he had to resist the temptation to turn it up a notch or two when he needed outs with Royals on base. He has a tendency, Clemens said, to try to do too much too soon when he "a little anxious or the adrenaline is pumping a little bit."
Why would the ardenaline be pumping in his first exhibition game?
"Just the excitement and the first time being out there again, just being in a new environment," he said. "I'm always excited about those situations each time I go out and I have a tendency to want to do more and overthrow. It was good that Mel reminded me on two or three occasions that today less is more. It doesn't matter what happens, guys get on base or whatever. Don't try to turn it loose just yet."
This was a mere exhibition game (the National Football League arrogantly calls theirs preseason games), but it offered an intriguingly symbolic matchup: Clemens pitching for the Yankees for the first time and Kevin Appier pitching for perhaps one of the last times for the Royals.
It was the money game that was in play.
In acquiring Clemens from the Toronto Blue Jays Feb. 18, the Yankees expressed willingness -- eagerness -- to take on another big salary that will grow much bigger when they give the superstar pitcher a contract extension that will catapult him into the Kevin Brown stratosphere.
The Royals, on the other hand, are looking to trade Appier for young players because they want to reduce their $26 million payroll and Appier, with a $4.8 million salary, is their highest-paid player. The Yankees' payroll is nearly three-and-a-half times the sum the Royals are committed to paying at the moment.
The teams epitomize the difference between baseball's haves and have nots.
"Hopefully we can get a player or two back for Appier and we can take some of the money we save and put it into prospects," Herk Robinson, the Royals' general manager, said.
The stands were filled with fans, but 20 or more scouts also were here. Those from the Cleveland Indians, the Boston Red Sox and the Rangers were probably the most attentive because their teams have been the ones that have expressed the most interest in dealing for Appier if he shows he has made a complete comeback from shoulder surgery.
As much as the Royals would like to retain some semblance of respectability that Appier gives them, economic reality takes precedence.
"Last year," Robinson said, "we cranked our payroll from $25 million to $37 million. We finished third and won five more games than the year before. We never realistically were competitive with Cleveland, but it cost us about $2 1/2 million a game. We can't afford that."
In the "old days," Robinson said, the Royals' owner, Ewing Kauffman, "could write a check at the end of the season for 1, 2, 3, 4 million, which he unwillingly did. He didn't like it; he considered it waste. But it put us on a pretty good par with Toronto or the Yankees or whoever. Now you put another zero on it."
In the late 70's and the start of the 80's, the Yankees and the Royals seemed to play each other every October for the right to go to the World Series. They haven't had any of those games recently and aren't expected to in the future. Times change.
But they also change for impetuous owners. That's why Steinbrenner didn't call the Baseball City Stadium press box yesterday screaming for scalps, Clemens's and Cashman's.

HEADLINE: Clinton Aides Admit Lapses On Espionage By Chinese

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6

 BODY:
Two of President Clinton's top advisers said today that the investigation into China's acquisition of American nuclear weapons technology showed enormous lapses in security at the Energy Department's laboratories in the 1980's, and they acknowledged that they moved too slowly to solve the problems during Mr. Clinton's first term. 
 The comments, in response to an article in The New York Times today detailing a Federal investigation into how China was able to copy the most advanced miniature nuclear warhead, known as the W-88, came from the President's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, and Energy Secretary Bill Richardson.
"The information that we were provided in 1997 made clear that there was a serious security problem at the national labs dating back to the mid-1980's, which we were going to deal with in a systematic and comprehensive way," Mr. Berger said in an interview today.
The authority to tighten security and begin a major counterintelligence push at the laboratories arose from a directive signed by Mr. Clinton in February 1998, after a nine-month investigation into security lapses at Los Alamos National Laboratory and other laboratories.
But Mr. Richardson said today that "the major reforms were instituted in October 1998, a month after I came in" as Energy Secretary, succeeding Federico Pena.
In other words, the tightening happened nine months after Mr. Clinton's order was signed, and 18 months after the details of the security breach were first relayed to the White House.
The Administration's critics say the delays indicated that the White House was playing down the severity of the reports to avoid derailing effort to put relations with China on a better footing. Mr. Berger and other officials deny that.
At the same time, senior Administration officials say Mr. Richardson, who previously served as chief delegate to the United Nations, was not briefed on the investigation until a month after joining the Energy Department. Even then, it came from the Energy Department official, Notra Trulock, who first raised questions about the Los Alamos case, rather than from the National Security Council or the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Asked today to explain the delays, senior Administration officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that despite Mr. Clinton's directive in early 1998, the Energy Department moved extremely slowly.
Mr. Pena announced his decision to leave the department in the spring of 1998, and major decisions were held in abeyance. "Things were kind of hanging out there" until Mr. Richardson's arrival, one official said.
The main suspect in the warhead case was identified only as a Chinese-American computer scientist at Los Alamos. But it was not the first time the Administration was made aware of security breaches at that laboratory, which is in New Mexico.
In December 1997, a 58-year-old physicist, Peter Lee, admitted in a plea bargain agreement that in 1985 he gave China classified informaiton involving the use of lasers to simulate nuclear detonations.
Former officials of the Bush and Reagan Administrations say that, in retrospect, the Government was remarkably lax about lab security in the 1980's, even during the Reagan Administration's arms buildup.
"It is quite clear now that things were far too casual," James R. Lilley, the Ambassador to China from 1989 to 1991 and then a senior Defense Department official, said in an interview today. Mr. Lilley, who for years served as one of the Central Intelligence Agency's top operatives in Asia, including in China, said: "This has been going on for a long, long time. We had Ministry of State Secruity defectors and other Chinese who became agents, and they made it clear that this was a top priority of their industrial and intelligence apparatus."
While Mr. Lilley blamed the two Republican Administrations he served in, he added that the Clinton Administration was "caught in bureaucratic struggles between the Energy Department and the F.B.I., and the Chinese saw that we were still sitting ducks" in the early to mid-1990's.
But Mr. Lilley said the United States should not disrupt its dealings with China because of the spying. "You've got to get some maturity into the relationship with China," he said, arguing that the United States could deepen its economic engagement with China "while still restricting high technology exports and breaking up their espionage rings."
The view in Congress may be different. The steady drip of disclosures about Beijing's efforts to obtain American technology may lead Congress to derail efforts for China to join the World Trade Organization -- an objective of the Chinese for many years.

HEADLINE: Give Vouchers a Try

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"Rudy Versus Rudy" (editorial, March 5) charges Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani with pushing a school voucher experiment to enhance his standing with national Republicans. To the contrary, I believe that he is simply trying to solve a major problem. 
 New York City's educational system is a disaster that is threatening the city's economic well-being. Employers are finding it difficult to recruit an even minimally educated work force. An entrenched educational establishment continues to fight tooth and nail to maintain its control of public money.
It is time to try something new: the free enterprise system. Citizens with vouchers in hand will decide which schools to send their children to. Schools that are successful will succeed, and those that are not will fail. Simple.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Milk Prices Put Parties in Odd Roles

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 3

 BODY:
There was a rally earlier this week to support dairy farmers, a bloc as politically influential in upstate New York as it is economically beleaguered. Gov. George E. Pataki and the majority leader of the State Senate, Joseph L. Bruno, delivered stirring speeches about the need for a system to help the industry avoid market swoons -- or "minimize the price swings," as Mr. Pataki artfully put it.
So there they were, the two most powerful Republicans in the State Capitol, self-styled archfoes of the government-by-regulation predilection, advocating new regulations to prop up a favored group. And the opponents of this enterprise have largely been Democratic lawmakers from New York City, the same folks who embrace price controls on apartment rents but have a problem with them for milk. 
 Sometimes, Albany can be a confusing place.
Of course, both sides in these fracases over the role of the state in commerce maintain that they are being consistent. Still, while the issues of rent and milk mandates are not entirely analogous, the politicians' positions illuminate an everlasting truth around here: when it comes to constituency politics, publicly espoused convictions can turn out to be, well, flexible.
At the rally, Mr. Pataki and Mr. Bruno called on Congress to permit New York to join the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact, a coalition of New England states that sets a legal minimum for the price that processors pay farmers for milk. After many months of resistance from downstate Democrats, Mr. Pataki pushed a bill through the Legislature in December authorizing the state's entry, but Congressional approval is also required, and is not assured.
Mr. Pataki (who was raised on a farm and knows a thing or two about handling a bleating cow) and Mr. Bruno (who lives in farm country near Albany) declared that the compact would strengthen the state's 8,300 dairy farms, many of which are family owned. They said the industry, one of the largest in New York, was in crisis because of repeated depressions in milk prices, noting that the number of dairy farms has been plummeting. The compact, they said, would preserve a "way of life."
In those assertions was a curious echo of the 1997 rent fight, when many Democrats from New York City proclaimed that if the state controls lapsed, the number of middle-class people in Manhattan and parts of other boroughs would drop sharply, irrevocably changing the city.
Back then, Mr. Bruno railed against the state's policy of limiting how much landlords can increase rents, which mostly affects the city. Government "is over-regulatory, to the detriment of the majority of people," he said. "I got into politics to try and do something about that." Mr. Pataki and Mr. Bruno ultimately backed down and agreed to renew the laws, after succeeding in loosening them only slightly.
At the rally on Monday, both the Governor and the State Senator said their stances on the dairy compact did not run counter to their views on the rent laws. "This is something that six states already have -- all of New England," Mr. Pataki said of the compact. "I just think that it is something that would have a profoundly positive impact on one of our most important industries."
Asked to compare the two issues, Mr. Bruno said the plight of dairy farmers was "rather unique." He said the dairy compact was not a cartel that would gouge consumers, as its antagonists contend, but would in fact insure milk supplies and thereby prevent sudden steep price increases. "I don't see it at all as contradictory in terms of where I am," he said. "I just think that it's being of service to the public."
For their part, some Democratic lawmakers from New York City have portrayed themselves in the dairy wars as unabashed free marketers out to make the state safe from the evils of price controls.
Throughout last year, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, referred to the dairy compact as a "milk tax" that would raise milk prices at supermarkets, particularly those in the city, and transfer that money to upstate farmers -- a charge that the compact's backers denied.
Mr. Silver was the most prominent supporter of the rent laws in Albany.
The Democratic-led Assembly would most likely not have approved the dairy compact in December if not for Mr. Pataki's threat to veto a pay increase for lawmakers if the measure died.
Democratic opposition to the compact is not universal, though. Among those at the rally was the new Attorney General, Eliot L. Spitzer, a Democrat who took office in January, and unlike city lawmakers, needs to court upstate voters.
Assemblyman Alexander B. Grannis, a Manhattan Democrat who opposed the dairy compact and championed the rent rules, said he was not against aiding upstate dairy farmers, but said the compact was wrongheaded. He said the dairy industry in the state was declining for many reasons, not just price fluctuations. He added that he believed the younger generation in farming communities was less interested in the business.
"You probably couldn't pay some of those kids enough money to get them up at four in the morning to milk the cows," Mr. Grannis said.
And then the Assemblyman used language that would be familiar to anyone who listened to Mr. Bruno talk about the rent laws. "This is a classic case of government price supports that are bad for consumers," Mr. Grannis said. Mr. Bruno often remarked in 1997 that rent regulations were suppressing housing construction in New York City, hindering most residents' chances of finding apartments.
Assemblyman James F. Brennan, a Democrat of Brooklyn, sought to distinguish his positions by explaining that it was appropriate to regulate the prices of basic goods, but not to restrict competition, which is what he interpreted the dairy compact as doing. In the end, though, when asked whether the essential thrust of the compact was any different from that of the rent laws, Mr. Brennan said no.
"The marketplace can be a harsh world," he said. "And people's constituents are constantly seeking to have their legislators deal with the consequences of that harshness."

Stocks Roar In Like a March Lion

BYLINE: By Patrick J. Lyons 

 BODY:
Hesitant investors awaiting a glimmer of good news in the battered computer sector or an excuse for the Federal Reserve to leave interest rates alone found both late last week, and responded by slamming their hands down on the "buy" button.
 
 Two headlines did most to dispel the gloom: I.B.M.'s $16 billion contract with Dell Computer, and the Labor Department's announcement that unemployment had unexpectedly ticked up a bit in February while average wages barely budged. Between them they set off two roaring days on Wall Street.
 The Dow industrials closed Friday at a new high of 9,736.08, a gain of 4.6 percent for the week, after rising 460 points Thursday and Friday alone. Broader market indexes posted more modest but still healthy gains.
 Many European and Asian markets rode on Wall Street's coattails Friday and finished ahead for the week. In Brazil, reassuring policy remarks by Arminio Fraga, the new head of the central bank, sent the Bovespa index up 6.22 percent for the week.
 The jobs report on friday buoyed bonds, with the benchmark 30-year Treasury yielding 5.60 percent at the close. The dollar finished the week at 122.72 Japanese yen, a gain of 3.52.

Giving Their Regards to Old Broadway

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON 

 BODY:
DAVID HARTMAN has been out walking the streets again. Last summer, he did a kind of crosstown video Baedeker, a public-television documentary about 42d Street from the East River to the Hudson. On Wednesday at 8 P.M. on Channel 13, he will move on a north-south axis as he makes his way up a far longer New York thoroughfare: Broadway, starting where Manhattan started 400 years ago, south of Wall Street. The program, "A Walk Up Broadway," takes him 17 miles uptown, to the bridge that carries Broadway across the Harlem River and into the Bronx.
 
 Along the way, Mr. Hartman and his traveling companion, the historian Barry Lewis, have a long conversation that proves how much a part of American life - and the American vernacular - Broadway is. For example: The phrase "23 skiddoo" originated with police officers trying to shoo gawking loiterers from Broadway at 23d Street. The triangle-shaped Flatiron Building turned the intersection into a wind tunnel that sent skirts billowing above the ankle.
 A few miles uptown, they pass the Ansonia, the thick-walled apartment hotel on Broadway between 73d and 74th Streets. It was home to Arturo Toscanini, Igor Stravinsky, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Lily Pons and Babe Ruth, who learned to play the alto saxophone there. "He said he was inspired by all these phenomenal musicians who lived in the building," Mr. Hartman noted.
 Mr. Hartman has absorbed so much Broadway history that he cannot resist mentioning another tenant of the Ansonia's golden age: Florenz Ziegfeld, who had one apartment for his wife and another for his mistress. There was also a resident bear. It belonged to the Ansonia's developer, William Earl Dodge Stokes, and inhabited the roof garden.
 "Broadway is arguably the most famous street in the world, and you might even be able to drop 'arguably," Mr. Hartman said the other day. "It's the spine of Manhattan, and New York literally unfolded around Manhattan. Broadway really is the heart of the tumult, the explosive energy that is the city of New York. It was true in the 1700's, it's true now, it's been true the entire period of time in between."
 That includes from 1975 to 1986, when Mr. Hartman was the host of "Good Morning America," working from an ABC studio a couple of blocks from Broadway in the West 60's.
 "It's a remarkable personal experience to be able to go out in the city where I've spent most of my life," he said. "I've walked a lot of it, subwayed a lot of it, cabbed a lot of it, but it's fascinating when you actually learn the history."
 Which is where Mr. Lewis, the author of a guidebook called "New York Walks," came in.
 "I asked him, 'If we look up, which we New Yorkers tend not to do because we're going at Mach 2 to get into the subway, what can we see?' " Mr. Hartman recalled. "He said, 'You can see the history of New York if you know what you're looking at.' "
 Mr. Hartman, who had been producing, writing and appearing in documentaries since leaving "Good Morning America," became involved with the walking-tour project after meeting Michael A. Fields, the executive producer of local programming at WNET. Mr. Fields wanted to do a program about a single street. "They only had 8 or 10 weeks to put it together," he said, and Mr. Lewis was already.
 "It's a remarkable story to look back at how this town got this way and how it functions, which is beyond comprehension," Mr. Hartman said. "Look at the subways. They built the IRT from downtown all the way up to 125th Street, something like that, in four years. It's amazing."
 One of the last stops in Mr. Hartman's trip up Broadway makes one consider how different history might have been if New York were not a city of constant change - and if Mr. Hartman had not turned down offers to play professional baseball when he graduated from high school (he attended Duke University instead, graduating with a degree in economics).
 "Where Columbia-Pres-byterian Medical Center is right now, there was a ballpark in 1904 where a team called the Highlanders played," he said. "In 1908 they changed the name to the New York Yankees."
 The rest, as they say on television, is history.

HEADLINE: Fight of the (Next) Century;
Converging Technologies Put Sony and Microsoft on a Collision Course

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif.

 BODY:
A BATTLE for control of the future of computing is looming between the personal computer industry and consumer electronics manufacturers.
Its roots can be found in meetings like one held here in July 1995, shortly after Nobuyuki Idei became chief executive of the Sony Corporation. Briefing Mr. Idei on the importance of the Internet, Peter Sealey, a Sony consultant, noted that the year before, the dollar volume of PC sales had surpassed that of television sales in the United States for the first time. 
 "He stopped the meeting and challenged my data," Mr. Sealey recalled. "I think it was a shock to him that this had happened."
But if Mr. Idei's education about the rapidly expanding world of personal computing was abrupt, Sony's conversion to a digital products strategy has been complete.
For decades the world's pre-eminent consumer electronics maker, Sony has now realized that its core business is being profoundly transformed by digital electronics, in ways that pose both opportunities and threats.
In a huge strategic shift for a company that long relied on the elegance of its industrial design and the prestige of its brand name, Sony has come to recognize, its executives say, that a new era is arriving in which clever software, above all else, will determine whether products from televisions to telephones will succeed or fail in the marketplace.
That sets the stage for a grand confrontation. On one side are Sony and its peers in the consumer electronics business. On the other is the personal computer industry.
The Microsoft Corporation and the Intel Corporation, the twin engines of the PC world, are eagerly looking for new markets in which to expand. Beginning with the cable set-top box in the living room -- a box they believe will bring the power of the Internet to tens of millions of TV viewers who do not now use computers -- they have a vast range of Windows-based products on the drawing board, including toys, phones, even computers for the car that will do everything from read aloud your E-mail to help you with navigation.
Microsoft's strategy is to re-create the powerful business model of the personal computer industry in consumer electronics.
At the center would be Windows CE, a scaled-down version of the Windows desktop software that is now familiar mostly in palm-size computers, where it has been slow to win converts. It would be the foundation for tens of thousands of vibrant software applications and an intensely competitive market of hardware makers all vying to compete on price and performance.
Moreover, the PC itself would control an ever-expanding world of "smart" peripherals -- TV's, audio systems, telephones, kitchen appliances and other electronic gadgets.
"This isn't the post-PC era; it's the PC-plus era," said Craig Mundie, Microsoft's senior vice president for consumer strategy. "The PC may be simpler to use in the future, but it will still broker lots of home services and control other smart appliances."
 
And in the Sony Corner. . . .
That vision presents a potentially grim future for Sony's $38 billion consumer electronics business. As a global standard setter, Sony has enjoyed high margins and big market shares. But the "PC-ization" of consumer electronics would most likely mean a world of increasing uniformity and low margins, like those that computer makers have experienced.
Sony's view of the digital future is far more decentralized. Its product designers sniff that the PC is the obsolete "mainframe" of the home. Instead, they envision homes in which dozens, even hundreds, of smart appliances are seamlessly interconnected, perhaps without a PC involved at all.
"Microsoft is going to have to change their business model to be effective in the world of consumer electronics," said Mario Tokoro, the computer scientist who is president of Sony's Information Technology Laboratories and a top adviser to Mr. Idei on computing and networking issues.
The system envisioned by Sony would let the consumer control a digital videocassette recorder from the television set, or vice versa -- or control them both from a cellular phone. In recent demonstrations, the company has shown an integrated audio and video system tied together by I-Link, a high-speed digital connection to the cable box.
It will allow people to watch movies on demand, pause a live basketball game in mid-jump shot to go to the kitchen for a sandwich -- then watch the rest of the game on delay -- or transmit a home video to a friend on the other side of the country.
Moreover, the new Playstation II, introduced last week and scheduled to arrive in the United States next year, would connect to the network, serving as a digital versatile disk, or DVD, player, and perhaps even as a cable set-top box.
The collision of these competing visions has resulted in what one Sony executive calls a "strategic dance." Publicly, Sony has announced ambitious strategic alliances with Microsoft in the last two years to design consumer electronics products; quietly, it has been reshaping itself into what is likely to soon become Microsoft's most dangerous competitor.
"The relationship is fearful and respectful and wary," said Mr. Sealey, the consultant to Sony.
One measure of Sony's commitment to a digital future is that by the end of next year, it plans to employ an equal number of software and hardware engineers, according to Akikazu Takeuchi, president of Sony's Platform Software Development Center, which has recently built software laboratories in Japan, Europe and the United States.
The outlines of Sony's new software-centric strategy are already clear at the company's vast development and marketing center here in Silicon Valley.
A fast-growing group of software programmers are putting the finishing touches on a new operating system called Aperios, which is intended to control digital TV's, cellular phones, even robot "pets" that Sony plans to introduce later this year.
Aperios and Windows CE will face off for the first time later this year, too, as cable companies decide which operating system they will use in a new generation of set-top boxes that will bring interactive television to millions of homes.
Indeed, the introduction of the new cable boxes will be the first round in the struggle for dominance over the next generation of computing. And for Sony, its role as a leader in consumer electronics, an industry it virtually invented, is at stake.
 
A Leap of Recognition
Conventional wisdom in Silicon Valley has long been that for all its excellence in hardware design, Japan, for cultural reasons, has habitually lagged behind in software development, which benefits from free-spirited individualism.
Yet Sony's computer researchers defy the stereotypes. Regular visitors say the company's computer laboratory in Tokyo could easily be mistaken for one in San Jose or Santa Clara, right down to the comfortable beanbag chairs. And Mr. Tokoro, who heads the labs, is not only a well-respected researcher but also the acknowledged architect of the company's ambitious software strategy.
"It was one of the first Japanese labs that was an American-style lab, with open doors and no hierarchy," said David J. Farber, a professor of computer science at the University of Pennsylvania. "The young researchers there are happy to argue with Mario, which is unheard of in that culture."
Still, the arrival of Aperios will put Sony's commitment to computer software to the test. And some Sony insiders worry that the company's bureaucracy -- its many divisions' conflicting agendas and its stodgy "salaryman" pay practices -- will thwart the software revolution.
Moreover, the company has occasionally chased down technological blind alleys, most famously in the case of the Betamax. And until last year, when it re-entered the PC market with innovative, ultrathin laptops, it had failed consistently in personal computers and work stations.
Still, executives say Sony has made the important leap of recognizing that the very nature of its business has changed. "To Sony's credit, we now realize that our competitor is no longer Toshiba or Panasonic, but it's Microsoft and Dell," said one executive in the company's United States personal computer business, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
And Sony has hard-won experience with the business model it is counting on for success in the software world.
The template is the company's conquest of the video-game business. In a bruising battle with Tokyo, Olaf Olafsson, then president of Sony's Interactive Entertainment division, persuaded the company to look for profits in software and licensing, and to sell the game hardware at cost.
The fight ultimately led Mr. Olafsson to resign in 1996. But the Sony Playstation became -- and remains -- a runaway hit in both the United States and Japan. Sony Computer, which is largely the Playstation business, provided 26.5 percent of Sony's operating profits in the first half of the current fiscal year.
Mr. Olafsson, now president of the Advanta Corporation, a financial services company, said Sony had no alternative but to pursue a similar course as it confronts the PC world head-on.
"Sony will never succeed as a just another clone manufacturer," he said. "It's not a manufacturing company per se, and it won't make the cheapest PC. I would say they have to find something else."
That something else could help change the way Wall Street views the company, whose stock declined in 1998 as a result of the Asian economic crisis.
"The whole Japanese market has been struggling," noted Peter G. Wolff of the investment bank ING Barings in New York. But, he added, Sony has recently begun to show promise. Among Japanese companies, "Sony has been regarded as the most international, and with the best brand name," Mr. Wolff said.
 
An Uneasy Coexistence
Increasingly, Sony executives -- like others in the consumer electronics industry -- have come to realize that Microsoft covets markets that are not part of the traditional personal computer business. It already sells toys and games, and it is developing a growing array of smart consumer electronic gadgets.
Sony also recognizes the risk of relying on Microsoft to set software standards for the dawning age of digital consumer electronics. The broad agreements between Mr. Idei and William H. Gates, Microsoft's chief executive, to cooperate on a new generation of information appliances have so far gone nowhere.
"This is a love-and-hate relationship," Mr. Tokoro said. "Each of us has our own territory. But the computer people need consumer electronics markets to grow, and by cooperating with us they want to expand into our territory."
Microsoft executives, of course, have a comeback.
"Sony has been recognizing, begrudgingly, that the microprocessor is going to find its way into the traditional lines of business," said Mr. Mundie of Microsoft. "But the PC will remain an important launching pad for them."
The ambivalence -- a rivalry fraught with mutual needs and fundamental differences -- is nothing new. Immediately after arriving to head Sony's United States business in April 1997, Howard Stringer, long a top executive at CBS, called an internal meeting to develop a strategy for Sony's relationship with Microsoft.
Mr. Stringer said last week that the company was still monitoring the relationship closely.
"Sometimes we waltz and sometimes we stand on the opposite side of the dance floor," he said. "And just like dancing, it's best not to talk about the bedroom while you're on the dance floor, because who knows where you might end up."
 
Dueling Standards
While the real engagement is still ahead, each side has already begun to marshal its forces.
Microsoft and Intel have been signing up consumer electronics makers, including Mitsubishi and Honeywell, to support a new standard known as the Home Application Programming Interface alliance, or Home A.P.I. These standards are intended to make the personal computer the control center for all kinds of home appliances.
Sony, Philips Electronics and six other consumer electronics makers have countered with their own standard, known as Home Audio Visual Interoperatibility, or HAVI (pronounced HAH-vee).
HAVI operates in tandem with the I-Link digital cable developed by Apple Computer, a technology designed to move digital video and audio efficiently between home entertainment components. But it does not require a PC; instead, the microprocessing power is within the components and appliances themselves.
Sony recently began giving demonstrations of HAVI-equipped entertainment centers that include not only TV, cable and audio gear but also a new kind of device that works much like a digital VCR and performs many of the storage and retrieval functions of a personal computer's hard disk. The first HAVI-compatible systems may be introduced as early as this Christmas.
Through the cable set-top box, with the Aperios operating system, all this equipment can be connected to the Internet at lightning speed.
Analysts expect Sony to complete the picture by announcing its own multimedia "portal," a Web site from which music, movies and software can be downloaded, with Sony charging a fee for each transaction.
Moreover, Sony and its allies announced last month that HAVI would interconnect with Sun Microsystems' Jini software, which is also intended to allow all sorts of computers and appliances to work together seamlessly, independent of a Windows-driven computer.
 
The Set-Top Factor
The first big test of Sony's vision will come later this year when the cable TV industry rolls out a new set-top cable box built by the General Instrument Company, with the almost comically old-fashioned name DCT-5000. Cable system operators will be able to decide whether to use Sony's or Microsoft's software, or that of other companies, in the boxes they deliver to consumers.
These operators have been promising powerful interactive cable systems since the beginning of the 1990's; the DCT-5000 helps make it possible, technologically. And AT&T's entry into the cable business, through its pending acquisition of Tele-Communications Inc., provides the financial muscle and competitive impetus that the industry may have lacked.
As powerful as today's most advanced personal computers, the new set-top box will serve as the brain for dozens of activities, including Internet browsing, local and long-distance telephone service, video games, movies on demand and many new home applications, like easy-to-use electronic phone books or call-screening based on Caller ID technology.
The possibilities are as limitless as software designers' imaginations. For example, the TV might replace today's ubiquitous home audio baby monitor. With a camera in the nursery, parents could keep tabs on a sleeping tot, using the picture-in-a-picture feature of the family-room TV. And if the baby does something cute, it will be possible to save a video clip and then send it over the cable network to be viewed on the grandparents' television on the other side of the country.
The cable industry and its partners are betting that when families want to enter cyberspace, they would rather settle down on a sofa in front of the TV than sit at a desk staring into a computer display.
"As a consumer, you will care less that this is not a personal computer," said David E. Robinson, senior vice president of General Instrument.
Eager to avoid re-creating the PC business model, the cable industry, led by John C. Malone, the electrical engineer turned chairman of Tele-Communications, structured a deal in which Microsoft, Sony, Sun and other companies all are providing software for the set-top box. No company has a monopoly.
The companies were eager to be part of the deal, in the hope that beyond supplying their operating systems they would be able to sell highly profitable services -- like pay-per-play video games -- directly to the consumer.
Subscribers will pick different services from cable operators, rather than worrying about hardware and software, Mr. Robinson said. But the kinds of applications that the new set-top boxes will make possible are the sort at which Sony has long excelled.
General Instrument, partly owned by both TCI and Sony, will make some boxes with special Sony I-Link connectors. And soon, perhaps even later this year, the cable industry plans to allow consumer electronics companies to produce set-top boxes under their own names.
Then it will be possible to go to a store and buy a Sony-made set-top box, or a cable-ready Sony digital TV with the Aperios operating system. Indeed, they may compete directly with systems from other consumer electronics companies with built-in Microsoft software. And in the end, it will be the consumer who decides whether the future will be a post-PC or a PC-centric world.
 
Sony's Bet For a New Generation
Sony's Aperios operating system, intended to control a host of consumer devices in a post-PC era, has been under development for a decade.
Early work on the system was based in part on ideas drawn from Smalltalk, an innovative computing system pioneered at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center in the 1970's.
Unlike Windows CE, which Microsoft designed to be compatible with older programs -- including the desktop Windows operating system -- Aperios was designed from scratch and so has none of the "legacy" issues that scientists say can clutter up software.
Indeed, the basic operating system can be shrunk down to a tiny "kernel" that runs in as little as 100 kilobytes of memory, a tiny amount compared with the tens of millions of bytes of memory required by a program like Windows and less than one-third the memory requirements of a minimal Windows CE system.
Sony figures that the smaller memory requirement will make Aperios attractive to makers of hand-held consumer devices, like so-called smart cellular phones and portable Web-surfing appliances.
Aperios is a real-time operating system, meaning that it -- unlike Windows or Apple's Macintosh operating system -- can handle high-speed streams of video from a TV cable or a home video camera.
Another feature that may give Aperios an edge in computing's next generation is called a "reflective architecture." That means the software can monitor its own functions and reconfigure itself on the fly as demands on it change -- for instance, as a user fires up a digital VCR to record a movie being downloaded from the Internet.
Such flexibility is a key to Sony's notion of a world of digital consumer electronics devices that work together without benefit of a personal computer as the system's central brain.

As the personal computer and consumer electronics industries converge. Sony and Microsoft find themselves clashing in a number of markets. At the core of the fight are rival operating systems - Sony's new Aperios software and Microsoft's Windwos CE. But there are also rival philosophies.
Microsoft thinks that the desktop PC will be the control center for a home's digital appliances. Sony says the brainpower will be in the appliances themselves, making the home PC obsolete.

HEADLINE: Tempest on the River;
It Was Supposed to Be an Urban Utopia. Today, Roosevelt Island Is a Battleground.

BYLINE: By BERNARD STAMLER 

 BODY:
THEY arrived at Roosevelt Island in stages, beginning in 1975, when the first apartment building opened. Pioneers, they were lured by reasonable, and in some cases subsidized, housing, and by promises of a utopia where 20,000 people of all races and economic levels would mix, traffic would be minimal and greenery would flourish, all within sight of Manhattan's skyline.
Promises, promises. 
 Nearly a quarter-century later, the 8,500 inhabitants of the northern half of the island, the only part developed, are riven by conflict. Although most of some three dozen residents interviewed over two months said they liked living on the island, many were hostile to the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation, the state agency that runs the place and plans its future development, and its chief executive, Dr. Jerome H. Blue, appointed in 1996 by Gov. George E. Pataki.
And so, where tranquillity was expected, anger is heard. The Roosevelt Island Residents Association, the largest civic group, and The Main Street Wire, the local newspaper, scorn Dr. Blue, a protege of former Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, accusing him of incompetence, arrogance and dishonesty. Elected officials like Assemblyman Alexander B. Grannis and Councilman A. Gifford Miller, both Democrats, have jumped on board. In interviews, Mr. Grannis called Dr. Blue "duplicitous" and Mr. Miller called him "an extraordinarily poor communicator" and "ineffective manager."
But others denounce the criticism as racially motivated -- Dr. Blue is black -- and call his detractors upper-middle-class bigots who want to keep the community underpopulated and keep out additional low-income residents. Both sides sometimes engage in shouting matches at town meetings and at monthly gatherings of the operating corporation's directors.
Whatever its motivation, grumbling over Dr. Blue's day-to-day management is widespread, as is consternation over projects he supports, like a $200 million two-tower, high-rise Marriott hotel and convention center proposed for the southern tip that would be linked to Manhattan by ferry. Edward J. Logue, the urban planner who oversaw the creation of Roosevelt Island as president of the New York State Urban Development Corporation, now the Empire State Development Corporation, calls the project "an outrage" that would be "a substantial change in the development plan."
Dr. Blue, who has a Ph.D. in neuroscience, remains steadfast. He dismisses Mr. Logue as "a naysayer," and says his opponents do not like him because of fiscal restraint he has imposed upon what he says was a free-spending, deficit-ridden operation. And he says that the hotel and other development plans he advocates will bring jobs to the island and money to the operating corporation.
"My mandate was to make the island self-sufficient," he said. "And I have done that."
Still, some detractors think his boss, State Housing Commissioner Joseph E. Lynch, may be reeling him in a bit. Mr. Lynch, a member of the corporation's board, said of Dr. Blue: "I think he has had a very difficult position. And I think that he has done what he was sent to do -- get the island in the black. But there are huge issues left concerning development, and if we can help and assist him in doing his job, that's a good thing."
In the last year, Mr. Lynch has attended the monthly board meetings rather than send an assistant. At his suggestion, two residents' representatives -- Patrick Stewart, president of the Roosevelt Island Residents Association, and Susan Whitaker, head of the Roosevelt Island Council of Organizations -- are to join the board.
Last month, Mr. Lynch set up two committees, half of whose members are residents, to advise the corporation on plans for the future. Board approval of the hotel project was postponed in December pending the committees' review, which began only last week. Still, Mr. Lynch said, he expected the corporation's directors to recommend "conditional approval," perhaps this week.
The idea for the committees, Mr. Lynch said, came from a team of management consultants who recommended "broadening the base" of the operating corporation and giving Dr. Blue "extra expertise in planning." Mr. Lynch blamed the corporation's directors, not Dr. Blue, for not doing the job "it was envisioned to do" in overseeing the island. In response, a board member, Frank Angelino, said he agreed that input from the committees "would be helpful."
 
A Small Body of Land Surrounded by Indifference
The island has been there, midway between Manhattan and Queens, for as long as the East River has flowed, now running parallel to the Upper East Side for some two miles, from 50th to 86th Streets. Named Minnahanock, or Island Place, by the Indians, and then Varcken Eylandt, or Hog's Island by the Dutch, it has also been known as Blackwell's Island (for an early English settler) and, more recently, as Welfare Island, a dreary appellation that referred to the asylums and hospitals that became its main claims to fame. For centuries, it was unused or underused, relegated to the background of the city's consciousness, accessible only by elevators from the Queensboro Bridge (gone now) or via a small bridge linking it to 36th Avenue in Long Island City, Queens.
But its location proved too attractive to ignore. In the late 1960's, urban planners, led by Mr. Logue, persuaded city and state officials that they could do something better with "the island nobody knows," where many of the older 19th-century structures had fallen into disuse and disrepair. The 147-acre site, still called Welfare Island 30 years ago, was leased by the city to the state for 99 years, and an ambitious plan, created by the architects Philip Johnson and John Burgee in 1969, called "for a town in the center of New York."
There was to be an apartment community at the northern end (Northtown) and another in the middle (Southtown), where a town center would also be built. There would be only one street (Main Street), with minimal traffic thanks to a central garage (Motorgate). Shops, schools and recreation centers would be built, and a space-age garbage disposal system (called AVAC, for automated vacuum collection system, similar to one at Disney World) would transport refuse pneumatically through underground tunnels.
And while two city-owned hospitals, Bird S. Coler, at the north end, and Goldwater Memorial, south of the Queensboro Bridge, were to remain, providing long-term nursing care, most of the remainder of the island would be made into parkland, including its southern tip, Southpoint, where a memorial to Franklin D. Roosevelt was to be built. (The island was renamed after him in 1973.)
Of the 20,000 people who were to live on the island, a third were to be low-income and elderly, and half in the moderate- and middle-income ranges. The rest would pay market rates for apartments. Once all the buildings were constructed and fully populated, rents and other revenues were supposed to cover all operating costs.
But ups and downs in the city's economy affected the island. A subway station that was supposed to be completed in 1976 wasn't done until 1989, necessitating construction of an aerial tramway, which was not part of the original plan. Northtown, with five apartment complexes, wasn't finished until 1989, and the Roosevelt memorial, designed by another noted architect, Louis Kahn, was never built. Nor was Southtown. Plans for Southtown that were approved in 1990 have been abandoned, though the operating corporation has solicited new ones. With development incomplete, the population never reached 9,000, and the island needed several million dollars in annual state subsidies.
 
Residents Are Manhattanites, But City Has No Role
From the outset, Roosevelt Island has been a political hybrid. The people who live there are legally Manhattan residents, but under the lease with the city, daily operations and development are the responsibility of the state-chartered Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation, whose directors are appointed by the Governor. The State Housing Commissioner is chairman of the board, and only three of the nine directors are required to live on the island. The city has no say in island management.
Before Dr. Blue took office, residents said, that arrangement did not seem to matter. "There was always the view that the corporation and the citizens were in things together," Assemblyman Grannis said.
Mr. Stewart, the residents association head, agreed. Dr. Blue's predecessor, Jean Lerman, who was appointed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, "really had the interests of the residents at heart," he said, citing as an example of her openness a 1995 forum on the island's future at which local residents were encouraged to participate. Equally important, he said, she made sure that the state allocated money for maintenance and repair and that the work was done.
Under Ms. Lerman, who declined to comment, the operating corporation also ran in the red. To meet the deficit and pay for capital improvements, the state contributed $6.7 million in 1994-95 and $6.2 million in 1995-96. Governor Pataki did not want to perpetuate this deficit spending, Dr. Blue said, and his mission was clear: eliminate the deficits and end the subsidies.
And he did. When the 1997-98 fiscal year rolled around, he said, he had reduced expenses to $9.7 million from $11 million the previous year, and was able to pay those from revenues and reserves without any subsidy. Dr. Blue said he expected to do so again for fiscal 1998-99, which ends on March 31.
How did he accomplish this? "By cutting waste," Dr. Blue said. "We had a contractor who mowed our lawns for $70,000 a year," he said. "I got our own workers to do it." He also pared down the scope of a sea wall project near Octagon Park. "When I got here, the agency planned to spend $3.7 million," he said. "But only $3 million was needed. The rest was for Art Deco picnic furniture." He eliminated the money for the furniture, and the project was completed.
Dr. Blue, whose annual salary is $115,000, arrives at work each day from his home in Freeport, on Long Island, in the heart of D'Amato country. After working as a legislative aide to the senator, he was hired in the mid-1980's, at Mr. D'Amato's behest, as a special assistant to the New York regional administrator of the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. In 1989, an influence-peddling scandal erupted at H.U.D. The agency's regional economist in New York, David Burns, testified in hearings that Mr. D'Amato had used Dr. Blue and other surrogates to influence the agency to approve pet housing projects. Neither Senator D'Amato nor Dr. Blue was charged with wrongdoing.
Dr. Blue left H.U.D. in 1990 and became the housing commissioner of Freeport. After Governor Pataki was elected in 1994, he appointed Dr. Blue vice president of the State Housing Finance Agency. In June 1996, the Governor appointed him to the Roosevelt Island job.
Almost immediately, controversy erupted. That August, another Pataki appointee, the State Housing Commissioner, Joseph Holland, wrote a scathing memorandum to the Governor, accusing Dr. Blue of "mismanagement," "irrational conduct" and "poor judgment." Calling him a "potential public-relations disaster," Mr. Holland urged that Dr. Blue be dismissed. The New York Post obtained a copy of the memorandum and published a summary. Soon after, Mr. Holland, who was suffering well-publicized private financial problems, resigned.
Mr. Holland, a lawyer now in private practice, would not comment except to say that his memorandum "speaks for itself." And Dr. Blue, who has consistently disputed Mr. Holland's criticisms, said only, "I seem to attract this kind of thing."
Dr. Blue's style -- quiet and deliberate, according to supporters, secretive and dishonest, according to critics -- rubs many people the wrong way, and he made enemies quickly on Roosevelt Island. To cut costs, and without consulting residents, he tried to reduce tram hours, end free tram passes for students who attended school off the island and raise fees for using ball fields -- all unpopular moves that were later abandoned.
Assemblyman Grannis, who is working on home-rule legislation for the island, said that Dr. Blue "plays everything very close to the vest." And, he said, "My gut tells me that he is ignoring the hidden capital needs of the island." Mr. Grannis cited maintenance of the sea wall near Octagon Park as a major concern.
To address their fears that Dr. Blue's economies might hurt the island, residents and local officials sought financial records of the operating corporation a couple of years ago. But Dr. Blue resisted, Mr. Stewart said. More than a dozen Freedom of Information Act requests yielded some information, he said, but not enough. Only after threats by local elected officials to subpoena him and his records did Dr. Blue meet with them and provide documents. But, Mr. Stewart said, there are still "a lot of questions."
Dr. Blue insists that he has been forthcoming with information and that the island is not being neglected. He said the sea wall was fine, an assertion confirmed by Tom Smyth, project manager for the Army Corps of Engineers, which has been examining the island. "Some sections are fairly old and have developed cracks, but there are no major problems," Mr. Smyth said.
And while Dr. Blue's adversaries accuse him of being remote and unresponsive to their concerns, many of his advocates say members of the Residents Association are cliquish.
"We call them the 100 families," said Edward Rademaker, who with his wife, Jessie, is one of Dr. Blue's most vocal supporters. "They are a small, well-educated group that has always had its way on the island," he said, adding that the association is not representative of most island residents, nearly half of whom are nonwhite, including some United Nations employees.
For years before Dr. Blue's arrival, Mrs. Rademaker said, she had tried to get money from the operating corporation to start a group for young adults that would offer computer training. But she said the Residents Association opposed her. She finally got $42,000 from Dr. Blue in 1997, and more than 200 people have since attended the program, she said, all but two or three of them nonwhite. Like Dr. Blue, Mr. and Mrs. Rademaker are black, and they say they believe that opposition to their program, and to Dr. Blue, has a racial component.
"I've lived here 22 years," Mr. Rademaker said. "I know what's racial and what's not. No one can tell me that I don't know what discrimination is."
Deirdre MacNamara, who is white, agreed that some criticism was racially motivated. "Dr. Blue doesn't let himself be manipulated by this small group that wants to control everything," whose members are mostly white, she said.
 
Visions for the Future Form the Crux of Disputes
While the specter of budget cuts remains a constant irritant, the major source of contention between the pro-Blue and anti-Blue forces is development. Having brought the island out of its deficit, Dr. Blue has said that it must be fully developed, as originally intended, so it can continue to be self-sufficient. None of the residents or elected officials who are involved with Roosevelt Island affairs disputes that. But many take issue with the way he has approached the task.
One of their chief complaints, they say, is that Dr. Blue does not come up with his own plans or seek community input in the planning process. Instead, Councilman Miller said, "He puts out requests for proposals, asking developers, 'How would you like to make money with my land?' and then assumes, once he picks something, that the general development plan can be amended to accommodate it."
In rebuttal, Dr. Blue points to a model of the failed 1990 Southtown project, which the corporation drafted after extensive community input but no developer agreed to build. "I keep it up as a constant reminder that that kind of development doesn't work," he said.
Mr. Miller and Mr. Grannis also argue that the master lease between the city and the state requires that any change in the development plan be subject to city approval and, under some circumstances, an environmental impact statement. (Roosevelt Island is otherwise exempt from city land use review procedures.) But Dr. Blue says the projects that are "on the table" -- a town center, a residence for the elderly, conversion of five vacant mini-schools into condominiums and the hotel and conference center -- do not violate the plan.
New plans for Southtown, the original town center, are still in the early stages and have not become controversial. The same cannot be said for other projects. For example, Dr. Blue first proposed that the residence for the elderly be built at Octagon Park, on the north end of the island. After many residents complained about losing parkland, he moved the project to Sportspark, an underused gym near the Queensboro Bridge. But developers say the project can be economically viable only if it is a 31-story building, which opponents say is far too tall for such a narrow site.
More recently, Dr. Blue's plan to convert the mini-schools into condominiums has come under fire. These small schools, in apartment complexes, have been vacant since 1992, when they were replaced by P.S./I.S. 217. Some residents say the proposed condominiums will be larger and taller than the mini-schools, thereby blocking views.
Then there are the plans for Southpoint, the approximately 10-acre site just below Goldwater Memorial Hospital, south of the Queensboro Bridge. Dr. Blue backs the proposal for the Marriott hotel whose 350 rooms would be in two 26-story towers. Plans for the $200 million project include a conference center and spa on the mostly vacant, overgrown land. Dr. Blue and the developers say the hotel would generate at least $2 million in annual revenue for the operating corporation, as well as 400 construction jobs and 100 or more permanent jobs.
A former smallpox hospital on the site, known as the Renwick ruin, will be preserved, Dr. Blue said, and the developers have agreed to "collaborate" with the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute in getting the Roosevelt memorial built. But the institute president, William vanden Heuvel, said last week that though he met with Dr. Blue last year, he has had no contact with the developers.
Meanwhile, residents worry about the toll that construction will take on their one-street island, with heavy equipment rumbling to Southpoint from the small 36th Avenue bridge, more than halfway up the island. And they worry that Southpoint will become, in Mr. Stewart's words, a "blocked-off" community to which they will be denied access.
But more than anything, they say, they worry that development of Southpoint will rob them of parkland. The island's general development plan, as last amended in 1990, includes in its list of open space a mention of "Southpoint Park, approximately 10 acres south of the Goldwater Memorial Hospital" -- the very same 10 acres earmarked for the hotel and conference center. Dr. Blue, though, insists there would still be plenty of open space left.
In his office last week, Dr. Blue reflected on the turmoil that has surrounded his tenure. "I will not let myself forget that these people are in the minority," he said of his opponents. "Most people like having a safe, clean community, and I've given them that." He acknowledged that his style had antagonized some, and said that he was trying to change, and that he held monthly resident advisory committee meetings to which all residents were welcome.
But some people say there has been no change. Last Monday, for example, Dr. Blue did not attend an evening meeting on the mini-schools that he himself had scheduled. After residents strongly complained, he scheduled another meeting for March 16. Last month, he skipped a forum on Roosevelt Island development arranged by Councilman Miller and attended by more than 100 people, including Assemblyman Grannis and the Manhattan Borough President, C. Virginia Fields.
"Why isn't Dr. Blue here," a man in the audience asked. "Can't he be brought in kicking and screaming?"
"Apparently not," Mr. Miller replied. In a later interview, Dr. Blue said that by the time he had learned of the meeting, it was too late to attend. Asked why he did not send someone to represent him, he answered quietly, "They didn't ask for anyone else."

The building identified as Island House was Motorgate, the island's parking garage.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Reactors: Healthy but Dying

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
TWENTY years after the meltdown at Three Mile Island, the nuclear industry has succeeded in ways that were hard to imagine in March of 1979 as Pennsylvania cowered in fear, plants around the country lost their luster and scores of half-built reactors were abandoned. The industry is doing better now, but ironically extinction is in sight.
Today, reactors are quietly producing about one-quarter more electricity each, and the level of radiation exposure to workers is down along with the number of automatic shut-downs. Uranium fuel is cheap and plentiful, and, with low interest rates, so is nuclear power's biggest ingredient, capital. The industry has also happily achieved a lowered public profile. 
 "And everything seems to be falling apart," Michael L. Corradini, a professor of nuclear engineering at the University of Wisconsin, said sadly.
The nuclear industry will be around for years to come, but seems to have peaked in terms of the number of working reactors and their share of power generated nationally. No reactors are being built; the last ordered were Palo Verde 1, 2 and 3 in Arizona in October, 1973, the month the Arab oil embargo began.
Since then there has been an energy revolution, but it wasn't nuclear. A barrel of oil, which has roughly enough energy to run a small house for a month, sold for $12 then; by 1979 it was $40. Today it is back down around $12. These gyrations upward lured utility companies into nuclear decisions that now look ridiculous.
For example, Millstone 3 reactor in Waterford, Conn., was far over budget during construction in the late 1970's. Even after the incident at Three Mile Island, consultants said it was still worthwhile to finish Millstone if oil averaged $96 a barrel over the reactor's lifetime. The Energy Information Administration, part of the Energy Department, predicted that the price would be $100 by the turn of the century. But oil is now about a 10th of that.
Reactors are a bit like the Concordes, the supersonic transport planes that first flew a few days before the Three Mile Island accident, or the Apollo moon rockets, which made the last of their flights to the moon a few years before. They are technological artifacts of an era slipping into history.
Cloning the best practices from one utility to another, policing each other, getting more output from the reactors, the industry essentially adopted the Greenpeace motto: a nuclear accident anywhere is a nuclear accident everywhere. It vowed to have no more meltdowns. Not counting the 1986 catastrophe at Chernobyl, where the nuclear reactors are of a different design, the industry has so far succeeded.
BUT not everyone agrees that the industry's performance is greatly improved. James P. Riccio, a nuclear expert at Critical Mass, a Washington-based nonprofit organization affiliated with Ralph Nader, said that the plants operated more now because the Nuclear Regulatory Commission had shortened the list of equipment that had to be in perfect working order for them to run, and the number of automatic shut-downs has declined because the number of manual shut-downs is up. "They've gotten more intelligent about what they're doing," he said, "but then again, they've had to."
There have been other changes in the last 20 years. If two decades ago nuclear power seemed forbidding and secret, today anyone can log on to Nuclear Regulatory Commission Web site, which offers detailed specifications for each reactor (http:// www.nrc.gov/AEOD/pib/pib.html). For Three Mile Island unit 1, the undamaged twin of the reactor that had the meltdown, the data includes the identification numbers stamped on the water pumps. Another table for Three Mile Island shows the temperatures and pressures at which the emergency systems will automatically start, with different numbers depending on how many coolant pumps are running.
But elsewhere technology is accelerating, too. Natural gas has become cheaper to find and recover, and the system for turning it into electricity has improved steadily. The newest plants produce twice as many kilowatt-hours from a thousand cubic feet as the ones that nuclear power was competing with in 1979.
The real reactor killer, according to Professor Corradini and others, is something that was not thought of in 1979 -- deregulation in the the utility industry. Nationwide, power companies are fissioning into companies that will distribute electricity and sell it to consumers (like local phone companies) and other companies that will generate power and compete to sell it (like long distance carriers).
THE companies that built the 104 reactors still operating ordered them in the 1960's and early 1970's. Asked then which source of power would be the cheapest in the next few decades, they had guessed nuclear, knowing that if they were off by a few tenths of a cent per kilowatt-hour, the consumer would pay or reap the difference. Now, if they are asked the question at all, they say natural gas. Today they are building nothing and buying power from independent producers, none of whom seems inclined to place a multi-billion-dollar bet on a reactor where the output might be uncompetitive in 2010, or 2020 or 2030, for that matter.
"The investment risk changed," said James K. Joosten, a nuclear engineer and consultant and former official of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of industrialized nations. "In old days, people used to talk about nuclear power in religious terms, and say, 'It's good and we need to do it and if the public doesn't buy into it, we'll make them buy into it.' Realistically, today it's a business decision."
By Mr. Joosten's estimate, if electricity is completely deregulated, the market price will be about 2 cents per kilowatt-hour at the wholesale level, a price that about 28 nuclear plants cannot achieve. And if some states offer a one-time payment to their utilities because they have to close such plants in the transition to deregulation, then some reactor owners with marginal plants will jump at that offer while they can get it.

HEADLINE: A Rise in Allergies to Latex Threatens Medical Workers

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
The first signs that Dr. Barbara Zucker-Pinchoff's life was about to come apart were small and seemingly innocuous.
As she lay on an operating table at New York University Medical Center in 1988, preparing for the birth of her second child by Caesarean section, her nose began to itch. She felt terribly congested, her hands started to swell and her face turned beet red. She told her husband she thought she was allergic to the hospital's air-conditioning system. 
 But then her blood pressure started to dive and she was headed toward anaphylactic shock, a dangerous condition caused by an extreme allergic reaction. As doctors rushed to take the baby from her womb, others pumped her with epinephrine to raise her blood pressure.
But it was not the air-conditioner that caused her nearly to die. Nor was it, as she had suspected, the drug she received for pain relief.
It was, she was shocked to discover later, an allergic reaction to the latex gloves that covered the two sets of hands that dipped inside her during surgery. That allergy was so severe, it ended her career as an anesthesiologist because she was unable to wear the gloves or to be near others wearing them.
More than 10 percent of the country's health care workers are allergic to latex, an allergy that was almost unheard of a decade ago.
About a half-dozen state legislatures, including New York's, have introduced legislation to limit the use of latex gloves in hospitals and other medical offices or to develop committees within their health departments to study the issue. No important proposal has become law, however, often because of lobbying by glove makers.
Critics complain that the Federal Food and Drug Administration has been slow to act on the problem and has taken too long even to consider regulating latex use in hospitals.
Glove manufacturers say they are reluctant to turn out alternatives because doctors complain that nonlatex gloves are less comfortable and provide less protection. And hospitals balk at the cost of the alternatives, which are usually about 30 percent more expensive than latex. Further, many medical professionals hesitate to admit that they could have the allergy, for fear of ruining their careers.
"It is extremely serious," said Anne Schott, a spokeswoman for the New York State Nurses Association. "Latex is everywhere in the hospital environment, and if someone develops a serious allergy, that is a huge impediment to a normal life."
Experts said as many as 17 percent of those in health care who work almost exclusively in hospitals and with patients' fluids, like nurses in emergency and operating rooms, could be allergic to latex, since allergies to latex worsen with exposure to the material.
The illness affects roughly 3 percent of the general population, and since the late 1980's, at least 30 people have died of latex-related illnesses, experts on the allergy say. The number is small compared with, for example, allergic reactions to penicillin, which cause 400 to 800 deaths a year.
The sharp rise in reported allergies, experts said, stems from a sevenfold increase in the use of the gloves since 1987, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began recommending that most health care workers wear them to protect against infection from H.I.V.
Natural rubber latex, derived from the sap of the rubber tree, contains proteins that can cause allergies. The powder that manufacturers sprinkle inside the gloves to help them slip easily onto hands absorbs those proteins, and when the gloves are snapped on or off, the powder is released in the air. Allergic reactions to the gloves, from direct contact or inhalation of the powder, range from hives to asthma to anaphylactic shock and even death.
There is no known cure for latex allergies, but treatments for the symptoms range from over-the-counter antihistamines, for the mildest symptoms, to steroids, to epinephrine for shock. (Doctors caution that not all hand rashes from gloves indicate a true latex allergy.)
The allergy is unpredictable, and it can be devastating. In some people, allergies build up slowly through the years, starting with hand rashes that turn into a serious respiratory disease. Others, like Dr. Zucker-Pinchoff, have no symptoms until they find themselves in near-fatal shock.
After a person becomes sensitized, routine chores can become threatening, the elastic in a pair of stockings toxic, a trip to the dentist impossible. Someone with the allergy cannot use latex condoms, which are generally believed to offer the best protection against H.I.V. infection.
"Children's birthday parties are a menace," Dr. Zucker-Pinchoff said, since latex balloons can send her into a fit of wheezing and choking.
Most troublesome is that those who are allergic to latex are often made much sicker when they seek treatment because doctors' offices and hospitals, where the air is thick with latex powder, are the most dangerous places.
This was true for Lieut. Harold Henderson, a military nurse in San Diego who went into shock and died in 1997 during a hospital stay for an allergic reaction to latex.
"He had three heart attacks while I was there to pick him up," said his wife, Christine Henderson, adding that although the staff knew he was allergic and tried to keep his room free of latex, powder in a doctor's hair or something else probably caused the fatal reaction.
"It was always in the back of my mind that he could die, but you don't think that it is actually going to happen," she said. "You think it is going to get better if you stay away from it enough."
The market for latex gloves increased sharply when the C.D.C. announced its universal AIDS precaution, with dozens of new manufacturers eager to tap this market. Many critics contend that the gloves were made more cheaply, as a way of competing on costs, and that the cheaper gloves, because they contained more protein, made the problem worse.
What makes the illness especially hard to manage, doctors said, is the difficulty in diagnosing it, because the blood test most commonly used is fairly inaccurate. "One of the biggest dilemmas is actually making the diagnosis," said Dr. Kenneth T. Kim, the chairman of occupational health at the American College of Allergy Asthma and Immunology. "Not many people have access to the well-tested skin prick test, which is in trial already and awaiting F.D.A. approval."
Many who suffer from the allergy complain that the test has yet to be approved, but their complaints about the F.D.A. do not stop there. Although the Federal agency held a conference on the latex problem in 1992, it has not created any of the promised regulations, other than the requirement that medical devices containing latex be identified as a possible allergen. The agency is considering requiring manufacturers to indicate on the label the amount of protein and powder in their gloves.
Officials at the agency say that drafting regulations for latex is difficult because there is no universal agreement about how much powder is dangerous to those who have yet to be sensitized to the allergy, about how effective latex-alternative gloves are, and about how much their higher costs could hurt hospitals.
"A regulation has to be well-grounded in science," said Dr. Bruce Burlington, the director of the F.D.A.'s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. "It is intended to be a thoughtful, contemplative process that involves detailed analysis of economic impact and a number of other factors. This is running along at about average speed, given the scientific complexity."
Glove manufacturers, which have found themselves the subjects of lawsuits, have tried to block legislation banning latex gloves. At the same time, they are creating alternative products.
Representatives from Johnson & Johnson, for example, have written to state legislators to oppose bills that would ban powdered latex in hospitals. Meanwhile, the company has been producing low-powder gloves and options to latex.
"We have been putting forward the alternatives," said John McKeegan, a company spokesman. "But there is a demand out there for powdered gloves, and they are the ones that sell the best."
Regent Medical has been very aggressive in marketing its powder-free gloves, including surgical gloves called Biogel, which have a powder substitute that helps the glove slip on. Yet powder-free gloves make up only 5 percent of the company's glove business, a spokeswoman said.
A handful of hospitals across the country -- including Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, St. Mary's Hospital in Waterbury, Conn., and Olean Hospital in Olean, N.Y. -- have either banned latex gloves or restricted them to certain parts of their buildings. But in general, doctors, particularly surgeons, resist nonlatex alternatives.
"I have been working with the surgeons to buy into this process," said Deborah Blazys, an emergency room nurse at St. Mary's in Connecticut and a chairwoman of the hospital's latex task force. "A lot of times it is just habit, so we bring them in on choosing the products."
Sometimes, even medical workers with the allergy resist change. "They think, 'I desperately need this high-paying job in this prestigious teaching hospital, I need the medical insurance and I cannot afford to acknowledge a latex allergy,' " said Gail Lenehan, chairwoman of the Massachusetts Emergency Nurses Association's Latex Allergy Task Force. "I have heard female surgeons say they live in a man's world and fear a bias against them, and residents say they won't speak up because they are low on the totem pole."
Still, some hospitals are starting to change. "We wanted to be a leader in this area," said Robert G. Hamilton, an associate professor of medicine and pathology at Johns Hopkins, which is becoming latex free. "Cost is the fundamental question. But we purchased a sufficient volume of stretch vinyl, which resulted in no change in cost."
An increasing number of lawsuits are charging manufacturers with negligence and product liability, or with continuing to market a product that they know to be harmful.
Howell Rosenberg, a partner with Brookman, Rosenberg, Brown & Sandler, a law firm in Philadelphia, estimated that about 250 cases against glove manufacturers have gone to Federal courts around the country, up from about 25 cases two and a half years ago. His office is handling a suit on behalf of all the Federal cases, roughly 12 percent of which are from New York. Dozens more are being tried in state courts.
"I think it is going to be closely watched," Mr. Rosenberg said. "We are talking about lots of people, and the greatest number of victims are in health care. That is a very significant segment of the work force who are doing very important jobs."

 CORRECTION:
An article on March 7 about allergic reactions to latex gloves among medical workers described gloves manufactured by Regent Medical incorrectly. None of the company's gloves are sprinkled with a powder to make them easier to put on (the powder can cause an allergic reaction). The five percent figure used in the article referred to the percentage of the company's gloves that are non-latex, not the percentage that are powder-free.

GRAPHIC: Photos: Dr. Barbara Zucker-Pinchoff, with her daughters Lilly, left, and Marian, can no longer work as an anesthesiologist because she is allergic to latex. A reaction to gloves used when she gave birth nearly killed her. Harold Henderson, here with his wife, Christine, died from an allergic reaction to latex in 1997.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN;
Las Vegas

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY; BRETT PULLEY is a national correspondent for The Times.

 BODY:
For the many people planning to visit Las Vegas since hearing that it had become family oriented, with plenty of affordable fun for the young and old, time may be running out. The place seems to be in a perpetual state of transformation, and the casino companies that built the amusement parks and Disneylike attractions in the early 1990's have now set their sights on more upscale tourists, building luxury hotels and casinos with couture shops and restaurants operated by world-renowned chefs.
Redefining itself is what keeps Las Vegas fresh and keeps people returning -- especially with casino gambling available all around the country. From its gangster beginnings, to its martini-drenched Rat Pack age, its Elvis era, its Sin City days and its most recent family-friendly years, this other city that never sleeps also never stays the same. All along Las Vegas Boulevard, better known as the Strip, there is so much construction machinery reaching into the sky these days that locals now joke that the official state bird is the crane. 
 The cheap buffets and modestly priced rooms are still here -- as is the Liberace Museum -- but the new Bellagio hotel and casino, which tries to combine high cost and high culture, may change all of that.
With an estimated $300 million in paintings and sculptures on display at Bellagio, suddenly everyone's an art expert: The guy parking cars outside raves about the Monets, Picassos and Renoirs inside, while a cocktail waitress discusses Dale Chihuly, the artist who created the lobby's gigantic glass sculpture chandelier, near which champagne and caviar are served daily ($68 for 30 grams of beluga).
Other opulent casino hotels, including the Venetian and the Paris, are scheduled to open in the next several months. But for now, the budget conscious need not be dismayed. The ailing Asian economy, which has kept many of the high rollers away, and the abundance of hotel rooms have kept room rates reasonable. But once the big-spending foreign gamblers return, prices are sure to rise.
 
Events
 The city's newest luxury resort, Mandalay Bay, was to open on Tuesday -- topped off by a separate hotel, the Four Seasons, on its 35th through 39th floors, with a separate entrance and elevators. The show at the main theater of the tropical-theme Mandalay Bay hotel and casino, at 3950 Las Vegas Boulevard South, will be the Broadway musical "Chicago." Tickets are $55 to $75, with eight shows a week.
On April 10, Luciano Pavarotti will open the Mandalay Bay Events Center, a 12,000-seat concert, entertainment and sports complex next to the hotel, with a performance at 8 P.M. Tickets: $50 to $450. Information: (877) 632-7400.
"Treasures of Russia," 1,100 works of Czarist art from the State Museum Reserve of Peterhof, near St. Petersburg, continues through April 15 at the Rio Suite Casino and Hotel, 3700 West Flamingo Road, (800) 752-9746. Timed tickets (10 A.M. to 6:45 P.M. daily) cost $7 to $12 from the box office and Ticketmaster, (702) 474-4000.
For five days of country eating, country music and cowboy competition, the Laughlin Rodeo Days featuring the Laughlin River Stampede Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association Championship takes place 90 miles south of Las Vegas in Laughlin, Nev., April 7 to 11. More than 500 of the world's best rodeo contestants will compete on the banks of the Colorado River. Tickets for April 7 and 8 are $10 a day, for April 9 to 11 $15. Information: (800) 227-5245.
The golfer Hale Irwin will try to win his third straight title at the Las Vegas Senior Classic May 13 to 16. The Senior PGA Tour event will be contested at the Tournament Players Club at Summerlin and the Tournament Players Club at the Canyons. Daily tickets are $15 and $20, and a tournament pass is $50. Information: (702) 242-3000.
A variety of musicians and singers, illusionists, comedians, showgirls and acrobats perform at the casino theaters each evening. A listing of performances can be found at www.lasvegas24hours.com or by calling (702) 892-7575.
 
 
Sightseeing
 Bellagio, which opened in October at 3600 Las Vegas Boulevard South, is full of attractions. Outside it looks like an Italian village and has an eight-acre lake with more than 1,000 illuminated fountains. In the evening, the water jets up to 240 feet in the air, choreographed to popular music. The show is free and performed every half hour from 5 P.M. until midnight Sunday through Friday, and 2 P.M. to midnight on Saturday. Information: (702) 693-7111.
Inside the hotel is the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art, with a small but blue chip selection of works by Monet, Renoir, Picasso, van Gogh, Pollock and de Kooning, among others (the works can be purchased, so the lineup can change without notice). The gallery is open daily 9 A.M. to 11:30 P.M. (children are allowed from 9 to 11 A.M. only) Admission is $12, and includes a recorded tour. Information: (888) 488-7111.
The wait to enter the gallery is made much more bearable by the fact that the line passes through a breathtaking conservatory and botanical garden, with a 50-foot-high glass ceiling and fragrances and flowers that will change seasonally. Lines are shortest later at night.
Starting April 14, another piece of Italy comes to the Strip. Afternoons and evenings at the Venetian, 3355 Las Vegas Boulevard South, the bell inside the 315-foot-high reproduction of the Campanile will ring on the hour and 500 white homing pigeons will be released from gondolas to fly over the arched bridges and piazzas of this Venice look-alike. A canal will wind through the shopping mall, whose centerpiece is a reproduction of Renaissance era St. Mark's Square, and for a yet-to-be-set fee visitors can ride with singing gondoliers. Along the streets, costumed characters like Napoleon, Casanova and Marco Polo will give live performances. The mall is scheduled to be open 10 A.M. to 11 A.M. Sunday to Thursday and till midnight Friday and Saturday; (702) 733-5000.
To get back to reality, head 55 miles northeast of the city to the 35,000-acre Valley of Fire State Park. Open from sunrise to sunset, the early-morning and late-afternoon sunlight here intensifies the red of the sandstone formations. From Las Vegas, take I-15 north to Highway 169. Admission is $5 a car. Information: (702) 397-2088.
From the observation deck of Hoover Dam, about 25 miles south of Las Vegas on Highway 93-95, you can peer 700 feet down to the Colorado River. Tours (35 minutes) are conducted from 8 A.M. to 5:15 P.M. daily; $8, $7 ages 62 and up, and $2 for children 6 to 16. Information: (702) 293-8367.
Sightseeing Tours Unlimited offers daily bus, airplane and helicopter tours of the Grand Canyon, which is 280 miles from Las Vegas. The all-day bus tour is $90 a person, the airplane tour $100 ($160 with the ground tour), and the helicopter tour is $255 ($305 with the ground tour). Information: (702) 471-7155.
 
Where to Stay
 Despite the recent trend toward higher-priced luxury hotels, there is still a large supply of first-rate accommodations for less than $100 a night. But prices rise and rooms are scarce on weekends or when major events are in town.
Unlike the city it's named after, New York-New York Hotel and Casino, 3790 Las Vegas Boulevard South, (800) 693-6763, fax (702) 740-6920, is medium priced. A 47-story version of the Empire State Building is at the heart of the "skyline," and the property includes such other scaled-down Gotham landmarks as a 300-foot-long Brooklyn Bridge and a 150-foot-tall Statue of Liberty. The 2,033 hotel rooms and suites have an Art Deco theme. Doubles: $50 to $300 on weekdays, $90 to $400 on weekends.
Budget: The Quality Inn, 377 East Flamingo Road, (800) 634-6617, fax (702) 369-6911, is less than a mile from the Strip and has its own casino. All 318 rooms have wet bars, refrigerators and coffee makers. Doubles start at $59.99 on weekdays, $99.99 on weekends.
Two blocks from the Strip and one from the Las Vegas Convention Center is the Best Western Mardi Gras Inn, 3500 Paradise Road, (702) 731-2020, fax (702) 731-4005. All 314 rooms have a separate sitting area and wet bar, and the hotel has a small casino. Doubles cost $49 to $109 during the week, and $69 to $109 on weekends.
Luxury: Still one of the most recognized names on the Strip is Caesars Palace, 3570 Las Vegas Boulevard South, (800) 634-6661, fax (702) 731-7172. This giant hotel and casino has plenty of Las Vegas nostalgia and nouveau extravagance. The newest tower, which opened a little over a year ago, brought the total of rooms and suites to 2,471. All of the rooms have marble baths. Doubles: $79 to $450.
Bellagio, 3600 Las Vegas Boulevard South, (702) 693-7111, fax (702) 693-8585, is luxurious in every detail, from its grand lobby to its Mediterranean-style pool area with six pools. The 3,005 deluxe rooms and suites, all with marble bathrooms, have sweeping views of the resort's eight-acre lake, the Las Vegas skyline and the mountains beyond the city. Standard doubles from $159 to $459, and suites from $375 to $1,400.
 
Where to Eat
 Long known for low-priced buffets, Las Vegas has become a city of high-priced haute cuisine. Celebrity chefs from around the country have opened restaurants in the new luxury casinos and shopping malls over the last few years. Among the most popular is Emeril's, at the MGM Grand, 3799 Las Vegas Boulevard South, (702) 891-7374. Emeril Lagasse serves up Creole cooking, specializing in fish, and a seafood bar. Lunch and dinner are served daily in the wide-open, somewhat noisy dining room. A three-course dinner for two with wine will cost about $125.
Prime, a 1930's-style chophouse operated by Jean-Georges Vongerichten, one of New York City's hottest chefs, is one of many pricey restaurants inside Bellagio, 3600 Las Vegas Boulevard South, (702) 693-7111. The steaks, seafood and chops are top quality, with prices to match, and the garden patio view of the casino's lake and fountain show add to the experience. Dinner only; a three-course meal for two with wine will cost about $250.
At least one big-name newcomer to this city's restaurant scene has struck out on its own, unattached to any new casino projects. Smith & Wollensky, the famous New York steakhouse, has opened a branch at 3767 Las Vegas Boulevard South, across from the Monte Carlo, that copies the look of the original, inside and out; (702) 862-4100. Lunch and dinner are served daily, with a three-course meal for two with an inexpensive wine costing about $150.
For a more affordable lunch or a late dinner, try the Noodle Kitchen at the Mirage, 3400 Las Vegas Boulevard South, (702) 791-7111. The service is fast and the menu includes Chinese noodles, barbecued meats and poultry, and rice porridge. A meal for two, with drinks, will cost about $30.
The casino hotels have a variety of restaurants, including some with huge buffets at low prices. The Stratosphere Hotel and Casino, 2000 Las Vegas Boulevard South, serves a prime rib buffet dinner for $8.99 Monday through Thursday and on Saturday, and a seafood buffet dinner for $11.25 on Sunday and Friday. Information: (702) 380-7777.

HEADLINE: Bridgemarket Emerging, After 22 Years

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
SLOW down, you move too fast," Simon and Garfunkel counseled in their "59th Street Bridge Song" of 1966. That may have been the last time anyone thought anything was moving fast around the Queensboro Bridge. Until now.
An almost legendarily stalled project to reclaim the nave-like vaulted hall under the bridge's Manhattan approach is well under construction. The $24 million, 98,000-square-foot Bridgemarket complex is to open later this year, barring further complications. There is to be a market-style Food Emporium, two restaurants operated by Sir Terence Conran, a high-end Conran home-furnishings store reached through a swoop-roofed pavilion on 59th Street and a landscaped plaza with a fountain. 
 "The whole thing fits neatly together, it's 100 percent leased and we're moving forward very rapidly with construction," said Sheldon M. Gordon, the managing partner of Bridgemarket Associates, which is developing the space on a lease from the city that runs to 2036. The architects are Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates.
"The 59th Street Bridge is a seam between two neighborhoods," said Charles Millard, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, which is leasing the space. "This project diminishes the sense of its being a hulking barrier to the neighborhood to the north."
Indeed, the prospect of Bridgemarket has rekindled developers' interest in the block between First and York Avenues, 60th and 61st Streets, where the Glick Organization planned a huge project in the 1980's.
The Milstein Organization is planning its first new development in a decade: a $100 million, 37-story, 430,000-square-foot tower with 170 to 200 apartments, designed largely for families with children. Demolition has begun on the L-shaped site along First Avenue.
On the York Avenue end, the developer Sheldon Solow is planning a project that would be mainly residential, perhaps with retail space and parking. To avoid a single skyscraper so tall that it would ignite the community's wrath -- as Donald J. Trump has done a half mile south with his 72-story Trump World Tower project -- Mr. Solow might construct two buildings in the 40-story range.
One big question concerns the Alexander's site between Lexington and Third Avenues, 58th and 59th Streets. The department store is falling to the wreckers. But the Vornado Realty Trust, which effectively controls the full-block parcel, is mum on its intentions.
There is an even larger question. Does the current wave of prospective development augur economic and esthetic rehabilitation? Or does it threaten to draw so many more people and vehicles that it will choke an already congested gateway and cast a shadow over genteel enclaves nearby?
It is not so much any one project as the cumulative effect that concerns Community Board 8 on the Upper East Side. "With Milstein here and Solow there, you have 600 new families in a single block," said M. Barry Schneider, its chairman. "Do you have the resources -- the playgrounds, parks, schools, transportation, sanitation, neighborhood convenience stores? All of a sudden we have a large community within our community."
Joseph B. Rose, the chairman of the City Planning Commission, believes new buildings can be accommodated. "It's an area that is clearly ready to be redeveloped," he said. "The key issue is to make sure that whatever additional development is allowed works in a way that doesn't aggravate the traffic flow in that area. What uses and what densities are allowed is a sensitive issue in terms of its impact on traffic."
More than sensitive, it is critical, said Councilman A. Gifford Miller, who represents the district. "The entire East Side was zoned with the understanding that the Second Avenue subway was going to get built," he said. "Each new building adds a greater burden to a transportation system that's bursting at the gills."
Although the Alexander's site is not in the immediate shadow of the bridge, it is bound to have an impact. The property is owned by a real estate investment trust called Alexander's Inc., 29 percent of which is owned by Vornado and 27 percent by a partnership controlled by Steven Roth, the chairman and chief executive of Vornado.
In a 1998 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Alexander's REIT anticipated a "large multi-use building requiring capital in excess of $300 million." But Buildings Department records show no application has been received yet for new construction permits.
"There have been no definitive plans announced at this time," is all that a spokeswoman for Vornado would say.
Under the C5-2 zoning designation on the site, the block could accommodate a structure with a floor area up to 12 times the lot size. That would be 1 million square feet, about eight percent larger than Bloomingdale's across 59th Street.
Retail, commercial and residential use would be permitted under the zoning, but not movie theaters. The subway entrance at 59th Street and Lexington Avenue would have to be incorporated into the building.
Word in the neighborhood has it that a Nordstrom department store might be part of the development. A spokeswoman for Nordstrom in Seattle said that while the company would "very much like to be in Manhattan some day," it did not discuss potential sites, as a matter of policy. And the Vornado spokeswoman said she would not reply to rumors and speculation.
For the moment, the action is to the east. Mr. Rose said one important step toward redevelopment around the Queensboro Bridge involved the disentanglement of a restrictive declaration under which the Glick Organization won a rezoning in 1989 against considerable local opposition.
Taking almost the entire block, the Glick project was to have had two 42-story apartment towers, a hotel, shopping gallery, garage, health spa and offices. The architect was Costas Kondylis.
The restrictive declaration obliged the developer to provide public amenities nearby, including the rehabilitation of a small park across 60th Street under the bridge approach. But before Glick could proceed, the collapse of the real estate market achieved what the neighbors could not -- stopping the project cold.
In 1996, Paul Milstein stepped in to acquire the west end of the Glick assemblage. He and his brother, Seymour, completed their last apartment building at Battery Park City in 1990 and have since concentrated on the reconstruction of the New York Presbyterian Hospital at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center campus in Washington Heights, to which their family has given more than $35 million.
Before the Milsteins could proceed, they negotiated a reduction in their obligation under the restrictive declaration, to reflect the fact that they are only building on part of the Glick parcel. They will establish a $700,000 fund, the interest from which is supposed to provide a permanent maintenance fund for the nearby park.
Mr. Kondylis is the architect again. He said the cruciform building would draw inspiration from prewar apartments in design and layouts. "It's going to create an audience for Bridgemarket," Mr. Kondylis said, "and it's going to be an amenity for those in the building to be able to cross the street and be in that market."
Mr. Solow, who is returning to residential development after a 10-year hiatus, must renegotiate the restrictive declaration, since two-thirds of his property was once part of the Glick assemblage. He will also require rezoning for the York Avenue end of his parcel, on which residential development is not currently permitted. Both actions require full land-use review, involving the community board, Manhattan borough president, City Planning Commission and City Council. The site might accommodate a project around 500,000 square feet.
"It is going to be a very high quality residential building consistent with others he has built," said Samuel H. Lindenbaum of Rosenman & Colin, who is Mr. Solow's lawyer. The architects are to be Davis Brody Bond, who designed Mr. Solow's One East River Place, at the east end of 72d Street, completed in 1989.
EQUALLY noteworthy, though far more modest, is the 14-story, 53,000-square-foot building under construction at 315 East 61st Street. The developer is RFR Davis but the target audience is not their typical affluent clientele.
Instead, the developers will turn the building over to the Metropolitan New York Coordinating Council on Jewish Poverty, a nonprofit and nonsectarian organization, which will operate it as a 53-unit home for lower-income elderly residents, chosen by lottery. The apartments may rent for as little as $450 to $500 a month. Meltzer/Mandl Architects designed the building, which is to be completed late this year.
In return for constructing this project under the "inclusionary housing" program, RFR Davis will receive a bonus of 200,000 square feet -- roughly 200 apartments -- applicable to the 11 luxury towers it is developing within the boundaries of Community Board 8, which covers the East Side from 59th to 96th Streets. Trevor Davis, a partner in the company, said the bonus would be apportioned among the projects.
"Inclusionary housing is not used that frequently," said Peter Brest, chief operating officer of the Met Council. "We're delighted it's being used in this case. Although 53 units may seem like a drop in the bucket, any additional housing for the elderly is very important."
Many New Yorkers have grown old waiting for something to happen in one of the greatest little-known public spaces in Manhattan: a 120- by 275-foot hypostyle hall under the Queensboro Bridge, from whose terra-cotta-clad columns spring 36 domed vaults over 30- by 30-foot bays, varying in elevation from 24 to 44 feet.
Majestic enough to be likened to a cathedral, as the Landmarks Preservation Commission noted in its 1974 designation of the bridge, the space was designed by Henry Hornbostel with ceiling tiles laid at perpendicular angles to form self-supporting vaults. The method was developed by the Guastavino Fireproof Construction Company, founded in 1889 by Rafael Guastavino y Esposito. Other famous Guastavino vaults are in Grand Central Terminal (they dominate the Oyster Bar) and the old Immigration Station on Ellis Island.
The straw color of the tiles and the basket-weave pattern conjure a marketplace. And as it happens, that was an early function of the hall. It was unenclosed when it opened in 1914 but walls were later added.
Another improvement came in 1919 from Evangeline Wilbour Blashfield, who had been a moving force in the creation of the Municipal Art Society. She noticed on a visit to the market that the vendors' water supply came from just one spigot. Her response was to donate a 17 1/2-foot-tall granite fountain, designed by Charles W. Stoughton, with a carved bull's head for a spout. Above the carving is a richly colorful mosaic depicting Abundance reclining on her cornucopia.
The vendors were nonplussed, wrote Gregory F. Gilmartin in "Shaping the City: New York and the Municipal Art Society" (Clarkson Potter, 1995). Blashfield explained, "Why, painters have no pigment for making pictures that can compare with your lemons and oranges and bananas and grapes, your tomatoes, even your onions."
The market closed by the 1930's and the space ultimately came into the hands of the Highways Department, which used it as a garage, sign shop and storeroom.
It was forgotten until 1973, when plans were unveiled for a Cinematheque designed by I. M. Pei, including a semicircular stainless-steel pavilion on the plaza.
After that fizzled, the developer Harley Baldwin burst on the scene in 1977 with "Bridgemarket," by Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer. It was to have a farmers' market, gourmet shops and restaurants, with a three-sided mezzanine inside the vaulted hall and two new structures outside.
"Another so-called farmers' market is quite unnecessary," Suzanne LaCroix, president of the Sutton Area Community group, declared at the time. "As a matter of fact, the proposed Bridgemarket would only exacerbate the devastating vehicular congestion around the bridge."
Opponents managed to derail the plan in the State Assembly. Mr. Baldwin bounced back in 1981 with a revised project, having enlisted Mr. Gordon -- a developer, owner and operator of West Coast shopping centers -- as his partner in Bridgemarket.
In 1983, the Board of Estimate approved a lease for 46,000 square feet but the Koch administration later amended the lease, without seeking board approval, to allow a project of up to 130,000 square feet.
Construction had begun on the project in 1985 when Sutton Area Community sued Bridgemarket and the city. It won two rulings but the Court of Appeals found in 1994 that no additional approval had been needed and that the lease was valid.
"In the meantime, we lost our financing and lost all of our tenants," said Mr. Gordon, who had stepped into the role of managing partner, with Mr. Baldwin becoming a limited partner, which he remains. Rather than seek many small tenants, Mr. Gordon decided in the next go-around to concentrate on a few larger ones.
Enter Sir Terence.
His company, Conran Holdings, was looking to bring its Conran Shop and Conran Collection to New York and also expand its burgeoning restaurant business, which includes Quaglino's, Bluebird and Le Pont de la Tour in London. Conran was introduced to Bridgemarket by Richard Seligman, who was then a broker at Insignia/ESG.
"We fell in love with the site, like many before us," said Joel Kissin, who helped start the restaurant business and is now president of Bridgemarket Restaurant Inc.
Not yet named, the Conran restaurants will occupy 26,000 square feet. The main floor dining room will feature a mid- to upper-priced menu of roasts, grills and shellfish. It will seat 300 people inside and 60 people outside, with private dining rooms for 20 and 40. On a mezzanine will be a more luxurious and higher-priced restaurant for 100, with a private dining room for 40. There will be two bars and a two-story display kitchen. The restaurants and shop are being designed by C.D. Partnership.
The 35,000-square-foot housewares store will occupy a new basement space under a floor slab that has been built in the market hall, slightly higher than the original floor. (The tallest vault is now 34 feet high.) Pamela Loeffelman, a senior associate at Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer, said the additions are independent of the bridge structure. The new exterior windows, she said, would match the originals in profile and scale.
The shop will not be a revival of the fresh-out-of-college-and-still-on-a-budget Conran's that New Yorkers remember at the Citicorp Center. Instead, Mr. Kissin said, it will be a higher quality and higher priced store selling furniture; bathroom, kitchen and table ware and cosmetics.
The shop will be reached through a 3,800-square-foot glass-walled pavilion on 59th Street with a curving roof. "The bridge goes in one direction and this goes in a kind of counterpoint," Mr. Kissin said. "We wanted it very much to be see-through."
East of the pavilion is to be a plaza on which the Blashfield fountain will be relocated. The designer is Lynden B. Miller, whose projects have included the renovation of Bryant Park and the construction of Robert F. Wagner Jr. Park at Battery Park City. The construction manager for the overall project is the F. J. Sciame Construction Company. The bridge rehabilitation is by the city's Transportation Department.
Twenty-four of the bays in the main hall will be occupied by Food Emporium, whose overall space is 35,000 square feet.
But it will not look anything like a standard supermarket. "We want to reinvent Food Emporium for this space," said Roger T. Turley, vice president of development for the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, of which Food Emporium is a subsidiary. "We plan to create a special ambiance capitalizing on the volume and the beauty of the space."
THAT is not so easy under landmarked Guastavino vaults. "We're not permitted to hang things from the open vault space," Mr. Turley said. "Lighting, heating, ventilation, air-conditioning -- the things you take for granted in a normal, traditional space -- became a major challenge." As an example, rather than using forced-air heating, which requires ductwork, the space will be heated by pipes within the floor slab.
Mr. Turley said each department would be distinctive, "almost like a collection of various markets." There will be 275 kinds of cheese, he said; 300 kinds of fish and seafood and 700 produce items; a bakery; a demonstration kitchen, and a flower stand. The store is being designed by Sam Burman of Food Emporium and Roland Gebhardt.
Separated by a glass wall, the tenants profess an "excellent relationship and rapport" (Mr. Turley) that have yielded a "good cooperative effort" (Mr. Kissin). Yet last year at this time, Conran was suing Bridgemarket, since A. & P. was not Sir Terence's idea of an appropriately upscale neighbor. The suit has since been settled and Mr. Gordon is clearly eager to move beyond Bridgemarket's troubled past, although he concedes, "This is not what I'd call the best real estate deal I've ever done."
After 22 years on the job, the architect Hugh Hardy sees a silver lining. "I really do think that the final result is the best of all possibilities -- including all of our other schemes -- having it as simple as it is, with three basic activities," he said.
Jennifer J. Raab, the chairwoman of the Landmarks Preservation Commission, believes the resolution allows "a very ambitious retail project to go forward in a way that enhances the landmark."
After all, she noted, shoppers and diners will constitute a new audience for the long-lost architectural treasure. "How many people get to see the Guastavino vaults now?" Ms. Raab asked. "Certainly not enough. That's a preservation purpose: bringing people into this marvelous historic space. There's a great preservation investment going on. But it wasn't going to happen without commercial investment as well."
The city will receive a rent of about $400,000 a year and a share of revenues.
At the end of a two-decade struggle, Richard J. Eyen, a leading opponent in the neighborhood, is keenly disappointed.
"The two main things we wanted were: nothing on the plaza and nothing to obscure those gorgeous arches," he said. "We ended up not only with a big structure on the plaza and a mezzanine inside but a vertical separation" -- between market and restaurants.
Councilman Miller, who was only 8 years old when Bridgemarket was first proposed, has not taken a formal stand on the project because his mother, Lynden, is designing the landscaping.
"I did take the position," he said, "that I was sure her gardens would be beautiful."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS;
After ClimbingSo Many Mountains, a Ski Resort Giant Stumbles

BYLINE: By JULIE FLAHERTY 

 BODY:
IT was a bold strategy: Buy like mad, build like mad, pay for it with an initial stock offering and a lot of borrowed money, and pray that the snow -- and the customers -- would keep coming.
For almost five years it was an exhilarating ride, as the American Skiing Company grew from a single Maine resort in 1994 to nine in New England and the Rockies. Hotels bought, condos built, new snow machines and gondolas installed: The company was pumping millions into its strategy of rapidly building itself into a giant in winter recreation. 
 Then the juggernaut crashed into the season that wouldn't start. Unusually warm weather in the East combined with a dry spell in the West in the first few months of the 1998-99 season to keep trails bare and cash registers empty. And the cracks that soon appeared in American Skiing's financial results call into question the wisdom of barreling ahead so fast in an industry that depends so profoundly on Mother Nature's fickle graces.
The snows last week in New England came too late to rescue the company's second quarter, which ended Jan. 24. On Monday, American Skiing announced a net loss of $10.8 million, even worse than it had forecast in January, on revenue of $109.5 million. Resort revenue fell $3.7 million from the corresponding period the previous year, while real estate revenue declined $1.6 million. And during what was supposed to be the company's most active quarter, 30 employees, mostly in middle management, were laid off at three of the resorts.
"No one can say that they are happy about having the kind of weather that we've had," said Leslie B. Otten, the company's founder, chairman and chief executive. "Long term, I don't think this is going to have any detrimental effect to the company. In the short term, it is something that we understand and expect will happen from time to time."
With two prominent banks, Fleet and BankBoston, in the company's corner as lenders, analysts had high hopes for American Skiing when it went public at $18 a share in November 1997. But within a year, the stock had slid to $5 a share; it closed last week at $3.75
Daniel Noll, a ski industry analyst with the Chapman Company in Baltimore, called American Skiing the most highly leveraged in the winter recreation industry and the most aggressive in real estate development. When the company found that it had to defer some projects, "they disappointed the analysts on Wall Street, and that's just been a big penalty for them," Mr. Noll said.
THE question now is how much of the company's aggressive building schedule can be sustained, and how much must be scrapped to conserve cash and service the company's debt of more than $400 million.
American Skiing has already shelved its planned $30 million Grand Summit Resort Hotel at the Sugarbush resort in Vermont, because of poor advance sales, as well as a related land exchange agreement the company had painfully worked out with the United States Forest Service.
Last month, the company also backed off from a planned $300 million offering of secured notes. Instead, it placed $58 million in secured notes with high financing costs and will use the proceeds to complete projects at its two Western resorts, Steamboat in Colorado and The Canyons in Utah, in time for next season. The switch led Standard & Poor's to downgrade the company's corporate credit and debt ratings, saying it hurt the company's "financial flexibility."
Last week, the company sought to play down its bad earnings report by announcing that it had renegotiated the terms of its debt with its bank lenders. The deal will put about $20 million for capital improvements into American Skiing's coffers during the coming season. Though that is less than the $35 million the company originally planned to borrow, it "gives us more than enough flexibility for the coming year," said Mark Miller, the chief financial officer. "We don't want anyone to get the impression that the banks crimped us."
The new agreement will also allow Mr. Otten to keep pursuing his vision of ski resorts that go beyond winter sports to become luxury vacation destinations with all the trimmings. With much of the basic infrastructure in place at the company's resorts, he added, it is "not a bad thing to be taking a break from that expenditure pace."
Bullish analysts say the company's real estate ventures could have more staying power than its lift-ticket sales.
Ford Frick, an economist with BBC Consulting in Denver, said that aging baby boomers who no longer frequented the slopes were an attractive demographic group for second-home ownership, including resort condos. "The real estate industry has really grown to eclipse the skiing industry" in the West, he said, and he sees a similar trend, though not as advanced, in New England.
Kenneth Hammerle, an industry consultant in Littleton, N.H., said American Skiing should not have much trouble filling its properties. "Across North America, resort real estate is in fairly high demand, particularly in the Rocky Mountain region," Mr. Hammerle said.
Sales of time-share ownerships at American Skiing's hotels, which come with amenities like the use of ski lockers, lounges and libraries, have been brisk and highly profitable, Mr. Noll said.
Some analysts find encouragement in Mr. Otten's track record turning around resorts like his flagship property, Sunday River in Maine, and hope the company can do the same with Steamboat. The Colorado resort looked like a good bet after a 1.1-million-visit season in 1997. But skier visits have slid sharply this season, off 16 percent through January, and the resort's managing director resigned.
AMERICAN SKIING continues to put much of its energy into developing The Canyons, which it wants to transform into one of the largest ski resorts in North America in time for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. More than 1,300 acres of skiable terrain have been added; a hotel and condominiums, many of them already sold, are under construction. Mr. Frick, the economist at BBC Consulting, called it "a make it or break it project" for the company.
But beyond the fate of The Canyons, it remains unclear how America Skiing and the three other big, aggressive group owners -- Intrawest of Vancouver, British Columbia; Vail Resorts of Vail, Colo., and Booth Creek Ski Holdings of Truckee, Calif. -- can keep growing, given that the number of skiers has stayed fairly flat for more than a decade.
"What's clear is that those four companies are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to put in high-speed chair lifts and grooming, and they're all building a lot of housing," Mr. Noll said. "If they don't get some kind of growth, unless those four companies take all of the market, you're going to have some of them changing their life style."

HEADLINE: The Way We Live Now: 3-7-99 -- Salient Facts;
Disposable Outcome

BYLINE: By C.J. Hughes

 BODY:
Despite all the environmental precautions, interstate trash fights -- like the one between Virginia and New York -- are back on the front page. Here's why.
 
Now that we're recycling, shouldn't there be less of the stuff to dump?
Nationwide, about a quarter of all trash -- and much more in some cities -- is recycled, but there are fewer and fewer places to put the nonrecyclables. In 1990, the Federal Government declared that garbage dumps had to install strict environmental safeguards, and fewer than half the country's dumps were left in business.
 
Fewer dumps -- that sounds like a good thing.
It would be, except that now trash has to be hauled a lot farther. National trash companies are busily seeking out ever cheaper places to put refuse. The typical American throws out a staggering three-quarters of a ton of trash a year, and to landfill that amount in New England or New York can cost two or three times as much as it would to dump it in the Midwest, South or, cheapest of all, out near the Rockies somewhere.
 
Is that what's making Virginia so reluctant to take New York's trash?
Not the cost of dumping so much as the potential hazards of hauling it around, which get a lot more likely the farther the trash has to go. Last month, after a traffic accident, several tons of genuine New York City refuse spilled all over a Virginia highway. Waste-industry executives insist these mishaps are rare, but even so, they leave a strong impression.
 
But aren't huge smelly landfills a bigger concern than occasional spills?
From an environmental perspective, perhaps -- but not from a political perspective. Newer dumps tend to be built in remote, economically depressed areas, far from most constituents' homes. The highways and waterways that trash haulers use to reach them, on the other hand, are well traveled. In the past year, interstate trash transit has become a hot-button issue in many states, including Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
 
All this uproar must be murder on the big trash companies.
Not really. People generate junk whether politicians are yelling at each other or not, and the big companies are aggressively expanding. While Mayor Giuliani and Virginia's Governor, James Gilmore, were making a stink, one Wall Street analyst reported that Waste Management Inc., the nation's biggest trash-disposal company, was raising its dumping fees by 40 percent. The company's own projections were more prudent. Regardless, competitors are expected to follow suit. C.J. Hughes

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY;
Trolling for Scuttlebutt on the Internet

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL 

 BODY:
James Alexander is the bearer of bad news for hundreds of corporations. And now, Mr. Alexander's clients can take heart that he intends to bring them more negative tidings more quickly than ever.
Mr. Alexander, 30, and his brother, Charles Lukaszewski, 32, are co-founders and operators of Ewatch, a company that scours the Internet on behalf of corporate clients who want to know what the rest of the world is saying behind their backs. 
 "The chairman is a pedophile; the chairman is arrested; the chairman has checked into a hospital under an assumed name," Mr. Alexander said, rattling off recent examples of false rumors from the dark corners of cyberspace.
Corporations have long paid so-called clipping services to monitor their appearances in the conventional news media. But Ewatch and its competitors have taken the practice on line and a step further. This new generation of monitors goes beyond news publishers and instead trolls for rumor and innuendo in the Net's virtual back alleys -- in thousands of chat rooms and discussion forums where, Ewatch executives say, unchecked scuttlebutt can damage corporate reputations and stock prices.
These brothers grim -- Mr. Lukaszewski a programmer by training and Mr. Alexander a former television producer -- started Ewatch in 1994 from their home offices in Minneapolis and New York, respectively. With help from friends and family, they spent days searching the Internet for venom spewed against corporations, trying to convince potential clients of the need for on-line rumor detection and control.
But bad news for corporate America meant good public relations for Ewatch. After O. J. Simpson's acquittal on murder charges in October 1995, for example, a false rumor -- first reported on the tabloid television show "Hard Copy," and then spread on the Internet -- said that Mrs. Field's Cookies had underwritten a party for the jurors. The company's sales dipped, Mr. Alexander said, and Ewatch was hired to help Mrs. Fields find on-line discussion groups where the rumor had appeared, and then post corrective messages. Cookie sales soon returned to normal levels, Mr. Alexander said.
Since then, as cyberspace has grown, so have Ewatch's methods. As its client list expanded, the company scrapped manual monitoring for automated "spiders" -- search tools that scour chat groups for key-word phrases. And earlier this month, Ewatch began a more fundamental overhaul, upgrading its software and server computers to quadruple the speed at which they scan and process information. The company also replaced its home-brewed search engine with search software from Excalibur Technology, which will be coupled with a new Oracle data base management system.
"The Internet is experiencing uncontrollable growth, and we have to be prepared for it," said Mr. Alexander, who also said that the upgrade would cost $2 million.
Each day, Ewatch combs through more than 250,000 postings from the sprawling on-line discussion forum known as Usenet. It also monitors thousands of other postings from the financial chat rooms on leading Web sites, including Yahoo and Motley Fool, while also scanning discussion areas on the leading proprietary on-line services like America Online.
Besides the challenge of keeping apace of Internet growth, Ewatch has another concern: competition. Among the handful of competitors offering monitoring services are Cybercheck, a Denver company that says it can search for key words in 150,000 on-line sources, and Cyveillance, an Alexandria, Va., company that scans the bit stream for rumors, trademark infringements and E-commerce developments that might affect its corporate clients.
But Louis M. Thompson, president and chief executive of the National Investor Relations Institute, a trade group based in Vienna, Va., said that among Internet monitoring companies, Ewatch "seems to be the big one on the block."
Ewatch serves about 130 clients full time, including U S West, H. J. Heinz, Owens Corning and Northwest Airlines. It is no longer independent, having been acquired by Wavephore Inc., a publicly held data broadcasting company based in Phoenix. But it is still operated by the brothers, with Mr. Alexander overseeing marketing from New York and Mr. Lukaszewski operating the technology side from Minneapolis, where the brothers were raised.
Mr. Thompson said that corporations had come to realize that the same attributes that make the Internet a valuable commercial medium -- such as the ability to quickly and cheaply spread information to the masses -- can be a liability, too. That is especially true as the rising popularity of on-line stock trading has placed a fast-twitch premium on corporate information, often with little regard to its accuracy.
And yet, as more companies come to recognize the perils of the electronic grapevine, Ewatch and other monitoring agents are finding that their real competitors are often their would-be clients. Many companies use in-house resources to monitor the Internet, or ask their public relations firms to do the work.
Even if companies acknowledge that Ewatch may have superior surveillance capabilities, they may not always be convinced that the $13,000-a-year service is worth the cost.
Take the Itex Corporation, a small, publicly held financial record-keeping company in Portland, Ore., which has filed a lawsuit against several people whom Itex accuses of making defamatory remarks against the company in a Yahoo chat room.
The burden of trolling the Internet for corporate gossip is being borne by the company's assistant general counsel, Stephen C. Pearson. He said the small public company -- which was recently delisted from the Nasdaq stock market after the Securities and Exchange Commission said Itex had failed to submit its annual report on time -- could not afford the likes of Ewatch.
"We looked at Ewatch in particular and did a brief analysis of their systems," Mr. Pearson said. "We came to the conclusion that it was pretty expensive."
Some of Ewatch's bigger clients say the service has proved valuable, though.
"There's a loose and free exchange of information on the Internet," said Tom Pinto, spokesman for the giant pension system TIAA-CREF, which manages more than $250 billion in assets. "Anything that is inaccurate or harmful, we want to know immediately about it and respond."
One day last October, for example, a visitor to a Compuserve discussion room wrote that a TIAA-CREF pension fund called Global Equities held 25 percent of its assets in Asia. In fact, the fund held only 5 percent of its assets in the region, and it was a potentially devastating error, coming amid the Asian economic crisis. Had the rumor spread, Mr. Pinto recalled, it might have caused investors to flee the $6 billion pension fund.
The next day, an Ewatch report landed on Mr. Pinto's desk. Two days later, the TIAA-CREF manager of media relations sent E-mail to the mediator of the chat group, who posted a correction.
With hundreds of thousands of messages posted daily to tens of thousands of Internet message boards, it might seem humanly impossible to patrol even a fraction of cyberspace. But Ewatch relies on its search spiders and computers to do most of the culling, before handing off to the half-dozen people Ewatch employs to do the final winnowing before passing along the information to clients.
Sometimes, Ewatch clients are not necessarily looking for bad tidings, but simply any news or discussions that might be relevant to the company. Owens Corning, based in Toledo, Ohio, instructs Ewatch to search not just for its name, but also for the words "fiberglass," "insulation" and "asphalt," Jim Worden, an Owens Corning spokesman, said. Such searches, he said, help the company stay abreast of consumer sentiments.
Soon, Ewatch will be offered for an extra fee to subscribers of Wavephore's primary product, Newscast, which gives corporations tailored news feeds from thousands of sources like Dow Jones, Reuters and PR Newswire. And Ewatch subscribers, in turn, will be given access to Newscast Lite, a significantly slimmed-down version of Newscast.
Eventually, Mr. Alexander said he would like to create a service that would help a company analyze the combined impact of Internet rumors, media coverage and the client's own public relations efforts. Although he acknowledged that plenty of details still need to be worked out, he envisions the day when a client could type in a natural-language query like "Why are sales lagging in Minnesota?" and receive reports about marketing, media and mendacity that might help explain the problem.
And on the assumption that no news is not necessarily good news, the company plans eventually to monitor not only for gossip and innuendo, but for the absence of chatter.
"If you're a company that's spent $100 million on a launch campaign and no one's talking about you -- why is that?" Mr. Alexander said. "If there's nothing about you on line, isn't that valuable information to know?"

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY: E-Commerce Report;
Internet retailers are attracting lots of window shoppers. Now the push is on to turn those shoppers into buyers.

BYLINE: By Bob Tedeschi; Beginning today, the E-Commerce Report will appear on alternate Mondays in Business Day, and every Monday in the Technology section of The New York Times on the Web: www.nytimes.com/tech.

 BODY:
INTERNET shoppers may be at the vanguard of a retail revolution, but as with anyone on the front lines, they are a jittery bunch.
Those who shop on the Internet abandon one-half to two-thirds of the purchases they begin, industry executives and analysts say. One way that sites can measure the dropouts is through "shopping cart" technology, which, as the name suggests, allows users to gather items at a site for a one-stop checkout. The problem is that on-line shoppers often start filling a cart, but then leave the site without buying anything. 
 Tired of such almost-sales, E-commerce sites have begun looking at the problem and are feverishly devising methods to convert these browsers into buyers.
"Is there widespread concern in the industry about this?" said Arno Harris, vice president for marketing at 911gifts.com, whose site has seen 45 percent of its potential transactions abandoned before checkout. "I think there is." Of those who bail out, Mr. Harris said, 30 percent drop off at the first page of the billing process. "We're still in the early phase of E-commerce adoption, so a lot of people just get into the process and panic," he said.
Industry executives cite various reasons that customers bail out. First, some consumers are just trying out the on-line shopping experience, without intending to make a purchase. Others abandon the process when confronted with often-hefty shipping and handling charges at the end of the transaction, or with registration forms that ask for personal information, like a home address, E-mail address or phone number. Finally, a significant -- but diminishing -- number of users remain unsure about giving out their credit card information on line.
Matt Hyde, vice president of on-line sales for REI.com, an outdoor goods retailer, conjectures that many Internet users are simply playing with sites that have E-commerce capabilities, just as people try out anything new before seriously considering spending money on it. "I put stuff in the cart all the time and then leave, don't you?" Mr. Hyde said. "I did it three times on Saturday."
But Ken Cassar, an E-commerce analyst for Jupiter Communications, a New York-based research firm, said a big problem was shipping and handling costs, which many sites do not disclose until late in the buying process. "It's sticker shock," Mr. Cassar said. "A lot of people just aren't willing to pay what is essentially a 30 to 40 percent markup."
Mr. Cassar and other analysts said that security was less of an issue than it was last year, when many in the industry were predicting that such fears would slow the growth of E-commerce. To date, there have been few actual reported instances of on-line credit card fraud. And many consumers have chosen to shop on line at sites operated by established companies, perhaps further reducing security concerns.
More Internet retailers are also designing their Web sites to convey the image of a secure store, with an abundance of credit card logos and other seals of approval adorning many companies' home pages. Though some shoppers still balk at using their credit cards on line, Mr. Cassar said that many more were put off by registration forms.
William Bryant, chairman of Qpass, a company that has developed a billing system for E-commerce sites, understands consumer resistance to registering. "Imagine going to a 7-Eleven to buy a can of Coke, and having to fill out a registration form that asks you about marital status," he said.
But don't expect registration forms to disappear any time soon. Internet companies love them, because they help retailers refine their marketing efforts and aim advertisements on the site more precisely (and thus charge more to advertisers). Even so, on-line merchants are exploring ways to make registering less of a hindrance, such as systems that would let users register one time for multiple Web sites.
Excite, for example, lets users type in their credit card information once and then shop at a number of merchants within the network.
Andy Halliday, vice president for Excite's commerce division, said the system not only eliminated registration redundancies, but also gave shoppers fewer opportunities to abandon a purchase. That is particularly important, he said, because the Internet has been a medium for impulse spending. "You have to make a consumer's purchase decision as slippery a slope as possible," referring to the speed with which sites should finalize sales.
Mr. Harris, of 911Gifts.com, said that his company recently started a similar system and that he expected it to reduce the number of lost purchases at his site. "Now that people have pretty much figured out the economics of getting customers to their sites, the focus is on conversion," he said, noting that E-commerce sites typically convert less than 2 percent of their visitors into customers. "This is a really critical way merchants can improve economics without spending a lot more money," he said.
Perhaps the most aggressive approach to the problem is represented by Cybershop, an on-line department store that actually pursues shoppers who abandon large purchases. Jeffrey Tauber, Cybershop's chief executive, says that even when a shopper fills and flees, the company can still "capture a pretty good level of information" about who the consumer was. "And if it's a nice-size order, we'll call or E-mail them and try to close the sale," Mr. Tauber said.
About 15 percent of the customers the company pursues ultimately complete the sale, Mr. Tauber said.
No doubt the best antidote for shopping jitters is, simply, more practice. Industry executives and analysts predict that if the Internet's flagship merchants continue to provide positive shopping experiences, fewer customers will hesitate about making a purchase.
In other words, if the industry is going to get past its abandonment issues, companies will have to allay customers' concerns. The E-merchants, meanwhile, will also have to stock up on the one commodity rarely found in cyberspace: patience.

HEADLINE: AT&T's Embrace of New Technology Signals Next Era

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
Amid last week's typically hectic flow of headlines about the communications industry, perhaps the most significant news of all got lost: Frank Ianna, president of the AT&T Corporation's network unit, announced that by the end of this year, the long-distance giant wanted to stop buying traditional telephone switches for the core of its network.
Granted, Mr. Ianna's pronouncement last Tuesday was not the lapel-grabbing kind of news generated by a multibillion-dollar takeover or the latest hot Internet stock. But it was a seminal moment for the communications industry and in some ways for everyone who uses a phone. 
 As it halts decades of investing in the traditional gear that makes up most of the global phone system, AT&T is retooling its network around a new generation of technologies inspired partly by the Internet.
Sprint and MCI Worldcom, the other long-distance giants, are doing much the same thing. But as the biggest communications company in the United States, AT&T wields a proportionately larger influence in the market and with technology suppliers. So Tuesday's announcement was perhaps the definitive sign that at least in the long-distance business, the aging and increasingly crowded phone network would be rejuvenated with younger, more efficient technologies.
For consumers, this evolution could lead to lower prices. And in the future, as the new technologies expand from the core of the network to homes and businesses, consumers could also benefit from new sorts of features and services.
"As the functionality moves closer and closer to the customer, the bottom line for the consumer is that clearly we will drive the economics down," said Neil J. Grenfell, an engineering vice president at Sprint. "This can also help give the customer more and more control and more and more integration."
This might mean, for instance, that a tourist or business traveler who wanted to stay in touch could simply unplug the handset from the home or office telephone and plug it into the base of any other telephone. The network would recognize that the person had moved around the block or across the country, and calls to the original number would ring in the new location.
Services like that are many years away and would require the local phone companies to invest billions of dollars on top of the current spending by long-distance carriers. And, of course, it would require consumers to buy "intelligent" phones.
The reason the new advanced networks being planned by AT&T and others are new and advanced is that they change the way networks behave at their most basic level.
Since the invention of the telephone, almost every civilian communications network has been based on the concept of circuits. If a network is a multilane highway, then a system based on circuits, known as a circuit-switched network, paints the lane lines of that highway solid: each conversation has its own lane, or circuit. If two people are on the phone with each other and neither of them is speaking, they still use the entire circuit just as if they are screaming. The standard voice circuit sends and receives 64,000 bits of information a second.
The main advantages of circuit switching are that it is reliable and relatively simple to carry out. The main disadvantage is that it is extremely inefficient to keep an entire lane open for every phone call, regardless of how much data -- in this case, conversation -- it is carrying.
The alternative that is being embraced by AT&T and the others is a sort of mass-transit alternative called packet switching. On a packet highway, the lane lines are dashed. Rather than consuming at entire lane, each conversation gets broken up into millions of small pieces, or packets, that are then mixed up with other conversations only to be reassembled into intelligible communications at the other end.
The main advantage of packet switching, the technology used by the Internet to move massive amounts of data around the globe, is that it is extremely efficient. A conversation that takes up 64,000 bits a second on a circuit-switched network might take up only a quarter of that, or 16,000 bits a second, on a packet-switched system. That can allow carriers to lower their costs and, potentially, the prices they charge consumers.
The problem is that sorting out all those packets and routing them to the right place requires ingenuity, especially when the packets are carrying conversations. A few extra seconds when loading a Web page may not mean much, but consumers expect their phone calls to be perfect representations of what they are saying -- with no delays or distortion.
The means for making packet-based systems robust enough to carry millions of phone calls has just emerged over the last year or so from companies including Ascend Communications, which has agreed to be acquired by Lucent Technologies, Cisco Systems and others.
Packet-based, however, does not necessarily mean the Internet version, known as Internet protocol, or I.P. The main technology that AT&T and many other long-distance carriers are looking toward is called asynchronous transfer mode, or A.T.M.
In the jargon of the communications industr, A.T.M. uses "cells" rather than packets. That is because while the data packets generated by Internet protocol vary in length, the data cells in an A.T.M. system are always the same size, generally 53 bytes. That uniformity can be a powerful advantage because it allows A.T.M. to carry comingled voice, video and data traffic without sacrificing much efficiency.
Also, while Internet protocol often ships each packet of information to its destination by a different path, A.T.M. sets up so-called virtual circuits, which help insure that a transmission of Hamlet's soliloquy begins with "To be" instead of "Be to" or "Eb ot."
Sprint is basing its network of the future largely on A.T.M. switches made by NEC of Japan, though Sprint is also working closely with Cisco. AT&T is using Ascend's A.T.M. equipment. MCI Worldcom has asked vendors to submit proposals for A.T.M. switches but has not yet made a decision.
One of the raging debates in the communications industry is whether A.T.M. is necessary at all or whether Internet protocol is reliable enough to form the underlying network language instead. For now, most of the big carriers are wary of I.P., partly because not all of the work has yet been done to add advanced features like Caller ID and call-waiting to Internet-based systems.
"Think about the software you need to do call-waiting in the circuit world," Mr. Ianna said. "Think about the software and the intelligence you need to replicate that in the I.P. world. It's non-trivial. There is a lot of router work that needs to be done, and it's not there yet."
The last time AT&T revamped its network so thoroughly was about 10 years ago when it upgraded its long-distance network from copper wires to optical fiber. About 20 years ago, the company upgraded its circuit switches from analog to digital.
"This is the next-generation architecture," Mr. Ianna said. "If analog was the first generation and digital switching was the second and digital transmission was the third, this is the fourth. It is significant."

HEADLINE: Musicians Want a Revolution Waged on the Internet

BYLINE: By JON PARELES 

 BODY:
Visionaries, hopefuls, hucksters and self-described geeks mingled over the weekend at the first New York Music and Internet Expo, a convention held at the New Yorker Hotel. While Web pages flickered on monitors and cellular phones beeped, musicians and computer entrepreneurs swapped business cards and ideas about how the Internet could revolutionize the music business.
Optimists, in the majority, saw it as a force that would inevitably democratize the market, a way to bypass recording companies and radio stations and offer music directly to listeners. "The Internet has made it possible for people to get consistently what they want, their way, without censorship," said Steve Zuckerman, a former music journalist who organized the event and plans to produce another one in Los Angeles on Aug. 7 and 8. "Artists, for a change, have hope. The people here all want something similar: creative control of their products and their companies." 
 Chuck D, the rapper who leads Public Enemy, gave a keynote speech and predicted that there would be "a million artists out there and 500,000 labels or more." He added, "Major labels will not be obsolete, but they're going to have to learn how to share."
It was a convention aimed at the grass roots. The Internet expo cost $15 a day to attend and $700 for exhibitors, considerably less than more established and expensive events like the CMJ Music Marathon. Mr. Zuckerman estimated that 2,000 people would come to the two-day event. Speakers included musicians, software and equipment makers and Web site operators. Absent were representatives of most major labels or their trade group, the Recording Industry Association of America, which is playing catch-up with the Internet. It is working to set a standard for digital distribution of music that will prevent unauthorized copying. The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, which presents the Grammy Awards, had a booth to promote its programs for emerging musicians.
Michael Robertson, the chief executive of the Internet site and company MP3.com, said: "We think the music industry is broken, no matter how you look at it. We need to change the whole business of music."
Mr. Robertson's company, and many other Internet sites, offers music in the form of MP3 files, which can be sent quickly over the Internet and copied at will. Because delivery via the Internet eliminates the need to package, manufacture and distribute a CD, it allows musicians to send their latest work out immediately. "An artist can have a creative urge at 2:30 A.M., upload it at 3:30 and have it on the Web at 4:30," Mr. Robertson said.
Established stars have begun giving away music on the Internet to promote themselves. Last Monday, Tom Petty made a new song available free on the MP3.com site; during the three days it was available, it was downloaded 157,699 times. In return, Mr. Petty and his recording company have a marketing tool: E-mail addresses for fans, who can be reached when his next album is released. Alanis Morissette made a new song available through AT&T's a2b Music (www.a2bmusic.com), which does not allow copying; the free song was downloaded 285,000 times, while links to the song sold 22,000 tickets to her concert tour.
Last year Public Enemy made songs available as MP3 files, but was stopped by the threat of legal action from its label at the time, Polygram, which owns the master recordings. Now, Public Enemy's contract with Polygram has expired, and it has a new MP3 song, "Swindler's Lust," on its Web site, www.public-enemy.com. Chuck D said that in future contracts, Public Enemy would keep its rights to master recordings and enter joint ventures with companies to release the material on disks and tapes. "I'm an Internet presence first, and everything else follows from that," he said. Public Enemy's next album would be available in digital form on the Internet before appearing as a CD, he added.
Mr. Robertson said that distributing music through the Internet could restructure the recording business. In a typical recording contract a label finances and promotes an album, and the performer receives a 10 to 15 percent royalty after costs are recouped -- $1 to $2 for each album sold -- while the label owns the master recording. Musicians who finance their own recordings and distribute them through the Internet could receive more for an album, making a profit without blockbuster sales.
"The record deal up to now has just been the engine that drives the tour bus," said Ken Hertz, a partner in the law firm Hansen, Jacobson, Teller & Hoberman who represents Ms. Morissette, Hole and others.
A few skeptics warned that the unchecked distribution of music on the Internet could rob musicians of income from recordings. "Today everyone's happy and everything's beautiful and everything's free," said Francois-Xavier Nuttall, whose company, Audiosoft, makes software to track copyright and royalty information. "But in the future we will need an economic model."
Other panelists noted that the sound quality of music transmitted over the Internet was inferior to CD's. "It's a lot easier for people to make records now," said Joe Alexander, a producer. "I might be able to do it on a wristwatch in a taxicab. But it's not the same as going in and taking the time to make the sound you've worked a lifetime to develop. Don't let this technology lower the standards." Other speakers insisted that appearing in cyberspace was no substitute for hitting the road, and that most of the free music on the Internet was not worth hearing.
"A lot of people envision this friction-free future, where everybody has access to everything immediately," Mr. Hertz said. "But if you have to spend your whole day figuring out what's good, you're not going to have time to listen to it." He predicted that filtering -- sites and formats that winnow the choices, as recording companies and radio stations do now -- would be a profitable Internet service, paid for through advertising or subscription fees.
For musicians, meanwhile, the promise of the Internet was simpler. "We just want our music out there," said Ricky Byrd, a songwriter.

HEADLINE: Microchips In Microcosm;
Failed Partnership Is a Lens For Viewing U.S.-Intel Suit

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7

 BODY:
At the heart of the Government's antitrust case against the Intel Corporation that goes on trial Tuesday is a meeting nearly five and a half years ago at the annual Comdex computer industry convention in Las Vegas, Nev. There, in November 1993, the chairman of Intel cut a fateful deal with his counterpart at a small but leading maker of highly specialized computer work stations, the Intergraph Corporation.
During the half-hour meeting, according to interviews and court papers, Andrew Grove, Intel's top executive, persuaded James Meadlock, Intergraph's chairman and chief executive, to use Intel as the sole supplier of chips for Intergraph's work stations -- high-performance computers aimed at engineers, architects and others requiring powerful graphics, design and animation capabilities. 
 For Intergraph, casting its lot with Intel would mean abandoning its own chip technology and scrapping plans to use Sun Microsystems as an alternate chip supplier. But it would also mean turning to the world's most advanced developer of computer chips, and at the time, a company that had been committed to making products that could be used interchangeably with those made by others.
For the first few years, the relationship flourished. Intergraph work stations were even featured in Intel's annual reports and in product rollout events like the debut of the Pentium Pro chip, as Intel's efforts to produce ever more powerful chips for customers like Intergraph burnished the chip maker's reputation for being on the cutting edge of technology. But by 1997 the ties between the companies had become frayed, amid bitter charges and countercharges of patent infringement, fraud and misappropriation of trade secrets.
Intergraph executives say that Intel's decision to withhold technological data in a market that changes as quickly as the computer industry has been a serious corporate setback. In the wake of the falling-out, as Intel racked up ever-higher revenues and profits and saw its share price continue its seemingly inexorable climb, Intergraph has labored under mounting losses. And Intergraph's share price now languishes in the $5 range -- about half its level when Mr. Meadlock made his Comdex pact with Mr. Grove.
For all of the Federal Trade Commission's charges that Intel had "sought to extort" technology from its customers "in order to preserve its monopoly," none are more revealing of the strengths and weaknesses of the Government's case than the accusations by Intergraph. And Mr. Meadlock and Mr. Grove, both pioneers in their respective fields, expect to feature prominently in the trial.
In fact, the Government plans to call Mr. Meadlock as its first witness this week. And Mr. Meadlock will be followed to the witness stand by Wade Patterson, the president of the company's hardware division.
The trial, expected to last up to two months, will be heard by an administrative law judge whose decision, either way, is all but certain to be appealed to the next level -- the four members of the Federal Trade Commission. The agency's lawyers have asked for an order that would bar Intel from withholding technical information from customers with which it has disputes.
Mr. Meadlock and Mr. Grove, both respected pioneers in their fields, expect to feature prominently in the trial. Mr. Meadlock would seem to present a sympathetic figure, an engineer's engineer who was a recipient of the Congressional High Technology Award in 1985, following his work in the 1960's as a top software developer for the Apollo space program and for military systems.
But then, Mr. Grove, whatever his reputation for tough bargaining, hardly comes across as a plundering monopolist. A native of Hungary who as a boy during World War II was forced to hide from the Nazis and later fled Soviet domination of his country by emigrating to the United States in the 1950's, is the embodiment of the American success story. Starting with odd jobs that included busboy in a Catskills resort, he rose to become the senior executive of the world's largest chip maker and one of the most profitable companies in history.
And so aware is he of the responsibilities and potential pitfalls of Intel's industry dominance that Mr. Grove requires employees to receive training in antitrust law. Yet, by all accounts, his management style is embodied by the title of his 1996 book, an aggressive executive's guide to consumer trends, rival technology and regulatory threats and opportunities: "Only the Paranoid Survive."
Intel declined to make Mr. Grove available for an interview, saying that he cannot comment while the company is in litigation.
The Government, besides presenting the Intergraph accusations, has also cited Intel's decision to cut off technology to two other companies -- Compaq Computer and Digital Equipment -- as evidence that the chip maker coerced its major customers into surrendering technology so that Intel could maintain its market dominance. But neither of those companies, which are much bigger than Intergraph and merged last year, has suffered as badly as Intergraph, according to Government officials and Intergraph executives.
Federal District Judge Edwin L. Nelson concluded last year, in a separate, continuing suit in which he ordered Intel to resume supplying Intergraph with crucial technology and sample chips while the litigation proceeds, that Intel "violated its affirmative duties as a monopolist not to misuse its monopoly power and to compete in a manner that does not unreasonably or unfairly harm competition."
That opinion, which also ordered Intel to resume supplying technical information to Intergraph, is now on appeal. Intel's lawyers have maintained that its decisions to sharply reduce customer access to technology were lawful and proper. And they contend that even the Government's own expert economist has been unable to find any evidence that Intel's actions harmed either innovation or competition -- a central criteria of Federal antitrust law, they say.
"Intel's actions were nothing more than a response to the assertion of infringement claims against it," the company said in its trial brief in the F.T.C. case. "Intel's withholding of the right to use its intellectual property from companies that had done the same to Intel was an appropriate and perfectly normal response to the actions of Digital, Intergraph, and Compaq."
Mr. Meadlock, in a recent interview, as well as court papers in the F.T.C. case and one of the related lawsuits between the two companies, has said that Mr. Grove assured him at the 1993 Comdex meeting that Intergraph did not need to worry about using Intel as its sole supplier of chips because "Intel would treat Intergraph fairly."
"The meeting was basically an effort to sell Intergraph on designing with Intel," Mr. Meadlock said. He said Mr. Grove "had told me that the openness of the architecture had helped Intel to dominate the industry and that they had no intention of changing that strategy." Chips designed with an open architecture are interchangeable with those made by rivals, while those of closed architecture are not.
As a result of that assurance, Mr. Meadlock said, Intergraph decided to forgo further development of its own high-end chip, called Clipper, and to abandon plans to use Sun Microsystems as a supplier along with Intel. It also spent months redesigning its work stations to make them compatible with Intel products.
But the relationship between Intergraph and Intel started fraying in late 1996, amid growing complaints from Intergraph that some computer makers that were rivals of Intergraph were infringing on Clipper chip patents by using Intel chips. Intel contended that the Pentium chips had relied on some of the same memory technology in the Clipper chips. When Intergraph threatened to enforce those patents, the companies turned to Intel and asked to be indemnified.
Mr. Meadlock said that since Intergraph recognized it was "locked in" to Intel products, his company did not initially confront Intel about the patent issues, but instead tried to obtain royalties from the computer makers.
"We knew it was a sensitive issue," he said.
But after the Intergraph rivals turned to Intel for help, Intel responded by seeking a cross-licensing arrangement that would enable the two partners to each have access to certain patent rights held by the other.
Those negotiations went nowhere, and in 1997 Intel began responding to Intergraph's requests by withholding technical specifications and samples of new chips that were crucial for Intergraph to design updated versions of its work stations.
Making things even more difficult for Intergraph was the fact that its work stations were now based on Intel products that were no longer interchangeable with other companies' chips. That placed significant obstacles to Intergraph's turning to an alternate supplier. In the years after the 1993 Comdex meeting, in which Mr. Meadlock recalls receiving Mr. Grove's assurances about Intel's open architecture, Intel began executing plans to move away from an open design in its newer chips to develop its own graphics functions.
"They wanted to control more and more of the electronics," Mr. Meadlock said. "They want the Compaqs and Dells of the world to be nothing more than their marketing arms."
Unable to reach a settlement with Intergraph, Intel retaliated by withholding vital technical information and support, limiting Intergraph's supply of chip samples, and according to Judge Nelson, blacklisting Intergraph in the digital media market by offering Intergraph customers financing and other support on the condition that those customers not deal with Intergraph.
"What they've done to us is totally unethical and illegal," Mr. Meadlock said, "and I don't think people realize it yet."
Intel executives are expected to dispute the blacklisting charges and say there was nothing wrong with withholding chip technology from Intergraph, Compaq and Digital. The company's lawyers point out that even Mr. Meadlock has conceded that Mr. Grove never suggested that Intel would be Intergraph's "perpetual supplier of chips."
It all comes down, Intel executives say, to the countervailing rights of business partners.
"At the end of the day, the facts in the three instances are similar," said Peter N. Detkin, an assistant general counsel at Intel who is overseeing its defense in the F.T.C. proceeding, said of the Intergraph, Compaq and Digital disputes. "A customer of Intel asserted an intellectual property claim, claimed that it was entitled to a larger part of Intel's profits and decided to withhold patents from Intel. In response, we said we have intellectual property rights of our own and asserted them."

HEADLINE: Coast Guard Halts Search Off Florida for Lost Haitians

BYLINE: By RICK BRAGG 

DATELINE: MIAMI, March 7

 BODY:
The three Haitian men whom rescuers found in cold, rough seas are apparently the only survivors of two boats that sank this weekend off the South Florida coast, leaving as many as 40 dead in what may be the worst smuggling disaster in this state's history.
The Coast Guard, which had found only the three survivors and four bodies in its sweep of the open ocean from Cape Canaveral to Palm Beach, called off its search today as hope faded of finding anyone still alive. 
 "Forty are presumed dead," said Art Bullock, a United States Border Patrol officer in West Palm Beach.
The two boats, with most of their human cargo, just vanished about 30 miles east of Palm Beach.
"We have found no debris, no vessels," said Petty Officer Jeff Hall, of the Coast Guard in Miami. Even if survivors had something to cling to, it was unlikely they could have survived, Petty Officer Hall said.
"The water temperature was 70 to 72 degrees," he said. "We factored in the water temperature to gauge their chances of survival."
Rescuers said that the northern push of the GulfStream would have carried any survivors further north into even colder water.
In a state that has seen bodies and makeshift rafts wash up on its beaches for as long as most people here can remember, this sea disaster is almost certainly the most costly in lives in the seemingly never-ending crossings from Haiti and Cuba, rescuers said.
"It's the biggest disappearance of a boatload of refugees that I've heard of" in Florida waters, Petty Officer Hall said.
The Haitians, trying to escape the latest rounds of violence and persecution and endless poverty, were apparently making their crossing withthe help of a smuggling ring, law-enforcement officials said after speaking with the three survivors.
The two vessels, a 17-foot boat and a 20-foot boat, were believed to have cast off from the western end of Grand Bahama and headed straight for Palm Beach, a usual smuggling route, Petty Officer Hall said.
Usually, such boats carry about nine people at most, Petty Officer Hall said, adding that these boats had at least twice that number.
On Saturday, just after midnight, one of the boats began to sink, and the second boat came alongside to help. But as the terrified passengers crossed to the second boat, it too began to sink, one of the survivors told rescuers. At about 2 A.M. on Saturday, about 30 miles off Palm Beach, crewmen aboard the passing freighter Tomas Faith heard screams in the water, and radioed the Coast Guard. The sinking might otherwise have gone unreported. As it turned out, only a few people, dead or alive, were foundon the surface as dawn broke.
A helicopter found the first survivor, weakly trying to stay afloat as he grasped a propane tank, at about 5 A.M., and two others were found clinging to a barrel at about 8 A.M. All three survivors, one man in his late 30's, one in his early 40's and another in his 20's, were treated for hypothermia and questioned by the Border Patrol. Although rescuers used helicopters, planes and seagoing boats to search an area of 2,600 square miles, they found only four bodies. They found no life jackets, either on the survivors, on the bodies, or floating on the water.
"In the Bahamas, smugglers tell them it's easy to get here," said Samedi Florvil, who works with the Haitian Refugee Center in Miami.
But then, Haitians here in Miami said, those who can afford the costs -- some pay hundreds of dollars, or more, a small fortune in that poor country -- are loaded onto unsafe boats, and risk their lives in crossings in the dead of night.
Refugee smuggling is becoming more and more frequent in both Haiti and Cuba, immigration officials said.
The sinking of the two vessels on Saturday follows a December incident, in which a 30-foot boat carrying 26 people sank in high seas just off Elliott Key, about 20 miles south of Miami. Investigators believe that 13 Cubans perished, although only 9 bodies were recovered, and the rest were believed lost at sea. Two of the nine survivors were charged with smuggling.
As conditions in Haiti and Cuba worsen, the number of rafters and smuggled people is expected to rise. In 1998, the Coast Guard intercepted 1,025 Cubans and 1,206 Haitians as they tried to enter the country, Petty Officer Hall said.
In 1997, 406 Cubans and 587 Haitians were intercepted. So far this year, 112 Cubans and 258 Haitians have been intercepted at sea, Petty Officer Hall said.
In Miami's Little Haiti, where many of the Haitian refugees have settled after fleeing a history of dictators and chaos, the news of the disaster saddened many people but surprised no one.
"These people are hurting, day after day after day," Gerard Joseph, a radio commentator, said of deteriorating economic and political conditions in Haiti.
The three survivors will eventually be taken to Krome Detention Center in Miami and could be deported back to Haiti.

HEADLINE: CABLE RATES RISING AS INDUSTRY NEARS END OF REGULATION

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7

 BODY:
Cable television, one of the last industries to have its prices controlled by the Government, is about to become almost completely deregulated.
But while the prospect of competition was supposed to drive prices down, the opposite has happened. Cable rates continue to rise, with many companies announcing increases for this year averaging 5 percent, more than twice the projected inflation rate. 
 The nation's 65 million cable subscribers have already seen rates climb about 22 percent -- more than four times the rate of inflation -- since the passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which set the end of this month as the deadline for removing nearly all Government price controls. The limits were imposed by Congress in 1992, over President George Bush's veto. It was his only veto to be overridden, following enormous public complaints about price gouging and poor service.
The 1996 repeal set a three-year waiting period on the assumption that by now the cable industry would be facing far more competition for home viewers from satellite broadcasters and telephone companies, according to many experts, regulators and lawmakers. But since that has not happened, the deregulation on March 31 has raised deep concerns, even among Republicans philosophically opposed to regulation. The fear is that cable companies unshackled from price controls and not threatened by competition will continue to impose rate increases that far outpace inflation.
"We may now be facing the worst of all worlds, which is an unregulated monopoly," said John McCain, the Arizona Republican who heads the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.
Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican who is chairman of the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications, Trade and Consumer Protection, said, "It's a date that's arising somewhat prematurely in terms of competitive opportunities for consumers, and that's troublesome for a lot of folks, me included."
But cable operators and their Washington lobbyists say the higher prices, which now average $30 monthly nationwide, have helped pay for better programming, more channels and expanded services. They also note their progress in making upgrades that will permit digital signals and significantly faster Internet service.
"It's a fact of life that programs are just getting a lot more expensive," said Joe Waz, a vice president at the Comcast Corporation, which has 4.4 million customers in 20 states, including Pennsylvania, New Jersey, California and Florida. Comcast expects to raise its rates this year by 5 to 6 percent. "We've invested very aggressively in systems upgrades," Mr. Waz said.
The Cablevision Systems Corporation, which provides service to 2.7 million households in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, has announced price increases for 1999 averaging about 5 percent. Charles Schueler, a vice president, said the company was spending more than $1 billion to upgrade the system to offer new telephone, digital and Internet services.
"Cable rates were set last fall based on our costs to provide cable service as well as market conditions," Mr. Schueler said. He also said Cablevision had begun to feel strong competition from satellite broadcasters and others.
Consumer groups have disputed industry claims that there is significant competition, and that price increases, which have varied in different regions, are justified by better programming and more channels.
"The Government data proves their argument false on the face of it," said Gene Kimmelman, a co-director of the Washington office of Consumers Union. "In those few areas where there has been competition, cable companies charge 10 to 15 percent less than where there's a monopoly to provide the exact same quality programming. And Government data show cable rates going up twice as fast as programming cost increases."
Some critics have complained that the price increases are being used to pay for new channels and programs that few consumers want and for advanced services that remain many years away.
For the cable companies, licensing fees and programming expenses each rose about 20 percent last year, according to a recent Government study. The industry also spent an estimated $4 billion on upgrades and improved technology.
Fearful of a possible political backlash if prices rise too much this year, Decker Anstrom, the cable industry's top lobbyist in Washington, has spent the last few months imploring companies not to take advantage of the new regulatory climate by spiking rates.
"I talk every day to companies in the industry to remind them that policy makers are and have been sensitive to cable prices," said Mr. Anstrom, the president of the National Cable Television Association. "If there's one message I hear from every member of Congress, it's that the industry has to be very careful about pricing and services."
He said the marketplace was highly competitive and was becoming more so every day, noting that the percentage of television viewers who subscribe to cable was steadily declining. Government figures show that 85 percent of all households with television now subscribe to cable, down from 87 percent a year earlier.
After March 31, the Government will continue to regulate prices for only basic cable service, consisting primarily of stations that broadcast over the air. More than 90 percent of cable subscribers receive expanded service, and often premium channels as well, Mr. Anstrom said.
A bipartisan consensus has developed in Washington over the last few years that the most effective way to keep cable rates down is not through regulation but by encouraging competition from alternatives like satellites and wireless cable, which uses radio frequencies to deliver video signals. While those technologies have begun to make inroads in the marketplace, lawmakers and regulators say they have been unable to truly compete because they cannot offer the same services as cable companies.
Satellite broadcasters, for instance, are restricted from offering local news and many other programs found on local stations and on the networks.
While legislation has been introduced in Congress to change those rules, Senator McCain, one of the main sponsors of the legislation, said in a recent interview that he was not optimistic about its chances.
Conventional broadcasters oppose removing the restrictions on the satellite companies, fearing that this will drain advertising revenues from local stations.
Court decisions have also discouraged competition. A Federal judge in Florida, for instance, recently ordered DirecTV Inc., the nation's largest satellite television company, to shut off CBS and Fox programming to 300,000 customers. The judge ruled that DirecTV was violating the law that allows the satellite systems to provide network programming only to viewers who cannot receive a local network affiliate using a conventional antenna.
Regulators and Administration officials said they believed the cable industry would now have the discipline to hold rates down.
"The industry has said that it will exercise restraint, and we're willing to accept their view on this," said Larry Irving, Assistant Commerce Secretary for communications and information.
William E. Kennard, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said that while cable companies "have had a history of taking increases whenever they can, they are also mindful of the political ramifications of increases that will raise the ire of Congress, which will be watching the issue."
Still, as the companies continue to pour billions of dollars into upgrading their systems, some analysts say temptation will be great for a deregulated cable industry to turn to rates as a vehicle to raise money.
"There will be enormous internal pressure," said Scott Cleland, an analyst with the Legg Mason Precursor Group. "The industry carries a lot of debt. They are trying to upgrade for digital TV and interactive services, and it's expensive. Will cable be restrained? They haven't been in the past. For some of them, it will take a personality transplant."

HEADLINE: A CONVERSATION WITH: GEORGE E. BROWN JR.;
The Congressman Who Loved Science

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA DREIFUS 

 BODY:
Representative George E. Brown Jr. of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Science and the former chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, is the dean of the Congressional science buffs.
Mr. Brown, 79, has been a crucial supporter of manned and unmanned space exploration. He was an author of legislation creating the Environmental Protection Agency, a prime mover behind efforts to include ozone layer protections in the Clean Air Act and an advocate of restructuring the national weapons laboratories to meet the needs of a peacetime economy. 
 "From my earliest days, I was fascinated by science," Mr. Brown said on a recent afternoon in his offices on Capitol Hill, his wife, Marta, at his side. "Also by my earliest days, I was fascinated by a utopian vision of what the world could be like. I've thought that science could be the basis for a better world, and that's what I've been trying to do all these years."
Q. How skilled are scientists and researchers at presenting their case to Congress?
A. Very unskilled. They, generally speaking, have too great a faith in the power of common sense and reason. That's not what drives most political figures, who are concerned about emotions and the way a certain event will affect their constituency. If you're going to work in a political environment, you have to know the reasoning of the people you're dealing with. You have to talk to them realistically. It does very little good to appeal to high principle, although I would not say that's insignificant. The vast majority of politicians think they are functioning on high principle.
Q. Some months ago, we interviewed Dr. Leon Lederman, the former head of the Fermi National Laboratory. It was his view that it may have been a mistake over the years for the scientists to ask for funding as a part of the cold war. Do you agree with him?
A. Well, I wouldn't describe it as a complete mistake. But to build the funding of science for the next generation on the basis of the cold war was not well advised. That implied that science wasn't important enough to survive without a cold war. The truth is that science -- research and development -- is probably the most important factor in the progress of the human race over the last several thousand years. To base support of science on something that ephemeral as temporary alliances and enemies is ridiculous!
Q. What's your take on the Czech President and playwright Vaclav Havel's famous statement that the fall of Communism has meant "the end" of science?
A. Well, like many people, I've tried to understand Mr. Havel as much as I could. I think his feeling was that science was the ultimate expression of a neo-modernist philosophy and that it is inherently bad because it fails to consider human emotions and needs. It was probably his hope that once the cold war was over and the need to have overwhelming military strength had dissipated, that people would revert to a more benign and caring and nonrational way of interacting.
Havel was influenced by the fact that the Communist system considered itself to be the ultimate in "scientific rationalism." Communism was touted from the beginning as a "scientific" way of looking at the problems of society. It wasn't. It probably never could be. It represented an effort to control society with a philosophy that was antithetical to freedom and democracy.
Q. You're a strong advocate of international cooperation in science and yet, you are very critical of our State Department. Why?
A. Because the State Department gives lip service to the importance of international cooperation in science. And lip service is about all they give. They are reducing the number of scientific attaches at overseas missions, and scientists in policy-making positions in the State Department here in Washington.
My problem with the State Department is that they spend most of their time in this area in long, drawn-out international negotiations. They negotiate a new science and technology cooperation treaty. You can almost count on their doing that periodically with each country we have good relations with. Basically, it's a photo opportunity for the presidents of the two countries. Then, believe it or not, the administration doesn't request any money to carry out the provisions of the agreement. This isn't unique to the current Administration; they all do it.
Q. The microbiologist Rita Colwell, an expert on cholera, was named last year to be the nation's top scientist, to head the National Science Foundation. Does her appointment represent a sea change in the N.S.F.'s direction?
A. Her appointment could portend a new direction in the support of science in the United States. Her career and her achievements reflect the direction science funding is going into in the future. In other words, jobs, industrial opportunities are going to stem more from the biological sciences than from chemistry and physics. I see biology as being the greatest area of scientific breakthroughs in the next generation. So, I'll probably be supporting her in any changes she wants to make in the direction of the N.S.F.'s funding.
Q. Are you a scientist?
A. I'm not. I'm a politician. I started out with a background in science. I do have a degree in physics and did a short stint as an engineer. I was interested in science before I even knew what science was. I used to read science-fiction magazines when I was a kid, stories about space travel, and that led me -- structuring my college training in math, physics, chemistry, astronomy -- a little bit. I've been on the Science Committee in the House since 1965.
Q. When you are putting together science policy, how much do you rely on staff?
A. How do you quantify that? I rely very, very heavily on the staff of the House Science Committee. That's because we have some the best people with the best scientific backgrounds available anywhere in the country. These people are good enough to know how to express my views, even when they don't agree with them. That's always very helpful.
Q. Former Senator John Glenn was able to parlay his support for science into a second ride in space. Have you considered doing the same?
A. (Laughs) I've indicated to NASA Administrator Dan Goldin that if he thinks I'm physically qualified, I'd still like to go into space. In any event, politicians have been known to use their influence to get things that they want.
Q. When you give speeches, you say that you expect to watch the progress of the space program from your perch in heaven some day. What exactly do you mean?
A. That I think we're soon going to have the exploration of the heavens by humans, starting with Mars and the rest of the solar system. I think maybe Dan Goldin and a few other people have this sense that human settlement of the universe is, beginning with what's nearest to us, an inevitable progression of human beings.
Q. Where do you vote on the "is there other life out there" question?
A. I consider the probability that there is other intelligent life in the universe overwhelming. And we will ultimately find it. It may not be exactly what we think it ought to be, but it will be intelligent life. It may be far more intelligent than we are. And that will be an interesting situation. How do we deal with a situation where we are encountering someone with vastly superior intellectual powers to ourselves? Now, I'm not fearful of that. Because highly evolved life will not be looking at new life forms as enemies. They will be looking on them as their children who need to be encouraged to develop even further.
Q. Do you see a beneficent kind of "Star Trek" scenario for our space future?
A. I think it will be beneficent, and I like "Star Trek." The people who write "Star Trek" are going through all these same scenarios as you are. They are asking, "What is a reasonable rational future for the human race?" And then they try to project that into a television program.
Q. I don't mean this disrespectfully, but as a senior member of the House, do you ever think about retirement?
A. I have no desire or ambition to enter another career just to earn more money or something like that. So my criteria for retirement will be determined by my sense whether or not I'm adequately fulfilling the responsibilities I have.
Some of my colleagues, years before they retired, weren't accomplishing anything. I don't want to do that. What I've always wanted to do is help shape ideas about the emerging human culture, the kind of thing that Newt Gingrich sometimes did. I think I can make a small contribution to that, maybe not as much as Newt. But I think I'm more on the right track. We'll see. As to my decision as to whether I decide to retire or not, that may be conditioned on how you write this story.

In balloting that often prefigures the Academy Awards, the Directors Guild of America gave its top prize this year to Steven Spielberg for "Saving Private Ryan," and the Screen Actors Guild bestowed its leading acting awards on Roberto Benigni for "Life Is Beautiful" and Gwyneth Paltrow for "Shakespeare in Love." The latter film also won an award for cast performance. Robert Duvall of "A Civil Action" and Kathy Bates of "Primary Colors" were named best supporting actors. 

Another Country
 
The Austrian actor and director Klaus Maria Brandauer, known for his performances in films like "Mephisto," "Out of Africa, " "Never Say Never Again" and "Colonel Redl," makes his English-speaking theater debut tonight at the Almeida Theater in London as the director of the British premiere of Esther Vilar's "Speer." Mr. Brandauer will also star in the drama as Albert Speer, Hitler's architect and a planner of the Nazi war economy.
 
Ageless Glories
 
Taken from their customary settings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art and its branch at the Cloisters, nearly 300 examples of medieval art acquired during the last two decades will be assembled beginning today in the special exhibition galleries of the museum in "Mirror of the Medieval World." Continuing through July 4, this show spans the centuries from the 4th to the 16th in a thematic presentation that embraces plant, animal and equestrian imagery; depictions of the human figure; ecclesiastical furnishings; objects of private devotion; jewelry; vessels, and works related to romance, vanity and games. Highlights include boldly illuminated Spanish Romanesque manuscript pages, a serenely smiling Gothic stone head, panels of stained glass and a magnificent tapestry fragment depicting a fabulous lionlike beast.

HEADLINE: Dia Center To Open A Museum Upstate

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
The Dia Center for the Arts, the innovative contemporary arts institution based in Chelsea, announced yesterday that it would open a massive museum in an abandoned paperboard factory in the hard-pressed Hudson River town of Beacon.
The $20-million museum, an hour's drive from Manhattan, will feature works by artists like Richard Serra, Dan Flavin, Joseph Beuys and Donald Judd, and will include 160,000 square feet of gallery space. That is roughly four times the exhibition space of the Whitney Museum of American Art and a little less than twice the exhibition space now in the Museum of Modern Art, which is about to undergo an expansion. 
 The Dia Center said it hoped the waterfront museum, scheduled to open in 2001, would attract 50,000 and 60,000 visitors a year, enough to give a significant boost to the economy of Beacon, a depressed industrial city. Gov. George E. Pataki, who yesterday said the new "world-class" museum would "preserve the Hudson Valley's rich cultural legacy," has pledged $2 million toward the new space with discretionary money from the state's Community Enhancement Fund. An additional $800,000 is coming from other state sources, Dutchess County and the City of Beacon.
"This is the first facility I've seen with enough space and light to do justice to our collection," said Michael Govan, the director of Dia. "We have one of the largest and finest museum collections of art of the 1960's and 1970's ranging from Andy Warhol's 'Shadow Paintings' to the recently acquired 'Torqued Ellipses' by Richard Serra. The scale requirements to show some of these works is enormous."
Dia has long been known for its alternative exhibition spaces. This will be the sixth location it has inaugurated. Besides its two galleries on West 22d Street, Dia also operates several site-specific art installations including Walter De Maria's "New York Earth Room" and "The Broken Kilometer" both in Manhattan; "The Lightning Field" in New Mexico, and the Dan Flavin Art Institute in Bridgehampton, N.Y. Dia also has collaborated with others on the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh and the Cy Twombly Gallery in Houston.
The 292,000-square-foot factory off Walcott Avenue and 26 surrounding acres are being donated to Dia by the International Paper Company, whose headquarters are in Purchase, N.Y. The Beacon factory, built in 1929 by what is now Nabisco, has sat empty ever since 1991. The Federal Paper Board Company, which had bought it from Nabisco, was acquired by the International Paper Company in 1995, and the factory came with the sale. International Paper had planned to sell the building, putting a $2 million price tag on it until it was approached by Governor Pataki who pursuaded it to give it to Dia. Mr. Govan said he first saw the building in Beacon last spring. He started bringing artists like Mr. Serra and Robert Ryman, whose works are represented in Dia's collection, for visits to gauge their impressions. Then he went straight to the Governor's office to inquire about support and to his trustees, who have already earmarked close to $10 million toward the project.
"I've always liked this type of great old industrial building for art," said Leonard Riggio, the chief executive of Barnes & Noble and Dia's chairman. "Having contemporary art along the Hudson is mind boggling to me. People generally tend to identify contemporary art with big cities. There aren't enough people who realize the landscape in America is full of culture and this kind of celebrates that."
The factory is about two miles from the Tallix Foundry where artists like Frank Stella and Claes Oldenburg have worked. It is also a 15-minute drive across the Hudson from Storm King Art Center, which is devoted primarily to outdoor sculpture.
The factory in Beacon, a historic steel, concrete and glass structure, is a model of functional and elegant early 20th-century industrial architecture, Mr. Govan said. The building is distinguished by high ceilings, large open spaces and an extensive system of north-facing skylights, making it a perfect showcase for contemporary art.
Even though Dia has long had far-flung outposts, the announcement follows a growing interest on the part of New York museums in off-site expansions in the region. The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum is contemplating a new museum on a Hudson River pier and the Museum of Modern Art has just merged with P.S. 1 in Long Island City, Queens.
Assembled largely during the 1970's and early 1980's by Dia's founders, the German art dealer Heiner Friedrich and the Houston arts patron Philippa de Menil, Dia's collection today has about 500 works and includes those by Beuys, John Chamberlain, Walter De Maria, Flavin and Judd. It also includes a group of 19th-century Hudson River school drawings by John Kensett, Aaron Shattuck and other masters which was assembled by Flavin, who died in 1996 and was a longtime resident of the Hudson Valley and one of Dia's founding artists.
Twenty years ago, Flavin had envisioned a Dia museum in the area for his own works and the Hudson River drawings, a vision that was never realized.
But will people from New York City be willing to drive an hour or spend 1 hour 15 minutes on a Metro North train to see the new museum? "When we opened up Chelsea in 1988, everybody said no one would come," said Mr. Govan. "Now we get over 80,000 visitors a year, and we have over 70 art galleries in our neighborhood."
While Beacon may not be as convenient as, say, P.S. 1, Dia simply could not afford space closer to Manhattan. "This is a $20-million project that will yield close to 200,000 square feet of gallery space," Mr. Govan said. "A project of that scale in New York City would cost 5 to 10 times that much."
Preliminary studies conducted on behalf of Dia indicate that the new center will generate nearly $1.7 million annually in revenue, and create 23 jobs.
Mr. Govan said that the new museum would probably have the same admission charge as Dia's Chelsea galleries, $6. But such details have not been worked out.

HEADLINE: An Interest-Rate Illusion

 BODY:

To the Editor:
You report (Business Day, March 6) that "Japan's central bank pushed overnight interest rates to the unprecedented level of effectively zero . . . basically allowing Japanese banks to borrow free." On the surface this is true; in reality it's an optical illusion. 
 The Japanese economy is undergoing deflation. Prices are falling 5 percent a year. If you sew 1,000 yen into a mattress today, a year from today you will be able to buy goods that would have cost you 1,050 today. From the standpoint of a borrower, however, 1,000 yen borrowed today at the stated rate of zero interest will have to be repaid with 1,000 yen that will then be worth 1,050 of today's yen. That comes out to 5 percent interest.
If the Japanese Government hopes to end its long recession, it may have to pay borrowers to borrow -- that is, charge them less than zero percent interest.

HEADLINE: Strange but True Economics

BYLINE: By Alan S. Blinder; Alan S. Blinder, a former economic adviser to President Clinton, is a professor of economics at Princeton and vice chairman of the G-7 group.

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J.

 BODY:
As the saying goes, the President proposes and Congress disposes -- and that's just what the Republicans seem intent on doing with President Clinton's proposals to "save" Social Security. That's a shame, because the Administration's rather convoluted explanations seem to have obscured the essence of a rather good proposal. The substance of the policy is actually far better than the spin.
What is the policy? Once you cut through some complexities that have given even budget wonks headaches, the President's plan does three things. 
 First, it saves most of the $4.85 trillion in budget surpluses that are now projected to accrue over the next 15 years. Specifically, the White House would "spend" only $1.4 trillion of the projected surpluses on tax cuts and new programs, thereby saving $3.45 trillion. That is $750 billion more than the Republican proposal to save the Social Security surplus and spend the rest. Since running surpluses is the best way to boost national saving and prepare for the heavy burdens of Social Security to come, that's a big plus. Congress should not do less.
Second, the President would invest a modest share of the Social Security Trust Fund in equities. The purpose is to raise the trust fund's rate of return, thereby reducing the need for future benefit cuts or payroll tax increases. Think of it as holding down future tax increases rather than cutting taxes today. Critics of the idea should tell us which benefit cuts or tax increases they prefer.
One line of criticism is true, but misses the point. Each dollar invested in equities is one less dollar invested in Government bonds -- which forces the Treasury to sell an additional dollar of bonds to private investors. Thus, critics complain, part of the return earned by Social Security is offset by higher interest costs. True. But that still leaves the Government as a whole -- Social Security plus the general fund -- ahead by the amount that stock market returns exceed the interest rate on Government bonds.
Critics also claim that Government shareholding will inevitably lead to politically motivated investment decisions. While purity cannot be guaranteed, there are several ways to keep politics pretty far from investment decisions. An independent board could supervise the investments not by picking the stocks itself but by hiring private portfolio managers, who would in turn be instructed to invest in indexed funds. The Government should not participate in shareholder voting. And an ombudsman should blow the whistle on any politician who tries to breach these lines of defense. What politician will want to risk being accused of undermining the pension security of every American?
This brings us to the President's third proposal, a complicated accounting device that has provoked angry charges of "double counting."
The Administration fears that persistent budget surpluses will prove tempting to future Congresses. So, to make it more difficult to spend this money later, the President would give the trust funds $2.87 trillion in newly created bonds -- plus the money to purchase $580 billion in equities -- for a total of $3.45 trillion in outright gifts. Furthermore, the Administration wants to count all these gifts as spending.
Notice that the $3.45 trillion in gifts is equal to the $3.45 trillion in budget surpluses. This is no coincidence. The Administration picked the gift number to make the surpluses disappear -- in a bookkeeping sense. It hopes that this unorthodox accounting device will build a political wall around money earmarked for Social Security. If future Congresses don't have budget surpluses dangling alluringly in front of them each year, there's less risk they'll dip into all that extra money.
Admittedly, the accounting looks a little strange. After all, the gifts are just paper transactions -- the Government's left hand is conveying i.o.u.'s to its right hand. Even more unusual is the Administration's proposal to count all these gifts as spending, which they clearly aren't in any real sense.
Still, there is a political method in this bookkeeping madness. Under current law, outstanding promises to pay Social Security benefits exceed likely payroll tax receipts over the long run. Thus Congress has implicitly pledged to balance Social Security's books through lower benefits and/or higher payroll taxes in the future. By handing $2.87 trillion in bonds over to the trust funds, the President would inscribe part of that pledge on documents that compel future governments to pay up. Whether this idea is clever or foolish is for politicians to judge.
Unfortunately, the President's idea has led to the charge of double counting, because it appears that the $3.45 trillion gets counted twice -- once as budget surpluses, and again as gifts. So let's be clear: there is no second $3.45 trillion. The gift bonds simply amount to a pledge to provide more money for Social Security in the future -- somehow.
One last point. The money needed to pay off the gift bonds will presumably come from general revenue. Thus, if Congress accepts this proposal, it implicitly signs on to substantial general-revenue financing of Social Security. This is surely a major step that deserves careful consideration. Personally, I favor doing it. After all, the alternatives are lower Social Security benefits and/or higher payroll taxes. But others hold a different, and respectable, view.
So when you add up the score, the President is proposing (1) large surpluses to boost national saving, (2) equity investments and general revenue financing to infuse more money into Social Security -- thereby reducing future payroll tax increases or benefit cuts -- and (3) a complicated accounting device intended to keep political hands off money that will one day be needed for Social Security. Now, does that sound so bad?

HEADLINE: Fishing Nations, Worried About Supply, Will Trim Fleets

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 8

 BODY:
In a stark recognition that many commercial fishing stocks are being harvested to the verge of collapse, the world's seafaring nations have promised to make the first far-reaching cuts in their fishing fleets.
Despite limits on how many fish can be caught, trimming the fleets is now seen as the key to heading off economic and ecological calamity, industry experts say. 
 But they acknowledge that the new effort, a nonbinding agreement sponsored by the United Nations, could take many years before having much effect on overfishing.
Without a solution, the question for some of the world's waters will only be which would come first -- the bankruptcy of the fishing companies or the extinction of their quarry.
As things stand, government and private experts said, the industry is wasting tens of billions of dollars each year trying to catch ever-scarcer fish.
At a meeting in Rome in mid-February, delegates from virtually every fishing nation agreed on a plan to reduce fishing capacity, starting within six years. To meet targets, many governments will probably have to pay owners to scuttle vessels, or the governments will have to reduce immense subsidies.
"The bottom line is that some folks are going to have to find a new job," said David Schorr, a fisheries expert at the World Wildlife Fund, adding that politicians will face some tough choices about who is forced out of fishing, and where.
Even without knowing whether the voluntary effort will work, fishery officials call the plan one of the most significant to address the need to preserve fish stocks.
"Globally, the problem of overcapacity in the world's fleet is probably the single greatest threat to the world's fish resources," said Terry Garcia, chief American delegate to the negotiations.
"Within the next decade or so, if we do not take steps to address the problem of overcapacity, then the demand for wild fish stocks is going to exceed the supply."
Some experts say this has already occurred. After decades of growth, the catch has leveled off, suggesting that many fish are being caught faster than they can reproduce.
The new agreement calls for nations to cap their fleets at existing levels and then to scale them back progressively, and to eliminate subsidies to companies that are deemed to overfish.
Past efforts to control overfishing have focused on strictly regulating the quantity of fish that can be legally caught, the size of fish that may be kept, the length of the fishing season and the type of equipment and nets used.
But that approach, the nations agreed, is flawed, given the capacity of many fishing fleets to catch more fish than permitted. Increasingly, countries have recognized that they must find ways to cut the industry's capacity. In 1997 fishing vessels at sea were estimated to have caught 95 million tons, the international food agency says.
Despite strict controls on fishing in recent years, New England fishery managers concluded in December that the cod fishery in the Gulf of Maine is collapsing. The Clinton Administration has already proposed new spending to take some of the region's boats out of service, and last month the National Marine Fisheries Service proposed guidelines for buying back licenses and scrapping boats throughout American fisheries.
The new international measures recommended in February, at the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization, will have no immediate impact. The first step is to get an accurate measure of how much fish the world's fleets really can catch.
Each nation that signs the agreement pledges to reduce overcapacity, starting between 2003 and 2005.
"This is the first significant international document on the management of fishing capacity," said Dominique Greboval, a fisheries planning manager with the Food and Agricultural Organization. "It might not look like much, but in terms of approach it is a significant departure."
The agency has estimated conservatively that the fishing industry's overcapacity is at least 30 percent. Gareth Porter, a fisheries expert for the World Wildlife Fund, has estimated overcapacity at almost 150 percent.
And the food agency found several years ago that worldwide, the fishing industry was spending $54 billion more than it was taking in every year.
The world's fishing fleet numbers about four million vessels -- about one-third of them large enough to have decks and motors, the agency says. About 40,000 are larger than 100 tons and longer than about 78 feet. And more than a thousand of those are owned in the United States. The new agreement, which was pushed by the United States and Japan, is one of a series of United Nations pacts since 1995 to address overfishing, and the most explicit on controlling overcapacity.
But the political barriers to following through are daunting.
"There is so much invested in the way things are that changing and downsizing the industry is an enormous task," said Anne Platt McGinn, of the Worldwatch Institute, an environmental research organization. "Probably the European Union is going to have the hardest time of all, because their fishermen are so over-subsidized."
As in the United States, government programs in Europe have encouraged the modernization and expansion of the fishing industry, but other programs have aimed at reducing the size of the fleet to control overfishing.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Little ChangeIn Treasuries After Rally Of Last Week

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Bond prices were little changed yesterday, after rising smartly on Friday, amid increased prospects that tame inflation will keep the Federal Reserve from increasing rates any time soon even as the economy expands.
The price of the 30-year benchmark Treasury issue rose 5/32 , to 955/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.59 percent from 5.60 percent. 
 Kim Rupert, an economist at Standard & Poor's MMS, a market research and analysis company in San Francisco, said that after the employment data released last week, the sigh of relief in the Treasury market was audible.
Gone were rumblings of unsustainable growth and imminent rate increases by the Fed. Also gone was roughly half the increase in yield that the 30-year bond had made since Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, testified before Congress late last month.
"We expect the progress in Treasuries last Friday to be sustainable," Ms. Rupert said. "But data, Fed commentary and supply still pose a risk after this brief respite from the storm."
Market analysts said that the trading yesterday was within a narrow range, as Treasury prices edged up. A speech by Mr. Greenspan to the Mortgage Bankers Association in Washington yesterday was for a time a source of concern, as is the case whenever he speaks, but he did not say anything that surprised the market.
Though the dampened fears of a rate increase have increased the appeal of longer maturities, many traders will probably reserve judgment on buying shorter maturities until after data on retail sales and the Producer Price Index are released later this week.
The market may be intimidated by the threat of strong retail sales, but if the script follows last week's lead-up to the employment report, this week's figures could become a rallying point if the data come in weaker than expected.
Elsewhere, the Government's weekly bill auction went well, with the best demand in a few weeks. The three-month bill was awarded at 4.510 percent, down from 4.570 percent last week, while the six-month bill came in at 4.540 percent, down from 4.585 percent.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	98.860	97.705	High Rate	4.51%	4.54%	Coupon Yield	4.63%	4.72%	Low Rate	4.41%	4.45%	Median Rate	4.50%	4.53%	Total applied for	$32,370,620	$30,863,339	Accepted	$11,526,860	$11,585,509	Noncompetitive	$1,344,204	$1,120,247	
 
Both issues are dated Mar. 11, 1999. The three-month bills mature on June 10, 1999, and the six-month bills mature on Sept. 9, 1999

Moviegoers Vs. Theaters: Food Fight!

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
THE tempest of the season for many here has nothing to do with upstate snows, school vouchers, police shootings or whither Hillary. No, the big storm is over the fact that it now costs $9.50 to see a movie at Loews, Cineplex Odeon and Sony Theaters in the city. That's four bits more than two weeks ago.
It may not sound like much money, especially for those desperate in these days before the Academy Awards to catch "Private Ryan in Love," "Life is Beautiful in Elizabeth, N.J.," or whatever the best-picture nominees are called. 
 Still, the way Loews Cineplex Entertainment sprang a 50-cent increase on New Yorkers struck many of them as an arrogance, considering that the 5.6 percent rise comes at a time of near-zero inflation. In the last five years, movie ticket prices in the city have gone up by 27 percent, more than twice as fast as the cost of living.
It brings to mind the assurances given by a Cineplex Odeon executive a year and a half ago when his company merged with Sony Corporation's Loews Theaters to form the new entertainment concern.
"I can guarantee you that ticket prices will not increase as a result of this merger," the executive, Howard Lichtman, said. Guess that can be put in the file with other classic not-to-worry lines like "the check is in the mail" and "I never had sexual relations with that woman."
Of course, a supply-and-demand purist would say that businesses are free to charge what they wish and the marketplace will let them know when they have overreached. That theory may not work quite so smoothly in a near-monopolistic situation, which we are approaching with Loews Cineplex Entertainment.
It controls almost half the movie screens in Manhattan alone, and would have had about 70 percent had the State Attorney General's office not stepped in last year, threatening antitrust lawsuits unless the company sold several movie houses. Even somewhat slimmed down, Loews Cineplex can feel fairly confident that an entertainment-hungry public will fuss and grumble -- and then fork over the extra 50 cents.
What to do about this "mugging of the middle class," as Peter F. Vallone, the City Council Speaker, put it?
Mr. Vallone took his unhappiness directly to Sony executives, according to his spokesman, Michael S. Clendenin. "He came away feeling that they're going to do whatever they want because they can," Mr. Clendenin said.
So for moviegoers looking to strike back, the Speaker has proposed a boycott of theaters on the first Friday of each month, a favorite time for Hollywood to unload its latest exegesis of raging teen-age hormones. Last Friday evening, he stood outside the grand Sony Lincoln Square Theater, urging people to walk on by.
There is no sign, though, that New Yorkers are about to march on the multiplexes with pitchforks. They do like their movies -- enough for a Loews Cineplex spokesman, Marc J. Pascucci, to wave off Mr. Vallone's boycott. "It had no effect on our grosses at all," Mr. Pascucci said yesterday.
MAYBE, some disgruntled New Yorkers say, the answer lies with a different kind of boycott.
Can't give up Gwyneth Paltrow? That's understandable. But how strongly do you feel about Milk Duds?
Concession stands account for much of a theater's profits. "Peter says that if you do go to the movies," the Vallone spokesman said, "don't buy food" -- a munchie boycott also urged in a letter to this newspaper the other day from a New Jersey reader, N. S. Hayden.
While this department is not charged with advocating a particular course of action, it may note that a "regular" order of popcorn costs $3.49 at Sony Lincoln Square and a "regular" soda $2.75. Skip them, and you're well on your way to recouping the price of a ticket (not to mention protecting your arteries).
If you absolutely must have a movie snack, Providence created delis and candy stores, along with handbags and coat pockets to carry the goodies in with you. Note, too, that signs over the Sony food counters say, "Free refills on all fountain drinks." They don't say that the refill has to be the same day. Do you see theater owners patting down hundreds of people looking for cup smugglers? Just a question.
The title of a film making the rounds could become the rallying cry for fed-up moviegoers: "Just the Ticket." It beats the title many feel better suits them now: "Affliction."

HEADLINE: Aerospace Gets Japan's Message;
Without Military Largess, Industry Takes the Lean Path

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: CHULA VISTA, Calif.

 BODY:
Two years ago, the B. F. Goodrich Company's aerospace division factory here fell so far behind schedule producing parts for the new Boeing 737-700 that the Boeing Company threatened to terminate the contract.
"We had rafts of Boeing people coming down here helping us get on schedule," recalled Martin Lodge, an executive here. 
 Today, Boeing people are still coming -- but to help put themselves back on schedule. This factory has significantly improved its efficiency using so-called lean production, the collection of techniques first perfected by the Toyota Motor Corporation. And Boeing, facing serious production problems of its own, has sent more than 300 people here to learn how it's done.
A decade after American auto makers and many other companies began adopting just-in-time delivery and other lean manufacturing techniques, the aerospace industry is embracing the concept to cut costs in the face of reduced military spending and, in commercial aircraft, stiff competition from Europe's Airbus Industrie.
Executives are now bandying about Japanese terms like kaizen (continuous improvement; pronounced KI-zen) and kanban (the just-in-time system; pronounced CON-bon). They often mispronounce them horribly, but are applying them well enough to achieve some startling efficiency gains in an industry long known as much for high costs and wasteful procedures as for cutting-edge technology.
At the Boeing factory in Long Beach, Calif., for instance, production of the C-17 military transport has been doubled in the last three years without raising the head count. That has helped save the Pentagon hundreds of millions of dollars, said Richard D. Harstad, the Air Force's chief of manufacturing and quality for the C-17. Boeing's C-17 operation, which initiated the improvement when it was part of McDonnell Douglas, recently won the Commerce Department's Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award.
Industry executives and analysts said aerospace manufacturers lagged behind in adopting lean techniques mostly because Pentagon contracts generally reimbursed them for their costs and they were insulated from foreign competition that hit other industries.
"The automobile industry had the advantage, if you can call it that, of an early threat," said Thomas J. Allen, a professor of management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is co-director of the Lean Aerospace Initiative, an M.I.T. program supported by the Air Force and many aerospace companies to spread lean manufacturing techniques across the industry. "The aerospace industry hasn't until now had that kind of a threat."
The term "lean" is vaguely defined and refers to many different techniques. But it generally focuses on manufacturing things in smaller batches to meet demand, rather than in large quantities. Parts are delivered just as they are needed and problems are corrected as they occur. The idea is to cut out operations, such as storing parts, that do not directly contribute to the value a company is providing.
Done right, lean manufacturing not only saves time and money directly, but also helps a company quickly identify flaws in its overall production process.
Many of the changes being made seem to be just plain common sense, such as preparing kits of necessary tools in advance.
The Northrop Grumman Corporation videotaped a mechanic whose job was to apply about 70 feet of tape to the B-2 bomber. The mechanic walked away from the plane 26 times and took three hours to gather the chemicals, hoses, gauges and other material she needed just to start. When the factory made kits with all the needed parts, the mechanic did not have to leave the plane at all and time for the job dropped to 1.62 hours from 8.4 hours.
Cutting the time needed to design and manufacture aerospace products could have great economic impact. It now takes so many years to design and build a fighter that the military threat can change in the meantime. Commercial aircraft take so long to build that Boeing has to order parts and materials years in advance. When it reduces its production rate, as happened recently, it and its suppliers are stuck with unneeded material.
How much lean production will save is still open to question. Despite some claimed successes in individual factories, it is difficult to separate any cost savings from those achieved simply because of big industry mergers and layoffs.
Certainly, lean production is no panacea. Boeing is suffering huge production glitches despite supposedly putting into effect some lean techniques for years. Skeptics say leanness could become just the latest in a series of short-lived cost-cutting initiatives by the Pentagon and its contractors.
James P. Womack, co-author of "The Machine That Changed the World" (Rawson Associates), the 1990 book that introduced the term and crystallized the Toyota production system for American managers, said that aerospace was the industry most in need of lean approaches. "It's the most sclerotic industry out there," he said.
But Mr. Womack, who now runs the Lean Enterprise Institute, a nonprofit organization, said most companies were merely "spray painting" lean techniques onto their existing procedures instead of making fundamental changes.
"Whole square miles of factories have to be blown up," he said. Pratt & Whitney, the engine maker owned by the United Technologies Corporation, revived itself with such a radical shift, but most executives are not ready for that, said Mr. Womack, who was dismissed as a consultant to Boeing for being, as he put it, "disruptive and obnoxious."
While Boeing would not discuss the reason for Mr. Womack's departure, it said it remained committed to lean manufacturing.
The Toyota system, designed for factories that make hundreds of thousands of cars a year, is not perfectly adaptable to an aerospace factory that might make only a dozen, highly complex objects annually. In aerospace, which generally does not use moving assembly lines, becoming lean means putting jobs that follow in sequence next to one another.
In many aerospace factories, parts move in big batches to various centralized production centers -- from metal pressing to heat treating to cleaning and so on. Parts can travel miles, either within a factory or around the country to different factories. It can take years from the time a part is started until it ends up in a functioning airplane.
But most parts are actually being worked on less than 5 percent of the time, according to a survey by researchers at M.I.T. The rest of the time they sit idle. That contributes to excess inventory, which takes up capital and is costly to manage.
Here at the Chula Vista factory, which makes parts for engine housings known as nacelles, work had been done in five separate buildings spread over a mile. A map of how a part once traveled through the production process looks like a plate of spaghetti. Sometimes parts were even packaged in paper and loaded onto dollies to be shipped from one building to the next, adding time and expense. The factory was cluttered with excess inventory.
"Three years ago I would have been embarrassed to bring a family member into this plant," said Harold Rhodes, a longtime worker who has moved to factory management.
Now, the company is rearranging production in cells. Instead of one big centralized degreasing center, for instance, there are now dishwasher-size degreasers placed where needed in the various cells.
Metal skins for the Boeing 717 fan cowls, a part of the nacelle, used to travel 17,000 feet and take 43 days to make. Now they travel 4,300 feet and are made in 7 days. Two years ago, the factory could not produce enough parts for even two Boeing 737-700's a month. It now produces enough for 23, with only 14 employees instead of 18.
Production is being consolidated in two buildings, so that the company will be able to give up half the land it is leasing and still have room to spare.
There are other changes as well. The manufacturing manager and many engineers have been moved from carpeted office buildings out onto the factory floor, making them more accessible to workers and closer to the job.
Layers of management have been flattened and the number of job classifications, as defined by the union contract, has been cut from 200 to 28. Workers no longer have to sit idle, unable to do a nearby job because they lacked the proper classification.
The Toyota production system almost seems as if it were a religion here, even though only one factory manager ever visited a Toyota plant in Japan. (The company learned from Toyota's American operations and from consultants.) The conference rooms above the factory floor are named after former Toyota officials.
Some workers greeted the introduction of lean production with suspicion, in part because the word suggested layoffs. Others saw it as just another passing phase. But most seem to appreciate it now.
Morgan Fugate, the shop steward, said the number of grievances filed through union procedure had fallen from several a day to only one or two a month because workers were happier and managers were more responsive.
"I can't believe my eyes when I go through here," said Mr. Fugate, a top representative of the International Association of Machinists and 25-year veteran of the plant.
Lean production can lead to job losses. While Chula Vista's work force has grown to 1,030 union workers from 700 four years ago, it is benefiting from cuts elsewhere. In December, Goodrich announced that it would close four factories in its aerostructures division, eliminating 775 jobs. Some of the work will move to Chula Vista, such as consolidating assembly of parts once shipped to Arkansas. This is already occurring here with fan cowls for the Boeing 717.
The division, which includes the Chula Vista factory, was an independent company called Rohr Inc. until its acquisition in 1997.
Other companies, however, are experiencing more worker resistance to lean manufacturing as well as resentment about the use of Japanese expressions.
When workers who make composite parts for the Air Force's F/A-18 attack fighter at Northrop's factory in El Segundo, Calif., were first organized into cells last October, they compared it to the cells in the Los Angeles County jail, said Joe Geer, a team leader in the section. But costs and time have been reduced 40 percent since October, he said, so workers are coming to like it.
Owing in part to lean production, operating profit margin for Goodrich's aerostructures division has risen to 15.6 percent in 1998 from 9.9 percent in 1995.
But Mr. Lodge, director of continuous improvement in Chula Vista, says that rearranging the factory furniture is the easy part. The big challenge is to apply lean thinking to the company's entire operations, including the engineers and office workers. One aim is to speed product design and design products that can be more easily maintained and manufactured.
"We're scratching the surface," said Mr. Lodge, who is already spouting new terms like hoshin kanri (policy management; pronounced HO-sheen KAHN-ree). "It's daunting, daunting, daunting. Daunting, with no alternative."

Chart: "Saving Time and Motion"
At Northrop Grumman's B-2 in Palmdale, Calif., a mechanic once made 26 trips to various workstations (black lines) and took three hours simply to gather the materials to apply some tape to the Stealth bomber.
 
By making prepackaged kits for the job, the company cut preparation time to zero and reduced the total time for the job from 8.4 hours to about 1.6.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
A trash hauler is buying a much bigger rival, a type of deal that makes Wall Street a bit nervous.

BYLINE: By David Barboza and Laura M. Holson 

 BODY:
WHEN Allied Waste Industries announced yesterday that it would acquire Browning-Ferris Industries, a much bigger rival in the trash hauling business, Allied's message was simple: We can better manage those huge assets.
With its $7.3 billion leveraged takeover of Browning-Ferris -- plus the assumption of $1.8 billion of Browning-Ferris debt -- Allied Waste will be the No. 2 player in the industry behind Waste Management Inc., and it is betting that its more integrated and focused approach to handling solid waste can create a fleet-footed giant that produces profit growth in the high double digits. 
 "The reality is, we're teaming our management with their assets," Thomas H. Van Weelden, the chief executive at Allied Waste, said in an interview yesterday. "The story here is not consolidation; the story here is focusing on growth."
Although shares of Allied, which was the No. 3 trash hauler, fell sharply on Friday on speculation about a possible stock deal, the share price recovered some of that ground yesterday climbing $1.9375, to $16.9375. Shares of Browning-Ferris, which traded just above $30 a month ago, soared for the second day, up $4.125, to $38.875.
With the deal, the trash hauling industry, once run by small, private operators, is further concentrating into a business dominated by a handful of national companies with huge fleets of trucks and enormous landfills. The big players, however, are under growing pressure to become leaner and more profitable.
So when the boards of Allied and Browning-Ferris voted on Sunday night to create a company with about $6.6 billion in revenue, just over half the $12 billion 1998 revenue of Waste Management, executives at Allied also decided that significant cost savings and layoffs would be necessary to generate profit growth in the high double digits. They project a 30 percent profit gain in the year 2000.
Wall Street analysts said the deal was good for shareholders of Browning-Ferris, which had recently begun to turn around a slumping business. But if Allied shareholders are to benefit, Allied executives must now find a way to work their magic on a much larger company while paying off the sizable debt load from the takeover.
"That's my concern," said James Kelleher, an analyst at Argus Research in New York. "They're assuming the best of all possible worlds to service the debt. There's a lot that could happen between now and the $45-deal date in the third quarter."
Although such a leveraged takeover is unusual, this is the second time in less than a year that a giant trash hauler has been taken over by a smaller rival. (A year ago, USA Waste acquired Waste Management in a $13 billion deal.) Wall Street analysts say that industry executives now realize that a focused strategy is just as important as size in the waste management business.
At Browning-Ferris, after years of aggressive acquisitions and expansion into everything from recycling to hazardous waste removal, shareholders had been pressing it to focus more closely on its North American business, and yesterday, Allied executives said the newly formed company would do just that.
The deal began last spring when Allied Waste and Browning-Ferris discussed a stock merger. At the time, people close to the deal said, Browning-Ferris executives were not eager to sell, hoping instead to improve the company's profitability on their own. But over time they became more open to the idea, in part, because a handful of Browning-Ferris's board members supported it.
Negotiations heated up at the end of February. Goldman, Sachs & Company was hired by Browning-Ferris to advise on the transaction, while Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, among others, advised Allied's management. Browning-Ferris initially wanted cash, a person close to the talks said, up to $49 a share. The companies agreed on $45. Then Allied, along with its two majority shareholders, Apollo Management and Blackstone Capital Partners, both of which supported a deal, began arranging financing.
Several banks were asked to commit funds for the deal at the end of February and to agree to put up the money for the buyout regardless of whether other investors could be enlisted. By March 3, one person close to the talks said, three institutions -- Chase Manhattan, Citibank and DLJ Capital Funding -- had committed themselves to provide the $9.5 billion that Allied needed to buy Browning-Ferris.
Adding to that, several investors said they would buy a total of $1 billion in convertible preferred stock, including Apollo Management, Blackstone Capital Partners, DLJ Merchant Banking Partners and Greenwich Street Capital Partners. By Thursday, the two companies had agreed in concept to a deal and to continue talking over the weekend.
On Friday, Allied's stock plunged about $5 a share, or 25 percent. The company was asked by the New York Stock Exchange to make a statement, but did not. Several bankers, along with Apollo and Blackstone, double-checked their numbers to make sure the deal was sound. After their analysis was finished, the two companies hammered out the final details of the acquisition, meeting well past midnight on Sunday.
Mr. Van Weelden, the chief executive at Allied, which is based in Scottsdale, Ariz., said that he expected some layoffs, particularly in Houston, where Browning-Ferris has headquarters, but that the key to driving profits at the new company would be combining a decentralized management style with a vertically integrated business.
"We want to own all the pieces," Mr. Van Weelden said. "We believe in vertical integration."
Responding to those who worry about the leverage in the buyout, Mr. Van Weelden cited his company's acquisition of the Laidlaw Company, a trash hauler about three times the size of Allied.
"This is a kind of repeat; this is exactly what we did with Laidlaw," he said. "We know how to do this."
Several Wall Street analysts, however, say that even after all the cost savings, Allied may have to cope with a large debt load and the possibility of an economic slowdown.
"If we were to run into a recession, the deal could be breached," said Melville Cody, an analyst at Sanders Morris Mundy, a brokerage firm in Houston. "But right now we're in a good environment for waste management."
Other analysts, recalling the problems of Browning-Ferris and the old Waste Management Company, before it was acquired by USA Waste, wonder whether Allied could become too large and unwieldy.
"Allied has a better management team and a better track record than Browning-Ferris," said Charles G. Moody, publisher of American Waste Digest in Pottstown, Pa. "But any time you triple your size, you're going to have new problems."

HEADLINE: At Nicaragua Mudslide Site, Clinton's Aid Offer Falls Short of His Goal

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, March 8

 BODY:
Beneath a volcano still scarred by the hurricane-induced mudslide that occurred last October, President Clinton vowed to help Nicaraguans reclaim their lives and ravaged land.
"A hurricane, a mudslide, they can destroy lives, they can destroy homes, they can destroy a life's work," the President said as blinding dust swept through a schoolyard in the town of Posoltega where he spoke. "But they must not be allowed to destroy hope." 
 Mr. Clinton announced that the United States would provide an additional $120 million to build temporary shelters, repair roads, provide medical care and remove land mines uprooted by the torrential rains and mudslides of the hurricane. But Mr. Clinton's request for nearly $1 billion more for Central America is stalled in Congress in a partisan dispute over its source.
Casitas volcano, near Posoltega, 70 miles northwest of Managua, was the scene of the deadliest disaster last October: a 30-foot torrent of mud that buried two villages, El Porvenir and Rolando Rodriguez. Some 2,000 people were killed, many buried alive. Thousands were left homeless.
On the first day of a four-day, four-nation tour of Central America, Mr. Clinton saw the remnants of the disaster in Nicaragua, including the single house that remains of the two villages and the shallow graves of hundreds of victims. Thousands are still in temporary shelters. Mr. Clinton placed a spray of flowers at the grave of one victim, a 6-year-old girl crushed by the slide. She was one of many victims who for public-health reasons were not buried but cremated where they lay, their remains then strewn with dirt.
Afterward Mr. Clinton said he had not until now appreciated the extent of the catastrophe. "No picture can convey the feeling of seeing the outline of that small child's body by her grave and seeing the remnants of her skeleton," he said.
In his public remarks, Mr. Clinton alluded to Nicaragua's revolution and counterrevolution of the 1980's and its two democratic elections since then.
"In this decade," the President said, "with courage and with strength you have created a new Nicaragua. You have earned the world's admiration and now you deserve the world's support." The aid announced today is to come from Agency for International Development funds already included in the budget. A proposal worth $956 million is stalled in Congress in a dispute over how to pay for it.
Mr. Clinton had hoped to deliver the nearly $1 billion in aid during his trip this week. But House and Senate Republicans voted last week to attach conditions to the relief bill that the White House finds unacceptable.
The dispute will most likely take weeks or months to resolve, forcing Mr. Clinton to dip into aid agency coffers to pay for a much smaller effort. The country is to get help on housing, health care, education, road and bridge repair and the removal of land mines left from the civil wars of the 1970's and 1980's.
The United States has already given about $300 million in disaster aid to the region, through civilian relief agencies as well as the Defense Department, which provided earth-moving equipment and temporary bridges for the hundreds of spans washed out by the rains.
The Administration also temporarily suspended deportations of Central Americans who illegally entered the United States to escape the effects of the hurricane. But preparations are under way to force the return of many of those refugees, a development that has created friction with the region's Governments, which say they cannot provide housing or sustenance for them.
Mr. Clinton promised today to seek a "fair solution" to the refugee issue but gave no details.
As part of its relief program, the Administration also deferred for two years all bilateral debt payments owed to the United States by Nicaragua and Honduras. That concession would relieve the two countries' obligation to pay $54 million in interest payments. The Administration is also asking other nations holding debt from Central America to forgive or defer payments.
In addition, the Peace Corps is expanding its presence in the region to help rebuild, according to Mark Gearan, the Peace Corps Director, who accompanied Mr. Clinton on the trip. The 500 Peace Corps volunteers already working in the countries hardest hit by the storm will be reinforced by as many as 100 workers for short-term emergency aid.
They belong to the Crisis Corps, a new Peace Corps program that enlists former volunteers to return for six-month stints to the countries where they served, sometimes decades earlier.

HEADLINE: Property Taxes In Nassau Called Biased

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON 

DATELINE: MINEOLA, N.Y., March 8

 BODY:
The Justice Department says Nassau County's method of assessing property taxes discriminates against black and Hispanic homeowners, causing them to pay disproportionately high taxes, according to Government documents.
Zachary W. Carter, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, in a letter to top Nassau officials, threatened a Government lawsuit unless the county voluntarily takes steps to end "the discriminatory assessments," and consents to a settlement. 
 In a separate but related action, a New York State Supreme Court judge refused today to dismiss a suit about discriminatory assessments filed against Nassau County by the New York Civil Liberties Union on behalf of six black homeowners.
Sanford M. Cohen, chief of civil rights litigation in the United States Attorney's office, said the homeowners' suit would not affect the Government's actions against the county. He added that he was hopeful that Nassau would voluntarily resolve the tax issue. "If not, we are authorized to sue," he said. Mr. Cohen said the county had been aware for years that its assessment system was discriminatory, yet had made no effort to change it.
In Nassau, homes are assessed based on 1938 construction costs, while the land they are built on is assessed according to 1964 property values. Because property values have appreciated faster in wealthier, predominantly white areas than in poorer, more heavily minority areas, homes that may have cost the same when they were built decades ago and are currently assessed at the same rate could have widely varying prices.
For example, Hezekiah Brown, a labor negotiator who says his home on Flower Street in a predominantly African-American neighborhood in Hempstead is worth around $200,000, pays a little over $8,000 a year in property taxes. He said a house similar to his in nearby Garden City was worth more than $400,000, but the owners also paid $8,000 a year in taxes.
"This is a scandal, and it's time for a change," Mr. Brown said in front of his home this afternoon.
Mr. Carter said a Justice Department study compared the assessed and market values of more than 11,000 residential properties in Nassau from August 1995 through July 1996 with Census Bureau figures.
The study showed that the average assessment in predominantly minority areas was 27 percent higher than the total average assessment rate of all property in the county.
Most of the minority homeowners live in southern and central Nassau, in small houses on modest lots. In some areas, such as Lakeview, Roosevelt, Freeport, Hempstead and New Cassel, the minority tracts were assessed at more than twice the average rate, Mr. Carter said.
"As a result, owners of residential property in minority communities have for years borne a disproportionate share of the cost of governmental services that are funded by real property taxes," Mr. Carter said in his letter, dated March 2. Mr. Carter's letter and the Justice Department's findings were first reported today by Newsday.
In response to the letter, Nassau County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta defended the county's property tax system as fair and as one that had been upheld by the courts. He had no immediate comment on today's court ruling.
Mr. Gulotta said that Nassau had one assessment system formula that "applies equally to all homeowners and is nondiscriminatory." He said it was not in violation of the United States Fair Housing Act, as charged by Mr. Carter.
"The Federal Government should not impose its will upon our homeowners over their wishes," Mr. Gulotta said in a letter to Mr. Carter dated March 5 that was released by county officials today.
A 1995 study by the Nassau Citizens Budget Committee estimated that a reassessment would cost at least $40 million dollars. Mr. Gulotta said such a step "may be harmful and costly to our taxpayers, regardless of race or national origin."
Mr. Gulotta's response to the Justice Department complaint was sharply criticized by Roger Corbin, who represents one of the two minority districts in the Nassau County Legislature.
"I think the County Executive is clearly off base with this," Mr. Corbin said.
Bruce Blakeman, Presiding Officer of the County Legislature, said that "it might be time to take a look at the Justice Department's data and discuss with the County Executive and Assessor's Office whether any changes would be in the best interest of the county."
"We do not want to be unfair to any segments of the county population," he said.
Mr. Gulotta noted that the county recently enacted a year-round grievance system enabling property owners to appeal their assessments.
In fact, the appeals have been so successful, they have cost the county more than $100 million in tax refunds, which it has had to borrow. In the view of some critics, this expense indicates that the old assessment system should be revised as a means to help solve the county's fiscal crisis.
The county's $2.3 billion budget has become so structurally imbalanced that Standard & Poor's recently lowered the county's credit rating to A minus and placed its bonds on a credit watch. It is facing a $160 million deficit for 1998 and a projected $125 million deficit for 1999, despite the generally robust health of Long Island's economy.
However, a revision of its assessment procedures would not help the county's finances, said Richard J. Marino, a director at Standard & Poor's. "It might shift the burden around among the taxpayers, but the financial outcome would be the same," he said.
Kathy O'Callaghan, former president of the Levittown Property Tax Payers Association, has long called for a revision of the county's tax system. While minority neighborhoods have been the hardest hit, she said, white low- and middle-income communities like Levittown have also suffered.
In the ruling on the homeowners' suit issued late this afternoon in State Supreme Court, Justice F. Dana Winslow noted that the 1938 and 1964 data used by the county in its assessment formula "may be so dated as to defy adjustment except on an individual basis."
Justice Winslow scheduled a preliminary conference for March 26 to consider a resolution of the claims by the six homeowners. He ordered all parties, including representatives of the Nassau County Board of Assessors, the County Executive and County Legislature to be present.
Leon Friedman, a professor of constitutional law and a lawyer with the New York Civil Liberties Union, welcomed Justice Winslow's ruling. "Nassau's system is archaic, costly, unfair and discriminatory, and it's time to go.
"In a nutshell," he added, when the impact of today's ruling by Justice Winslow is combined with the actions by the U.S. Attorney's Office, "you have a powerful case being made."

JAPAN: U.S. GETS OKINAWA BASE
Urasoe, a small city on Okinawa, decided to allow a U.S. naval port to relocate there in return for Japanese Government aid to develop the city's waterfront. Under a 1974 agreement, the U.S. agreed to return its military port in Naha, the capital of Okinawa prefecture, on condition that the port be relocated on Okinawa. Until Urasoe made an offer, no city appeared to want the base. (AP) 

INDONESIA: 4 DIE IN RELIGIOUS RIOTS
At least four people were killed and 11 severely wounded in new clashes, left, on the eastern Indonesian island of Ambon, officials and witnesses said. Christians attacked and burned a truck with 28 people aboard, killing two and wounding four others, in the town of Paso, an official at a local mosque said. In the Air Salobar area of Ambon city, Christian and Muslim gangs clashed, leaving two dead. (AP)
 
CHINA: BANNED AUTHOR HELD
An author of books banned by the Communist Party has been detained in China's restive Muslim northwest, where he was researching his latest project, family and friends said. The police notified Wang Lixiong's relatives in Beijing that he was being held in Xinjiang on suspicion of leaking state secrets, said Hao Weizhen, his adoptive aunt. A fellow author said Mr. Wang may have been trying to interview separatist groups. (AP)

TURKEY: KURDISH PARTY CAN RUN
The highest court ruled that the leading pro-Kurdish party, People's Democracy, may take part in elections on April 18. A prosecutor sought to bar the party, but several commentators warned that if he succeeded, many supporters would probably vote for the Islamic-oriented Virtue Party, an equally disagreeable choice to the secular elite.

HEADLINE: Fluor Is Expected to Announce Revamping

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 8

 BODY:
The Fluor Corporation, the nation's largest engineering and construction company, is expected to announce a reorganization Tuesday that will result in $160 million in annual cost savings, according to a person close to the company. 
 The move is also expected to result in a charge against earnings of about $130 million, this person said.
The company is expected to cut up to several thousand jobs.
Fluor had nearly 57,000 employees as of last Oct. 31. The immediate cuts are expected to be from staff positions.
The company is also expected to narrow the types of construction jobs it will accept, concentrating on only a few industries such as petrochemicals and pharmaceuticals in which it is strong and can obtain reasonable profits. The company is also expected to organize itself into four divisions -- engineering and construction, coal, diversified services such as temporary staffing, and a division that will provide administrative services to the rest of the company.
Fluor, based in Irvine, Calif., has been suffering from a downturn in the construction market caused in part by the Asian economic crisis and the decline in oil prices.

A Heart Pumping Poetry

BYLINE: By BEN RATLIFF 

 BODY:
Current 93, a British Goth-folk band led by a thin, charismatic poet named David Tibet, is a perfect little cultural operation. It has a small core of fans whose devotion runs shockingly deep; the group lies so safely and cozily within a nook of the underground-rock economy that it is never exposed to attack or unrealistic sales expectations.
And the band doesn't operate on anyone else's field: though it pumps out about two albums a year, it doesn't play at festivals, it rarely gives interviews and it fulfills a deep need among fans, who crave the mordant comfort of fantasizing that the world is one great barren moor. 
 The band's show on Friday night at Tonic, the small club on Norfolk Street in Manhattan, was its 41st performance since forming in 1983, according to one of the many Web sites devoted to the band. Fans from all around North America were there, and even some from other countries; devotion to this band is a commitment. (After tickets had quickly grown scarce, some were offered on line for $150.)
On Friday when Mr. Tibet took the stage in a colorful vest and closely cropped hair, accompanied by his guitarist, Michael Cashmore, the crowd fell deadly silent. Mr. Tibet doesn't sing, but reads his poetry to the quiet accompaniment of acoustic-guitar minor chords with a perfectly enunciating, lissome voice.
His work is fixated on God and on blood, not blood like a horror film, but more metaphorically and with less gusto. He comes across as a perfect modern equivalent of a consumptive turn-of-the-century poet turned drearily obsessed with his illness. He bent his knees and bobbed up and down a bit, quivering with feeling, declaiming lines like "the great bloody bruised veil of this world" and "sell all you have; give it to the kittens/and pour the milk on Louis's grave." He was wide-eyed and unnervingly fragile and serious.
Expanded later with a second guitarist and a violinist, the music became a heavily stylized relative of old English folk ballads.
It is music about being alone and looking within yourself, and the evening's repeated phrase -- one that has cropped up through Current 93's recorded work -- was "the inmost light." Yet the more inward music goes, the stronger are the ties among its constituents. The show was a small, emotional convention of E-mail friends who looked as if they didn't get out much, and there was an ecstatic glow over the place.

March, Insanity, Sad Facts

BYLINE: By IRA BERKOW 

 BODY:
MARCH Madness is a catchy, alliterative phrase designed to draw attention -- pecuniary preferably -- to the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division I men's basketball tournament, which begins tomorrow at eight sites around the country. I don't recall it being called March Madness until a handful of years ago when it became a big-time attraction on television, having swelled from a dozen or so teams to 64, a tournament big enough to choke a horse.
Part of the madness -- which is actually pretty sane for the TV network, the organizers and the schools, since they stand to make millions of dollars from it -- is demonstrated by the TV cameras focusing on some of the brilliant students in the crowd who look as if they've had buckets of paint, in two and three colors, spilled on their heads. Added madness is the brassy bands in the arena playing loud enough to be heard in the next county. 
 And then there is the basketball itself, invariably a wonderful show. The Cinderella teams, the buzzer beaters, the Clash of Titans, etc. But for all this, there is a level of suspended disbelief that is necessary to these nutsy pleasures. Some of the suspension is that all of these basketball players are also true students, struggling with their calculus and Economic History of Mesopotamia, and cramming on a paragraph or two during a timeout.
The sad fact is that college basketball players have lower graduation rates than most students. And the black basketball players fare worse than the white basketball players.
In the latest annual survey by the N.C.A.A., compiled last November, male basketball players continued to graduate at rates far lower than other students. "For the eighth consecutive year," wrote The Chronicle of Higher Education, "the rate of Division I male basketball players was far below the rate for all male students at those institutions, which in 1997 was 53 percent." The association found that only 41 percent of men's basketball players who entered college in 1991 had graduated within six years, down from 45 percent the year before and the second-poorest showing since the association began its graduation-rate survey.
White male basketball players graduated at a rate of 47 percent -- their lowest total in the N.C.A.A. graduation-rate survey -- compared with the overall graduation rate for white male students of 56 percent, down by 11 percent from the year before. The graduation rate of black male players fell from 39 percent in 1996 to 37 percent in 1997.
Emerge, a black-oriented magazine, has a "Bottom 50" listing that names the 50 worst Division I schools in regard to graduation rates for both African-Americans and whites. And several of this year's glorious March Madness schools are on it, including James Madison, Ohio State, Syracuse and Cincinnati, all of whom have graduated no black players for at least the past five years. And while the first three of these schools had graduated 67 percent of the white players, Cincinnati was an equal-opportunity school in having graduated no white players, either.
"The statistics aren't good, and it's a dilemma," said Kenneth A. (Buzz) Shaw, the chancellor of Syracuse University and chairman of an N.C.A.A. group that is studying basketball issues at Division I colleges. "We're working on it, and hope to help improve it."
In a related issue, a Federal District Court in Philadelphia on Monday discarded the N.C.A.A.'s minimum test score requirements for athletic scholarships, saying it "has an unjustified disparate impact against African-Americans."
Shaw said that tests have to be important -- the problem is how much weight to give them, in relation to high school grades, classroom competition, courses taken.
What's most important, from this viewpoint, is motivation for schooling. Too many players want the N.B.A. rather than an M.B.A.
"Unfortunately, some guys get the idea they only have to concentrate on basketball because they don't feel a degree will lead to fame and riches," said Steve Milburn, director of academic services for athletics at Louisville.
And it is a cruel fallacy that only sports scholarships will lead some out of mean circumstances.
"Federal and state grants and aids are available to virtually all high school graduates based on need, regardless of class standing and admissible to community colleges and beyond," Shaw said.
Meanwhile, here comes March Madness, that annual assault on the senses, where for some three weeks, we gaily suspend disbelief, and then return to sober reality.

HEADLINE: Amtrak Unveils Its Bullet to Boston

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Aiming to bring high-speed rail service to Boston by the start of the new millennium, Amtrak said yesterday that it would start rolling out the first of its new 150 mile-an-hour trains by December.
The new high-speed rail line intends to change commuting habits along the Northeast corridor from Washington to Boston by competing head on with air shuttles and interstate highways. But more important for Amtrak, the high-speed train provides a model for its rail service across the nation, and is the centerpiece of its hopes of economic redemption after operating for three decades with government subsidies. 
 "Today we are kicking off the revitalization of train service in America," Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin, who is the chairman of Amtrak's board, said at a Manhattan news conference. He described the new Northeast corridor trains, comparable to the bullet trains of France and Japan, as the first installment of high-speed rail service in this country, with his corner of the Midwest coming next.
"We are giving notice to our competitors," said George D. Warrington, the president of Amtrak, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, addressing the more mundane, unresolved question of whether trains -- even those making the New York-to-Washington run in two and a half hours -- can compete with discount regional airlines.
With a phalanx of brand-name politicians on the rostrum -- including the former Governors Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts and Linwood Holton of Virginia, both board members -- the conference provided a more rounded but still incomplete picture of the railroad's long-awaited high-speed service.
Central to its plan, Mr. Warrington said, are trains that speed from Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan to South Station in Boston in three hours, cutting 1 hour and 40 minutes off the time of the trip.
With new, electrified engines pulling rebuilt Amtrak cars, the three-hour schedule has been made possible by extensive track work and electrification from New Haven to Boston, a project that cost $1.6 billion.
The trains will also be used along the line to Union Station in Washington, beginning some time before mid-2000. With the new trains, the trip from Manhattan to Washington will be a half-hour shorter than the current three-hour trip of Amtrak's Metroliner express train, which went into service in 1969 after track upgrades and has a top speed of 125 miles an hour.
Just as critical as their speed, according to transportation analysts, will be the cost of riding the new trains. The announcement comes only weeks after several discount regional airlines disclosed plans to enter the hotly competitive New York regional market, prompting widespread predictions of lower air fares, if not an airline price war.
Officials of Amtrak refused to say what they would charge for the high-speed rail trip. Compared with the current differential between air shuttle and train tickets -- about 40 percent between New York and Washington, where the Metroliner charges $119 and full-fare air shuttles cost just under $200 -- Mr. Warrington said high-speed trains would offer a smaller discount.
"We will still have a more attractive fare" than competing air shuttles to Washington and Boston from New York, he said. But where the savings is now closer to 40 percent, he said riders on the high-speed trains could expect to pay about 30 percent less than for airline tickets.
Amtrak's ticket pricing for high-speed trains could be crucial to its success. Its executives said yesterday that it planned to retain slower, lower-priced service that has alwaysheld an appeal with more budget-conscious travelers or those traveling between smaller cities.
"The market they have to go after is the business traveler who at the moment wouldn't consider Amtrak unless he is just somebody who doesn't like to fly," said Jeffrey Zupan, a transportation analyst for the Regional Plan Association in New York.
To attract more riders, Amtrak said it would schedule more trains along the length of its Northeast corridor, with the biggest service expansion between Boston and New York City. While declining to provide detailed schedules, it said it would begin offering 17 round-trip trains between the two cities sometime next year, compared with nine round trips currently. It declined to say how many would be high-speed versions making the projected three-hour run.
Another question left unanswered yesterday was how many stops the high-speed trains would make, another complex equation for Amtrak planners, since every stop increases travel time for those on board.
Preliminary plans by Amtrak that were released yesterday call for stops of its high-speed express service in Boston, Providence, R.I., New Haven, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington. But executives of the railroad said it had not been determined how such heavily used rail hubs as Route 128 outside Boston, New London and Stamford, Conn., and Trenton would figure into their plan for high-speed service.
"Obviously, not every train is going to stop at every station, and we are going to have to look at what makes most sense in consideration of speed and convenience," said Barbara J. Richardson, Amtrak's executive vice president.
With such questions remaining until sometime later this year, Amtrak officials sought yesterday to emphasize several improvements in comfort and service that are planned for the new trains, largely aimed at business travelers in an era of cellular phones, laptop computers and increased demands for executive productivity, even on the road.
Among them, Mr. Warrington said, will be electrical outlets next to every train seat that enable travelers to plug in their laptop computers. Video monitors in each train's cafe car will provide news updates, while audio plugs will be provided with headsets for each rider, with pre-recorded music.
Amtrak plans to name the trains Acela (pronounced uh-SELL-uh), which is a made-up name, not an acronym.

An Early RallyReverses and Dow Finishes Down 33.85

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks declined yesterday, led lower by concern about the performance of Intel and Walt Disney.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 33.85 points, or four-tenths of a percent, to 9,693.76, after coming within 201.07 points of the 10,000 mark. Disney was the average's biggest decliner, falling on concern that revenue from television and movies was falling short of expectations. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 2.89 points, or two-tenths of a percent, to 1,279.84. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 4.68, also two-tenths of a percent, to 2,392.94. Losers outnumbered winners, 16 to 13, on the Big Board.
Shares of semiconductor makers may have declined on speculation that Intel, the world's biggest computer-chip manufacturer, will warn of weak earnings, said Gary Dvorchak, a money manager for Provident Investment Counsel, which oversees $18 billion in Pasadena, Calif.
"It's fairly well known on the Street right now that they're maybe 10 percent below plan for the quarter," he said. "Especially given the optimism surrounding Intel, there would be a pessimistic reaction to their announcement."
Intel declined to comment. Its shares fell 4 5/16 , to 115 5/16 .
Advanced Micro Devices, the No. 2 chip maker, fell 1 7/16 , to 17 1/2, after warning that it would lose money in the first quarter because of production problems. Intel has been cutting prices to win back sales lost to Advanced Micro's less expensive K-6 chips.
Disney fell 1 3/4, to 34 11/16 . Richard P. Simon, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs, lowered his earnings estimates for the world's No. 2 entertainment company, citing lower-than-expected revenue from TV shows and movies.
Alcoa, the world's largest aluminum producer, fell 1 11/16 , to 37 7/8, and was the second-biggest decliner in the Dow after Disney. Alcan Aluminium, the No. 2 producer, said its first-quarter profit would be less than expected because of low aluminum prices, a recession in Brazil and weaker prices for its manufactured products. Its shares fell 1 1/8, to 23 11/16 .
During the session, the Dow rose 71 points, to 9,798.93, an intraday record. Stocks retreated as short-term traders, who hoped the market would push higher throughout the day, were disappointed when the rally stalled and used that as an opportunity to sell, traders said.
On the positive side, shares of Lycos, the No. 3 Internet search service, soared 12 3/8, to 96 1/4, after David Wetherell, the chairman and chief executive of the venture capital company CMGI, resigned from the board of Lycos, saying the terms of Lycos's pending acquisition by USA Networks Inc. were inadequate. CMGI is the largest shareholder of Lycos.
Sony's American depository receipts jumped 8 3/16 , to 94, after the company said it would spend $2.7 billion to buy out three subsidiaries in a reorganization aimed at halting sliding profits. Sony will also cut 17,000 jobs, or 10 percent of its work force, and close 15 of 70 factories.
Hypercom, Sterigenics International and A. Schulman slid after saying they expect earnings to fall short of expectations.
Hypercom fell 4 1/8, to 5 5/8, after warning it expected to report a loss for the quarter ending March 31. The maker of electronic-payment systems blamed the Brazilian currency devaluation and "depressed economic conditions" in Asia and Latin America.
Sterigenics tumbled 6 3/8, to 10 1/4. The company said fourth-quarter revenue and earnings would fall short of analysts' estimates because of less business in its medical sterilization division.
Schulman, a supplier of plastic compounds and resins, fell 2, to 13 1/2, after saying net income for the quarter ended Feb. 28 would be less than the current estimate of 33 cents a share, as well as below the 31 cents the company earned in the quarter a year earlier.

Treasuries UpAs Greenspan Sees No Signs Of Inflation

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices rose yesterday after Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said there were "no obvious signs" of rising inflation, despite strong growth.
A Government report on productivity also bolstered expectations for tame inflation. Nonfarm productivity increased 4.6 percent at an annual rate during the fourth quarter, up from an initial estimate of a 3.7 percent increase. Unit labor costs -- a separate index measuring changes in worker compensation and productivity -- fell at a 1.1 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, the first drop since the first quarter of 1996. 
 The 30-year Treasury bond rose 26/32 , or $8.13 for a $1,000 bond, to 95 31/32 , pushing the yield down 6 basis points, to 5.53 percent. Yields on two-year notes, the most actively traded Treasuries, fell 8 basis points, to 5.00 percent.
"As long as Greenspan seems happy to let the economy grow without inflation picking up, the Fed doesn't have to do anything," said Chris Iggo, international economist at Barclays Capital. For the Fed to raise interest rates, inflation would have to speed up, "and that still seems some ways off," he said.
Treasuries also rose as some traders reversed short sales, or bets that prices would fall, traders said. In a short sale, traders borrow bonds and sell them, speculating that they will be able to buy them back later at lower prices and pocket the difference. Rising bond prices obviously defeat that strategy, prompting traders to buy bonds to replace the borrowed ones they had sold.
With inflation subdued -- it ran 1.7 percent for the 12 months through January -- and Treasury yields not far from seven-month highs, some investors say bonds are attractive. The 30-year bond, after adjusting for inflation, yields about 3.87 percent, almost the highest since July.
Alan Koepplin, who helps manage about $2.5 billion of fixed-income assets at SG Cowen Asset Management, bought notes and bonds last week and predicts that yields have seen their highs for the quarter, and possibly for the year.
Bonds got a brief lift after the Federal Reserve bought $811 million of Treasury bonds for delivery tomorrow in an outright purchase, or coupon pass. The central bank bought securities due between Aug. 15, 2022, and Nov. 15, 2027, excluding one issue from its purchases.
The Fed makes outright purchases periodically to permanently add money to the economy. The moves do not signal a change in interest rates.
The prospect of several large corporate bond sales could rein in bonds. Freddie Mac is planning to sell $3 billion of bonds and Lucent Technologies Inc. plans to raise $1 billion. AT&T may sell as much as $10 billion in coming weeks.

HEADLINE: U.S. Productivity Rises Sharply

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 9

 BODY:
The productivity of workers shot up in the final quarter of 1998, recording the fastest growth pace in six years and easing concerns that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates.
The Labor Department said today that productivity -- the efficiency at which workers produce goods and services -- grew 4.6 percent in the fourth quarter. That was a revision from previous data that had shown a 3.7 percent rise. 
 "This is the magic bullet that allows us to have strong economic growth with low inflation," said James Annable, an economist at the Bank One Corporation in Chicago. "If we can continue to get these productivity gains, we can keep this Goldilocks economy going."
Further encouragement came from Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, who, in remarks to a conference on business access to capital and credit, called the economic expansion "exemplary" and emphasized the lack of inflation pressures.
The fourth-quarter productivity gain was the biggest since a 6.2 percent increase in the fourth quarter of 1992. Because of the year-end surge in productivity, unit-labor costs, a closely watched gauge of wage inflation, fell 1.1 percent.
