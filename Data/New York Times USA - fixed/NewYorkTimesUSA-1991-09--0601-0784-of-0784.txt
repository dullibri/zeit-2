HEADLINE: Brazil's Environmental Plea Appears to Be Aimed at U.S.

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 23

 BODY:
In a speech before the General Assembly highlighted by his implicit criticism of the United States, the President of Brazil, Fernando Collor de Mello, said today that there was "an inescapable obligation" for nations to accept mandatory measures to protect the environment.
"Just as the question of development has yielded to other issues on the international agenda, I am concerned that the issue of the environment may also yield to other aspects of the day-to-day life of the world," said Mr. Collor, whose country is to be the site of the first Earth Summit in June. 
 The first day of general debate of the 46th General Assembly featured few surprises from the 14 speakers who went before the 166 member nations.
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran delivered a speech almost totally devoted to discussion of the "New World Order." He ended his 30-minute speech with brief mentions of what he called the three major crises of the last several decades, the "Iraqi aggression" against Kuwait, Afghanistan and the issue of a Palestinian homeland.
 
Harking Back to the Environment
 Iran has privately been at the center of efforts brokered by the United Nations to release Western hostages in Lebanon, but Mr. Velayati made no reference to that issue.
The speeches today were filled with prescriptions for peace and references to the "New World Order." But the environment was a recurring theme, from Mr. Collor's lightly veiled chastisement of the United States to an impassioned plea by President Bailey Olter of Micronesia to industrialized nations that use tiny South Pacific islands as dumping grounds.
"Our region cannot be considered by the larger nations as a convenient empty space for the disposal of toxic and hazardous waste and chemicals and radioactive materials," Mr. Olter said.
Leading off the speakers, Mr. Collor's comments increased pressure on the United States to end its opposition to a series of proposals dealing with global warming and other environmental issues.
The third of five international meetings called to formulate a host of agreements to be voted on in Brazil at the Conference on Environment and Development ended last Friday in Nairobi, Kenya. The United States was still resisting efforts to set mandatory cuts in emissions of carbon dioxide. Scientists say carbon monoxide is the main manmade gas contributing to global warming.
 
Tracing the Responsibility
 The European Community and Japan favor reducing carbon-dioxide emissions to the levels of last year by the year 2000. But the United States, the biggest producer of carbon dioxide, argues that too little is known about the warming threat to justify the costs of trying to adhere to mandatory limits.
In comments seemingly directed toward the United States, Mr. Collor said, "Lasting solutions to global problems require the commitment of the international community as a whole, each country according to its responsibility relating to the origin of these problems and to their management, as well as to its economic and technological capacity to overcome them."
The United States' objections could impede chances for a treaty at the meeting in Brazil. There are also other obstacles like demands by the United States and other developed nations for language to reduce the depletion of forests and waterways in many underdeveloped nations.
"The conference should not set the stage for grievances and recrimination," Mr. Collor said. "It should, on the contrary, provide the framework for mature and feasible proposals."
Mr. Collor, who said the Brazil meeting would allow a debate as broad and profound "as the political will of the participants will allow," was supported by New Zealand, whose Prime Minister, J. B. Bolger, said, "Next year's United Nations conference in Brazil will be the real test of our ability to cooperate in the endeavor to find the proper balance between development and environmental protection."
Other speakers included the Foreign Ministers of Angola, Australia, Burkina Faso, Iceland, Mexico, Norway and Sri Lanka.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Goes To a Hearing On Police Pay

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
In an unusual move, Mayor David N. Dinkins testified yesterday at the final day of arbitration hearings on a new contract for New York City police officers, arguing that the city cannot afford a raise greater than the 4 percent it has offered unless the union agrees to save money in other ways.
Municipal labor experts said they could not recall a similar appearance by a mayor in an arbitration dispute and they saw Mr. Dinkins's testimony as a sign of the administration's deep concern about holding down the cost of a new 15-month contract with the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, to replace the one that expired in June 1990. 
 That the contract would have expired by the time it is awarded is a sign of the complexities of the situation. In effect, Mr. Dinkins is trying to squeeze back into a bottle the genie he let loose a year ago by granting a substantial raise to the teachers' union just as the depth of the city's fiscal problems was becoming apparent.
Negotiations with the P.B.A., one of the city's most powerful unions, were thrown into arbitration after the union and city could not agree on a new settlement. Like other uniformed services, the police have traditionally won wage settlements higher than other municipal employees, and its settlement could set a pattern for firefighters, correction officers and sanitation workers.
 
'Precarious at Best'
 "If our fiscal integrity is compromised even to the smallest degree, then our ability to meet the needs of our people in public safety and in all areas is compromised as well," Mr. Dinkins said in remarks released after the closed hearing. "It is no secret that our economic situation remains precarious at best."
The police have sought a raise comparable to the 5.5 percent wage increase Mr. Dinkins granted to teachers. But the city contends it cannot afford that, since much of the teacher raise was financed by changing earnings calculations for its union's pension fund, allowing the city to reduce its annual contribution to the fund and use the money for raises instead. Over the years, the police pension fund has been invested differently and its union has regularly drawn from it to supplement wages and it could not produce as much extra money now.
The city says it is prepared to give the police a 1.5 percent raise in each of two fiscal years, for a total of 3 percent directly from the city budget (as it did for other unions this year), and about another percentage point from pension recalculations. But it says anything above that must come from concessions by the union, such as changes in salary step-ups based on seniority or a reduction in the amount of "wash-up" time allowed.
The union contends that it deserves bigger raises to stay competitive with officers in Nassau County, who can earn nearly $10,000 more a year than officers in New York City can earn. Keeping teachers' salaries competitive with the surrounding region was one of the Mayor's chief reasons for granting them raises last year.
Joseph Mancini, a spokesman for the P.B.A., said he had no comment on the Mayor's testimony, but he repeated the union's contention that it deserved competitive wages, the city's fiscal problems notwithstanding.
Before the talks went to arbitration, the city had relatively little leverage over the police union, since the Mayor's ambitious anti-crime plan means that the city is continuing to hire thousands of officers, while laying off other employees. So the police had little incentive to make concessions.
Yesterday, the Mayor repeated that he would lay off no police officers, whose union chose to endorse no one in the 1989 mayoral race rather than support him. That is a pledge he has been unable to make to unions that did support him.
Arbitration is unpredictable, but generally gives great weight to past practice and patterns set in bargaining with other unions. The current situation is especially complicated, because the raises granted to other unions have come from a variety of sources and because the police are not comparably situated. But experts said the police also have a strong case that they are entitled to raises comparable to those given other unions.
Mr. Dinkins said the arbitration panel could not ask the city "to spend money we don't have."

HEADLINE: MIDEAST DIPLOMACY;
Bluegrass Supporting Bush on Israel

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOREHEAD, Ky., Sept. 21

 BODY:
Jobs, tobacco and taxes are the essence of Bluegrass politics, but when Representative Larry J. Hopkins brought his longshot Republican gubernatorial campaign here this weekend, he tested a new issue: the proposed $10 billion in loan guarantees for Israel.
Speaking before a sparsely attended fund-raiser, Mr. Hopkins hinted that he would support President Bush's request that Congress delay consideration of the loan guarantees. Such a position is an expression of his own opposition to all foreign assistance programs. 
 "I can tell you that in 14 years I haven't voted for a single foreign aid bill yet," he said. "Why? I think we have to help our people first."
Afterward, Republicans at the fund-raiser expressed enthusiasm for Mr. Hopkins's position.
"We need to solve problems here, and we shouldn't use our money as a means for keeping peace in the world," said Terry LeMaster, a 37-year-old construction contractor. "We shouldn't buy off allies."
 
Israel 'Must Follow Suit'
 John O'Cull, a 35-year-old dentist, said. "The Israelis have to follow suit with our demands before we give them the money."
The loan guarantees, meant to help Israel house and otherwise accommodate its flood of Soviet Jewish emigres, are controversial because the issue is linked in the minds of many with the Israeli policy of building Jewish settlements in the occupied territories.
The Bush Administration, which opposes the settlements policy, argues that Congressional consideration of the loan guarantees now would jeopardize Arab participation in a proposed Arab-Israeli peace conference scheduled for October. Pro-Israel organizations and Israel's many supporters in Congress contend that the loan guarantees are a strictly humanitarian issue and that the proposed 120-day delay of the matter would only weaken Israel's bargaining position at peace talks.
Here in Kentucky, the issue has touched a raw nerve for a different reason. The loan guarantees package is commonly viewed in the populist terms of helping America first, even though no money from the Federal Treasury need ever be spent; Washington would only be guaranteeing $10 billion in commercial loans to Israel over the next five years, a step that gives Israel the advantage of lower interest rates.
 
Support for Bush Stand
 In dozens of interviews in small towns around the state, Kentuckians indicated that there is resounding support for Mr. Bush's request for a delay. The interviews suggest that whatever political damage the President may suffer with American Jews may be neutralized in areas of the country where there are few Jews.
The Kentucky public's apparent sentiment against the loan guarantees seems to have helped persuade several of the state's members of Congress, including its two traditionally pro-Israel senators, to remain largely silent on the issue.
"What the drumbeat is about is a $10 billion donation for Israel, but once people understand that we're only co-signing a note, I think you'll find some softening," said Senator Wendell H. Ford on a flight to Kentucky for a weekend of parades. As the Democratic whip, Mr. Ford would be expected to be a crucial player in opposing the President and in overriding a possible veto of legislation including the loan guarantees.
But Mr. Ford, who is up for re-election in 1992 and remains undecided, said, "This is an issue you have to explain, and my dad used to say never cast a vote you have to explain."
Kentucky's Republican Senator, Mitch McConnell, who is publicly undecided and quietly trying to forge a compromise between the White House and other pro-Israel Senators, called himself "the man in the middle." On the one hand, Mr. McConnell's traditional support for Israel drew more than $120,000 in campaign contributions from Jewish interest groups last year, more than any other Republican Senator attracted for the 1990 campaign. On the other hand, he is one of the Senate's strongest promoters of Mr. Bush's foreign policy.
 
'Better Way to Go' Unclear
 "You can make a persuasive argument on this issue either way," Mr. McConnell said. "It's not clear strategically which is the better way to go."
Noting that less than 1 percent of the Kentucky population is Jewish, he added, "If you were going to make a purely political decision on this, you'd have to go with Bush."
While Mr. McConnell was attending Hopkins fund-raisers around this state on Saturday, a reporter's conversations with more than 30 people elicited only two responses unequivocally supporting the Israeli position.
As he watched Mr. McConnell crown this year's queen at the Harrodsburg Horse Show, Gary Gibson, a 39-year-old plumbing factory worker, said, "I feel Israel ought to get whatever it needs."
As a Baptist, Mr. Gibson said he believed that "the United States is based on being a God-fearing country," adding, "So if we're willing to help all those heathen people, we should help Israel, where Jesus Christ came from."
 
2 Reasons for Opposition
 But the overwhelming majority of those interviewed were divided between those who said the Government should spend more money on creating jobs at home and less on foreign aid and others who said Mr. Bush's judgment on foreign affairs was superior to that of Congress.
Several people mistakenly thought that the credit guarantee was an outright grant. But even when their misconception was corrected, they said they feared that the United States would have to pick up the tab eventually anyway.
A typical remark was made by Sherry Keller, a 29-yar-old Morehead grocery store owner, who said: "We ought to see how the peace conference works out before we give away our money. But still, you have no guarantee you'll ever get the money back."
Roger Moore, a 38-year-old unemployed Morehead geologist and a Democrat, said he would vote against Mr. Ford next year if he voted for the Israeli loan guarantees.
"I wouldn't send it at all," he said. "We already have loan guarantees around the world, and we might as well write them all off. I believe Kentucky could use the $10 billion a lot better."
 
Several Are Knowledgeable
 While some of those interviewed had only a vague idea of the issue, several people spoke about the subject knowledgeably and said it came up in conversations at home and at work. Several said they valued Israel as an important ally, but believed that this was no time for the United States to expose itself to more debt.
At the Black Gold Festival in the southeastern town of Hazard, the weak coal economy seemed to sharpen negative sentiments toward the loan guarantees.
Charles Reynolds, a 52-year-old mine worker, said the issue of the loan guarantees came up in a discussion last week among his crew while they were laying some track for transporting coal out of their mine.
"I think a lot of people here care about foreign aid," he said. "People wouldn't be against foreign aid if their needs were met."
A 47-year-old mine worker, who would identify himself only as A.J., said: "We have real hunger in the United States, and here in eastern Kentucky we have high unemployment right now. If anybody needs help, we ought to help them, but you have to help your people first."

HEADLINE: U.S. Could Cut Defense Spending By More Than 33%, Report Says

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 23

 BODY:
An authoritative study of American defense needs by the Brookings Institution concludes that the United States can reduce military spending by more than a third over the next 10 years and still maintain the world's preeminent military establishment capable of dealing with any likely emergency in the post-cold war era.
The Brookings Institution estimates that cumulative savings of $316 billion to $619 billion could be realized. 
 The study, which will be published later this month, challenges the Pentagon's assessment of future military threats as unrealistic. It says the Pentagon's assumptions about war-fighting strategies and the need for more sophisticated weapons will mean that the military budget will begin to swell again by mid-decade after being on a downward path since 1985.
"The view from the Pentagon is of a scaled-down version of the cold war," the study says.
 
A Critical Outside Review
 The 80-page document, co-written by Dr. William W. Kaufmann, professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and John D. Steinbruner, who heads Brookings's Foreign Policy Studies Program, is the most extensive and critical outside review to date of the Bush Administration's military strategy and spending plans for the rest of the decade. As such, it is likely to provide ammunition in a Congressional debate that has already begun over how to divide the Government's resources better between military expenses and domestic programs.
Challenging the five-year, $1.2-trillion military spending plan submitted last year by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, the study argues that the Pentagon sought to pre-empt Presidential decision making by categorically defining the absolute minimum level of national risk -- and therefore spending -- that the country should accept.
Defense Department officials said they had not seen the study but expressed strong reservations when told of its recommendations. Since the abortive coup in the Soviet Union, Mr. Cheney has been particularly sensitive to calls for speeding up the pace of cuts in the military budget.
"I think a little caution is in order before we automatically assume, based on one week's news, that we can now dismantle our own defenses," Mr. Cheney said recently.
The study suggests, among other things, that traditional definitions of military threat, American national security interests and military spending should be adjusted in a way that places more emphasis on economic power in a world where the probabilities of major conflicts involving the United States are seen by many as substantially reduced by the end of the cold war.
"The future ability of the United States to maintain the conditions of its security will depend as much on its moral authority, diplomatic skills, and economic assets as on its military capabilities," the study asserts.
It also recommends that the United States seek to engage potential adversaries and competitors in cooperative security ventures to minimize the risk of sudden military conflict.
"With regard to the Soviet Union in particular, the U.S. military would have to subordinate traditional objectives of deterrence and containment to the strategic principle of cooperative engagement that was successfully used with the German and Japanese military establishments following World War II," the study recommends.
The study was commissioned at the outset of 1991, and its major conclusions were drawn before the new and more sweeping changes in the Soviet Union that followed last month's attempted coup against Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. But Dr. Kaufmann, adviser to a number of secretaries of defense during the cold war era, said the changes in the Soviet Union only deepened his conviction that greater reductions in military spending could safely be made.
The study formulates a plan it calls the "low option," defining future American forces that would be adequate to protect American interests while shifting resources to other parts of the economy. By projecting a moderately lower level of risk, the plan envisions spending $2.2 trillion over the next decade. It says that Mr. Cheney's spending plans would cost a minimum $316 billion more, and as much as $619 billion more if the production costs of a new generation of high technology weapons balloon as predicted by the Congressional Budget Office.
Noting that these weapons were based on assumptions of Soviet threats that now seem far less likely, backers of the low option estimate that $50 billion could be safely cut from military spending from now to 1996 by freezing many of those weapons in the "advanced development" stage.

HEADLINE: Duke Softens Past in Louisiana Race

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: COVINGTON, La., Sept. 20

 BODY:
First came the warnings. State Representative David Duke told a crowd of supporters gathered in a rural meeting hall here that their way of life was threatened by racial quotas and welfare babies.
Then Mr. Duke, a 41-year-old former grand wizard of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, promised that if he was elected governor he would save Louisiana by giving poor blacks his own version of "tough love." 
 With a month to go before the voting in Louisiana's open primary, Mr. Duke's past has not emerged as a major issue in the campaign. Poll takers, political analysts and even aides to rival candidates agree that Mr. Duke has succeeded in presenting himself as a legitimate candidate for governor, and he is widely credited with putting his message into language that has a potentially broad appeal among white voters.
With public opinion polls showing that he has a fair chance to win a place in a runoff, Mr. Duke has become the wild card in an election that will provide this year's most prominent test of racial issues in American politics.
 
Appeal to Racial Identity
 Although much of his message is framed in terms of budget cuts and changes in the welfare system, Mr. Duke still makes a direct appeal to his supporters' racial identity.
"If you are white these days you are a second-class citizen in your own country," Mr. Duke said at his rally here on the shore of Lake Pontchartrain, drawing loud applause.
Within the next 10 days both President Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle are scheduled to campaign in Louisiana for the incumbent, Buddy Roemer. The Governor was wooed by the White House last spring when he switched parties and became the Republicans' prize catch to date in their long effort to convert Democratic officeholders in Southern states.
The other major contender for a spot in the runoff is a populist Democrat, Edwin W. Edwards, who previously won three terms as governor with strong support from black voters and is now trying to rally his party's traditional constituencies.
The operatic qualities of Louisiana politics, with larger-than-life personalities and melodramatic plots, are reinforced by the state's election laws. All candidates regardless of party affiliation appear on the same ballot in an open primary, which will be held on Oct. 19 this year. If no one wins a majority, the top two candidates will meet in a runoff on Nov. 16.
 
'A Very Dicey Contest'
 "It is virtually a three-way race and it is certainly a very dicey contest for second place," said Edward Renwick, of the Loyola University Institute of Politics.
The race is further complicated by the candidacy of United States Representative Clyde C. Holloway, who has the endorsement of the state Republican Party. Mr. Roemer did not seek the endoresement. Nor did Mr. Duke, who calls himself a Republican even though he has been disavowed by both the state and national party organizations.
In a poll made public last week by the Loyola institute for several Louisiana television stations, Mr. Renwick found that Mr. Roemer was preferred by 26 percent of the electorate, Mr. Edwards by 25 percent, Mr. Duke by 10 percent and Mr. Holloway by 9 percent. The poll of 750 registered voters had a margin of sampling error of nearly four percent.
But taking into account what has come to be known as Mr. Duke's "hidden vote" -- people unwilling to admit their preference for him except in the privacy of the voting booth -- Mr. Renwick recalculated Mr. Duke's share at 25 percent.
This hidden vote came out massively for Mr. Duke last year in his unsuccessful effort to unseat Louisians's senior Senator, J. Bennett Johnston, a Democrat who has been an influential voice on Capitol Hill for 20 years.
Just days before the election, public opinion polls were predicting that Mr. Duke would win from 20 to 30 percent of the vote. His actual total was 44 percent, including about 58 percent of the white vote.
 
Duke Attracts Protest Vote
 Charles and Sandra Wagoner are examples of Mr. Duke's hidden vote. Mr. Wagoner is a 29-year-old economist, and Mrs. Wagoner, 30, is a paralegal. They concede they are uncomfortable with Mr. Duke's involvement with the Klan and with several of his positions on specific issues.
But they came to Mr. Duke's rally here because, as Mrs. Wagoner put it, "He strikes a very sympathetic chord in those of us who are working to death, who are taxed to death and don't see much for it."
Mr. Wagoner said, "There is a protest vote out there of people who will go for Duke in the end because even if they don't like everything he stands for, they are even more unhappy with the way things are going."
A major factor in determining the size of the hidden vote this year is Mr. Duke's apparent ability to overcome the less savory aspect of his past.
In last year's Senate race the electorate was constantly reminded of Mr. Duke's past as a Klansman and a neo-Nazi by the news media and by Senator Johnston's television advertisements. This year, for the first time in his political career, Mr. Duke's past is rarely mentioned.
For example, Mr. Duke appeared before a political science class at the University of New Orleans this week and took several hostile questions from students on issues like his proposal to give welfare mothers cash payments if they agree to be implanted with long-term contraceptives. But no student ever referred to his past.
"It's been gone over and over and now it's old news, said Alan T. Leonhard, the professor who taught the class. "People in Louisiana are used to him. The shock value has worn off."
Douglas Rose, a professor of political science at Tulane University, said: "Duke is now following a relatively well-trod Republican trail. He is saying some things we've heard from George Bush and certainly from Jesse Helms," the Republican Senator from North Carolina.
In his campaign appearances Mr. Duke bemoans excessive government spending and rising taxes. He also deplores crime, drug trafficking and the high costs of welfare. He frequently stresses the charge that affirmative action programs are unfair to whites.
 
Drawing a Battle Line
 Like other politicians who raise the same issues, Mr. Duke refrains from outright appeals to racism. But he is more explicit than others in drawing a battle line between his constituents, white voters, and his scapegoats, poor blacks, who are blamed for everything from rising crime to rising taxes.
"The rising welfare underclass is taking more and more from the working class," he says. "They are overwhelming us."
Mr. Duke was on his home ground in Covington, a community about 40 miles north of downtown New Orleans. Addressing an all-white crowd, he said, "It is time to reform the liberal welfare system because it is not helping the poor escape poverty, and it's not helping the people who are paying for it."
Then, in tones heavily laden with sympathy, he added: "We have not helped these people by giving them our money. We have not been very Christian. I want to help them."
 
'It's Called Tough Love'
 Mr. Duke, who is divorced, compares welfare recipients to his teen-age daughters, saying it would be wrong to give them everything they want. "It's called tough love," he said.
In an interview, Mr. Duke said he has had a change of heart. "I used to blame minorities for a lot of the conditions in their communities," he said. "Now I blame the liberal social welfare system for creating those conditions, and I feel sorry for the people."
But he cautions against making too much of this change.
"I have not given up the basic conservative values I started out with," the candidate said. "I've become more moderate, but I'm not afraid to say I believe in white rights. I do say that because I believe in protecting our nation's western, Christian culture, but now I can also say I believe in black rights, in equal rights for all."

HEADLINE: PERU CHIEF'S VISIT HELPS AID CHANCES

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

 BODY:
A visit to Washington last week by President Alberto Fujimori of Peru has started the wheels turning in Congress for a compromise in which Peru would receive $94.9 million in military and economic aid that has been blocked because of human rights abuses.
Congressional aides said yesterday that it now seemed likely that Peru would receive all of the $60 million in economic aid that had been requested by the Bush Administration and most, if not all, of $34.9 million in military assistance. 
 "Clearly, the visit helped Peru's case," one aide said. "People came away from meetings with Fujimori feeling he wants to help Peru and that he's trustworthy."
Mr. Fujimori, who returned to Peru on Friday, told the legislators that he would provide access for civilian prosecutors and representatives of the International Red Cross to military and police detention centers where many tortures and rapes have been reported.
 
Meeting Coca Farmers
 He also said he had been meeting with Peruvian coca farmers, who produce 60 percent of the raw material for the cocaine that reaches the United States, to help them switch to other crops.
Representative Robert G. Torrecelli, Democrat of New Jersey, and five other congressmen who had been among the leading opponents of the aid package are proposing that the money be released in three stages based on progress in improving the human rights situation and in countering cocaine production and trafficking.
Mr. Torrecelli said he remarked in his meeting with Mr. Fujimori that Peru was "a nation facing an almost complete security, economic and health collapse" and that "some different standards need to be applied for our own interests."
About 80 percent of Peru's work force is unemployed or underemployed, a third of the country is malnourished, the Shining Path guerrilla movement is terrorizing the highlands and many of the cities, and a Latin American cholera epidemic has hit Peru the hardest of any country, with 240,000 reported cases.
Most of the $60 million in economic aid is to be used to help Peru meet payments on its $23 billion foreign debt, which must be made to keep new loans and other aid flowing. Approval of the economic aid will also permit Peru to spend $50 million in Peruvian currency from a joint United States-Peruvian fund for several projects aimed at the country's 250,000 coca growers.
 
Uses of Military Aid
 The military aid is to be used for equipment and for sending up to 50 United States military advisers to serve as trainers in noncombat zones.
The Inter-American Development Bank announced during Mr. Fujimori's visit that it was giving Peru a loan of $425 million. A special Japanese fund that is administered by the bank added $4 million more.
Mr. Fujimori, a former college rector with no previous political experience, impressed the legislators as well as business people and diplomats he addressed at a luncheon of the Americas Society in New York "with his sincerity and willingness to deal with problems that concern us," a senior congressional aide said.
"He represents a real balance between the legitimate interests of the United States and his own people," Mr. Torrecelli said.
Part of Mr. Fujimori's appeal to Americans is his contrast to his predecessor, Alan Garcia, who often attacked the United States, led a rebellion in Latin America against payment of foreign debt and largely ignored Peru's prominence in the supply chain for cocaine.
Mr. Fujimori said he believed that his best chance of success against cocaine production lay in a total reorganization of Peru's economic structure, which, among other things, would give the country's coca growers land titles, access to credit and means of getting alternative crops to market.
After a meeting at the White House, President Bush said Mr. Fujimori had "made progress" on human rights.
Juan Mendez, the executive director of Americas Watch, a human rights group that monitors Peru, said Mr. Fujimori had outlined "a policy that is to be implemented in the future, and some elements are very postive." He added, "But this doesn't by itself constitute progress right now."
Representative Charles B. Rangel, the New York Democrat who heads the House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control, said he expected the aid package to be approved shortly, adding, "It is imperative that we go forward because we are asking Peru to do a lot, and we need to follow through on our commitment."

Question on Jobless Bill: Can It Survive a Veto?

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 23

 BODY:
Sometime in the next week or so, Congress will almost certainly send President Bush a Democratic bill that would spend about $6 billion to help 3 million people who have been out of work for at least half a year.
Before then, Republicans will denounce the bill as a "budget buster," as President Bush did in killing a similar measure last month. They will say, as Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader, said Friday that the Democrats are more interested in an issue than in helping the unemployed with as many as 20 more weeks of jobless benefits. 
 The Democrats will say that opposition to this bill shows that Republicans care more about Kurds or Bangladeshis, for whom Mr. Bush has approved deficit-busting spending, than about Americans.
The issue will probably come down to whether Congress can override a Bush veto for the first time. The votes seem to be there in the House. In the Senate, Mr. Dole predicts that Mr. Bush can be upheld. But he is supposed to say that, and the question will be just how many Republicans facing re-election in suffering states vote to override.
If Mr. Dole is wrong, the long-term jobless will get the benefits. If he is correct, the Democrats will have an issue. Indeed, one lawmaker deeply involved with the bill said he hoped Mr. Bush signed it so the unemployed would be sure to get the money, but if that did not happen, "I wouldn't mind having the issue."
This partisan tangle raises several questions about the way Congress and the White House do business.
The Republicans raise one of them: If this is an "emergency," as the Democrats insist, why did they wait to force the issue until more than a year after the recession began?
Republicans criticize the Democrats for waiting this long, and Richard G. Darman, Mr. Bush's budget director, insists the extra benefits are unnecessary because the recession is over. Put forth by the Republicans, that is just a debating point; they would have opposed the bill with as much energy in April as now.
In late April, House Democrats were ready to try to pass a bill, even if it let Republicans label them as big spenders. But so tentative was their commitment that when the April unemployment totals dipped, they backed off --although the decline was recognized as a statistical quirk and although some 300,000 people a month continued to exhaust their benefits.
That fear of a "tax and spend" label caused most Democrats' refusal, last week, to vote to offer Mr. Bush a choice between a higher deficit now or higher employers' taxes in 1993.
Democrats did bring the issue to the floor in mid-summer, fearing to look especially foolish if they went on vacation without doing anything. But they sent Mr. Bush a bill he killed with minimum risk, because he could sign it to assert his sympathy for the jobless and then refuse to declare the emergency required to increase the deficit under the 1990 budget act. That declaration was required to release the money. The same approach is in the Senate bill this time, but it is expected to be dropped in conference with the House, so that Mr. Bush would be sent a bill that specifically waives the budget act and which he must sign or veto.
An equally serious question is why neither side is trying to reach a compromise. Mr. Dole, who thinks being against the unemployed is bad politics, has an alternative -- a bill that would help fewer jobless for shorter periods of time. It would cost much less, and it would be paid for, not by raising the deficit, but by auctioning off unused radio frequencies and tightening student loan repayments. Mr. Bush said today that he wanted the Dole bill. But there are too many Democrats for it to have a chance.
Yet if both sides wanted to, they could cut a deal. For the Democrats, dealing now would impose two high costs. One would be that they would give up their best chance yet of overriding a Bush veto. And the consequence would be giving the unemployed less than they have promised.
For the Republicans and Mr. Bush, dealing now might invite other attempts to bypass the budget agreement for domestic spending. For the President, even the Dole bill is a step away from insisting that there was no real economic problem out there.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Meet With Major Health Insurers

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 23

 BODY:
The Bush Administration announced today that it would bring together major insurers for a meeting to find ways to reduce administrative costs in the nation's health care system.
But Louis W. Sullivan, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, said that while some savings could be achieved by streamlining administrative costs, recent studies showing large savings were unrealistic. 
 Some studies have shown administrative costs account for at least 20 percent of the more than $600 billion spent annually in the United States on health care.
"We think these studies are flawed and that the public is being misled," Dr. Sullivan said in a speech at a health care conference. "Nevertheless, we do believe an examination of administrative burdens is long overdue."
 
Bush to Get Recommendations
 The Secretary, who said the meeting would be held "in the next month or so," has been conducting a study of the problems in the nation's health care system and is to recommend to President Bush changes to improve access to care and to reduce the costs of medical care.
He has proposed no major changes. He has said he favors continuing the current system, which includes public and private insurance coverage.
In his speech today Dr. Sullivan criticized the "play-or-pay" approach supported by many Democrats in which employers would be required to provide health coverage for their workers or pay to support a public program. He also repeated his opposition to a centrally run national health care system.
He said these proposals would accelerate health care inflation, hinder competition and innovation and would lead to rationing and waiting lists for care. Instead, the Secretary said, the most practical options include making health insurance more affordable for small businesses and increasing the use of managed care.
Dr. Sullivan's remarks were criticized by Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th, Democrat of West Virginia and chairman of a commission named for former Representative Claude Pepper of Florida, which has recommended broad changes in health care, including a national insurance system.
"Unfortunately, the Secretary's speech indicates that Administration officials have done little more than read the Pepper Commission's table of contents and pull out a few isolated ideas -- outcomes research, managed care and an expanded National Health Service Corps," Mr. Rockefeller said. "Had they read further, they would understand that to give Americans the kind of health care they want and deserve, we must implement all the interdependent ideas in the Pepper plan."

HEADLINE: Cuomo Outlines Fiscal Blueprint For Recovery of New York City

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo drew an ambitious blueprint for New York City's fiscal recovery yesterday, outlining an array of high-visibility public works projects aimed at creating tens of thousands of jobs, improving the city's long-term competitiveness and, perhaps most importantly, lifting morale.
In a speech delivered to business and civic leaders in Manhattan last night, Mr. Cuomo said his plan to build mass-transit links to the city's airports, accelerate the construction of huge housing developments and explore the potential for high-speed water ferries on the city's rivers would "help rebuild the city from the ground up, putting people to work and pumping blood into our economy."
 
Easing the Medicaid Strain
 The Governor also announced his proposal for easing the strain placed by rapidly growing Medicaid costs on the budgets of New York City and other local governments. Under his plan, which was first reported on Sunday, the state would assume the local share of Medicaid costs while taking some of the taxing authority now held by the city and county governments. 
 Whether the third-term Governor is being driven most by a desire to secure his place in New York history or by the need to preserve his national reputation, he clearly has decided to become more of a protagonist in the city's fiscal drama. It is a high-risk strategy, for as Mr. Cuomo becomes more closely associated with the struggle for fiscal recovery, his political future will increasingly be linked to its success or failure.
Elements of Mr. Cuomo's public works blueprint were brand new, while others were resurrections of dormant projects or accelerations of work already in motion. Because many of his proposals would require approval by the Legislature or by state authorities, their success is not guaranteed.
But the Governor suggested that it was vital to create the perception, both inside and outside the city, that momentum was being generated.
"Every hour we spend on this is time we don't have to spend being defensive," he told an audience of about 80 people, including Mayor David N. Dinkins, City Council President Andrew J. Stein, City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Assembly Speaker Mel Miller. "The psychology of it is very important. We haven't had a whole lot of things to grab hold of."
Unlike the city's last fiscal crisis in 1975, Mr. Cuomo said, the city's current plight must give birth to a more lasting recovery. He also said the city and the state must seek a more activist approach to ending the recession than the Federal Government. "While Washington chooses to offer up prayers to the cyclical god of the economy, which appears to be all they're doing, we must choose to act," he said.
Those listening to Mr. Cuomo seemed to embrace his speech warmly. "This is a statement to people who say New York has no future that New York City has a grand and glorious future," Mr. Dinkins said.
 
A High-Tech Slide Show
 Mr. Cuomo unveiled his plans at a dinner sponsored by the New York City Partnership on the 50th floor of the Equitable Life Assurance headquarters in midtown. Against the backdrop of tall arched windows that presented a stunning view of the city skyline, he spoke for about an hour and illustrated his plan with a high-tech slide show.
The dinner was closed to the press, but Mr. Cuomo's office released a copy of his text. He is to repeat the presentation at a breakfast meeting today.
The public and private cost of the projects he outlined would total $7 billion, according to the Governor's office, but the state's actual investment would be only a fraction of that amount. The Governor said the projects would create 54,000 construction jobs and 25,000 permanent jobs and would generate an estimated $8.2 billion in economic activity by the turn of the century.
While the prospect of 54,000 new construction jobs sounds enticing on its face, many of those jobs would most likely be filled by people who had previously lost jobs. As of August, the city's construction industry employed about 100,000 people. But that was 13,000 fewer than one year earlier, and without new spending, analysts had been expecting the industry to lose 10,000 to 15,000 more in 1992.
So as much as half of that 54,000 could be replacement jobs, rather than new jobs added to the economy. Still, economists figure that with the $40,000 to $50,000 in average income that would come to those 54,000 people, their spending would, in turn, generate another 27,000 jobs.
Among the public works projects proposed by Mr. Cuomo were these:
*The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey would spend $1.6 billion to build automated people movers, a form of light rail, to connect the airports with mass-transit stations in Queens. They would travel above ground in the medians of the Van Wyck Expressway and Grand Central Parkway, linking La Guardia Airport to the Sunnyside subway station and Kennedy International Airport to the Long Island Rail Road's Jamaica station. The money would be generated by a new $3 fee imposed on passengers departing from the city's airports.
*As part of a five-year, $10 billion capital plan proposed by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, new money would be dedicated to renovation of Grand Central and Pennsylvania stations. In addition, the authority would begin construction on a subway line that would link the Queens Boulevard line to the 63d Street line.
*Design work would start anew for a Second Avenue subway line on Manhattan's East Side, which was started and abandoned more than 20 years ago, and the possibility of a new East River transit crossing between Manhattan and the Bronx would be explored.
*Money from the state and Port Authority would rejuvenate construction of a 1.8-mile freight rail connector at Oak Point in the Bronx. It would enable modern freight cars to roll from the Bronx through Queens to Long Island.
*A new subsidiary of the state's Urban Development Corporation would be formed to generate financing for a huge development of housing, office buildings and commercial space at Hunters Point in Queens. The project would be similar in scope and structure to the successful Battery Park City project in lower Manhattan.
*State funds would be used to study the feasibility of moving an 18-block stretch of the West Side Highway inland in an effort to "jump start" the Riverside South development.
Mr. Cuomo's also suggested how the city should use up to $1 billion that may be generated from a proposed refinancing of Municipal Assistance Corporation bonds. Mr. Cuomo said some of the money should be used to create a tax stabilization reserve fund to help the city in times of fiscal emergencies.

HEADLINE: Crack Hits Chicago, Along With a Wave of Killing

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Sept. 23

 BODY:
For most of the 1980's, street gangs kept crack out of Chicago, fearing that it could open the way for small dealers to challenge their control of the drug trade. Now crack has arrived and those same gangs are warring over territory.
With the eruption of the same kind of turf wars that marked the arrival of crack in Washington and elsewhere, 1991 is shaping into the deadliest year in Chicago history, surpassing the rate during the bloody years of the Al Capone era and even the record year of 1974, when 970 residents were killed. 
 By the end of August, Chicago had recorded 623 murders, as against 593 by that date in 1974. The city declared last month the deadliest ever with 120 killings, more than the previous record of 117 in November 1974. As of today, the 1991 toll is 686.
"It's out of control," said Frances Sandoval, president of the Chicago chapter of Mothers Against Gangs, a support and advocacy group. "People are in agony. People are being held hostage in their own neighborhoods. One mother said to me: 'What do we have to do? Do we have to get on our knees to stop this?' "
The problem has pitted alderman against alderman and community leaders against the police superintendent. It has touched off neighborhood marches and candlelight vigils and even prompted Mayor Richard M. Daley, out of frustration after a security guard was killed in sniper fire at a public housing project last month, to liken Chicago to Colombia.
"It's becoming much more violent," Mayor Daley told reporters recently. "It's becoming like Colombia. That's what it is."
The Mayor has also gotten political heat over the killings, partly because of his unfulfilled campaign promise last spring to hire 600 police officers.
 
South Side Hit Hard
 Unlike drug distribution networks in New York, Washington and other cities with fairly diffuse trafficking systems, the network in Chicago has traditionally been tightly run by a group of major street gangs who enjoyed a longstanding monopoly on drug sales and were not inclined to introduce or -- allow anyone else to introduce -- a volatile new product they could not easily control, criminologists say.
"Everybody had their share of the market and there was just not room for entrepreneurs to get in like in New York," said Dr. Jeffrey Fagan, an associate professor of criminal justice at Rutgers University, who has studied the evolution of crack in this country. "Distributors acted like every other business and kept out the product. The fear in Chicago was that once the taste got out, it would be extremely difficult to control."
The pact between street gangs, whether formal or tacit, made it more difficult for small-time outsiders to infiltrate the market with crack, a drug that lends itself to independent sales because customers make more frequent purchases of smaller amounts than they do with other drugs. But the agreement did not keep it out for good. No one is certain who was the first to bring crack into Chicago, but now that it has arrived, distributors large and small are angling for their slice.
 
'More Active Market'
 "What this did was create a more active market," said Ronald Allen, a professor of law at Northwestern University. "There is more money changing hands. Dealers want to get in on the market and want to get a bigger share of the market. But rather than cutting prices and putting out a better product, they kill each other."
The violence is taking its greatest toll on the South Side community of Englewood, a jumble of worn two-family apartment buildings and burned out apartment buildings, where 71 people have been killed so far this year, higher than the annual murder toll in many American cities.
There, 40 percent of all homicides are tied to drugs or gangs and the percentage of drug arrests at which crack is confiscated has gone from zero to 70 percent in two years, said Comdr. Ron Watson of the city's Seventh District.
The city deployed 100 additional police officers to Englewood over the summer, and it seems even now that every other car on Halsted or Racine Avenues is a police cruiser. The police have made 3,000 arrests since early August and confiscated 379 guns. Still, residents say they are afraid to go out after dusk or dawdle on street corners.
"No way, shape or form do I go out at night," said Andrew Allen, a retired postal worker and longtime resident. "It's the worst I've ever seen it. Just going out at night to get something, I can't tell you when I last did that. If I ain't got it by nightfall, I don't get it."
Residents who had only read about crack or watched movies about it are now living the nightmare themselves. They are adjusting to sight of discarded crack vials and ominous gatherings of drug buyers and sellers on street corners.
"We're at the zenith of this murder situation," said Cecil Davis, who coordinates citizen patrols in Englewood. "People are worried about who's next and 'How close is it going to be to me?' "
People have become so afraid that it has become difficult to get them to report what they see.
James O. Stampley, executive director of the Englewood Economic Development Corporation, a local civic group, said he and others had watched helplessly as more and more fellow residents were robbed on buses or otherwise victimized by the violence.
"We were afraid to open our mouths," Mr. Stampley said. "You're dumbfounded. You're numb."
At the core of much of the violence is the new and expanding market for the highly addictive drug here and and the turf wars it has set off, community leaders and several ranking members of the Police Department said.
The headlines and handwringing have produced a minor political crisis for Mayor Daley, who promised to hire 600 police officers during his election campaign last spring. But the officers have not yet materialized, the mayor's office has said, because of delays created by a change in the entrance examination for police recruits. Still, aldermen whose wards have been hardest hit are blaming the Mayor for inaction.
The Mayor has deflected such criticism by saying that the real problem is the failure courts to put criminals away and the failure of the Federal Government to stop drugs from entering the country in the first place.
The Mayor is promising new police officers by November. But LeRoy Martin, the police superintendent who has been the focus of the most vehement criticism in the crisis, has said that with the proliferation of guns and a gang culture, that new police recruits may not be enough.
"You can give me 2,000 police officers," he said at a City Council hearing last week, "and you can see them walking and talking. But until you start addressing the root causes, we'll be living with this high crime."

HEADLINE: Cosmetic Surgeons Seek New Frontiers

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
To camouflage her skinny calves, the 30-year-old film producer from southern California always wore long skirts and "felt like a freak" when she played tennis or ran. For years, she lifted weights to improve the contour of her legs, to no avail.
"Doctors told me it's just the way your muscle is formed," she said in a recent telephone interview. "But I was always self-conscious. I thought someday they're going to develop some way to help this." 
 A year ago, someday arrived.
At a Beverly Hills Clinic, a plastic surgeon made a tiny incision behind each of her knees and slipped silicone implants into her calves. "My mother said, 'Oh God, do you have to do it?' " the woman said. "But it's great. I've been really pleased."
Welcome to the frontiers of cosmetic surgery. To achieve the ideal form, a growing number of patients are undergoing implants to enlarge their calves, chests and even buttocks; they have liposuction to siphon fat from their cheeks or necks, and they get lips plumped up with tissue borrowed from their own scars.
Although face lifts were once the province of older women, cosmetic surgeons say there has been a huge increase in patients from 35 to 45. "Ten years ago, surgeons used to think it was frivolous to operate on people under 50," said Dr. Ronald Iverson, chairman of the public information committee of the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons. "Part of the change has been induced by better results, but mainly it's what people want."
Men, too, are demanding equal time, seeking younger faces, bigger chests and "correction" of cleft chins. One plastic surgeon tells of a man who, envious of a spouse's breast augmentation, demanded a new set of pectorals to keep pace. Next month's edition of the series Clinics of Plastic Surgery is devoted to cosmetic surgery for men, and Dr. Brian Novack, a plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills who estimates that 65 percent of his patients are male, predicts that half of all patients will someday be men; the current figure is slightly over 10 percent.
"It's a big change to see good-looking guys in their 40's asking for face lifts," said Dr. Fritz E. Barton, a professor of plastic surgery at the University of Texas Southwest Medical Center in Dallas. "We are seeing more men, but we are also seeing more people. There used to be a stigma, but now it's just considered another method of being productive longer in life."
Although the trend is consistent all across the country, the epicenter is, of course, southern California. "It's a combination of people who are very body-conscious and a group of very interesting and innovative surgeons, and they feed off each other," said Dr. Norman Cole, the president of the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons. "Some of them are plowing new ground."
While some of the techniques, like facial liposuction, are now widely offered by plastic surgeons, others, like pectoral implants, are regarded by many with a snicker, and surgeons worry that patients seeking what are permanent changes may be overly influenced by current fashion.
"I don't pretend to understand southern Californians, but I do understand competition among plastic surgeons when there are so many plastic surgeons per square mile," said an East Coast doctor who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Patients sometimes travel to California to take advantage of the local expertise. They say the pain of surgery and its cost -- up to $5,000 for a pair of calves, rarely covered by insurance -- are well worthwhile.
But those who are less body-conscious may have a hard time believing that skinny legs can ruin a life or that women still having children should be contemplating face lifts.
The motivations of patients who seek out these most cosmetic of cosmetic operations are diverse.
 
Pressure on the Job Front
 Surgeons say that the typical implant patient is young and extremely athletic but has been unable to achieve an ideal body contour through weight lifting. In fact, pectoral implants tend to produce better results if the patient continues to exercise, since the implant sits deep under the skin and the patient's own muscle provides the skin texture.
For men and women seeking face lifts at 40, the motivation is often to look and feel a bit younger in a society that has put an increasing premium on youth. And so cosmetic surgery has flourished in the midst of a major recession.
"In a tight job market people see a face lift as an investment in their competitiveness for jobs," said Dr. Barton.
"For many people it's just another way to spend discretionary income," Dr. Iverson said. "That's unfortunate in some ways since it is surgery, with pain and potential complications."
Even among plastic surgeons, the growing popularity of implants has been a source of some concern.
Many of the implant procedures first achieved popularity in the body-building gyms of southern California in the middle of the last decade but have moved into the general population in the last two years, said Dr. Adrien Aiache, a Los Angeles surgeon who has pioneered calf implants.
In these operations, carefully sculpted solid silicone pieces are inserted under skin and sometimes muscle to enhance normally curvaceous portions of the body. Implants made of the same material have been used successfully for decades to restructure chins and are thought to be far safer than liquid silicone breast implants, which have recently come under scrutiny by the Food and Drug Administration because they can cause deforming scars and serious allergic reactions.
 
Severe Pain at First
 More than 100 buttock and pectoral implants were performed by members of the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons in 1990, the first year the society kept tallies, and close to 300 calf implants were performed. Many surgeons predict that the number will rise dramatically once more patients learn about the procedures.
The incisions are generally inconspicuous, hidden in the armpit for pectoral implants and in the crease behind the knee for calf surgery. Although some patients experience severe pain for weeks, particularly those with calf implants, once the tissue heals they say they are not aware that the implant is in place.
Patients generally work with their surgeon before the operation to express their preferences about the size and shape of a reconstructed body part, hopes that the surgeons find they frequently dash.
"Like a typical male, I wanted the biggest size," said a 49-year-old insurance executive from Pennsylvania who had calf implants two months ago. "The ones he put in were two sizes smaller. They look natural and are a much better balance with the top of my leg."
With pectoral implants, "if a person has small shoulders and arms and you build them up too much they just look silly," said Dr. Novack, who said that patients bring in surfing magazines and Calvin Klein ads. "And the implant has to fit under their normal chest muscle."
Dr. Iverson said that there was "no reason to think that these implants were not safe and effective," but noted that they had not been used for very long and that surgeons could not predict for certain how they would wear for 50 years under the skin of a 20-year-old.
 
Buttocks Data Lacking
 Some plastic surgeons are particularly worried about the calf and buttock implants, since -- unlike chins -- these areas of the body are constantly in motion with large powerful muscles sliding by. The doctors worry that movement and gravity could cause the implants to travel under the skin over time. And then, people sit on buttocks all day long, and no one knows how the implants, which provide no additional cushioning, will wear over time.
Other surgeons say that the lower leg is frequently plagued by poor circulation as the body ages, which they fear may make calf implants an ideal breeding ground for serious infections.
"I'm interested, but these haven't been used long enough by a credible number of people to know their long-term effects," said Dr. Cole. "If my son or daughter wanted them, I'd say push hard with exercise."
But, he added, it still might be a reasonable procedure if "they had done toe curls until they were blue in the face" and it hadn't helped. "If they were still self-conscious and understood that the procedure might fail and even potentially lead to scarring, then I'd say go ahead," he said.
The push to do cosmetic surgery on younger faces has met with far wider acceptance. By the age of 35, plastic surgeons say, many a face has started to sag and could benefit from some restructuring.
Face lifts on the young generally focus on different areas and involve somewhat different techniques from those performed on older people. Most faces show signs of age first around the cheeks and eyes and only later around the mouth and neck.
In the traditional face lift, loose skin is drawn back at the hairline and removed. But in the 35-to-50 crowd, surgeons more commonly beef up or otherwise meddle with the underlying bone or fat and let the skin settle back on its new frame.
 
'People Do Look Refreshed'
 They say that liposuction of fat necks or puffy cheeks creates a more tailored and rested appearance and that the placement of implants under the skin to enhance cheek bones or chins can make these relatively young patients appear even more youthful.
"We see a lot more people coming in now with minimal deformities, a subtle fullness around the jaw line rather than a real turkey gobbler," Dr. Iverson said. "It's not the dramatic change in the over-50 group, but people do look refreshed. And we believe that if you tighten the skin up early you look better than you would otherwise forever."
As testament to this wisdom, Dr. Cole noted that most plastic surgeons' wives are now having their face lifts in their early 40's.
Some surgeons have tried to perform minimalist operations for patients showing the first signs of age, filling out gaunt cheeks hollowed by age with crescent-shaped implants inserted through the mouth at the upper line of the gums. The procedure takes 45 minutes under local anesthesia and costs about a quarter as much as a typical $5,000 face lift.
Dr. Geoffrey W. Tobias, a head and neck surgeon at the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, thinks of the 45-minute procedure as a "missing link in facial surgery for people who want a more youthful look, but are not ready for a real face lift."
But others are wary of this approach. "I'm not sure I'd call it experimental, but we don't have any long-term follow up," Dr. Iverson said.
As the age of plastic surgery patients creeps downward for this and other operations, many surgeons stress that there are limits. Although about 1,000 women under the age of 18 had breast implants or liposuction in 1990, the American Society for Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons has recommended against both procedures for teen-agers.
 
The Forgotten Cary Grant
 Their adult body-fat distribution has not been established, and some women have breast development into their early 20's, Dr. Iverson said. Also, he said, because of the possible risks associated with breast implants, "we really need an adult to make an informed decision."
Experts urge patients eager to improve on an imperfect body part to avoid succumbing to fads or fashion. Patients are now calling on plastic surgeons to "correct" thin lips for women and cleft chins for men, having apparently forgotten Myrna Loy and Cary Grant.
Recently, doctors have devised numerous methods to plump up narrow mouths, most of which produce, at best, transient success. Lips injected with collagen tend to revert to their past form over time, and the substance is now under scrutiny by the Food and Drug Administration because of other undesirable side effects.
Recently, Dr. Linton Whitaker, the chief of plastic surgery at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, has reported better staying power in a small group of patients whom he treated by tunneling strips of tissue, borrowed from scars or the buttock, under the lip. He has had one patient return three times for surgery, each time wanting more pout.
"It's hard for me to believe that she's going to want those full lips when she's 70, but if people understand that this is for keeps I'll do it," Dr. Whitaker said, reflecting that 15 years ago he far more commonly treated women who wanted their lips reduced.
Patients who feel they are lacking in certain body parts must often wait until surgeons catch up with their desires. Dr. Harold M. Reed, a urologist from Bar Harbor Island, Fla., has for several years performed an operation to extend the length of the penis by about an inch; he cuts a ligament that in some men constrains the organ from attaining its full potential length. Each week he receives four or five inquiries about the operation. Some things never go out of style.

A Classical Physique Could Be Yours
Men who want their chests to resemble more ideal forms, like that of the Calvin Klein ad above, are resorting to plastic surgery. A plate of silicone can be implanted (below) to give the pectoral muscles better definition or a fuller look that offsets a protruding lower rib cage.

HEADLINE: ON HORSE RACING;
All the Stars Come Tumbling Down

BYLINE: By Joseph Durso

 BODY:
What odds would you give that Meadow Star, who won the Eclipse Award last year as the country's best juvenile filly, would run sixth in a field of seven on Saturday? Or that Lite Light, who outran Meadow Star by seven lengths in July, would run sixth in a field of seven on Sunday?
The two fillies took their artistic tumbles 1,500 miles apart, Meadow Star falling from grace in the $200,000 Ruffian Handicap at Belmont Park and Lite Light taking the plunge in the $1 million Super Derby at Louisiana Downs. 
 Remember: They were the prima donnas among fillies, the superstars, the ranking contenders for this year's championship. But now Meadow Star is a fallen star who has lost 4 of her last 6 races; Lite Light has lost her last two starts and hasn't even come close.
Nobody is trying to line them up for a match race anymore, and you wonder if anybody can win the Breeders' Cup championships in six weeks.
They are not alone, either. Strike the Gold, who won the Kentucky Derby, has lost five in a row since then. Hansel, who won the Preakness and the Belmont, lost his next two and then was retired with a torn ligament in the leg. Mane Minister, who ran third in all three races in the Triple Crown, has run once since then. And Best Pal, second in the Santa Anita Derby, second in the Kentucky Derby and first in the $1 million Pacific Classic, ran fourth in the Super Derby just when racing people were figuring that he looked like the main survivor among this year's star-crossed class of 3-year-old horses.
Other horses in other seasons have fallen by the wayside. But this year's bunch looks like horses on a merry-go-round, nobody going anywhere in particular, everybody going in circles. They are asked to make the big move into the homestretch, but they don't fire.
Things are this freakish: In the Super Derby the other day, Best Pal and Lite Light, two of the marquee stars of racing, ranking contenders for the 3-year-old championships, finished out of the money while a million-dollar race was won by a 28-to-1 longshot, a largely unknown Louisiana-bred colt named Free Spirits Joy.
"When I asked my horse to move," said Pat Valenzuela, the rider aboard Best Pal, "he moved up to them. But he couldn't get them in the last eighth of a mile."
"I asked her to run," said Corey Nakatani, the rider aboard Lite Light. "But she got tired. I got no response at the head of the lane."
John Veitch, the trainer of Alydar and other champions, sat in his box seat at Belmont Park yesterday afternoon and fielded the question: Why are they demolishing one another this year?
"This is probably an ordinary bunch of horses, that's No. 1," he said, skipping the diplomacy. "They can't cope with the pressures that all race horses feel as the year goes by: time, fatigue, injury, competition, whatever. Extraordinary horses face the same challenges, but surmount them. Forego, Kelso, Secretariat, Alydar.
"It's also more dramatic these days than in the past because of public perceptions. The Breeders' Cup, for one thing, creates stars late in the year. Then we try to extend them into the following year at the same level. They're almost famous before their time.
"After that, we try to keep them going for the next Breeders' Cup. So, we keep them in training longer and harder to get there. And we do that because of the prizes and the prestige. We try to keep a horse together when ordinarily we might have let him taper off the season earlier."
"Another thing," John Veitch said, "some horses are better at 2, with the shorter distances and shorter season. But at 3, they may get caught up in pressures of the Triple Crown, and they can't handle it."
John Frato, a pedigree consultant to some of the leading stables in the country, sat a few feet away from Veitch and agreed that both the perceptions and the demands of racing were putting more strain on the stars of racing.
"The business is ever-demanding, in terms of the economics," he said. "Purses keep increasing, so you keep a horse in training longer in the year. There is no doubt we are putting more demand on our horses. And maybe even the good ones can respond with one or two ultimate efforts before showing the strain."
He was reminded that Meadow Star had won her first nine races, so she must have been doing something right.
"Yes," he replied, "she was better than her contemporaries last year. But she really didn't beat anybody of significance during that streak."
"Speed is misunderstood," Frato said, marveling at the strange season of 1991 at the race track. "People were saying earlier this year that Meadow Star ran as fast as she had to. That's nonsense. She probably ran as fast as she could."

HEADLINE: As Biosphere Is Sealed, Its Patron Reflects on Life

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
THE largest private sponsor of environmental research in the United States is not Amoco, the Environmental Defense Fund, Exxon, the MacArthur Foundation, the National Geographic Society, the Nature Conservancy, the New York Botanical Garden or the World Wildlife Fund.
It is Edward P. Bass, 46, maverick son of the multibilliondollar Texas oil family.
His main effort is a $150 million, eight-story, glass-and-steel structure in the Arizona desert that holds a miniature ocean, savanna, marsh, desert and rain forest as well as 3,800 species of plants and animals. On Thursday, four men and four women plan to seal themselves inside Biosphere 2, as it is known, for a two-year experiment in recreating the earth. 
 Mr. Bass's "job," as he put it in an interview last week, involves financing and helping direct a dozen other projects, including a $20 million Institute of Biospheric Studies at Yale, a 20-acre research farm in southern France, a 1,042-acre tropical rain forest preserve in Puerto Rico, a 82-foot ocean research vessel and big ranches in Australia and Texas; his Australian lands comprise nearly 900 square miles. [Excerpts on page C6.]
In a more orthodox vein, he is also on the boards of the World Wildlife Fund, the New York Botanical Garden, the African Wildlife Foundation and the Jane Goodall Institute for Wildlife Research, Education and Conservation.
His own ecological projects are unusual in that many are meant to turn a profit. He calls himself an "ecopreneur." Biosphere 2 has already been visited by thousands of paying tourists, many of whom profess astonishment at its scope and audacity. Some experts have called it the greatest venture since man landed on the moon.
On the other hand, critics like Marc Cooper, writing in the Village Voice, have charged that some of Mr. Bass's projects are inspired by doomsday dogmas and new-age flakiness disguised as science. Scientists like Dr. Arthur W. Galston, a Yale University botanist, and Dr. Charles F. Hutchinson, an ecologist at the University of Arizona, say that at best, Biosphere 2 is a scientific crap shoot.
On the rare occasions Mr. Bass has spoken with reporters, he has vigorously defended his projects as creative endeavors meant to forge a new environmental ethic.
A native of Fort Worth, the second of four sons who are heir to the Bass oil fortune, and a bachelor, Edward Perry Bass went to prep school at the Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., and to college at Yale, where he graduated in 1968 with a degree in administrative sciences. After a stint in the Coast Guard, he studied architecture at Yale, but left before his got his master's degree.
What captured his interest in the early 1970's was New Mexico, with its eclectic mix of art, architecture, off-beat characters and rural splendor. "He designed and built adobe structures, dabbled in pottery, and sold Indian jewelry and handicrafts," reported the Texas Monthly.
He also met an unusual counterculture group at Synergia Ranch, 15 miles south of Santa Fe. It was named in honor of Buckminster Fuller's concept of synergy, where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The guru of Synergia was John Allen, who encouraged experiments in gardening, theater and Buddhism and preached the virtues of Fuller's view of "spaceship earth."
Born in Oklahoma and raised, as he once put it, "in the lingering traditions of the frontier," Mr. Allen received a B.S. degree from the Colorado School of Mines and a M.B.A. from the Harvard Business School. After managing a uranium-processing plant, his interests turned unconventional. He traveled across North Africa on foot. He founded an acting troupe, the Theater of All Possibilities. In the 1960's in the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco, he directed theater and wrote poetry under the name Johnny Dolphin. He studied the teachings of the mystic G.I. Gurdjieff. He preached the imminence of nuclear Armageddon and held that Western civilization had already collapsed. What was needed was a new civilization, he said, based on a more enlightened relationship among man, machine and nature.
In New Mexico, Mr. Bass became a regular visitor to the Synergia ranch and participated in the group's drama workshops. He was struck by Mr. Allen's philosophy and hired Synergia ranch hands to help him build condominiums in central Santa Fe. He became a director of the Institute of Ecotechnics, founded by Mr. Allen and other Synergia veterans to carry out bold ecology projects. Most importantly, he bankrolled their work and began his own along similar lines.
His most ambitious venture to date is Biosphere 2, which got under way in 1984 and is being carried out with extensive aid from Mr. Allen and other veterans of the Synergia ranch.
Some of the discord around it has been stirred by Mr. Allen's vision of biospheres as refuges for a small elite from nuclear war or other disasters. In "The Biosphere Catalogue," a 1985 publication of Mr. Bass's London-based Synergetic Press, Mr. Allen outlined a vision of how "higher forms of life" could survive the destruction of civilization in biospheres he called "Refugia."
"A hundred Refugia protected by their own energy resources in mountain caverns could release full-scale life" back into the Earth environment "after the skies begin to clear," he wrote. "Perhaps even the existence of the Refugia," he added, "could bring home to people and states the gigantic risks they run and thus alter the behavior itself."
Biospheres were also originally seen by the group as a way to form human settlements on Mars and to design a new civilization, although of late Mr. Bass has stressed more of the commercial and educational aspects.
 
Bass on Biosphere 2 and 'Walden Two'
 EDWARD P. BASS, a major patron of environmental causes, discussed his work in a rare interview during a business trip to Manhattan last week.
Q. What is the philosophical basis for your interests?
It's something that has grown from many sources, more or less organically. There are people who I much revere and have helped me. I'm not a scientist myself. I deal with the interface of science and politics and economics and I have great interest in the philosophy of science. E.O. Wilson is a wonderful thinker and I've sought his advice. Tom Lovejoy of the Smithsonian is someone I much admire. Buckminster Fuller has been an influence through his writings. And there's the circle of people I've worked with in Biosphere 2, many of whom I've known for 15 years or more.
Q. Why Biosphere 2?
It's a project that appealed to my interest in science and ecology. I thought it had tremendous potential to develop technologies, know-how, data, and could have great use in environmental matters on all scales, from the fairly small to the planetary. And in a business sense, I saw that these technologies would have a very significant commercial application.
Also, as to the why of Biosphere 2, there was very definitely a decision made to put an architectural element into it, to make it accessible and, if you will, symbolic, so that people could look at Biosphere 2 and gain an understanding of the biosphere, this operating system of the Planet Earth.
Q. Will Biosphere 2 turn a profit?
With the biosphere structure itself and the associated infrastructure, that's a long-term proposition, on the scale of 10 years or more. But as an operating entity, with the investment and apparatus in place, within a couple of years we'll turn a profit because we already have revenues.
Q. From tourists?
The visitors are a very significant part of that. It has been said in an accusatory fashion that this is not science or research, that this is a Disneyland. Well, it certainly is. It's built to attract people, to be accessible to people, to be fun, but also to be educational. And I think that's a very important aspect.
Q. What about news reports that Biosphere 2 is basically a survivalist cult built around the magnetic personality of John Allen, whom The Village Voice characterized as "much more the Jim Jones than the Johnny Appleseed of the ecology movement?"
That's entirely bunkum. I've never found anything to contradict the notion that he is a fine human being. He's an exceptional thinker, an exceptional intellect. He can take a lot of seemingly unrelated phenomena, disparate data, and put it together in meaningful patterns.
Q. At the end of one of his books, he talks about the feasibility of a Biosphere-based colony on Mars whose members conduct their debates under Robert's Rules of Order.
Yes, but that's no more far out than "Walden Two." Actually it has a little bit happier ending.
Q. It's said that the Biosphere 2 people maintain silence while they eat, meditating on the metaphysics of it all. Doesn't that suggest some kind of cultism?
There was a NASA cult that got us to the Moon in the 60's. If what's at work is mindless conformity, manipulation and so forth, that would be frightening, that would be shocking. But as far as dedication to a project, discipline, hard work and so forth, I would say NASA's effort that got us on the Moon and Biosphere 2 have a lot in common.
Q. Should Mars be colonized?
It's an interesting concept. It's certainly a potential enterprise for the next century. It's not something I occupy myself with greatly today. How you would apply a concept of closed biospheric system to Mars is yet to be worked out. You would not build something that necessarily looked that much like Biosphere 2. You would not transport steel and glass ad infinitum to build something there. But as far as the utilization of biological systems to produce food and continually recycle your material resources, yes, that makes sense.
Leonardo da Vinci talked about flying machines. Centuries later the Wright brothers built one. Biosphere 2 may prove to be the Kitty Hawk of biospheric life-support systems. Then again it may prove to be one of those airplanes everybody sees in the movies and laughs at that had 16 wings flapping at the same time.

HEADLINE: THE DOCTOR'S WORLD;
Can the Brain Provide Clues to Intelligence?

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D.

 BODY:
THE inner sanctum of the K.G.B. seems an extraordinary place for a brain laboratory to elucidate the structure of great minds.
But, according to the CBS News magazine "60 Minutes," Russian scientists, watched carefully by the Soviet secret police, peered through microscopes for decades to scrutinize tens of thousands of slides made from scores of brains, including those of Lenin, Stalin and other prominent Communists. 
 The search for biological and physical correlates of intellect has taken many strange turns, like phrenologists' attempts to relate the bumps on the head to mental abilities. But more sophisticated methods are now available for analyzing the brain and may one day produce some jewel of discovery from this muddy arena.
The K.G.B. effort was probably as misdirected as phrenology and many other earlier studies conducted in the United States and elsewhere. Saving neurons from smart Russians may have been as futile a scientific effort as Communism was an economic policy, American experts say. They note that if the Russians found anything of significance, not a word has been communicated in any standard scientific journal. It is not known whether Western scientists will be allowed to examine the brain specimens or whether an invitation, if extended, would be worthwhile to accept. American experts say that if the K.G.B. did not use modern techniques to preserve the brains within an hour or so after death, little could be learned.
Many experts dismiss as pseudoscience the task of examining brains for evidence of genius and mental prowess, largely in the belief that even experts do not know where and what to look for in the three-pound organ. Indeed, experts say no study similar to the K.G.B.'s is on the drawing boards in this country.
However, a growing number of Americans are leaving their brains to science in Federally financed tissue banks devoted to the study of nervous system disorders, particularly those with suspected hereditary links.
And a few scientists believe they are on the brink of finding clues to the most fundamental questions of human intelligence.
"We are just coming into the time when we can begin the studies to try to tell what it is about the ability and talents of the way certain people used their brain tissue when they were alive," said Dr. Arnold B. Scheibel, director of the brain research institute at the University of California at Los Angeles.
Not that scientists plan to ask former Presidents of the United States for permission to examine their brains after death, although Dr. Scheibel's team, including his wife, Dr. Marian C. Diamond, has examined a tiny portion of Einstein's brain. In that study, Dr. Scheibel's team found a significantly larger number of certain cells, called oligodendroglia, than was found in the brains of 11 less gifted individuals that were used as scientific controls.
"The findings said nothing about causality or whether Einstein was born with his magnificent use of his brain," or whether the cells increased in response to the way he thought, Dr. Scheibel said in an interview.
Studying the brains of geniuses and gifted people has not received much scientific attention, but attitudes are changing, and Dr. Scheibel said that up to a few dozen scientists are exploring ways to do such research, though they have not held a formal meeting.
Techniques for studying the most fundamental aspects of the cell and genetics are rapidly advancing. Scientists hope that someday they will be able to develop them to probe for anatomical and biochemical correlates of gifted minds and various kinds of intelligence.
The difficulty of the task cannot be overestimated. Even the most optimistic among such scientists say they are not even close to separating the interplay of genetic and environmental factors on the maturation of the brain.
In a broader context, they point to a widely publicized recent report about previously undetected anatomical differences between the brains of homosexual and heterosexual men.
Dr. Simon LeVay at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, Calif., reported that one of four groups of nerve cells in the hypothalamus was smaller in gay men than in the brains of heterosexual men. But the controversial finding has not been confirmed in larger studies, and Dr. LeVay's team has not determined whether the finding is one of cause or effect.
Cerebral exercise apparently can improve an animal's intellectual capacity, according to earlier studies at the University of California at Berkeley by Dr. Diamond. Although animal studies can yield some clues about intelligence, the human brain is the most meaningful model. Yet many concepts about evaluating human intelligence are vague. For example, what is intelligence and how is it measured?
Earlier studies have tried to correlate human intelligence with overall brain size, the number of convolutions and subdivisions and other crude measurements.
But many such studies have been discredited because the investigators started off with a preconceived notion and then found what they sought. The results were often confusing, and sometimes dangerous when they fed erroneous beliefs of racial superiority.
Still other findings were never confirmed, in part because the nature of the question asked was too complex and the studies too crude to provide meaningful answers.
Scientists have learned that overall brain size is critical to intelligence, but only up to a minimal point, arbitrarily 800 to 900 grams.
Great variation in brain size did not appear to affect the literary abilities of two famous novelists, Jonathan Swift and Anatole France. Neuroscientists frequently cite figures of 1,000 grams for France's and 2,000 for Swift's, Dr. Scheibel said.
Recognizing the remote possibility of solving the riddle of human intelligence simply by looking at brains, scientists suspect that answers are more likely to be found by using the microscope and other techniques.
CAT scans, magnetic resonance and other recently developed imaging techniques allow examination of the living brain in greater detail than ever before. Such studies can be used to screen for certain large abnormalities and findings. But they cannot provide the fine anatomical and cellular detail that can come only after chemicals are applied to brain tissue so the stains can highlight microscopic and immunologic features.
Studying human brains for clues to intelligence and genius will require long-term cooperation from gifted individuals and their families. Among the needs would be good documentation of I.Q. and other mental status exams throughout life. A complete set of medical records would also be needed to exclude damage that could be produced by disease late in life, said Dr. Edward D. Bird, a neuroscientist who heads the brain bank at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass. Tissue from the bank for the study of nerve disorders is not being used for studies of human intelligence, but could be by qualified investigators, Dr. Bird said.
Microscopic studies can usually be done only after death. The detail that can be obtained is critically dependent on how soon after death the brain is preserved. The technique is also critically important because the standard fixative, formalin, destroys proteins in the brain.
The techniques vary. At McLean, Dr. Bird divides the brain; one half is studied with standard techniques to confirm a diagnosis, and the other half is frozen for research studies.
At the Wadsworth Veterans Adminstration Hospital, Dr. Wallace Tourtellotte quick freezes the entire brain and stores it in liquid nitrogen.
But even when brains are properly preserved, experts recognize that they still have a long way to go before understanding enough about brain function to ask the really searching questions.
If they count cells, which cells? If they weigh specific areas of the brain, which ones?
Nevertheless, they are guided by a long history of research experience that has shown that scientists who look long and hard at microscopic slides from a wide enough selection often detect new and important patterns. The first attempts are often crude and the moment of recognition often comes unexpectedly. But those can be the moments that create new branches of science.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Israel: 'Not for Sale'

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
This is a passage from a personal letter sent to the Prime Minister of Israel by a particularly sophisticated and experienced American supporter of his Government and country:
"If it should develop that the availability of loan guarantees should be conditioned upon a change in the principles you have adopted regarding participation in the proposed international peace conference or upon a change in the settlement policies established by the Government of Israel, I would urge that Israel forgo the loan guarantee instead of compromising your principles. . . . Policies and principles . . . should not be for sale." 
 The letter was written by Kenneth J. Bialkin, president of the Jewish Community Relations Council of New York and former president of the umbrella group of American Jewish organizations. Some other American supporters of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir are telling him or each other much the same thing.
They know the loan guarantees to build homes and jobs for Soviet Jews are enormously important. But they are coming to believe that it would be better for Israel to withdraw the guarantee request to the U.S. until it is free of conditions that could distort the peace process, and the future. Instead Israel would have to look even more to itself and its friends.
It is not the guarantee issue alone that troubles them but what it shows about the Bush Administration's intentions about Israel. In Israel, there is the same concern among centrists in the Shamir Government that Mr. Bush is not only setting the price for guarantees unaffordably high now but that he and the Arabs will keep raising the ante on one issue after another.
Put as bluntly as it should be, more American backers of Israel and officials in Jerusalem believe that if the Bush Administration could have its way, Israel would lose Jerusalem as its capital and would be pushed back to pre-1967 borders. That would make it a tempting target once again, 10 miles wide from the enemy to the sea.
Before the talks even begin, Israel is asked to give up its West Bank settlement plans. Obviously that involves such questions as who should run the West Bank, whether one side or the other, and whether it be shared territorially or administratively.
Important questions -- but until Mr. Bush started his political blitz against Israel, the assumption was that those things were supposed to be what the talks with Palestinians would be all about, not settled in advance.
Also strange: Mr. Bush asks nothing of the Arab states except to sit down and chat. Did the idea never cross his mind that maybe Syria should also agree in advance to land for peace? One way would be to get out of Lebanon, whose colonization by Syria was accepted by Washington with a silence that shouted America's acquiescence.
Now that Mr. Bush has vividly shown his obsession with Jews in the West Bank, the Arabs will make that a theme from the beginning of the talks. They had not intended to do that until he reminded them how important it was.
Despite the booby traps, it is still worthwhile for Israel to talk directly with Arab states and Palestinians. Withdrawal of the request for guarantees might persuade Arab rulers that Israel could not be delivered to them.
But Israel cannot answer the guarantee problem by closing its doors to Soviet Jews and still keep its national purpose. For help it would have to look even more to Jews abroad, and to itself. That would mean more sacrifices for Israeli taxpayers.
Maybe then Israeli politicians would finally be forced to privatize the draining, patronage-fat enterprises run by the Government, a relic of Israel's Socialist days. Government holdings in land should be sold off and every government business put on the market -- chemical companies, transportation and communication giants, all of them. That would bring in about $2 billion at least, and help the economy raise even more.
Israeli politicians are no better than most at brave economic leaps -- and worse than some. But perhaps the President's policy, and his deliberately unpleasant message of delivery, will shock them enough to do what is needed now to protect Israel's security, independence, economy and its dignity, all four.

HEADLINE: ELECTRICITY COSTS DIP UNEXPECTEDLY IN 2 AREAS OF U.S.

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Wholesale electric prices rose in the 1970's and were stable in many places in the 1980's. But now, contrary to expectations, they are doing something new: declining in the Northeast and Southwest.
Some reasons for the drop, like lower oil prices and the collapse in the price of natural gas, are temporary and likely to reverse themselves eventually. The sluggish regional economies, which will presumably also reverse at some point, are a factor, too, lowering demand for power and thus leaving high-cost generating stations idle more often than usual. 
 But another factor is probably longer lasting: more efficient use of electricity, spurred in part by utility subsidies for new light bulbs and electric motors. This has cut demand, idling expensive generators.
 
Utility Rates Hold Steady
 Taken together, the crosscurrents running through the power industry mean that electricity supplies, which some analysts had predicted would tighten rapidly and cause prices to rise in the next few years, will shrink more slowly, delaying price increases.
For residential customers, the lines on their monthly bills where utilities adjust rates for changes in fuel costs have shown a small number, or even a negative one. Because the price of wholesale electricity that companies buy from each other is down, utility rates have mostly held steady when they might have been expected to rise.
Whatever the reasons, the balance has shifted. "It's a buyer's market," said Barry Abramson, an analyst at Prudential Securities. "It's good for anyone who is consuming electricity, any utilities that are short of capacity and need to buy."
Another analyst, Mark Luftig of National Economic Research Associates, said: "The cost is certainly down on a real basis. It's not clear how long it's going to last, but it's lasted longer than anyone would have predicted a few years ago."
The effect is clearest in New England.
"New England as a region may be unique in that virtually all the states in the region are aggressively promoting demand-side management," said Michael Foley, an electricity expert at the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, an organization of state officials based in Washington. "In other regions of the country, it's a state here and a state there, but it's not a religion like it is in New England."
In addition, the six-state New England region has been hit hard by recession.
If prices in the Northeast are falling, it would only begin to redress a huge imbalance. A recent survey by the National Utility Service, a consulting concern in Park Ridge, N.J., found that of the five most expensive utilities in the United States for commercial and industrial customers, four were in the Northeast.
First and second, respectively, were the Long Island Lighting Company, at 11.1 cents a kilowatt-hour, and the Consolidated Edison Company of New York, at 10.6 cents a kilowatt-hour. Fourth was the Philadelphia Electric Company, at 8.8 cents, followed by the Jersey Central Power and Light Company, at 8.6 cents. In between, at third, was the Louisiana Power and Light Company, a subsidiary of the Entergy Corporation, at 9.8 cents.
Around the country, one factor that drove electricity prices higher in the 1970's is rare now: the construction of new power plants. In most states, utilities build power plants with their own money and then, when the plants are put into service, apply for large rate increases to pay for them. But Mr. Foley of the utility commissioners association pointed out that few utilities were building big plants these days; instead, they are signing contracts to buy power from small producers.
 
Shopping for Power
 Within the utility industry, there are other signs that prices are down.
For example, one way to buy electricity is to purchase a generating station, or shares in a generating station, or to sign a contract for the right to the output of a power station for a fixed number of years.
Northeast Utilities, which serves much of Connecticut and western Massachusetts and is the largest utility in New England, has been in a "long" position for several years, with more capacity than it needs for its own customers. If another utility wanted to buy capacity today, said James R. Shuckerow, Northeast's director of intercompany arrangements, "the price we'd sell for today would be considerably below what we'd have sold for in '87, '88 or '89."
The reason, he said, was that the deep recession in New England had cut demand just as the Seabrook nuclear reactor in New Hampshire came into service, adding to supply and turning a tight market into a loose one.
 
Less Valuable Capacity
 William Balet, the director of the New York Power Pool, a utility consortium that manages electricity transfers among utilities, agreed that the price of buying a share of a generating station was down because of reduced demand. "If you need 10 snow shovels and you have 14, it's enough," he said. "The capacity is less valuable than it would have been three or four years ago."
Another way to buy power is on an hour-to-hour basis, and that, too, seems to show a decline. Power pools use a system called economic dispatch to run generating stations in order of their cost for a kilowatt-hour; thus, at any given moment, controllers know that if power demand increases they will turn on the next-most-expensive generator, and if demand declines, they will turn off the most expensive then running.
The New England Power Pool recently calculated that its 12-month cumulative average for the price of the most expensive plant in operation at any given moment was $24 a megawatt-hour, or 2.4 cents a kilowatt-hour. This was not a record low, but it was down from $25 for the prior 12 months.
 
Troublesome Contracts
 The Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Electric Company, a consortium of small publicly owned power companies, reported in the June issue of its newsletter that in part because of low fuel prices, the region was losing money on a contract to buy hydroelectric power from Quebec that began in 1986. The cost of that electricity was set at 80 percent of what the electricity would have cost if it were made from oil, gas and coal, but the price of oil and gas are down. At the same time, a drought in Quebec has cut deliveries, spreading the cost of the transmission lines over fewer kilowatt-hours.
Meanwhile, a second contract with Hydro-Quebec, which began this summer, is losing economic value, the newsletter reported, because it, too, was based on the value of the oil and gas displaced.
Analysts blame the trend toward lower prices for one bankruptcy, that of Eastern Utility Associates, a Massachusetts company that increased its capacity by buying shares in the Seabrook reactor from other companies that wanted to bail out. Eastern Utility expected to sell the resulting power in a tight market, said Mr. Abramson, the Prudential analyst. but that market never developed.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 6, 1991, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sept. 24 about national trends in wholesale electricity prices misstated the charge to industrial and commercial customers of the Louisiana Power and Light Company for each kilowatt-hour. It is 5.7 cents, not 9.8 cents. A public relations firm that provided the erroneous figure issued a correction on Oct. 23, but it was not called to The Times's attention until Monday.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Cement Shoes For Venezuela

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
TRADE dumping: the words conjure up scenes of wily foreigners plotting to drown American businesses in a torrent of cut-price goods.
But what Washington calls dumping bears only a passing resemblance to the image. In fact, some economists think that illegal dumping should often be celebrated rather than prosecuted. A new case, involving sales of Venezuelan cement in Florida, illustrates their point. 
 According to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, dumping means selling goods abroad for less than they are sold at home. Consumers gain -- cheaper, after all, is better -- but economists agree that dumping is pernicious if the intent is to drive local competitors out of business and then sock it to hapless customers.
The parallel (and more familiar) problem in domestic markets is predatory pricing. Nobody objects when a Pittsburgh bakery sells pastry for less in Peoria -- unless, of course, the idea is to wait for Peoria's bakers to run out of dough and then raise the price of a sugar fix.
But laws against dumping, notes Jagdish Bhagwati, an economist at Columbia University, do not address intent. What counts in United States law (which favors the home team more than the GATT) is whether foreigners price below "fair market value," meaning either the price they charge at home or the cost of production. Exporters who give consumers a good deal simply to meet the competition are thus vulnerable to penalties if the lower prices injure American companies.
In a recession, injury is generally not hard to establish. By no coincidence, American companies have already filed twice as many dumping complaints in 1991 as they did in all of 1989. One of them involves Venezuelan cement in Florida.
Local Florida cement makers, including a subsidiary of Texas-based Southdown Inc., supply half to two-thirds of Florida's cement. The balance comes from abroad because ocean transport is much cheaper than moving the stuff by rail or truck from other states. Venezuela, with easy access to Florida by water, currently has about 10 percent of the Florida market.
The price of cement is roughly equal in Florida and Venezuela -- $60 a ton. Since transportation and storage adds $10 to $15 a ton to the cost of delivering Venezuelan cement to Florida, Southdown contends the Venezuelans are undercutting their home-market price by a like amount.
It is clear why Southdown and two other Florida cement makers are suing. If they win -- and, in the process, inhibit competition from Greek, Spanish and Colombian suppliers to Florida -- they will probably be free to raise prices by as much as the dumping margin. Local supplies of limestone, a key ingredient in cement, are very limited, and potential competition from out-of-state suppliers is constrained by high transport costs.
It is far from clear, however, that a Southdown victory would serve consumers. Kenneth W. Clarkson of the University of Miami and Stephen O. Morrell of Barry University estimate that Florida consumers would pay an extra $664 million for cement over the next five years if the company won.
The two economic consultants for the Venezuelans note, moreover, that two of the three petitioners are their own best customers, supplying cement to subsidiaries that use it as the primary ingredient in ready-mix concrete. If foreign companies are driven out, they argue, independent producers of ready-mix will be easy prey for the two vertically integrated companies with secure access to low-cost cement.
The Venezuelans may yet beat the rap. The Commerce Department has considerable discretion in determining fair market value. And the legal definition of injury is so vague that the United States International Trade Commission could decide that lean times for Florida cement makers are solely due to the depression in local construction.
But they may not: Southdown has already successfully used anti-dumping suits to knock the Mexican cement makers out of the Southern states and drive the Japanese out of California.
Mr. Bhagwati suggests that one route to reform would be to narrow the definition of fair market value and force complainants to meet tougher tests for injury. Michael Knoll, a law professor at the University of Southern California who was a special assistant to the International Trade Commission, would just as soon drop the law as patch it up. Predatory pricing would still be illegal under domestic antitrust laws.
Do not hold your breath. The European Community, which might have been expected to favor reform, now seems intent on using its own anti-dumping weapon against the Japanese. In the politics of trade, consumers do not seem to count.

Dollar Ends Higher in U.S. After Declining in Europe

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar closed higher in domestic trading yesterday after falling in Europe. Gold prices advanced.
The dollar gained in early trading but turned lower after the Conference Board business research group said its consumer confidence index fell sharply in September. The index was seen as yet another indicator of weakness in the United States economy. 
 Dismal auto sales figures for mid-September also took the dollar lower.
The figures "substantiated the belief that the recovery is at best anemic and at worst not there at all," said John McCarthy, chief dealer with Algemene Bank Nederland.
The dollar tends to fall on negative economic news as traders speculate that the Federal Reserve will push interest rates down to stimulate business activity. Like all currencies, the dollar is supported by higher rates, which raise demand for American investments.
The dollar later recovered as technical market influences of supply and demand dominated subsequent dealings.
Mr. McCarthy said one large buyer had come into the market and bid the dollar higher. Other traders who had sold holdings during the dollar's recent decline suddenly found themselves short and scurried to cover their positions, he said.
The dollar rose in New York to 133.45 Japanese yen, from 132.84 on Monday. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar rose to 132.97 yen from its Monday close in New York. Japanese markets were closed Monday for a national holiday. In London, the dollar fell to 132.85 yen.
The British pound fell to $1.7290 in New York, from $1.7425 late Monday. In earlier London trading, sterling fell to $1.7430 from $1.7435.
Other late dollar prices in New York, compared with late Monday's prices, included: 1.6865 German marks, up from 1.6735; 1.4690 Swiss francs, up from 1.4580; 5.7455 French francs, up from 5.7045; 1,261.00 Italian lire, up from 1,252.25, and 1.13375 Canadian dollars, down from 1.13415.
Gold for current delivery picked up $2.90 on the Commodity Exchange in New York to close at $353.70 a troy ounce. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $353.65, up $3.25.
Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $351.75, up from $350.05. In Zurich, it rose to a closing bid of $351.70, up from $349.60.
Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose $3.45 to close at a bid $351.56.
Silver for current delivery rose 8.2 cents on the Commodity Exchange and closed at $4.250 a troy ounce. In London, silver rose to a late bid price of $4.23, up from $4.12 late Monday.
Dealers said the jump had followed a bout of buying overnight in Asia.

HEADLINE: Money Market Accounts And C.D.'s Drop in Yield

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Yields on certificates of deposit and money market accounts showed further declines in the week that ended yesterday, according to The Bank Rate Monitor, a publication in North Palm Beach, Fla., that focuses on interest rates.
Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Monitor, said there had been considerable impact from recent cuts by leading banks in the prime lending rate to 8 percent from 8 1/2 percent. 
 "New York institutions continue to cut rates at a rapid pace," he said. "While the recent drop in the prime rate did little to affect loan rates, it is having a big impact not just on certificates of deposit but also on money market accounts as well."
At the Treasury's weekly bill auction on Monday, three-month bills were auctioned at an average discount rate of 5.18 percent, only slightly lower than the 5.19 percent the previous week, while six-month bills averaged 5.23 percent, compared with 5.22 percent.
But the rates that bank offered customers showed larger declines. According to The Monitor, the largest change among New York area banks was made by the Chemical Bank, which lowered its money market rate by 26 basis points, to 4.60 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Another substantial cut was made by Chase Manhattan, which lowered its money market rate by 21 points, to 4.60 percent. Marine Midland lowered its rate on three-month certificates of deposit by 16 points, to 4.86, the largest cut in that category.
As for six-month certificates, four major banks -- European American, Connecticut National, Bank of New York and National Westminster -- cut their rates by 11 basis points.
Among commercial banks in New York , the average yield was cut to 4.78 percent, a decline of 5 basis points, for money market accounts, and three-month certificates are down 5 basis points, to 5.02 percent.
For depositors at savings institutions in the New York area, yields were cut an average of a basis point, to 5.34 percent, for money market accounts and 3 points, to 5.44, for three-month certificates.
Nationwide, according to The Monitor, the average money maket account yields of 20 major banks outside of the New York area were cut by 5 basis points, to 5.03, and the six-month certificate rate was cut a point, to 5.28.

HEADLINE: Fed Bank Regulator Wins Support for Seidman Posts

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 24

 BODY:
William Taylor, the Federal Reserve Board's top banking regulator, won broad Congressional support today to succeed L. William Seidman as chairman of the the sister agencies managing the bailouts of the nation's banks and savings and loans.
Senator Donald W. Riegle, the Michigan Democrat who heads the Senate Banking Committee, said after a hearing today on Mr. Taylor's confirmation that he did not see any impediments to his nomination to head the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Resolution Trust Corporation. He also expressed satisfaction with Mr. Taylor's answers to questions about his supervision over the last six years of some of the banks involved in the scandal of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. 
 "I have not found anything there that is a barrier," Mr. Riegle told reporters, adding that committee and floor votes on the nomination would probably take place within a few weeks. But he again expressed doubts about the prospects of Robert L. Clarke for another term as comptroller of the currency, strongly hinting that Mr. Clarke's confirmation hearing on Thursday would be acrimonious.
"The Administration should think long and hard about this one," Mr. Riegle said.
For the most part, senators at today's proceeding lobbed softball questions to Mr. Taylor, eliciting no significant new revelations about the B.C.C.I. case.
In many ways the hearing offered a vivid contrast in styles between the circumspect Mr. Taylor, who appeared to go out of his way to say nothing controversial, and the outspoken Mr. Seidman, who had a penchant for using committee hearings to make splashy news announcements.
Without offering specifics, Mr. Taylor vowed to search for "a new methodology" for resolving the plight of failing banks.
"We must do all that we can to keep bank assets from being liquidated," he said.
 
Points to Merger
 He held up as a model for handling more failing banks in the future the proposed acquisition last week of the Southeast Bank by the First Union Corporation, which had been engineered by the F.D.I.C.
In a highly unusual move, regulators used liquidity rather than capital as the standard for seizing Southeast, taking it over before it was technically insolvent, on the ground that it was short on cash after the Federal Reserve called $568 million in loans. And as part of the deal, First Union agreed to assume all of Southeast's loans and to take 15 percent of any losses from those loans. In most other large bank failures, the F.D.I.C. guaranteed all of the losses of bad loans.
Mr. Taylor said he agreed with the plan to have a new chief executive, Albert V. Casey, run the trust corporation on a day-to-day basis. He also supported the proposal by Mr. Seidman -- who has disagreed with the Treasury Department -- that legislation should be introduced formally separating the F.D.I.C. from the trust corporation and creating different chairmanships for each agency.
"Separating them from me would be reasonable," he said.
 
Against Industrial Ownership
 Breaking ranks with the Bush Administration, which has proposed as part of the bank overhaul package now working its way through Congress that industrial enterprises be permitted to own banks, Mr. Taylor said that he did not think that would be appropriate. He agreed that banks should be allowed to diversify into the securities and insurance industries, which the Administration has also proposed. Congress is divided.
Facing a handful of hostile questions from several Republicans on the committee, Mr. Taylor defended the role of examiners, disagreeing with the proposition that they had caused the tightening of credit by discouraging legitimate loans by overreacting to charges that they had been lax in the past.
"There's bound to be, among all of the examiners, someone who overreacts," Mr. Taylor said in response to a question by Senator Jake Garn, the Utah Republican and ranking minority member of the committee. "The worrisome part is that the banker is intimidated to lend not just by the examiner, but by economic circumstances."

From the J. Press Fold To the Top of Tripler

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
After 31 years, Richard Press has bid adieu to his family's retail business and walked around the corner and up Madison Avenue to assume his new post as president of F. R. Tripler, the crown jewel of the Hartmarx Corporation's specialty store division.
"You can decide whether this is fact or fantasy but when I left J. Press, I looked up at the picture of my grandfather on the wall," the 53-year-old Mr. Press said on Monday, his first day at his new job. "He winked at me and said, 'Richard, go for it.' " 
 He is going for it at a time when the recession has cut deeply into the market share for traditional classically styled men's wear, the core of Tripler's business. But Mr. Press said he had no intention of abandoning that segment.
"There is a vacuum that exists now," he said. "The number of people in the trade who have served this type of clientele have moved in other directions, and we are in a good position to capitalize on that."
That is not to say that Tripler's customers, many of whom populate the board rooms and executive suites of America's blue-chip corporations, are hidebound. Mr. Press said that he was eager to attract younger managers, male and female, to the store, and that he planned to make some interior changes to move away somewhat from the atmosphere of a well-heeled men's club.
"We want to lighten the store; air it out a bit," he said. "We want to make it more hospitable to the young men and women who might look up to the C.E.O.'s and senior executives who shop here."
At J. Press, Mr. Press had been a vice president of the parent company, Kashiyama, a Japanese company that in 1986 bought the store founded by his grandfather in 1902. The parting was "cordial," he said.
He had worked at J. Press, one of the haberdasheries that inhabit the corners of Madison Avenue near Grand Central Station, since he graduated from Dartmouth College, where he developed an avid passion for skiing.
Mr. Press is also a graduate of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. He had acting roles in Off Broadway plays and later had financial roles in the production of Broadway plays, including Athol Fugard's "A Lesson From Aloes."
Mr. Press lives in Old Greenwich, Conn., with his wife, Vida.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Many Avoid Dealers in Note Sale

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
In an apparent reaction to the shadow the Salomon Brothers scandal has cast on Wall Street, many participants at yesterday's auction of two-year Treasury notes chose to bypass dealing with the 39 institutions that are primary dealers in Government securities. Instead, they placed bids directly wih the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
In releasing the auction results, the Treasury Department said 79 percent of the bids submitted by New York primary dealers for the $13 billion issue were accepted, compared with an average of 90 percent in past auctions. 
 With the exception of four concerns -- the First National Bank of Chicago, Harris Trust, Fuji Securities and the Bank of America -- all the primary dealers, a collection of big banks and securities houses, are in New York.
"I can't ever remember seeing that before," said Joseph Liro, a senior vice president and money market economist at S. G. Warburg & Company.
And Stephen A. Wood, director of financial market research at the Bank of America, said, "The bids suggest that people are pulling away from the dealers."
"It seems that customers are probably making a collective decision to go directly to the Fed in order to avoid any chance of a problem," said a trader at a primary dealer, who asked not to be identified.
Bids at the auction produced an average yield of 6.14 percent, well below the 6.46 percent average yield at the last two-year note sale on Aug. 27.
Yesterday's auction was the second sale of two-year notes since the Salomon scandal erupted on Aug. 9. The first auction went smoothly, as did yesterday's. But at the Aug. 27 auction, just under 89 percent of the bids made by New York dealers were accepted by the Treasury.
At yesterday's sale, unusually large competitive bids were submitted through a number of regional Federal Reserve Banks, most notably the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, which was awarded more than $860 million, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, which was awarded nearly $550 million.
Dealers said that bids from those two institutions alone were $1 billion higher than usual.
 
More Complicated Process
 The process of placing a competitive bid through a regional Federal Reserve Bank is somewhat more complicated than doing business directly with a primary dealer.
In working through the regional Federal Reserve banks, a client wishing to bid on securities needs to submit either an automated or written tender form. Through primary dealers, a telephone call specifying the size of the bid and the price is all that is necessary.
Results of an auction of $12.5 billion of one-year notes last week gave little sign that this sort of shift would occur. At that auction, 93 percent of the bids submitted by New York dealers were accepted.
"A month ago, it would have made sense to stay with the dealers," said Louis v. B. Crandall, chief economist at R. H. Wrightson & Associates, an economic consulting firm. "But given what's happened since, you would have expected to see some of this shift at the one-year bill auction.
"The fact that something changed between that auction and this one is surprising, and makes me wonder if this is an aberration," Mr. Crandall continued. "It is certainly something people will be watching at the five-year auction tommorrow."
 
5-Year Note Sale
 The Treasury is expected to sell $9.5 billion worth of new five-year notes today. In when-issued trading late yesterday, the securities were offered at a price to yield 7.06 percent.
Demand for the two-year notes sold yesterday remained strong after the auction results were announced, and by late in the day the securities were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 6.12 percent.
The auction was the highlight of an otherwise slow day in the secondary market for Treasury notes and bonds.
After moving higher early in the session on news that the Conference Board's index of consumer confidence declined for the third straight month in September, prices of Treasury securities staged a reversal and ended slightly lower on the day.
Analysts said that car sales data for the middle 10 days of September were a bit stronger than anticipated, showing a seasonally adjusted annual selling rate of 6.4 million vehicles.
Though far from robust, the rise from the 5.4 million annual rate for the first 10 days of the month provided traders with an excuse to take profits after the recent run-up in prices.
 
30-Year Bonds Off
 By late in the day, the Treasury's benchmark 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 102 25/32, down 1/8 point, to yield 7.88 percent, compared with 7.87 percent late Monday.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 102 10/32 in late trading, down 3/32, to yield 7.55 percent. And the outstanding 7 1/4 percent five-year notes were offered at 100 26/32, unchanged from late Monday, to yield 7.05 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were little changed. Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.17 percent late yesterday, up one basis point, or one one-hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bills were unchanged at a late offered rate of 5.21 percent.
In the investment-grade corporate bond market, Salomon Brothers acted as lead manager on an offering of $175 million of 10-year securities for the Masco Corporation.
The 9 percent notes, which mature Oct. 1, 2001, were priced at $100, or par, 1.44 percentage points higher than the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.

Mexico Pries Open Its Oil Industry

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
The transformation of Mexico's economy has filled a graveyard with old myths: the inviolable power of big labor unions, the need for trade protection, the importance of state ownership. The lone survivor would seem to be the sanctity of oil.
Mexican officials still speak in almost mystical terms about the relationship between oil and sovereignty. And in free-trade talks with the United States, Mexico has done its best to keep the issue of foreign involvement in its oil production off the table. 
 Little wonder that to most outside analysts, Petroleos Mexicanos S.A., Mexico's biggest company, remains one of its most insular -- and least efficient.
While continuing to to loom as a nationalist symbol, however, the giant state monopoly known as Pemex has begun to change and open up at a quickening pace.
Driven to expand production by an economy that is projected to grow as much as 4 percent a year through the rest of the decade, Pemex is gathering investment dollars by the billions. Last week, it secured a $1.3 billion loan guarantee from the Export-Import Bank of the United States to call in American companies for four big new exploration projects.
Meantime, as the Mexican Government is loosening other rules on foreign participation in the petroleum industry, Pemex is trying to impose order on the chaotic organization of its various lines of business.
"What is happening with this economy has to happen in all parts of it," a senior economic official here said of the changes sweeping Mexico. "Oil cannot remain apart."
The changes coming to Mexico's oil industry are clearly more evolutionary than revolutionary, and some economists and industry analysts criticize the measures so far as woefully insufficient. Nonetheless, the tentative steps toward opening the industry represent a remarkable break with the past.
As recently as a few years ago, Pemex seemed to be as much a social service agency as an oil company. It ran hospitals and schools, and handed over more revenue to the Treasury than all corporate and individual taxpayers combined.
From the few cases that came to light, though, corruption appeared to be rampant. And the oil workers'union, which maintained a stranglehold on Pemex contracts, was a business empire in its own right, with assets valued at more than $1 billion.
Perhaps most significant in a technology-intensive industry, Pemex's capital spending, which reached $6 billion in 1981, dwindled to barely $1 billion as the 80's drew to a close. Mexico, with twice the reserves of the United States, was producing barely one-third the oil.
 
Soldiers as Agents of Change
 Upon taking office in December 1988, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari hinted that all of this would change. Weeks later, he sent soldiers to storm the home of the powerful oil union chief, Joaquin Hernandez Galicia, and haul him off to jail.
Since 1988, Pemex has shrunk its labor force from 213,000 employees to 171,000 Yet such has been the momentum of economic reform, that when Mr. Salinas stunned many Mexicans earlier this year by closing a major oil refinery to curb pollution in Mexico City, some union officials even mumbled words of support.
Pemex officials say the company has cut its operating costs by 17 percent over the past five years, saving about $1 billion. With the help of MacKinsey & Company consultants, Pemex has also rationalized its system for trading goods within the huge, vertically integrated operation.
In hopes of streamlining Pemex's ponderous bureaucracy, executives are now at work on a sweeping reorganization in which the company has been divided into independent sectors. Exploration and production, for example, has been separated from refining and distribution. Hundreds of mid-level management positions have been eliminated, and lower-level managers have gained more responsibility for productivity and cost containment.
One new division, petrochemicals, has emerged as the laboratory for many of the management and investment innovations being discussed companywide. The petrochemical division has also pioneered a more receptive stance on foreign participation. Among other strategies, the unit has hired foreign companies to build new plants and paid them from the factories' proceeds.
Still, for all of the changes that Pemex has undergone during the first half of Mr. Salinas's six-year term, oil stands as the Mexican industry that has most conspicuously remained closed. Opening it, some economic officials said, would be more politically sensitive than even the planned changes in the communal agriculture system, a land-tenure system that the Government has long defended as one of the remaining prizes of the Mexican Revolution.
Last spring Pemex, for the first time contracted out an entire drilling job, paying a Houston-based company, Triton International Inc., an estimated $18 million for an exploratory well in the Gulf of Campeche, west of the Yucatan Peninsula. The contract was the first under a 1989 law that frees Pemex from the traditional requirement to use Mexican labor.
The 113 new wells that Pemex will have American companies drill and service in the Gulf of Campeche, thanks to the Export-Import Bank guarantee announced last Thursday, are part of a five-year, $19 billion plan to expand exploration, production and refining.
The chief Mexico loan officer for the Export-Import Bank, Marian M. Hinchman, said in a telephone interview from Washington that Pemex was ultimately looking to secure as much as $5.8 billion in guarantees for 16 projects contemplated in the expansion plan. Mexico has also worked out similar arrangements with 25 other national export-import banks around the world, the company's top official, Francisco Rojas, the director general, said in an interview.
Ms. Hinchman described the United States bank's program as a boon to American suppliers. "My phone has been ringing off the hook with oil drilling companies that want a piece of the business," she said.
But several analysts suggested that the loan guarantees might work at cross purposes with attempts by United States trade negotiators to persuade Mexico to open its oil production to foreign equity partners.
According to a Pemex spokeswoman, the company's capital investment will rise this year to $3.07 billion from $2.14 billion in 1990. By 1995, Mr. Rojas said, Pemex hopes annual investment will rise to about $4.5 billion.
 
Rising Domestic Energy Demand
 But after eight years in which domestic demand stagnated and oil exploration and development were sharply curtailed, industry analysts say Pemex will have to invest heavily merely to meet Mexico's domestic energy needs. Gasoline consumption already is rising at an annual rate of more than 5 percent.
Pemex plans to increase its daily crude oil production from 2.64 million barrels in 1990 to 3.1 million barrels by 1995. While domestic use is expected to rise from 1.36 million barrels a day to 1.7 million over the same period, exports are projected to grow by only about 120,000 barrels to 1.4 billion a day.
What incentive Pemex might have to expand more quickly is open to debate. Mexico already has had difficulty selling its heavy, hard-to-refine crude abroad. While some experts insist that Mexican oil would be more valuable out of the ground sooner rather than later, global prices in recent years have not provided much of an incentive.
And even as finance ministry officials say the oil industry has little difficulty securing outside financing, critics insist that politics, not economics, holds foreign equity capital at arm's length.
 
The People's Oil
 Mexico's Constitution defines the nation's hydrocarbon resources as the property of the people. And, in an interview last month, Mr. Salinas said that Mexico, unlike other developing nations, had no intention of inviting foreign exploration companies to share the profits from its oil.
The strongest, and apparently prevailing, arguments against foreign equity partnerships is the relative lack of risk in so-called risk contracts. So confident are Mexican officials in the richness of their oil fields that they see little reason to bring in outsiders to share the risk of exploration.
According to a recent issue of International Petroleum Finance, Pemex data show average production per well in the Gulf of Campeche at 9,933 barrels a day, compared with 250 barrels a day from Louisiana offshore wells.
But the counterarguments go beyond Mexico's need for drilling money. Pemex requires deep-water exploration technology, say the analysts and, even more pressingly, huge investments in its refineries.
 
The Free-Trade Test
 The next big test of Mexico's resolve to keep full control of its oil production will come in negotiations over the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement involving Canada, Mexico and the United States. American negotiators have fought hard to put the subject of Mexican oil on the table, and officials say it will ultimately be discussed.
But American officials and oil executives have not been the only ones to argue for greater flexibility at Pemex. "The situation is ripe for important changes in Mexican oil policy," Mr. Ramirez, the economist,said. "The domestic opposition to changing oil policy has been grossly exaggerated."
Even if Mexican officials were to determine that ownership of oil resources was negotiable, it would remain unclear what the United States might offer of commensurate value at the bargaining table.
"What could the United States possibly trade that's equivalent?" a former Pemex official asked. "There's nothing."

Vehicle Sales Fell 16.3% in Mid-September

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 24

 BODY:
Sales of American-made cars and trucks dropped 16.3 percent in mid-September compared with a strong period a year earlier, but the annual selling rate improved in recent weeks because of higher sales to rental fleets. Car dealers and analysts said consumer demand remained sluggish.
For the 10 days that ended on Sept. 20, cars sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.4 million, compared with 7.8 million a year earlier. Still, the latest rate is up from the 5.4 million reported for early September. By category, domestic car sales were off 21 percent in the latest period, to 162,949; domestic truck sales dropped 7.9 percent, to 106,653. 
 Maryann N. Keller, the automotive analyst for Furman Selz in New York, said the increase in fleet sales masked the fact that "consumer confidence is not very good."
Several analysts agreed, noting that consumers were worried about the security of their jobs and regarded the economy as shaky. "People are unwilling to step up to the plate and spend discretionary income," said Philip Fricke of Prudential Securities in New York.
Analysts said lean inventories had led to spot shortages that hurt sales. Some dealers said they were not getting as many 1992 models as they needed to meet demand. "If you don't have ready availability in dealer lots, it's going to limit consumer enthusiasm," said Jack V. Kirnan of Kidder, Peabody in New York.
Several dealers reported that showroom traffic had been uneven in recent weeks. "I have a good week, then a bad week," said Richard J. King, general sales manager of Continental Motors in Stamford, Conn. "I can't seem to put a good total month together." Mr. King added that changes in his advertising budget had so far had no effect on the number of customers who pass through his doors.
Dealers added that consumer confidence remained the biggest obstacle to better sales. "They still have a wait-and-see attitude through the winter months," said Ramsay Gillman, president of a number of dealerships in Houston, San Antonio and Austin, Tex. He added that credit approval remained a problem for some customers, but said that it was not signficantly hurting business.
 
G.M. Car Sales Down 24.1%
 The General Motors Corporation reported a drop in car sales of 24.1 percent for the 10-day period, to 75,805. G.M.'s light-truck sales fell 14.6 percent, to 43,505.
The Ford Motor Company sold 40,453 cars, a decline of 22.6 percent. The No. 2 auto maker posted sales of 34,687 light trucks, a drop of 10.5 percent. The Explorer four-wheel-drive vehicle had the only sales increase in its light-truck lineup.
The Chrysler Corporation's car sales, based on estimates by Ward's Automotive Reports, a trade publication, declined 37.2 percent in the period, to 15,500. But light-truck sales were estimated to have increased 11.5 percent, to 22,500. Chrysler reports sales only once a month.
 
'Transplants' Take 19% of Market
 Among the Japanese auto makers with American manufacturing operations, known as "transplants," the Honda Motor Company reported that sales jumped to 16,786 American-built cars, an increase of 25.6 percent. The Toyota Motor Corporation's car sales dropped 24.5 percent. Honda manufactures cars in Marysville, Ohio, and Toyota operates plants in Fremont, Calif. and Georgetown, Ky.
Over all, the Big Three lost ground in mid-September, as their share of the market for North American-built cars fell to 80.9 percent, from 85.7 percent a year ago.
The Japanese transplants picked up almost 5 points of market share, growing to 19.1 percent of the domestic car market, compared with 14.3 percent in the period last year.

HEADLINE: Bell Atlantic to Buy Metro Mobile

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
In one of the largest deals ever in the cellular telephone industry, the Bell Atlantic Corporation said yesterday that it had agreed to buy Metro Mobile CTS Inc. for nearly $2.5 billion in Bell Atlantic stock and assumption of debt.
Metro Mobile is considered a well-managed company whose business has been severely hurt by the recession, and analysts say it is one of the last large properties that is likely to come on to the market in desirable urban areas. The price represents $202 to $206 for each potential subscriber, depending on circumstances at the deal's closing. 
 That price is just below the company's asking price of $215, according to John E. Brennan, president and chief operating officer of Metro Mobile. "It's worth a lot more than what we paid for it," said Raymond W. Smith, Bell Atlantic's chairman and chief executive.
 
Period of Consolidation
 The Metro Mobile acquisition is the third-largest deal ever, after McCaw Cellular Communications Inc.'s acquisition of Lin Broadcasting and the GTE Corporation's purchase of Contel Cellular. In recent months, Ameritech Inc. and the BellSouth Corporation, which, like Bell Atlantic, are regional Bell companies, have also bought big cellular concerns. But their acquisitions, Cybertel Cellular and Graphic Scanning, respectively, are together only half the size of Metro Mobile.
The acquisition of the cellular telephone properties of Metro Mobile continues the consolidation of the cellular telephone industry. More than 1,000 companies provide such service, but 25 companies cover more than 80 percent of Americans.
 In the fast-growing cellular business, it was not immediately clear how large the Metro Mobile acquisition would make Bell Atlantic. But the deal is likely to make it at least the sixth-largest cellular service in the country, up from ninth. Bell Atlantic, based in Philadelphia, would have at least 33.6 million potential subscribers, the standard measure of size, up from 22.1 million as of June 30.
Bell Atlantic, already the biggest provider of local telephone service, said the deal would further consolidate its lead as the largest provider of cellular phone service on the East Coast. Its revenues last year totaled $12.3 billion. It has experienced slow growth in highly regulated businesses like local telephone service, but faster growth in lightly regulated new technologies like paging services and cellular telephones.
"Bell Atlantic absolutely had to do this deal," said Joel D. Gross, a telecommunications analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "Unless they want to wind up in the buggy whip business, they had better get more cellular franchises."
Because the deal is a stock swap, increasing the number of Bell Atlantic shares outstanding, the company's earnings will be hurt for the year after the close of the deal, Mr. Gross said. He cut his 1992 earnings estimate from $4 a share to $3.70, equal to the profit for 1991.
Metro Mobile, a New York City company whose revenues in the year ended Sept. 30, 1990, totaled $224 million, took on huge debts as it acquired smaller cellular franchises. It reported losses throughout the 1980's, including its largest loss, $80.1 million, last year. Metro Mobile also distributes propane, a business also acquired by Bell Atlantic in the deal.
As of June 30, Bell Atlantic had about 22.1 million potential subscribers, spread over 8 Northeastern states, including Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey. Metro Mobile had about 11.5 million potential subscribers in 8 states in the Northeast, South and Southwest, including Massachusetts, North Carolina, South Carolina and Arizona.
The industry measures growth in potential subscribers known as P.O.P.'s, or "points of presence," which includes children and teen-agers as well as adults. The industry considers itself a fast-growing business whose expansion would not be accurately gauged by actual subscribers.
Bell Atlantic has 283,000 actual subscribers, and Metro Mobile 180,000 actual subscribers. Nationally, there are 6.4 million subscribers, according to the latest June 30 figures from the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association.
Bell Atlantic stock closed at $46 yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, off $1.625.
Cellular telephones are mobile radiotelephones that can be carried in cars, briefcases or shirt pockets. They connect, through fixed radio transmitters known as cell sites, to conventional providers of local and long-distance service.
 
Hurt by Expansion
 Metro Mobile has been especially hurt by its expansion strategy and the recession. The company's negative cash flow has put it in technical default on a big bank loan. Metro Mobil projected average monthly revenue per subscriber of $85, but was recently getting only $60.
Mr. Brennan of Metro Mobile said practices that had helped the company grow had also hurt it. It paid agents a $300 commission for each subscriber, but when the recession hit, these additional customers tended to use their cellular phones rarely, spending $15 a month or less for calls.
Many of the customers bought service for second phones for family members who are light users. It will take four years or more for some of these new subscribers to pay back in future revenue the original $300 agent's commission.
The latest deal is one of many that are consolidating a fragmented industry. In 1989, hundreds of thousands of applicants clamored for billions of dollars worth of cellular telephone franchises. The Federal Communications Commission assigned the franchises by lottery, many of them to private citizens with no intention of operating a phone company but eager to sell the franchise rights to the highest bidders.
Analysts likened the resulting Balkanization of the cellular market to Humpty-Dumpty's great fall. Since then, big cellular companies have been buying the smaller franchise holders, as well as each other, in an attempt to put things back together again.
Many in the industry believe that only then will they be able to provide the kind of national service similar to the familiar residential and business telephones wired into walls. Cellular service is now unavailable or difficult to use in many places.
Bell Atlantic plans to pay $1.65 billion worth of Bell Atlantic stock, or 33 million shares. for Metro Mobile, under terms that would make the deal tax-free. Bell Atlantic also plans to assume about $800 million in Metro Mobile debt.
The deal is expected to close in March or April 1992, partly because of the need for a special order from Federal Judge Harold H. Greene, who oversaw the breakup of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company into the regional Bells.

HEADLINE: Senator Assails Drug Prices

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 24

 BODY:
Prescription-drug prices jumped by almost three times the rate of inflation during the first half of 1991, continuing the pattern of the 1980's, a Congressional report released today said. Congress needs to do more to curtail the "despicable behavior" of the prescription-drug industry, a Democratic Senator said.
While inflation for consumer goods during the decade was 58 percent, prescription drug prices rose 152 percent, said Senator David H. Pryor, chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, releasing a report by his panel's Democratic majority staff. "The findings in this report point to an industry whose despicable behavior can be characterized as nothing short of repulsive," Senator Pryor, who is from Arkansas, said at a news conference. 
 The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association responded by saying "prescription drugs are the best bargain in health care" because they help hold down total health-care costs.

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Falls Further, Index Shows

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Consumer spirits, which wilted this summer, continued to droop after Labor Day -- one more sign that the recovery in consumer spending continued to be unusually weak.
"The prime worry is jobs," said Fabian Linden, executive director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research Center. The closely watched Conference Board index of consumer confidence, released yesterday, logged its third straight monthly decline in September, to 72.7, from 76.1 in August, on a 1985 base of 100. 
 The trouble, said Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch, is that anxiety over layoffs in key industries -- services, computers and weapons, among others -- is overwhelming the good news from lower interest rates and inflation. "There's not enough income and too much insecurity," he said.
Nonetheless, there are scattered signs that spending, which probably dipped last month, may actually be holding up a bit better this month. The University of Michigan Survey of Consumer Sentiment -- whose preliminary results for early September showed a slight improvement -- indicates a slightly less worrisome trend in consumers' mood.
Richard T. Curtin, who conducts the University of Michigan survey, said: "Over the last several months we've been drifting sideways. That's very different from six months of decline."
And some retailers are more optimistic.
"Our store sales have been better in September, said Ira Silver, chief economist for J. C. Penney.
Carl Steidtmann, a retailing consultant at Management Horizons in Columbus, Ohio, who works with apparel chains, said, "Most people are telling me that September is a little better than August, although not much,"
Merchants continue to count on a better Christmas sales season than last year's, which was dreadful. "Most people are still hopeful about Christmas and most plan to have more inventory," Mr. Steidtmann said.
The Conference Board's index, basically, has retraced more than one-third of its surge immediately after the Persian Gulf war. The board's Survey of Consumer Attitudes, conducted in the first weeks of every month, covers 5,000 households in the United States.
The board's most striking finding is that consumers are getting more, not less pessimistic about job prospects. More than 40.2 percent of survey respondants thought jobs were hard to get versus 35.5 percent in April.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
For Steel, Small Means Healthier

BYLINE: By Jonathan P. Hicks

 BODY:
BIG steel companies, which saw some of their brightest days before the recession took hold, are once again faced with plunging profits and outright losses. But the smaller, second-tier steel producers have generally not seen the profound losses of their bigger counteparts.
Companies like the Nucor Corporation, Birmingham Steel and the Quanex Corporation have been holding their own during the recession, with only a little sagging. And analysts say their prospects are brighter than those of big steel once the economic recovery takes hold. The reason, analysts say, stems from fundamental differences between the cost structures of the smaller competitors and those of big producers like the USX Corporation, Bethlehem Steel and the LTV Corporation, which have billions of dollars in sales to many industries and an array of products made in several plants. The big companies typically have expensive, large headquarters and produce raw materials -- iron ore and coal -- in mines they own outright. 
 "Some of the smaller steel companies are big fish in a small pond," said John Jacobson, an analyst with AUS Consultants in Philadelphia. "They cast their lot with a small set of industries and concentrate on a small number of markets."
Smaller steel companies generally have lower overhead, too, as well as nonunion labor forces that work under far more flexible work rules. "A maintenance worker in a big steel mill does mostly that," Mr. Jacobson said. "But a worker in a small, non-union shop does a little of everything."
Heading the list of smaller steelmakers whose stocks are currently in favor is Nucor, the giant of the so-called mini-mill companies. Nucor has departed from the tradition of mini-mills -- which produce steel from scrap, mainly for construction -- by making a bold foray into the market for sheet steel, which is used by automobile and appliance makers. By producing sheet steel by a process that is cheaper and less labor intensive than its big-steel rivals', Nucor has been praised by analysts, who expect the company to show robust growth for the next few years. Nucor's stock, which traded around 60 at the beginning of the year, closed yesterday at $81.25, up 62.5 cents.
Not everyone agrees on Nucor's prospects. "Nucor is a great company from its potential and it is well managed," said Charles Bradford, an analyst with UBS Securities. But he questions the timing on buying Nucor stock.
"The company's primary market is in commercial construction such as thrift stores and shopping centers," he said. "It is not a buoyant business and I don't expect it to be for another year and a half or more." Mr. Bradford said he expected Nucor's earnings to rise to $4 next year, from a depressed $2.75 for the current year and $3.50 a share in 1990.
Analysts are also giving high marks to Birmingham Steel, a mini-mill company based in Birmingham, Ala., that is a significant producer of steel bar products used in the construction industry. While that industry has been deeply affected by the recession, Birmingham Steel has made its mark by acquiring small steel companies, cutting operating costs and improving efficiency.
"They are able to make money because they acquire old plants at low prices, and develop a labor force with incentives like a good profit-sharing program," Mr. Jacobson said.
The company's earnings have been hurt by the drop in the construction industry, but analysts expect sales and earnings to rise this year because of higher prices, increased volume and the absence of restructuring charges.
Mr. Bradford said Birmingham "is doing a lot of things to become efficient, and I look at the company as an improvement stock." He added that he expected earnings of $1 a share for the current fiscal year and "perhaps as much as $1.75 in the following fiscal year."
Aldo J. Mazzaferro Jr., a metals analyst with C. J. Lawrence Inc., praises the Quanex Corporation's prospects, saying he expects the company to double its earnings in the next two years. Quanex, based in Houston, is a producer of high-quality bar products used in engine components and machinery. But the company's success will have less to do with increased efficiencies in steel production than with expansion into the aluminum fabrication business, Mr. Mazzaferro says. Quanex has said that in the next two years it will increase its annual production capacity of aluminum to 300 million pounds, from 50 million pounds.
While many of these companies have the same kinds of problems of their larger counterparts, they are nonetheless better off because "it takes a lot to happen in the economy for big steel to rebound," Mr. Jacobson said. "It's not at all clear that integrated steel will be a good investment any time soon."

HEADLINE: Lawyer Pleads Guilty to Fraud

BYLINE: By RONALD SULLIVAN

 BODY:
A prominent Manhattan divorce lawyer pleaded guilty yesterday to stealing more than $1.28 million from well-known matrimonial lawyers through a series of fraudulent investment schemes.
The plea from the lawyer, Alvin Ashley, was unexpected, coming just a week after his indictment on grand larceny charges. 
 Acting Justice Herbert J. Adlerberg of State Supreme Court said he would sentence the 57-year-old defendant on Dec. 3. As part of a plea bargain, Mr. Ashley faces 1 to 9 years in state prison. He also faces disbarment. Had he gone to trial, he would have faced 5 to 15 years if convicted.
Although the indictment charges Mr. Ashley with stealing $1.28 million, Manhattan prosecutors said he stole more than $4.75 million from unsuspecting clients and others over six years.
They said he ended up broke because of a sagging economy, bad business decisions, and a luxurious style of living that included gambling sprees to Atlantic City, $400 bottles of wine and a regular table reserved at Le Cirque.
"His victims included his clients, former clients, and colleagues, relatives and neighbors," said Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan District Attorney. "Unfortunately, it appears that the stolen money has all been spent, mostly on high living."
Mr. Ashley pleaded guilty to making a counterfeit copy of $900,000 in Pepsico stock owned by Herbert Feinberg of 138 Madison Avenue and then offering the forged stock certificate as collateral for an investment loan from Halsley Investments.
In three other instances, he pleaded guilty to stealing from matrimonial lawyers: $90,000 from Julia Perles, $164,000 from John Vassallo, and $38,000 from Elliot Samuelson. He also admitted to stealing $92,000 from Georg Heine, a Greek businessman.
Mr. Ashley, who lives in White Plains, is the former president of the New York chapter of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers.

HEADLINE: U.S. EXTENDS DEAL FOR SOVIET LOANS

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 24

 BODY:
Agriculture Secretary Edward R. Madigan announced today that he was changing loan guarantees for the Soviet Union to make them more attractive to commercial banks.
In response to an urgent request from the Soviet authorities, President Bush made $315 million in loan guarantees available immediately in late August. But the Soviets have only been able to obtain loans with $104 million of the guarantees, using the credit lines set up before the unsuccessful hard-line coup in the Soviet Union last month. 
 Commercial bankers have been especially concerned for the last month that they would never recover the unguaranteed portion of any new loans if the Soviet Union rescheduled its debt or if the Soviet Union disintegrated and the republics refused to honor foreign debts incurred by the central Government.
Until now, the loan guarantees have covered 98 percent of the principal and the first 4.5 percentage points of interest on the 98 percent of principal.
 
'There'll Be More Takers'
 Mr. Madigan said he had increased the guarantees on the remaining $211 million to 100 percent of principal and interest equal to the prevailing rate for 52-week Treasury bills. That interest rate is currently 5.2 percent.
A senior official at an American comercial bank who insisted on not being identified said the expanded guarantees should be more than adequate to insure that they are used.
"I suspect there'll be more takers than available loan guarantees," he said. "They've cleared a major hurdle."
Mr. Madigan's action came after several members of Congress at a House Agriculture Committee hearing this morning criticized the absence of new Agriculture Department programs to help the Soviet Union.
"I think the inertia of the Soviet bureaucracy is being quickly overtaken by the inertia of the U.S.D.A.," said Representative Timothy J. Penny, Democrat of Minnesota.
But Mr. Madigan said in a telephone interview this evening that the decision to expand the loan guarantees had been made at a meeting on Monday afternoon. The meeting ended too late to announce the decision, which was released after the close of trading today, he said.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Ideas for New York City: Some Are Old, Some Are New

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's plan to prime New York City's economy with public works, an expansive vision of new high-tech "people movers," subway lines and huge housing complexes, is actually a melange of proposals, some bold and new but many old and languishing.
The Governor presented his plan yesterday, backed by stirring music and an elaborate, handsome film, offering a $7 billion wish list to restore the city's luster. 
But some of the projects will require money that state legislative leaders fear is unavailable. The fate of other proposals will depend more on a turnaround in the region's economy, and in particular on its real-estate market, than on any encouraging words from Mr. Cuomo and other public officials.
Mayor David N. Dinkins and his aides had mixed reactions to the Governor's proposals, praising their promise but still trying to sort out what they would mean and expressing wariness about how much they might help the city.
"It's a great vote of confidence in our city," Mr. Dinkins said. "How much we get done, and how soon, is another question." He added, "Just because a proposal's old doesn't mean it's not a good idea."
At the same time, City Hall was grappling with its own proposals for cutting costs further in the hope of winning more help from the state. [Page B4.]
Two projects account for $4.5 billion, or 64 percent, of the Governor's $7 billion plan: huge housing and office developments that have been proposed for years at Hunters Point, on the East River waterfront in Queens and at what had been known until recently as Trump City, along the Hudson River on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
Almost all the money to develop the sites would come from private investors, not the city or the state, and both projects have long been stalled. New York has a glut of office space and market-rate apartments, and investors have been unwilling to put up the capital to make the visions reality. The relatively small changes proposed by Mr. Cuomo are not likely to jump-start either project, many public officials said privately yesterday.
 
One Project Under Way
 The bulk of the Governor's proposals have existed, in one form or another, for some time. One of them -- a plan to renovate the Long Island Rail Road's terminal at Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan -- was approved long ago and is actually under way.
Others, like a renovation of Grand Central Terminal and a new $612 million link between the overcrowded Queens Boulevard subway line and the new 63d Street tunnel under the East River, are part of a $10.6 billion five-year capital plan that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has been crafting for a year.
Perhaps the foremost innovation proposed by Mr. Cuomo is a light-rail train line connecting La Guardia and Kennedy International Airports with mass-transit lines in Queens. Many experts said they thought this project had an excellent chance of being built because it could be financed by a new airport tax.
Even if the Governor was not offering large new amounts of state money, his commitment and zeal could be of more than psychic value, some city officials contended. "Grand vision and strong reassurance are sometimes what it takes to trigger the private investment we need," said Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President.
These are the major elements of Mr. Cuomo's plan:
 
Airport Rail Lines
 The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey would be the prime mover behind this project, which would connect all three of the region's major airports with mass transit. While virtually all details must still be resolved, the concept calls for Kennedy and La Guardia Airports to be linked by an automated people-mover or other kind of light rail line that likely would run down the medians of the Van Wyck Expressway and Grand Central Parkway. The line would connect Kennedy with the Long Island Rail Road terminal in Jamaica, Queens, and would run from La Guardia west to other railroad or subway stations in Long Island City, Queens.
The Port Authority would finance a similar line to link Newark International Airport with mass-transit lines in downtown Newark.
Unlike most components of Mr. Cuomo's plan, the $1.6 billion rail line proposed for Queens would be backed by a specific financing source: a $3 tax for departing passengers at the airports, which was approved last year by Congress for airports that want to expand or improve safety. The tax would generate about $100 million a year in new money, Port Authority officials estimated, and that could be used to finance the light rail line. The proposal must go to the Port Authority's board for approval.
 
Queens Subway Lines
 The E and F subway lines that run under Queens Boulevard are the most congested in the city. The lines cannot handle additional trains during rush hours because their tunnel under the East River cannot accommodate more trains. Planners have wanted for years to ease the overcrowding by connecting some trains on the E and F lines with the Q line that runs in a new tunnel from 63d Street in Manhattan to Long Island City in Queens. That would allow 15 more trains to be run under Queens Boulevard during rush hours.
A proposal to connect the two lines, at a cost of $612 million, is in the five-year capital plan that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has developed over the last year. It will be presented to legislative leaders in Albany next week. The fate of the $10.6 billion proposal -- the authority's third five-year capital plan -- is uncertain. Assembly Speaker Mel Miller said yesterday that he could earmark only $6 billion for the M.T.A. "Beyond the $6 billion, I don't really see where we get more money," he said.
 
Renovating Rail Stations
 Rebuilding the L.I.R.R. terminal at Pennsylvania Station is part of the five-year capital plan that was passed by the Legislature years ago and that the M.T.A. is to complete this year. About $157 million will have been spent in all. Among the renovations, on which ground is about to be broken: a new street entrance at 34th Street and Seventh Avenue; new elevators, escalators and stairways; a new waiting area and a new cooling system.
The five-year plan that the M.T.A. will soon take to Albany includes $126 million to rebuild parts of Grand Central Terminal, including new wiring, plumbing, ventilation and some structural work. After legislators had complained about a $11.5 billion capital plan that the transit agency presented last spring, the M.T.A. scaled back its proposal by $900 million two weeks ago. Among the items dropped was a $20 million proposal to reconfigure the station's interior to improve the flow of passengers during rush hour.
 
Second Avenue Subway
 Twenty years ago, the city spent $87 million to dig sections of tunnel for a Second Avenue subway, the first new line in decades. It was abandoned in 1975, during the fiscal crisis, after the structural shell of three sections that covered a total of slightly more than 20 blocks was completed.
The Governor proposed spending $22 million to design and plan the possible completion of the line in the next five years. Actual construction, whose cost is unknown, would not begin until at least 1997 under Mr. Cuomo's plan.
 
Hunters Point
 This $2 billion development, with as many as 6,000 apartments and more than 2 million square feet of office space, has been planned for years on a site in Queens, just across the East River from the United Nations Building. Three government agencies are behind it, including the State Urban Development Corporation, the city and the Port Authority. The city pledged long ago to spend $30 million and the Port Authority promised $125 million, to be used to help prepare the site and to buy some of the land.
The city's Board of Estimate formally approved the project in August 1990, at its final meeting before the board was dissolved. But the project has languished for a lack of private investors, who would finance virtually all of it. Mr. Cuomo proposed yesterday that the Urban Development Corporation create a subsidiary that would be solely responsible for Hunters Point. He offered no new money.
But some elected officials and some developers interested in participating in the Hunters Point project said they thought there was value in the Governor's commitment. "We see a renewed emphasis in moving the project forward," said Richard L. Higgins, vice president of the Trotwood Corporation, a subsidiary of the Dreyfus Corporation that is interested in developing part of Hunters Point.
"That the Governor is putting it at the top of his economic development agenda is a wonderful thing," said Mr. Higgins, who served until last year as Mr. Cuomo's Housing Commissioner.
 
Riverside South
 Over the last six years, this project was known first as Television City and then Trump City, named after the developer who had hoped to make it a landmark of contemporary urban planning on the Upper West Side. Donald J. Trump failed to attract NBC to the site in 1987, and then, after his financial reversals last year, he agreed in March to scale back significantly his planned apartment and office complex, in return for support from civic groups that had fought the project.
The proposal has not yet gone before the appropriate city agencies for public approval, and it too faces a very troubled real-estate market. Mr. Trump has indicated he would still like to build part of the development, whose overall cost the state estimates at $2.5 billion. All would come from private sources.
Mr. Cuomo proposed yesterday to spend $1 million to begin examining the feasibility of moving an 18-block stretch of the West Side Highway eastward to permit a large public park to be built on the site along the Hudson River waterfront.
Proponents of the project would like the highway moved. But several real-estate executives said the Governor's initiative, by itself, could not possibly overcome the project's serious financial problems.
 
Science and Business Library
 Mr. Cuomo proposed that the New York Public Library create an international center for information on science, industry and business in the building that was once home to the B. Altman department store on Fifth Avenue at 34th Street. He said the center would cost $82 million, to be split equally by the library, private contributions and the city and state. The Governor also proposed that the city and the state each donate $7.5 million to start raising funds for the center.

HEADLINE: Senate Votes to Extend Jobless Benefits

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 24

 BODY:
The Senate tonight passed a bill 69 to 30 providing extended unemployment benefits for about three million people who have been out of work for more than half a year.
President Bush opposes the $6.1 billion measure, which is similar to one he killed last month, because it would be financed by adding to the deficit. He urged support of a less expensive bill sponsored by Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader. But the $2.4 billion Dole measure was defeated earlier, with only Republicans in support. 
 Senator Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas, sponsored the bill that passed tonight. It is expected to be quickly reconciled with a similar, $6.3 billion bill passed last week by the House.
The issue is expected to provide the Democrats with a serious chance to override a Bush veto for the first time, as senators from both parties complained that the economy was not recovering from recession very quickly, if at all.
 
Sterner Bill Expected
 Tonight's vote, with 13 Republicans joining 56 Democrats to defeat the 30 Republicans who opposed the measure, was not a clear test of the veto override prospects because the bill that comes back from conference is expected to be tougher for Mr. Bush to kill than the Bentsen bill.
The Bensten bill, like the House bill, would provide up to 20 weeks of additional benefits for jobless workers who have exhausted regular benefits, which stop after 26 weeks in most states. The Dole bill would have provided up to 10 weeks of additional benefits and would have been financed by selling unused radio frequencies and tightening up on student loan repayments.
The Bentsen bill, like the one Mr. Bush killed in August, requires Mr. Bush to take two separate steps before extended benefits are paid. First he must sign it and then sign a separate declaration of emergency under last year's budget act before the benefits can flow. Last month he signed the bill but did not issue the declaration.
The House bill combines those two steps into one, so Mr. Bush must sign or veto the bill. That provision is expected to emerge from a House-Senate conference in the next few days.
Besides killing Mr. Dole's measure, the Senate rejected a measure sponsored by Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, that would have paid for the benefits with a cut in capital gains taxes and other tax changes.
The Democrats continued their attack on the Administration as more interested in aiding foreigners in difficulty than in helping Americans in need. Senator James Sasser, Democrat of Tennessee and chairman of the Budget Committee, said, "This administration can liquidate the debt of Malawi but can't help the unemployed factory worker in Maine."
The Republicans denounced the Democrats as heedless of the tax burden the growing national deficit and interest payments would impose on the next generation. Senator Dole said the message of the Bentsen bill was that "Congress does not care how big the Federal deficit grows."
Mr. Dole also insisted that while President Bush would sign his bill, and thus provide help to the unemployed, Mr. Bush would veto the Democratic measures and be sustained, causing needy unemployed workers to go without the extended benefits.
 
Which Way the Recession
 Richard G. Darman, Mr. Bush's budget director, has said that the Administration would support the Dole bill, although he believed that extended benefits were unnecessary because the recession was coming to an end.
That view got little support in the Senate today. Even Mr. Gramm said, "It may well be that the economy turned the corner last month, but it sure didn't leave any skid marks when it turned."
Democrats also argued that spending the money under a budget emergency declaration was proper because the recession was just the sort of problem that the emergency provisions of the budget act were aimed at. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said, "The budget agreement was intended to provide flexibility in dealing with economic problems, not as a device for the Administration to deny help to working families enduring hard times because the economy has gone bad."
Unemployment insurance covers about half of all workers and provides benefits of about half of the salary most recently earned up to ceilings that vary greatly from state to state.
 
Making It Easier to Qualify
 Current law provides extended benefits of up to 13 weeks, paid for equally from state and Federal funds. But even though the national unemployment rate was 6.8 percent for August, workers in only one state, Rhode Island, and in Puerto Rico were covered.
Democrats complained that the extended benefits fund had grown to nearly $8 billion but the program was too narrowly applied. Extended benefits are paid when joblessness among a state's workers who are covered by unemployment insurance reaches 6 percent, or when the rate reaches 5 percent if the level of insured joblessness exceeds by one-fifth the average level in that state over the last two years.
Under the Bentsen bill, the measuring standard would be total unemployment, not insured unemployment, on the ground that when there is widespread joblessness of any sort, it is harder to find a job. And all the benefits would be paid from Federal funds.
In states with 8 percent unemployment, averaged over the last six months, up to 20 weeks of additional benefits could be paid. Workers in Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi and West Virginia would become eligible, as Rhode Islanders and Puerto Ricans are now.
In states with 7 percent unemployment, 13 additional weeks of benefits could be paid. New York and California, the nation's two most populous states, are in that group. In all other states, 7 weeks of additional benefits could be paid.
The reach of the Bentsen bill would be temporary, extending only until next July, except for a provision affecting people who leave the armed services. A permanent change would make them eligible for 26 weeks of benefits, instead of the current 13 weeks. They would be able to start collecting after one week, instead of the current four. Both changes would put them under the same rules as people who leave civilian jobs.

HEADLINE: FAILING TO COMMUNICATE;
Dispute Over Settlements and Loan Deal Is Symptom of a Deeper U.S.-Israel Strain

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 24

 BODY:
The dispute between the Bush Administration and Israel over loan guarantees and restrictions on Israeli settlements underscores the stunning lack of communication between two Governments on some of the most sensitive issues between them.
"This whole crisis is symptomatic of our relationship," said an Administration Middle East expert. "We have this ritualized relationship, with all of the structures of closeness, but people don't really talk to each other or hear each other, because there is no real private honesty. Everyone is afraid to be honest, because they are aware that there are some real underlying differences over the question of the occupied territories." 
 Interviews in recent days with many American and Israeli officials and others involved in the dispute suggest that Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir badly miscalculated when he brushed aside a Bush Administration request in early September to put off a request for $10 billion in loan guarantees or face a confrontation over Jewish settlements in the occupied territories.
 
Bush-Shamir Misunderstanding
 It is now evident that Israel's supporters in Congress have decided not to fight the Administration and will postpone dealing with the loan guarantee issue until after a Middle East peace conference begins.
The lack of communication between Mr. Shamir and President Bush goes back to the very first meeting between the two men in the Oval Office in April 1989, when Mr. Bush expressed his displeasure over Israeli settlement-building practices and Mr. Shamir responded, "It won't be a problem."
Mr. Shamir meant that if the Israelis really have an Arab partner for peace talks, settlements will not be an obstacle to peace. What Mr. Bush thought he heard, though, was a commitment from Mr. Shamir to slow down or stop settlement-building, and when just the opposite happened as soon as Mr. Shamir returned to Israel, the seeds of Mr. Bush's personal wrath with Mr. Shamir were firmly planted.
 
Loan Guarantees Delayed
 Mr. Bush's focus on Israeli settlements grows out of a longstanding American belief that an accord between Israel and the Arabs will only come about in a trade of land for peace, and if Israel builds housing all over the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, no trade will be possible.
The tension between Mr. Shamir and Mr. Bush dating back to that first meeting hung over their relationship. In early 1990, Israel appealed to the Bush Administration for $400 million in housing loan guarantees to help resettle Soviet immigrants who were flooding in.
The guarantees sailed through Congress, but they did not become available for almost nine months while Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d negotiated with the Israeli Foreign Minister, David Levy, an unusual letter in which Israel for the first time promised not to use the money to settle Soviet Jews "beyond the green line" dividing Israel proper from the territories occupied in the 1967 War. The expectation in Washington was that as a result of that letter there would be no increase in Israeli settlement activity of any kind, whereas the view in Jerusalem was that Israel had agreed not to spend the $400 million in the territories, but that it could spend its own money.
Mr. Levy also agreed to provide Mr. Baker with certain financial data to assure the Americans that their money was not going into the West Bank.
 
Baker and Levy Letter
 The Levy letter was signed on Oct. 2, 1990, and the $400 million in guarantees was granted. After the new year, though, it became apparent to the Israelis that the number of Soviet Jews that could descend on them could reach a million, far more than anticipated, and therefore their housing and absorption requirements would be much greater.
In between all of that the Persian Gulf War intruded and Israel sought a special aid infusion from the Bush Administration -- over and above the annual $3 billion it receives for economic and military assistance -- to compensate for losses it incurred from Iraqi Scud missile attacks and increased defense spending.
The Bush Administration, beholden to Israel for not retaliating against Iraq, agreed after a period of bargaining to a one-time grant of $650 million in cash -- on the condition that Israel not ask for any more extra aid of any kind until after Labor Day, when the Administration hoped it would be too late to get the request through Congress this fiscal year.
Between March and Labor Day, the President was privately seething over what he believed was Israeli non-compliance with the Levy letter of October and the fact that every time Mr. Baker came to Israel on his peace missions a new settlement was erected. Despite the Levy letter, Israeli settlements in the occupied territories were increasing instead of decreasing and the financial data Israel promised was not forthcoming. At a news conference on July 1, Mr. Bush said he did not think there "ought to be a quid pro quo" between a halt on settlements freeze and loan guarantees, but he implored the Israelis to live up to the Levy letter.
 
Lobbying Campaign in U.S.
 But Mr. Baker was obsessed with putting a peace conference together, and while he regularly spoke to the Israelis about problems he had with settlements, he acceded to their demand that a halt on settlement not be made a precondition for the peace conference, and sold that to the Arabs.
The Israeli Government began talking about the need for $10 billion in housing loan guarantees and the Israeli lobby, the American Israel-Public Affairs Committee, or Aipac, and every other major American Jewish group began organizing a lobbying campaign that would culminate after Labor Day to insure that the Israelis got the money through Congress.
The Israeli Government was aware of how President Bush was feeling, because Israel's Ambassador to Washington, Zalman Shoval, was hearing it from his sources. But Mr. Shamir apparently did not take his warnings seriously. On June 22, Mr. Shoval, in an unsual move, went public. Asked in an interview with Israel Radio whether the $10 billion in loan guarantees was assured, he answered: "Very probably there will be a difficulty. The Government of Israel with all the data in its hands may have to decide whether the issue of settlement is a priority or that the issue of aid is a priority. Sometimes there are moments and there are issues where governments have to take decisions."
For his candor, Mr. Shoval was berated by his superiors. Mr. Shamir apparently thought the Administration was simply using the loan issue as leverage to get him to say yes to Mr. Baker's peace conference.
But he had received other warnings. On July 25, Vice President Dan Quayle personally warned the Israeli Defense Minister, Moshe Arens, when he visited Washington that linkage was a possibility if Israel did not curb settlements.
In early August, though, Mr. Shamir finally told Mr. Baker that Israel would come to his peace conference and Israeli officials said at the time that they assumed that the Shamir "yes" to the conference meant that the housing guarantees were assured.
While Baker aides say they never told the Israelis that, Mr. Baker, still focused on his peace conference, also did not explicitly tell Mr. Shamir that the Administration intended to hold up the guarantees until it got even more restrictions on Israeli settlements.
A few days later, after Mr. Baker returned from the Middle East, senior Administration Middle East experts began focusing on the gauarantees. It became clear to them then that President Bush had no intention of granting the guarantees without restrictions that would finally either freeze or severely curtail Israeli building. Mr. Bush is said to have literally laughed at the notion that the sort of understandings Mr. Levy agreed to for the $400 million guarantee would be satisfactory for the $10 billion.
 Meanwhile, Aipac and other Jewish organizations were putting the finishing touches on their lobbying campaigns for the guarantees.
Over the Labor Day weekend, Secretary Baker telephoned Mr. Shamir twice and asked him to delay the loan request for four months. But Mr. Shamir said he could not do that. He had just concluded an exhausting domestic budget battle in which he agreed to increase the defense budget by cutting the housing budget and the only way he could limit the damage to his housing budget was by assuming that the loan guarantees would come this fiscal year. It was already written into the Israeli budget.
The guarantees would enable Israel to borrow $10 billion from banks over the next five years at reduced interest rates, since the United States would be giving its assurance that it would meet any principal or interest payments that Israel could not make. Israeli officials, noting that Israel's credit rating is fairly good, say there would be no need for Washington to pay any money.
When Mr. Baker got no satisfaction from Mr. Shamir, the Administration turned to Congress to delay the issue for 120 days, which it now appears ready to do.
In four months, the Administration will again try to link Israeli housing guarantees with some sort of suspension of Israeli settlements. But the Administration apparently hopes that by then the Arab-Israeli peace conference will be well underway and they can use their leverage over Israel on that issue to help forge the first interim deal in that conference: Israel suspends settlements in return for the Arab countries' suspending their boycott of Israel and the Palestinians' suspending their uprising.

HEADLINE: Patrol Officers in New York To Test Semiautomatic Guns

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES

 BODY:
The New York City Police Department, which has steadfastly resisted the trend toward arming police officers with quicker-loading, more powerful guns, has decided for the first time to let uniformed officers test semiautomatic pistols, a police official said yesterday.
Until now, the department has argued that the extra firepower made the weapons unsafe in densely populated urban areas. The police union favors 9-millimeter weapons, saying officers need them because of the proliferation of high-power semiautomatic and automatic guns in the hands of criminals. 
 First Deputy Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said the department would issue 225 9-millimeter pistols to a handful of closely supervised uniformed officers. In addition, 94 more pistols will be used by special officers and detectives in the Housing Police, said Chief DeForrest W. Taylor, the chief of the Housing Police.
Mr. Kelly said the department still thinks the 9-millimeter guns are too dangerous for general use. But it is now willing to experiment with them, he said, "because of concern voiced by the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association and because the New York City Police Department wants to collect its own data in our own working environment."
The officials spoke at a hearing in Manhattan called by State Senator Emanuel R. Gold of Queens, who said he wanted to open a public debate on the choice of weapons.
About 500 nonuniformed officers -- detectives and narcotics police -- already have 9-millimeter pistols and the Transit Authority police began issuing them to subway patrol officers earlier this year. But until now, the department has been adamant in its refusal to give the guns to officers who patrol the streets. There are currently 27,250 members of the department.
Mr. Kelly emphasized that the weapons would be issued to only three officers in each precinct and only to those who accompany sergeants in patrol cars. That is to insure that those carrying the more powerful weapons will be closely supervised, Mr. Kelly said, emphasizing that the 6-shot, .38-caliber revolver will remain the official service firearm of the Police Department.
 
Reloaded in an Instant
 In general, 9-millimeter pistols fire bullets faster than .38-caliber revolvers and the bullets have more penetrating power. They can be reloaded in an instant by inserting a magazine, while a six-shooter requires slipping bullets one at a time into a barrel. The 9-millimeter pistols, to go to each of the 75 precincts within the next 30 days, fire up to 17 bullets without reloading.
Scores of police departments across the nation have been adopting 9-millimeter guns. "It's a modern trend," said Hubert Williams, the former police director of Newark who is president of the Police Foundation, a nonprofit police research organization. "Police departments are moving in that direction in larger numbers, places like Newark and Washington, D.C. The 9-millimeter is rapidly becoming the weapon of choice for police officers."
Mr. Williams, added, however, that because of the public safety issue, "New York is being very prudent, doing some tests, and that's a wise decision to make before they decide what direction to go in."
"Nine millimeter" and ".38 caliber" refer to the diameter of a gun barrel and are similar in size. A semiautomatic pistol, like a revolver, fires a round each time the trigger is squeezed.
Phil Caruso, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, told the State Senate Committee that introducing the 9-millimeter was overdue and called the .38-caliber an "anachronistic" weapon that is difficult to reload "under tense combat conditions."
Recalling the death of Scott Gadell, a 22-year-old rookie officer who was shot with a 9-millimeter semiautomatic while reloading his pistol during a gunfight in Far Rockaway, Queens, in 1986, he said the department had "a long history of resistance to technological change."
He attributed such resistance to "purely political and economic considerations," including a fear of more claims of police brutality if the gun is adopted and the cost of training.
Deputy Commissioner Kelly, however, said that the .38 was still the safest and most efficient weapon and that there were misconceptions about the 9-millimeter's effectiveness.
He said that the semiautomatic tends to jam, whereas the .38-caliber does not. He disagreed that police officers were "outgunned," noting that in 67 gunfights in 1990, 20 percent of bullets fired by police officers hit assailants, while only 6 percent of bullets fired at officers hit their mark.
But a real concern, he said, is accidental shootings, with nearly 14 accidental firings per 1,000 semiautomatics, compared with less than one accident for every 1,000 revolvers. He attributed the difference to a trigger pull that is too light in semiautomatics.
Chief Taylor said that the housing police would also test the guns, but he too supported the continued use of the .38-caliber in high-rise housing projects. Ninety-four 9-millimeter pistols will be issued, mostly to narcotics specialists and detectives, he said.
 
Senator Supports New Gun
 After hearing testimony, Senator Gold said he was convinced that the 9-millimeter was effective, reliable and safe and that police officials were overly concerned.
Of 4,200 transit police officers, 1,000 have been using the 9-millimeter pistols in the subways, said Assistant Transit Police Chief Walter D. Mickulas. The guns have been used in three subway incidents; there have been no accidental discharges, he said.
Most proponents said a major benefit of the 9-millimeter was what Chief Mickulas called "the psychological advantage" police officers felt they had in carrying the weapons.
"I think I'll feel safer that I'm not at a disadvantage from the start like now," said Officer Chris Minogue as he patrolled West 38th Street. "If a guy knows that I have the same firepower as he does, he might think twice before taking me on."
A half-dozen other officers in the Midtown South Precinct favored the 9-millimeter. But some wondered if they would ever get to use the gun. "To be honest," Officer Mark Mulitz said, "I'll only believe this when I have the gun in my holster."

HEADLINE: THE GATES HEARINGS;
Excerpts From C.I.A. Official's Testimony on Nomination of Gates as Director

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 24

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from testimony by Charles E. Allen, a former national intelligence officer for counterterrorism for the Central Intelligence Agency, at the hearing of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on the nomination of Robert M. Gates as Director of Central Intelligence, with questioning by Senators Sam Nunn, David L. Boren and Frank H. Murkowski. The transcript was provided by the Federal News Service.
 
STATEMENT BY CHARLES E. ALLEN
 . . . I was involved in the White House Iranian initiative from September 1985 until it became publicly known in November 1986. . . . 
 During the first phase, I was asked by Lieutenant Colonel North to coordinate the collection of intelligence on the Iranian initiative and to protect closely this White House effort. During this period, I kept Mr. Casey and Mr. McMahon fully informed on the intelligence collected. Moreover, some of the intelligence was provided to Mr. Clair George, the Deputy Director of Operations. In keeping with Lieutenant Colonel North's instruction, I did not inform Mr. Gates, even though he technically was my immediate supervisor as Chairman of the National Intelligence Council.
During the period September 1985 until January 1986, I never once mentioned this activity or my role in it to Mr. Gates, although I learned after the initiative became public that he may have had some knowledge of it in December 1985.
My first direct contact with Mr. Gates on the Iranian initiative came after the Presidential finding was signed on 17 January 1986. . . .
Throughout the winter and spring of 1986, I occasionally briefed Mr. Gates on the status of the initiative and provided him with some, but not all, of the intelligence that was being collected. . . .
I saw Mr. Gates on 1 October 1986. I expressed concern to Mr. Gates over the problems with the White House-directed initiative and its eroding operational security. . . .
I told Mr. Gates that I was concerned about one other aspect of the Iranian initiative: the impasse over the price of arms being sold to the Iranians. I said that I could not prove it. But I thought that proceeds from the arms sales might have been diverted to support the contras in Central America.
 
Briefing Gates and Casey
 I recall in the context of that meeting describing the impasse over the pricing of the Hawk spare parts and the refusal of the Iranian Government officials involved to pay for the parts because the price was five to six times their actual cost, noting the desperate financial straits of Manucher Ghorbanifar [the Iranian arms dealer and middleman in the Reagan Administration arms sales to Iran] and his frantic call to me in August 1986 when he insisted his commission on the price of Hawk spare parts averaged only about 40 percent, mentioning Lieutenant Colonel North's reference to the reserve and his conversation with me on 9 September 1986, an indication that substantial profits were being accrued from the arms to Iran -- from the arms sales to Iran, pointing out that Mr. Hakim and Maj. Gen. Secord [Albert Hakim and Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord, who replaced Mr. Ghorbanifar as "channels" to Iran] directly controlled the second channel to Iran and at the same time evidently also were principals involved in the private effort to aid the Contra struggle against the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua. I said I could not prove a diversion was occurring, but that my analysis indicated this could be the case.
Mr. Gates appeared startled and disturbed that the White House would involve itself in such a dubious activity, but then stated that this was potentially very serious and directed that I brief Director Casey immediately. I met with Mr. Casey on 7 October. Mr. Gates also attended. I briefed Mr. Casey on the pricing impasse, the discrepancy between what the Iranians and Mr. Ghorbanifar thought was a reasonable price and what U.S. intermediaries evidently were charging for the Hawk spare parts. I further explained the key roles being played by Mr. Hakim and Maj. Gen. Secord in managing the new channel to Iran and conducting activities in Central America in support of the contras. I stated that this was one of several factors that had left me to conclude that profits obtained from the arms sales were going to the contras, although I lacked direct proof.
At this meeting, Mr. Gates shared my concern about a possible diversion and indicated that the issue needed to be pursued. Mr. Casey seemed surprised by my statements and asked me to put my concerns in writing, which I agreed to do.

 	 	 		. . .	 	In hindsight, those of us who thought that a diversion had occurred should have raised the matter during the preparation of Mr. Casey's testimony. I considered raising the matter on the afternoon of 20 November when we met in the D.C.I. conference room with Mr. Casey to go over the draft testimony. I felt inhibited by the presence of a large number of officials, some of whom had just learned of this highly sensitive effort. I was also uncertain how to characterize the allegations of diversion, especially since the initiative was directed from the White House and since the evidence I had was still circumstantial. I believed I had already discharged my proper responsibility.
Even though the issue of the diversion of profits made from the arms sales to Iran was not included in Mr. Casey's testimony, I did not consider the issue closed, nor did I believe either Mr. Casey or Mr. Gates. Both had encouraged me to pursue the questions about improprieties relating to the initiative.

 Q. During this time, Mr. Allen, you had these suspicions and you conveyed those suspicions to various people in the C.I.A. And during that time you were meeting with Colonel North, I assume, frequently, were you not?
A. I met with Colonel North several times a week, and I talked to him on the secure phone several times a day.
Q. Why didn't you just ask him, or did you just ask him, "Colonel North, are funds being diverted?"
A. I did not put it to him that way. I put it in the form of: "Why are the prices so high? Why is there this funding impasse?" And each time I was given virtually a different story by Lieut. Col. North. Usually, you know, Ghorbanifar is the problem. Or, reopening production lines is a problem. Just go on and keep this story consistent with both Mr. Ghorbanifar and with Mr. Nir [Amiram Nir, a counterterrorism official for Israel]. And he was most emphatic.
It's a good question. Why didn't I? Because I thought it was getting fairly close to the bone at the White House to accuse them of what would appear to be a very imprudent thing to do, if they were taking profits, endangering the lives of hostages in Lebanon, and applying it to support another operation in Central America.
Q. But you indeed were accusing them of that with your superiors. Wouldn't it have been the logical thing to do to simply ask Col. North whether he was doing it before you basically aroused the suspicions or while you were arousing the suspicions and while you were working with him on a daily basis?
A. I could have gone that direction, but I decided to go up to the top through the C.I.A. and to the Director Casey so he could go as he thought proper to the White House. And I think he handled it quite well.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
QUESTIONS BY SENATOR BOREN
 Q. Well, Mr. Allen, it could be -- now, let me just say this, could it not have been that Mr. Casey did know about the diversion and that he wasn't so shocked and surprised about the diversion but he was shocked and surprised by the inept way in which it was being carried out, that the financing was going on and so on, and therefore he was shocked -- he might have well been shocked to learn all these problems with Mr. Furmark, but he might have known about the diversion and his shock might have been, "Oh, this has been so mismanaged now it's all going to blow sky-high." Is that another possible hypothesis?
A. That's strictly a hypothesis. I have no evidence that Mr. Casey was thinking along those lines.
Q. . . . You obviously think Mr. Gates was not knowledgeable about the diversion -- I assume you still think so -- at that time.
A. I firmly think that, yes.

 
Casey Walking Fine Line
 Q. Now, implied in your testimony is the feeling that, at least at that point in time, you also trusted Mr. Casey and did not believe that he knew about the diversion, at least in toto?
A. Contemporaneously, I had no reason to believe that he knew of the diversion.
Q. . . . Have you drawn any conclusions yourself or have you reached -- or have you speculated yourself, not in terms of what you believed at the time but what you believe now, in terms of whether Mr. Casey knew about the diversion when he was talking to you through this whole period?
A. Other than Lieut. Col. North's statement, which he gave under oath, I have no reason to believe he knew -- that D.C.I. Casey knew of the diversion. I have no personal evidence of that. I found that Mr. Casey sometimes walked a fine line, but he never crossed the line, based on what I've seen of the Director. And I have no reason to believe that he was deliberately deceiving me at that time.

QUESTIONS BY SENATOR MURKOWSKI
 Q. I have questions on behalf of one of our colleagues, Senator Warner, with regard to the intelligence warning responsibility that you have. It's the understanding of the Senator from Virginia that you gave some warning on Iraq's intentions towards Kuwait in 1990. Is that correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. I also understand, on behalf of Senator Warner, that warning in itself can be rather controversial and not always popular. Based on your long relationship with Mr. Gates, I wonder if you could tell the committee how you view the mission of warning, its importance, what will Mr. Gates do, in your opinion, if he's confirmed, to improve the system by which we collect, analyze and disseminate warning.
A. Well, I believe that Mr. Gates's highest priority is to warn of threats to U.S. national security interests worldwide, and that his responsibility is to alert the President and policy officials as early as possible, based on reliable information that a threat to U.S. security is developing. In my view, in my conversation with Mr. Gates, he is an individual who really wants to strengthen the warning function. He recognizes that there will always be surprises to U.S. foreign policy, but I think he believes, with the proper techniques, the proper methodologies of warning, and also with regional specialists participating, that we can do a better job and we can avoid the surprise. . . .
He believes we need to do a better job in political intelligence. We can warn a lot about military mobilization, but there were political indicators relating to Mr. Saddam Hussein's intentions and plans to invade Kuwait. There were economic indicators that developed prior to the military mobilization. Once the military mobilization began around the 19th of July, 1990, we were able in warning to fairly well present a convincing case by the 25th of July that Saddam Hussein would invade Kuwait.
So I think -- I am very confident Mr. Gates will take a very strong hand in warning.
Q. Yes, and if I can go back, the general presumption was that we had little or no intelligence, or if we did we did not act on it. And I gather you're saying because of the political nuances, it was difficult to, I guess, come out publicly with any kind of a condemnation of Iraq early? In view of what they've done with the Kurds and their record, why would that be such a difficult thing to do? Clearly we were very dissatisfied with what was happening.

 	 	 		. . .	 	A. Well, I think, as Mr. Kerr [Richard Kerr, Acting Director of the C.I.A.] has testified, and I don't want to get into classified, but in closed session, and I support -- over in the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence -- I believe that the intelligence community performed rather well during that period.
I think to some degree sometimes we tell the policy level things that don't correspond with actual policy initiatives or thinking. But I think this is the strength of the intelligence community, is to be very independent and as objective as possible.
I think overall the Defense Intelligence Agency, C.I.A. and I, as head of the National Warning Community, did a very credible job in warning.

HEADLINE: Mulroney Proposes New Canadian Framework to Stall Separatism

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OTTAWA, Sept. 24

 BODY:
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, today proposed the most comprehensive constitutional overhaul since the nation's birth in 1867, recommending a new federal structure aimed at stalling the separatist movement in French-speaking Quebec.
The Government proposal, which was presented in a package called "Shaping Canada's Future Together," stressed the reaffirmation of a binding Canadian identity and called for the strengthening of economic integration by striking down trade barriers between the provinces. In his address to the House of Commons, the Canadian leader declared that "renewal is what Canadians everywhere seek for our country -- not confrontation, not division, not rupture." 
 Essentially, the plan is intended to fashion a new relationship by granting Quebec constitutional recognition as a "distinct" society because of its French language, culture and civil law. Its adoption, in amendments to the Constitution would require approval of Parliament and the endorsement of 7 out of 10 provinces with at least 50 percent of the population..
 
New Inducements Included
 An earlier long-pending unity plan, known as the Meech Lake Agreement, foundered last year over a similar proposal that aroused complaints in key parts of English-speaking Canada about granting the province a special legislative status and powers to override the 1982 Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Canada's bill of rights. Unlike the present proposal the Meech Lake arrangement needed the approval of all provinces.
In its efforts to ease passage this time, the Government is including as inducements some changes long sought by English-speaking Canada, including an elected Senate that could delay federal legislation for six months and, like the Senate of the United States, ratify federal appointments. Currently members of the Canadian Upper House are appointed by the Government to serve until they reach the age of 75. In recent years a rallying cry in western Canada has been for an "equal, effective and elected Senate." to replace what is essentially a body patterned after the British House of Lords with very limited powers and a tradition of docile support for the Government.
As a parliamentary democracy, Canada's Government business at the national level is done almost exclusively by the House of Commons. The leader of the majority party of the House of Commons, for the past seven years Mr. Mulroney of the Progressive Conservative Party, is prime minister.
 
Addresses Trade Barriers
 The country's economic ties also would be dramatically altered under the plan. Interprovincial trade barriers, which, for example, keep Moosehead beer bottled in New Brunswick, from selling in Ontario, or prevents Ontario-made bricks from being used in construction in Quebec, would be canceled and a new federal-provincial Council of the Federation would be created to solve economic disputes between the various provinces and the Federal Government.
The provinces would gain greater influence on national economic policy-making, including the running of the Bank of Canada, which controls interest rates.
 
'National Conscience'
 Other highlights of the plan that has been the subject of intense and at times divisive debate in the Mulroney Cabinet the past summer, include:
*A "Canada Clause" of the Constitution declaring what it means to be a Canadian. Among other points cited by the 59-page Government document outlining the proposals is "the importance of a national conscience that spurs us to make our contribution to global peace and development."
*Self-government within 10 years for the estimated 500,000 Indian and Eskimo peoples of Canada. The Government's document and briefers stressed that this would be achieved within the framework of both the Constitution and the charter of rights and that provincial laws of general application would continue to apply. The opposition of Indian groups to granting a special status to Quebec without obtaining similar rights for themselves had proven critical in capsizing the Meech Lake arrangement.
*New restrictions on the existing power of provincial governments to override the charter of rights.
 
New Mechanisms for Governing
 "What we're trying to do is set up new mechanisms to govern the country better," said Constitutional Affairs Minister Joe Clark, himself a former prime minister, whom Mr. Mulroney placed in direct charge of developing the proposals.
Early reaction was cautious and generally positive, except for the separatists of Quebec. Lucien Bouchard, leader of the separatist faction in the House of Commons known as the Bloc Quebecois, called the package "dangerous to Quebec."
Liberal Party leader Jean Chretien, criticized many aspects of the plan but added as a conciliatory note: "Let us demonstrate over the next few months thoughtfulness, reason, generosity, a willingness to accommodate and a skill to negotiate."
Preston Manning, leader of the Reform Party, a new protest party centered in Alberta which has arisen in opposition to what it regards as the constant series of deals to assuage Quebec, said that "On the surface there is some movement on Senate reform, but I think there's still a long way to go to accommodate alienation, not just in the west but all over the country."
 
Taking It on the Road
 The proposals now go to a 30-person Special Joint Committee of the Parliament, which has a mandate to travel widely and spur a national debate. On the basis of possible new input, it would then make suggestions for further refinements that would be brought back to the Government by the end of next February. The Government would then frame the legislation for the House of Commons and begin trying to sell the plan to the provinces.
Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa has enacted legislation mandating a referendum on sovereignty by the end of next year if the rest of Canada fails to come up with satisfactory proposals to keep Quebec within the federation.
Mr. Mulroney, who is hoping to use the national unity issue to reverse his record low popularity and win a third term in office -- he must call elections within two years -- dismissed the objections of the Quebec separatists.
"If we had put the Declaration of Independence and the Lord's Prayer on the table, the P.Q. and the B.Q. would have said it's insufficient," he said, referring to the Parti Quebecois and the Bloc Quebecois. "We are not going to be able to deal with the phonies who say they're interested in Canada but whose real objective is the destruction of the nation."

HEADLINE: THE GATES HEARINGS;
Early Indicators of Kuwait Invasion

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 24

 BODY:
In his Congressional testimony today, Charles E. Allen, the senior intelligence official, disclosed for the first time that as early as January 1990, he and other Central Intelligence Agency officials began to consider the possibility that Iraq might attack Kuwait.
Under questioning by Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, at Robert M. Gates's confirmation hearing today, Mr. Allen, a senior analyst at the agency, said he had not received any special instructions in 1990 from the Deputies Committee, a panel of high-ranking Administration officials headed by Mr. Gates, to keep a closer watch on Iraq. 
 "I did not personally receive any such guidance," he said. Mr. Allen added, however, that he had the mandate to watch Iraq nonetheless.
"There were economic indicators that developed prior to the military mobilization," said Mr. Allen, a 32-year veteran of the agency. "Once the military mobilization began around the 19th of July, 1990, we were able in warning to fairly well present a convincing case by the 25th of July that Saddam Hussein would invade Kuwait."
On Aug. 2, he did.
Mr. Allen said that in conjunction with the Defense Intelligence Agency and the military's Central Command, his staff identified a possible threat to Kuwait from Iraq as early as January 1990. But that warning and more refined forecasts later went largely ignored in the Bush Administration.
Mr. Allen warned that the intelligence community needed to respond more actively to potential threats rather than wait until a crisis was imminent.
"We can always warn at the last minute when it's obvious that war is going to occur," he said. "But if you warn early enough, you can truly give the policymaker the tools to avert and defuse a crisis."

HEADLINE: Cuomo Ties Dinkins Aid to Payroll Cuts

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Even as he proposed to recharge New York City's image and economy with a range of proposed building projects, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo warned the Dinkins administration yesterday not to expect too much quick help in balancing its budget unless it cuts the city payroll more.
The Governor's warning, delivered amid dollops of good news, put Mayor David N. Dinkins on notice that he expects the city to deliver on its pledges to reshape its spending, especially now that Mr. Cuomo has risked involving himself more deeply than ever in the city's fiscal problems by proposing to have the state assume the city's share of Medicaid costs over the next several years. 
 For his part, Mr. Dinkins said, "The spotlight has never left us." He and his aides said they would revise the city's four-year financial plan by mid-November to spell out more cost-saving moves, pressing anew for concessions from municipal unions that they have been seeking in vain for months.
Mayoral aides are drafting their own specifics for how many more city jobs should be cut through layoffs and attrition, how a state takeover of the city's $2-billion-a-year Medicaid costs would work, and whether it could happen faster than Mr. Cuomo has suggested.
They are also reviewing the possibility that hundreds of millions of dollars in aid from the state's Municipal Assistance Corporation could help finance tax cuts or stretch out the pace of further jobs reductions to ease the pain, and are studying the creation of new public authorities to maintain bridges or dispose of garbage financed by new tolls or fees.
 
'It's Not My Place'
 But Mr. Cuomo made it clear again yesterday that help will not come from the Municipal Assistance Corporation until the city has made its own cost-cutting plans clearer. His comments, in a speech to business and civic leaders in Manhattan, underscored the differences still to be worked out between City Hall and Albany, even as the Governor allied himself more firmly with the Dinkins administration in confronting the city's sprawling needs and burdens.
"I'm not going to presume to tell the city" what to do, Mr. Cuomo told the Association for a Better New York in a breakfast meeting at the Waldorf-Astoria in the second of a pair of public pronouncements since Monday. "It's not my place."
But the Governor cited his elimination of 15,000 jobs from the state work force since last fall and his refusal to grant raises to state employees' unions, in contrast to Mr. Dinkins's decision to grant raises. "You pay a price for it, certainly you do," Mr. Cuomo said, noting that angry workers had marched on the Governor's Mansion in protest. "But the reality is the unions will have to be at the table, M.A.C. will have to be at the table and I think they'll work it out."
Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog group financed by businesses, said: "I think the ball is in the city's court, and I think it's pretty clear what that expectation is, and it has to do with what the Mayor proposes to do with the size of the municipal work force."
 
'Has to Work With Labor'
 Municipal union leaders who heard the Governor's speech generally praised it, but they also repeated that they were not prepared to make concessions until they, too, see a long-term plan from the city.
"I want to work with the Governor, but the Governor's got to understand that he has to work with labor," said Stanley Hill, executive director of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the largest city workers' union.
Barry Feinstein, president of Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said of the Dinkins administration: "There is no fiscal plan for this city that goes beyond 1992. We are disbelieving."
Privately, some senior Dinkins aides described Mr. Cuomo's grab bag of development projects, many of them long discussed, as "old wine in new bottles" that might not be uncorked in time to benefit the political fortunes of either the Governor or the Mayor. They voiced some frustration that his proposal for assuming the city's Medicaid costs remained sketchy and appeared unlikely to generate large savings for several years, even if approved by the Legislature.
But they also acknowledged, with a mix of gratitude and envy, that by putting so many ideas together in a splashy slide show and stem-winding speech, and embracing the Mayor's call for a Medicaid takeover after first resisting it, Mr. Cuomo had managed to generate some optimism about the city's prospects, whatever the outcome of the proposals.
"There's no way the Governor can lose on this," one aide said.
Cuomo aides were equally quick to paint the Governor's announcements as a victory for the Mayor.
"He's a winner," Vincent Tese, the Governor's chief economic development adviser, said of Mr. Dinkins.
But there were stresses. Dinkins aides were encouraged by the Governor's proposals to take over Medicaid costs, ease state regulations that require the city to provide certain services in certain ways and to redistribute state education aid to give the city its proportional share.
They were quick to note, however, that Mr. Cuomo had not addressed other state-regulated programs which the State Financial Control Board recently cited as among the growing costs burdening the city's budget, from welfare payments to workers's compensation, health insurance and pension guidelines.
Mr. Cuomo took pains in his presentations to counter any notion that he was meddling in the city's affairs, or trying to dictate policy choices, or seeking greater powers over city spending by the control board, which he heads. The board was set up to oversee the city's finances in the fiscal crisis of the 70's and Mr. Dinkins has vowed to avoid a greater role for it at all costs.
"This is the Mayor's city," Mr. Cuomo said. "We are partners at his request and at his sufferance."
 
Cut Costs Permanently
 Still, Mr. Cuomo and Felix G. Rohatyn, the chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, would both continue to hold considerable sway over the city's options under some of the Governor's proposals. Mr. Rohatyn has repeatedly insisted that he cannot provide the city with about $1 billion by refinancing some of the corporation's bonds without assurances that the city will cut costs permanently and reduce the size of the work force.
The corporation was set up during the crisis in the 70's to borrow money on the city's behalf when it was barred from the credit markets, with its bonds backed by first call on the city's sales tax revenues. Now Mr. Cuomo proposes giving Mr. Rohatyn new powers, by seeking legislation that would enable the M.A.C. to issue new bonds for the first time since the early 1980's to finance building projects on the city's behalf, since its superior credit rating allows it to do so at lower interest costs.

President, Municipal Art Society, a 100-year-old group devoted to the physical improvement of the city
 
"I think first of al that we're excited to see an agenda, a program, visible leadership in this area. I think that the totality of the program and the spirit of it are more important than any of the component parts. Obviously, as one of the proponents of Riverside South, we are pleased and excited that the state will be playing a strong role there. The Governor's spirits seemed very high last night. I think his high spirits are infectious. I think that these projects are realistic, are doable, and will find and have found public support. I think the Governor has stepped out front in a way that we should be suppotive of."
 
SALLY GOODGOLD
Chairwoman, City Club of New York
 
"If you grew up in the Roosevelt years as I did, that's exactly the kind of process this brings to mind. I certainly think it's injected a feeling of hope. Is it a risk? Of course it's a risk. He's going to be looked at in the future. Will it mean he will h ave to bend with the Legislature? Of course. But I give him high marks for risk-taking and it's what we nmeed at this moment. It's taken our minds off racism and ethnicity, which we need at the moment. I was delighted myself. It is what will make us competitive in the future."
 
THE REV. TIMOTHY S. HEALY
Presieent, New York Public Library
 
"I can only address the library proposal. It's a great idea. It addresses two problems. One, it aims to keep New York the capital of the world in business information and will serve as a support to business in the city. It may well help to keep businessess in the city. It realy is a service to the economic development of the city. It is eminently realistic. There is one think you have to realize - we have a window of oportunity on a landmark building. It's absolutely perfect for a public entity like a library. It is economically feasible."
 
DAVID R. JONES
President, Community Service Society
 
"No one left there with bitter feelings toward him. If anything, there was the feeling that is was long overdue. I think there was a lot of speculation on how he's going to deliver, but is is nice to see him breaking through on the people mover. As a social welfare person, I was a little concerned that of the areas to be helped, none of the areas had to do with African-Americans or Latinos or poor people in general. I think the hope would be that the economic development to be stimulated would help all communities; we have to applaud that effort. Some of the htinks seem more real than others. The ver act of shifting the debate form hand-wringing over the state of the city to saying let's do something about it is good."
 
ELIZABETH HOLTZMAN
Comptroller, New York City
 
"I applaud the Governor for his vision. It's not enough to just talk about balancing the budget. I think the details of the plans have to be assessed; maybe it has to be refined. Maybe parts of it can be implemented more quickly but the important thing is that the Governor is saying the problems of the city have to be addressed on two fronts - the fiscal front is a direct consequence of what's happening in the city's economy. It started a very important debate. The Governor has put some proposals on the table."
 
RUTH W. MESSINGER
Manhattan Borough President
 
"I think he has made a dramatic public commitment to the city. He has affirmed the principle that so goes the city, so goes the state. That is a positive step. We now have to focus on what's realizable, what's the wheat and what's the chaff of the proposals andwho's going to do the coordinating and expediting of some of his ideas. The proposal to move toward state responsibility toward Medicaid costs is extraordinarily important. I am delighted to see the Governor make a commitment to equalize education aid."

HEADLINE: CUNY Student Leaders Run Up Big Tab

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
Student leaders at the City University of New York were battling to keep tuition low. In doing so, they spent $49,000 on a three-day lobbying excursion to the Albany Hilton and $13,000 on a limousine service that chauffeured them around New York City.
The chairman of the University Student Senate, Jean LaMarre, also hired his twin sister and his best friend as his top assistants at annual salaries of $24,000 and $27,000 respectively -- roughly as much as starting instructors at the university make. 
 He and the other leaders spent all that money with the knowledge of the university's top officials, who approved each bill and gently admonished the students to be a little more frugal. They even approved air fare for three students to the Ivory Coast at a cost of $4,500 so they could attend an event called the African-American Summit.
Yesterday, the university's officials were shamefaced as they struggled to dampen a controversy over the expenditures after they were disclosed by a student news service and later reported in The Daily News.
 
Tacit Acquiescence
 But the officials seemed hard put to escape the implication that they had been giving their students some wrongheaded lessons in economics and management.
City University students may be poorer than those of years past, but their leaders have often adopted a more opulent style of command than student leaders of the past. And they have done so with the tacit acquiescence of administrators eager to maintain calm on their periodically unruly campuses. Many student leaders have fax machines and other high-technology equipment. One of the senate expenditures was $2,209 for electronic pager service.
Much of the senate's spending came as it was leading a protest against a proposed tuition increase that culminated in a student strike that shut down most of the university's campuses for up to three weeks. The senate's $345,000 budget this year is financed by an 85-cent activity fee each semester placed on each of the university's 200,000 students.
Top university officials, eager to avoid a repeat of a scandal five years ago over improper outlays by student leaders, warned the students last March that they were spending money like Wall Street executives, but went on to approve most of the expenditures and did nothing to stop the spending until yesterday.
Both the approvals and warnings were given by Tilden LeMelle, who resigned as vice chancellor for student affairs last spring to become president of the University of the District of Columbia. Mr. LeMelle did not return telephone calls to his office seeking comment.
Jay Hershenson, vice chancellor for university relations, said the university believed in letting students run their own affairs and has monitored but not interfered in the Student Senate's decisions. But after the public disclosures, the university's chancellor, W. Ann Reynolds, imposed the state's standards on travel expenses on the students, rather than the looser university standards.
In an interview, Mr. LaMarre, a 23-year-old senior at Brooklyn College, said the allegations about overspending were "a blatant attempt to try to undermine me and the organization" by another student officer, Rafael Alvarez, the vice chairman for fiscal affairs, who is considering a bid for Mr. LaMarre's job in elections next month.
"There is nothing that we spent, nothing that we purchased that was not legitimate and that was not approved by university officials," Mr. LaMarre said.
Ron Goulet, director of sales for the Albany Hilton, a hotel that state legislators and professional lobbyists often favor because of its proximity to the Legislature, said 200 students rented more than 100 rooms at the Hilton at $70 a room per night in February. The students had the hotel cater almost every meal over the three days and a reception at a cost of $26,000. Contracts for the visit were approved beforehand by university officials.
The more than $13,000 in limousine charges were billed to a single company, XYZ Car Service in Brooklyn, which is also used by members of the university's board of trustees. Assuming that an average trip cost $10, Mr. LaMarre and his associates would have had to make 1,300 trips since January to spend that amount. A university official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the bill was as high as it was because students demanded cars equipped with cellular telephones.
The expenditures were a sharp contrast to those of a decade or two ago, when student leaders scrounged accommodations with friends on trips to Albany and used the subway to get around New York. Mr. Hershenson was chairman of the Student Senate between 1974 and 1976 and recalled that on his Albany trips he stayed at a State University dormitory.
In 1989, roughly 30 students stayed at the Albany Hilton on a lobbying trip, the Hilton official, Mr. Goulet, said.
The Student Senate is made up of about 50 delegates from the university's 21 campuses. Theoretically, the senate is supposed to advise the university's board of trustees on issues affecting students, but in practice it spends much of the $345,000 it receives on advocacy and lobbying with City Hall and in Albany. The senate also puts out its own newspaper, though only one issue was published last year.
Mr. LaMarre, who has been chairman since January, is a speech major and the winner of a national debating contest. He receives a $650 monthly stipend for his senate work and lives with his mother in Flatbush, Brooklyn. He also was reimbursed by the senate for $8,197 in personal expenses.
"I'm one of the poorest students," he said. "I receive full financial aid."
In the interview, he said the senate felt it got a reasonable price from the Albany Hilton for a conference that trained students in the techniques of lobbying and gave them firsthand experience with legislators. He said that the cost came out to only $45 a student, but the arithmetic for having 200 students stay for three days at a cost of $49,000 works out to something closer to $81 a student per night.
The limousine service, he said, was necessary so that he and other student leaders could get around town late at night.
He said his sister and his best friend were hired with the senate's approval.
"I'd rather work with a friend than an enemy," he said.

HEADLINE: Languages Becoming Hot Subject In Colleges

 BODY:
More college students in the United States are studying foreign languages than ever before, with Japanese, Russian and Spanish showing the greatest growth in enrollment, according to a new survey by the Modern Language Association of America.
The survey released last week found that nearly 1.2 million students were enrolled in language courses other than English last fall, an increase of 18 percent since 1986. 
 The survey, financed by the United States Department of Education, was based on written questionnaires to all 2,797 two-year and four-year colleges and universities; 98.2 percent respondved. The survey used enrollment figures from 1986 to 1990.
The study of foreign languages has been growing steadily since 1980, but for the first time since 1965 the percentage of students studying languages has increased markedly in relation to the percentage of students attending college, according to Phyllis Franklin, executive director of the Modern Language Association, made up of teachers and scholars in the language field. Since 1980, the number of college students studying languages has increased 30 percent, while the number of students attending college has increased 15 percent, she said.
The survey found that Spanish, French and German maintained their ranking as the three most popular foreign languages, in that order, but that the number of students studying French declined by 1 percent, from 275,328 in 1986 to 272,555 in 1990. Enrollments in Ancient Greek and Hebrew also declined.
The association's survey included culture and literature courses that were taught in a foreign language.
The enrollment in Japanese classes nearly doubled, the survey found. It said the number of students studying Japanese in the fall of 1990 was 45,717, compared with 23,454 in 1986. The survey said 44,384 students were studying Russian in 1990, an increase of more than 30 percent over 1986.
Together, Japanese and Russian accounted for about 8 percent of the 1990 enrollment in foreign language courses. Spanish had the highest number of students, 533,609, and the highest overall percentage, 45 percent. Its growth in enrollment from 1986 to 1990 was nearly 30 percent.
In the association's last survey, which studied enrollment figures from 1983 to 1986, Japanese showed the highest percentage increase, followed by Chinese, Portuguese and Russian, in that order.
 
Findings Provide Encouragement
 Helene Zimmer-Loew, president of the Joint National Committee for Languages, which represents 41 language associations, said: "We're thrilled to see this. It is very heartening to all of us in the field."
She said that the increase in students taking language courses probably reflects interest in countries that are economic powers or hotbeds of political activity.
"I don't think this reflects thousands and thousands of language majors or people who are going to be language teachers, although we always hope they will choose it," Ms. Zimmer-Loew said. "I think many are majoring in business and they see a second language as an absolute necessity because of a shrinking global economy."
 
Concerns Arise
 The study does not disclose what level of language the students are studying. Richard D. Lambert, director of the National Foreign Language Center, which also tracks foreign-language study, said that while the findings were encouraging, more information is needed on what types of students are studying languages and whether they continue with the languages to advanced levels.
"The question," he said, "is are we still working with a limited set of students from the arts and sciences? Are we lengthening as well as broadening? In terms of national policy, I think that's an important question."
The enrollment decline for French classes concerned Dr. Fred M. Jenkins, executive director of the American Association of Teachers of French, who said the popularity of Spanish was taking away students who might otherwise pursue French.
"We are not happy, and we are undertaking a drive of our own to make students, particularly on the secondary-school level, more aware of French and what it stands for," Dr. Jenkins said.
 
Spanish Is Spoken
 The popularity of Spanish is attributed partly to the influx of Hispanic people into the United States and partly to the fact that students find Spanish a useful language in this country.
"It is here; its time has come," said Dr. James R. Chatham, executive director of the American Association of Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese.
Meanwhile, the secondary-school level is also showing growth in foreignlanguage study, according to a study, not yet published, by the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages.
The council found that in the 1990-1991 academic year, about 30 percent of public school students in grades 7 to 12 were studying foreign languages, which is a 5 percent increase over 1985, the last time the council conducted a survey.
"The best news as far as we're concerned is this has been a period of some sustained growth," said C. Edward Scebold, president of the 6,000-member organization.

HEADLINE: Stall in Weicker's Union Negotiations

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Sept. 24

 BODY:
Already bitter labor talks between Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. and the unions representing state workers broke off today, with both sides saying they were nowhere near agreement on a package of wage and benefit concessions tied to the state's new income tax.
The breakdown raised the likelihood that residents could see further cuts in state services and more employee layoffs, some of which could coincide with the first impact next week of the new income tax that was intended to secure those state services. Among the cuts being considered is a partial closing of some state agencies, which might shut their doors for one or two days every month. 
 Mr. Weicker, a former Republican who was elected last year as a third party independent governor, has said that he needs more than $300 million in wage, benefit and pension concessions from the unions. He has accused the unions of reneging on an agreement signed this spring that guaranteed that amount, mostly in benefit deferrals that would have to be made up in later years. Union leaders say that earlier compact died on July 1, with the start of the new fiscal year, and that pay raises that took effect on that date will not be given back.
The talks broke up after an announcement today by administration negotiators that contrary to its early pledges, layoffs might be unavoidable in the 45,000-member work force even if the unions agree to the full concession package. The state sent layoff notices to about 2,500 workers last week -- the first wave in what they said could reach as many as 8,000 layoffs -- but the officials stressed that if the concession package could be signed, the layoffs would all be rescinded.
 
Could Not Be Guaranteed
 Labor leaders said the new wrinkle eliminated any motivation for them to voluntarily reopen their signed contracts and give back benefits, or even to continue the talks at all because the state was in effect saying job security could not be guaranteed regardless of what happened at the bargaining table.
"It's insane to think about giving something back and getting nothing in return," said Steven Perruccio, president of the Connecticut Employees Union Independent, which represents about 7,000 service and maintenance workers.
Mr. Weicker's press secretary, Avice A. Meehan, said that the legislature, in passing the $7.7 billion budget last month that created the income tax, also cut about $30 million in spending that has only come to light in recent days as the document has been analyzed. She said that agency heads were meeting today with administration budget officials to try and address the gap, and that some combination of layoffs and other service cuts might be necessary, with an outside limit of perhaps 1,000 layoffs a possibility.
The state employee unions were a major ally in Mr. Weicker's summerlong fight to impose a state income tax on Connecticut. Mr. Weicker said the new tax would allow other taxes to be cut, and so stimulate the faltering economy. The unions, in making the same case, also conceded that a large new revenue stream would make their members' jobs more secure.
The prospect that the unions could win on both fronts, keeping both their wage increases and the heightened job security from the revenues raised by the tax, has angered some lawmakers who voted for the wage tax. It has also bolstered the effort led by the Republican Party to repeal the income tax and substitute it with a traditional sales-tax based budget.
The repeal effort is expected to culminate next month with a proposed special session of the legislature. Lawmakers said that today's stumbling block in the labor talks made it even more likely that the concessions issue would hang over the repeal effort, though with uncertain impact.

HEADLINE: F.A.A. EASES PLAN FOR PHASING OUT NOISIEST JETLINERS

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 24

 BODY:
Responding to pressure from airlines and the White House, the Federal Aviation Administration today eased its plan to phase out the nation's noisier planes.
By allowing airlines to continue operating many of their older and noisier planes, the decision will delay for several years some of the benefits for people who live near airports. 
 Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner said he had ordered that the timetable be made more flexible out of concern for the economic viability of the airlines. He acknowledged that the rules issued today would probably be challenged in court.
Mr. Skinner said the rules put the industry on a path that would eliminate most, if not all, of the louder planes by the year 2000, in keeping with a law Congress passed last year. He estimated that the number of people exposed to the worst noise would drop to 400,000 from about 2.7 million within the decade.
 
Debated for Months
 The agency's proposal had been debated for months, as a coalition of airlines and airplane leasing companies recommended the main change adopted today. The industry generally welcomed the final rule. But the stage appeared to be set for a confrontation with some local airports.
An initial proposal would have required airlines to quickly begin eliminating the noisier planes from their fleets, removing one-fourth of them by the end of 1994, and continuing the reductions until they were all gone by the end of the century. The new proposal allows airlines to add quieter planes first without necessarily removing the noisier ones.
The aviation agency, which is part of the Transportation Department, said it would carefully examine any efforts by local authorities to impose stricter noise-reduction plans than the one in the Federal rule. Mr. Skinner said the agency might go to court to overturn local rules that were too costly to the airlines or that hampered the efficient operation of the interstate aviation system.
"I and all of us in the Administration are very concerned with the financial health of the airline industry," he said, in explaining why the rules were modified.
The aviation agency has estimated that the rules will cost the industry up to $4.5 billion; the industry estimates the cost to be many times greater.
Those costs would have to be passed on to consumers or taken out of airline profits. The rules announced today allow airlines in financial distress to apply for permission to miss the rules' deadlines, but officials said they did not expect to see many waivers allowed.
 
Ultimate Goal Remains
 The ultimate goal of the rules has not changed: to attain a fleet of commercial jetliners that meet the quietest noise standards, known as Stage 3 aircraft, by the year 2000 or shortly afterward. There are now about 1,880 Stage 3 planes in the nation's fleet, accounting for about 45 percent of all jetliners; the 2,270 other planes are noisier Stage 2 planes.
The difference in noise between a Stage 2 plane, like a Boeing 727 or McDonnell Douglas DC-9, and a Stage 3 plane, like a Boeing 757, is easy to recognize from the ground. The noisier planes seem deeper in timbre, their vibrations are more penetrating and they can be heard from much farther away.
With the advent of the newer planes, which are also more efficient to operate, the number of people exposed to unbearably high noise around airports has been steadily declining for decades, a trend that would continue with or without the new rule.
The question is how fast the improvement must occur, and whether the Federal Government should dictate the pace or allow local politicians and airport operators to set up a regulatory patchwork across the nation.
The rules announced today, after months of public comment and behind-the-scenes lobbying over a draft proposal, would still force airlines either to buy new airplanes or to put quieter engines or "hush kits" on older planes.
But the rule issued today allows airlines, if they choose, to move toward compliance at first by increasing the numbers of quieter aircraft in their fleets, rather than by starting right away to eliminate the noisier ones.
Administration officials acknowledged that this means noise will not be reduced as much in the next three to five years as would have happened under the aviation agency's initial proposal early this year.
 
Airlines That Benefit
 The change will be of substantial help to some airlines, like Southwest Airlines or Northwest Airlines, which grew rapidly in the past decade and own a lot of noisier planes that have plenty of useful life in them.
The most prosperous airlines, including giants like United Airlines and American Airlines , are already well on the track toward complying with the new rules, and will not have to adjust their plans, officials said.
The new rules are of particular interest in New York and New Jersey, where amid a steady outcry by local residents, state lawmakers and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey are considering requiring rapid reductions in noisy flights.
But the new rules are important from coast to coast. In Los Angeles, city and airport officials have been negotiating all summer with the Federal officials to draft a local noise rule that would control airline flights without overstepping the authority that the Federal Government is willing to cede to the city.
If even a few big cities adopt rules that are much stricter than the Federal rule, the airlines would have to pay more attention to local rules than to the Federal schedule because they cannot efficiently schedule their quietest planes to fly only to certain locations.
Because of these considerations, Federal officials acknowledged today that the rules are likely to be challenged by local officials, airlines or citizens groups -- possibly by all sides at once.
Patrick J. Russell, a lawyer from Far Hills, N.J., who is a member of the New Jersey Coalition Against Aircraft Noise and a leader of a national coalition of similarly minded groups, sharply criticized the Administration's announcement.
"Certainly we are not happy about it in the National Airport Watch Group," he said, "and we are certainly not happy about it in New Jersey." He said the group would continue to press for stricter local regulations.
The regulations were issued under a law passed by Congress almost a year ago. Initially scheduled to take effect on July 1, the rules were delayed by almost three months from the original deadline, as industry lobbyists pressed their case at White House offices, including the Office of Management and Budget, the Council on Competitiveness, and the Council of Economic Advisers.
In those meetings, the airlines urged that the F.A.A. adopt exactly the formula for phasing in the rule that was eventually chosen by the agency.
At first, the agency proposed a simple series of deadlines: one-fourth of an airline's noisier planes would have to be eliminated by the end of 1994, one-half by 1996, three-quarters by 1998, and all by the end of the year 1999, unless economic hardship prevented achieving the final deadline.
But a group of "have-not" airlines that would be hardest pressed to meet this schedule argued for another approach, one that would allow some of them much more leeway in the earlier years. They asked for the option of meeting the following deadlines: 55 percent of an airline's entire fleet must be the quieter models by 1994, 65 percent by 1996 and 75 percent by 1998.
Because many airlines already have substantial numbers of quieter planes in their fleets, these hurdles could be met in some cases while leaving most of the noisier planes in service.
In the end, either formula leads to a relatively quiet fleet by the year 2000. But at the beginning, to the dismay of people who complain about airport noise, fewer noisy planes will be retired, and there will be some net increase in noise as the airlines continue to increase their flights.
The issue of airport noise regulation boils down to this question: when should airlines have to modify or mothball their noisier planes? The law demanded that the switch take place by the year 2000, and left it up to the aviation agency to write rules phasing in the change.

HEADLINE: 40,000 Aliens to Win Legal Status in Lottery

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

 BODY:
At one minute past midnight on Columbus Day, would-be immigrants and their lawyers will dump tens of thousands of applications into bins at a Virginia post office as part of one of the stranger and more controversial innovations in a new immigration law.
Under the 1990 law, the first 40,000 applications received after 12:01 A.M. on Oct. 14 from people born in 34 nations will qualify for the green card that signifies legal permanent residency in the United States. 
 With some people planning to dump off or mail in hundreds of duplicates to increase their chances, the post office could receive as many as five million applications by the cutoff date five days later, according to some estimates.
While there have been similar lotteries in 1986 and 1989, they were smaller, with 10,000 and 20,000 winners, and were intended as one-time programs. The new lottery will become a permanent annual feature under the new immigration law.
 
Effort to Add 'Diversity'
 Among the applicants is Derek McMahon from Dublin, who has worked in the United States illegally for the past six years and said he would mail in 200 copies. "I've tried everything to get a green card and nothing has worked," he said. "This is my only chance."
The lottery was written into the law -- which allows for overall immigration of up to 700,000 people a year -- with the stated intent of bringing "diversity" by aiding countries whose immigration numbers dropped after the passage of a broad new statute in 1965.
The 1965 law lifted stringent quotas on immigration from Latin America and Asia and gave preference to immigrants closely related to citizens. Both changes reduced the influx from many European countries. Most of the 34 countries on the list for the new lottery are in Europe.
"This is kind of a white person's lottery," said Michael Maggio, a Washington-based immigration lawyer.
In particular, the new law, co-sponsored by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, favors the Irish, who are allotted at least 40 percent of the places. Some critics describe it as a disguised amnesty for the more than 100,000 undocumented immigrants from the Republic of Ireland who are living illegally in America; supporters say it is merely addressing years of discrimination against Irish immigrants.
Natives of Northern Ireland will be considered to be citizens of Britain, one of the 33 other countries included in the lottery.
 
Latin and Asian Influx
 With most immigrants now entering the country under the immigration law's provisions for family reunification, the flow of people from Latin America and Asia has continued, building on an initial influx from those nations after 1965.
Many European nations, and particularly the Irish, do not have that recent base of legal immigrants who can apply for entry for immediate family members.
"This is like a once-off effort to give these people an avenue into the family unification system," said Sean Benson, executive director of Emerald Isle Immigration Center, a nonprofit community organization in Queens that counsels illegal Irish immigrants.
Critics of what one lawyer called an "Irish sweepstakes" approach to immigration assert that it a mockery of the nation's immigration ideals, with possible racial undertones. They say it reinserts into immigration law the principle of national origin that was erased by the 1965 law. That law, among other things, ended a restriction on immigration from Asia.
Cecilia Munoz, an official of the Washington-based Hispanic rights lobbying group, National Council of La Raza, said, " 'Diversity' is clearly a euphemism. 'Diversity' under this law means larger numbers of white Europeans, and I think there is some irony in that."
 
Lotteries Aid the Irish
 She added: "Clearly, members of Congress are more comfortable with immigrants with last names similar to theirs. People who would fight us tooth and nail didn't bat an eyelash when the Irish got their amnesty. It says something about the politics of immigration. We are more comfortable with some people than with others."
Through vigorous organization, the Irish did well in the two previous immigration lotteries. Ms. Munoz also marveled as well at how effective the Irish had been in lobbying Congress, saying, "We talked to Congressional office after Congressional office that just was charmed by the Irish lobbyists."
Critis also say the lottery injects an element of randomness at a time when United States immigration law is attempting to attract what are considered to be desirable immigrants, with new provisions inviting people with particular job skills or large amounts of money to invest in businesses.
"It's not a true lottery, but more of a crap shoot," said Cornelius D. Scully, the State Department official who prepared the regulations under the guidelines of the new law.
After the first three years, during which at least 54,000 people are to be admitted from the Republic of Ireland, the Irish preference is to be dropped, Mr. Scully said. The total number of visas offered under the lottery each year will rise to 55,000.
An analysis of the legislation printed in the Federal Register this month noted there would be "the unseemly spectacle of thousands of applicants and their representatives going through bizarre gyrations in an effort to guarantee that their applications were processed early."
"This is a hell of a way to run a railroad," said Alan Nelson, a former Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service who is now a private consultant on immigration issues. "It sort of cheapens the immigration process."
Responding to the criticisms, Senator Kennedy said yesterday, "The provision is a long-overdue step to end this unfair discrimination against Irish immigrants, who for decades were limited to less than 1,000 visas a year."
He pointed out that the increase for the Irish was accomplished without restricting any other visa categories.
Supporters also argue that the Irish have historically been an important part of the nation's immigrant heritage that should not be lost. They say economic conditions in European nations, including Ireland, did not create the heavy immigrant flow from other parts of the world in recent decades.
 
Fine Points Decisisve
 Another widely raised objection is that some lawyers are charging fees that range into the hundreds and even thousands of dollars, essentially to stamp and mail envelopes containing very simple application letters.
The lawyers respond that as in any legal process, the fine points can be decisive. One group of 15 immigration lawyers from around the nation is holding regular telephone conference calls to discuss questions that include whether envelopes can be machine metered or must carry a postage stamp.
One member of the group has advertised a 95 percent success rate in the last lottery. Another said she had filed 150 applications and won all but six of them.
"We have spent hours and hours and hours going through the minute points," said one of the lawyers, Allen E. Kaye, who said he would be filing 100 applications for each of his 100 clients, for a total of 10,000 letters, and would probably rent a van to carry them.

A1); The first 40,000 applications received on Oct. 14 from people born in 34 nations will qualify them for the green card that signifies legal permanent residence in the United States.

HEADLINE: DE GUSTIBUS;
Hello, Tomatoes! Goodbye, Columbus

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THINK of pasta without tomato sauce, polenta without cornmeal, pommes soufflees without potatoes, ratatouille without peppers and mousse without chocolate. What you'd have is European cooking without Columbus.
Some will argue that what the Old World brought to the New World -- apples, pears, peaches, milk and sugar cane, not to mention livestock -- was equally significant, but culinary scholars tend to think the Europeans got the better of the deal. Even if it took them a while before they realized what treasures they had. (For years, they were afraid to eat the tomato.) 
 On Sept. 6, the Smithsonian Institution began its commemoration of the 500th anniversary of Columbus's voyage with a reception that featured dishes from the Old and the New Worlds before 1492. (These days, commemoration, not celebration, is the politically correct term.)
Unlike other aspects of the quincentenary, there isn't a lot of politics attached to chocolate and peppers.
"Food is one of the few safe grounds," said Katherine Kirlin, the special coordinator for the reception, "No scholars have called for revisions of food thoughts."
Indeed. Only a culinary churl would complain about the Italians getting the tomato.
Yet historians who study geopolitics do not award the tomato the importance it enjoys among culinary historians. For them the clout belongs to potatoes, corn and sugar.
"Potatoes and corn are more important to the diet because of nutrition and calories," said Carolyn Margolis, the assistant director of quincentenary programs at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. She helped organize the museum's exhibition called "Seeds of Change," which opens on Oct. 26. "Sugar is important because it was the first major commodity that resulted in the plantation economy, slavery and the destruction of the rain forest," she said. "It continues to be political because of the migrant labor that is used to grow it.
"The true treasures of the New World were not gold, but botanicals."
Anyone who cooks would not argue with her assessment. But 500 years later it's hard to keep straight what came from where. The food now called Tex-Mex would not have existed without the arrival of cattle (and by extension, cow's milk) from Europe. And if you want to be absolutely accurate, you would say "as American as blueberry pie," because blueberries are indigenous, while the Europeans brought the apple.
The "Seeds of Change" exhibition was created to make its viewers aware of these contributions. "I don't think most people know how much has been contributed," Ms. Margolis said. "Food unites us and helps us appreciate other cultures."
As a companion to the exhibition, a handsome new book, "Seeds of Change" by Herman J. Viola and Ms. Margolis (Smithsonian Institution Press; cloth, $39.95; paper, $24.95), tells the same story with evocative photographs and inviting prose.
All of these threads were noted by Robert McC. Adams, the Secretary of the Smithsonian, in his remarks at the opening reception for the Columbus quincentenary. But unlike most Washington receptions, where the focus is the someone or something being honored and where the food is secondary, at the Smithsonian the meal was spotlighted.
Inside the Institution's forbidding red-brick Castle and its more welcoming gardens, the Old and New World each had its own buffet. Eric Michael, who owns Occasions Caterers with his brother, Mark, described what they served as three-quarters old recipes and one-quarter modern adaptations. Sopas and the guacamole that filled them belong in the latter camp, as did the melon and prosciutto; paella, capon pie and roasted quail legs in the former.
And some adjustments were necessary. Lard was replaced by oil, salt was toned down considerably, and dense, extremely sweet cakes were lightened up a bit.
Some of the seasoned Washington partygoers, used to roast beef, trees of shrimp and nothing more daring than a piece of rye bread, agreed. Even though such a lavish buffet would have cost a private individual $50 to $65 a person, the guests were nonplused by the likes of air-dried buffalo strips, cassava bread, cactus and jicama salad, roast wild boar and even tamales. Washington is not noted for its adventurous palates. Even Jean Lujan, the wife of Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr., was more interested in the popcorn than any of the exotics.
Did you like the wild boar, she was asked.
"No."
Did you like the squash?
"No."
Did you like the beans?
"They were O.K., but I'm a real simple kid," she said by way of explanation as she munched the popcorn.
But there was another point of view, one held by Dr. Adams, the Secretary of the Smithsonian. "I worked for a number of years in Mexico," he said, "so I should know Mesoamerican food very well. This is a good, bland introduction. It's a shame they didn't put out the chilies."
Who said food isn't controversial?

HEADLINE: Do Scarlett and Rhett Discover Love Anew? A Sequel Reveals All

BYLINE: By ELEANOR BLAU

 BODY:
"Tomorrow, I'll think of some way to get him back," says Scarlett O'Hara, the feisty, self-centered Southern belle in "Gone With the Wind." "After all, tomorrow is another day."
So ends Margaret Mitchell's 1936 soap opera of a novel, a Civil War epic that became one of the most popular books ever written. 
 And then what happens?
Well, for one thing, maybe Scarlett goes back to Tara, the beloved plantation in Georgia, moves on to Charleston, S.C., and later to -- Ireland? Not so far-fetched, considering that was her father's birthplace. It all happens in Alexandra Ripley's "Scarlett," the Warner Books sequel, which was authorized by the Mitchell estate, and is being published today in 40 countries and 18 languages.
More than a million copies of "Scarlett" were ordered by bookstores in advance of the publication, Ms. Ripley has been told, and no one doubts a movie can be far away. Still, what acclaim would "Scarlett" have to win to begin to match the popularity of its predecessor?
 
28 Million Copies Sold
 The Pulitzer Prize-winning "Gone With the Wind" has been translated into 27 languages and has sold some 28 million copies, more than any other book but the Bible. The 1939 movie of it -- one of the best-loved movies of all time -- won 10 Academy Awards and may forever have linked the protagonists with their portrayors: Clark Gable as the adventurer Rhett Butler and Vivien Leigh as Scarlett, whom he pursues through the nearly four-hour film and the more-than-1,000-page book, finally abandoning her with his classic adieu: "My dear, I don't give a damn."
Ms. Ripley, who was in New York this week, said she was well aware that some fans of "Gone With the Wind" would scorn the presumption of continuing what Mitchell said should have no sequel. She even heard about an "I Won't Read the Sequel Club" in Atlanta, which she herself asked to join after re-reading her own manuscript in its many rewritten, edited, galley and page-proof versions. (She received a membership plaque.)
For nonmembers of the club, it would be unkind to reveal the Ripley fate of Rhett and Scarlett, but the author did not mind noting that Scarlett "grows up" by admitting defeat and by experiencing love for Cat. Cat is a child. We won't say whose.
If Scarlett did not change, how could matters change between her and Rhett?
Ms. Ripley said she had decided early on that fans of the first novel would have her "pilloried" if, in more than 800 pages, the pair had still not gotten together. But that is not divulging the ending.
"Whoever writes the next book should send me flowers, because I've set it up for them," she observed.
The 57-year-old Ms. Ripley said she had spent five years on "Scarlett," the first year settling legal matters and the next year and a half in preparation, visiting libraries, archives and sites from Atlanta to Dublin and steeping herself in the Mitchell work.
After reading "Gone With the Wind" at least four times, and copying several hundred more of its pages in long hand (the only way she writes), Ms. Ripley said, she started underlining bits of it with colored pencils to try to fathom what she calls a most unusual style that broke rules of syntax and compressed a great deal.
"Margaret Mitchell was a better writer than critics have given her credit for," she said. Better than Ms. Ripley? A pause. "Yes," she said and smiled.
 
Other Historical Novels
 Ms. Ripley has written historical novels, including two set in her own and Rhett's home turf: "Charleston" and "On Leaving Charleston," as well as "New Orleans Legacy," all Warner paperback best sellers.
The author, who lives in Virginia with her husband, a professor in the rhetoric department of the University of Virginia, and who has two daughters by an earlier marriage, tried to imitate Mitchell's style for only a few hundred of the book's 823 pages, she said, to gain the trust of readers. Then, she said "Gradually, I could slide into my own voice."
Even while imitating, she said, she avoided the black dialect of "Gone With the Wind," which she considered not only demeaning but also hard to read.
"Gone With the Wind" ends in 1873, and that's when "Scarlett" starts, a few days later, at the burial of Melanie Wilkes. Melanie is, of course, the wife of Ashley, whom, all these years, until recently, Scarlett had thought she loved. (You don't want to be told Ashley's lot, do you?)
Plotting the novel and trying to match it to the times was difficult. "I read seven books on Wall Street and the economy," Ms. Ripley said. "This was the big thing happening. Not only was I reading things I did not understand, it bored me senseless. There were things going on in the Balkans, but can you see Scarlett saying, 'I think I'll grow cotton in the Balkans?' "
But when Ms. Ripley read about this being tumultuous times in Ireland, "with early skirmishing and political parties and rhetoric" -- much like the pre-Civil War times in which "Gone With the Wind" opens -- "I said, 'Oh, thank you, God!' " she said.
 
No Graphic Sex
 The Mitchell estate put only two restrictions on her efforts, said Ms. Ripley: don't include miscegenation or graphic sex. The sequel is more open about sex than its predecessor, but she said, "I'm a three-dot writer" who thinks suggestion is more of a turn-on than explicitness.
Her biggest problem early on was that she considered Scarlett "a thoroughly loathsome character." The one thing she admired, she recalled, was that Scarlett always kept her promises. "But her ruthlessness I found appalling." A friend advised her that she didn't have to like Scarlett, merely love her.
Rhett, on the other hand, was no trouble at all. "An adventurer who is au fond a good guy, nice to children and to his mother. And he's an educated man. He was a joy to write."
According to biographies, she said, Mitchell experienced more pain than pleasure from her huge success. Ms. Ripley, though, said she felt like "the luckiest person in the world."
She has received a $160,000 advance for "Scarlett," which is less than half the advance she was to have received for a book for Warner that was postponed for the sequel. But she has that book and another one under contract for Warner now and stands to earn more for "Scarlett."
"It's not just avarice," she said. "It's vanity" -- she shrugged -- "hubris? I would like to have people go into bookstores and say, 'Is the new Ripley out yet?' "

HEADLINE: New Life for a Neglected Jewel in Los Angeles

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
Architects have sometimes wondered if George Herbert Wyman designed the Bradbury Building as a kind of architectural surprise. From the street, it looks like a nondescript 19th-century building with a plain Romanesque facade of brick and sandstone.
But after passing through a narrow arched entry, the visitor suddenly arrives in a grand atrium. The eye is almost overwhelmed, carried up five stories on ornate black wrought-iron railings and staircases and carved red oak wainscoting and fascias to the clerestory windows and skylight that bathe the entire space in a warm ocher. Two open-caged hydraulic elevators glide up and down on either side. 
 It is, in the architect Charles Moore's words, "one of the most thrilling spaces on the North American continent," a building that might seem more at home in Milan, lower Manhattan or San Francisco if it had to be in California.
The 1893 Bradbury was rededicated on Sept. 24 after two years of painstaking restoration. Its red-oak paneling has been sanded and refinished to a bright rose luster. The floors of Mexican tile have been patched up, the glazed yellow brick walls have been restored, the red Italian marble wall bases cleaned and shined and 98 years of grime scraped off the skylight panes.
 
Hopes for a Renaissance
 The building's current owners, a partnership led by Ira E. Yelin of the Yelin Company, hope it will form the nucleus of a renaissance of the once grand center of downtown Los Angeles, now dilapidated. The first tenants will soon begin to occupy some of the 61,000 square feet of office space, with ceilings that range from 12 to 14 feet.
The restoration is almost certain to win applause from architects and architectural historians, among whom the Bradbury has aroused almost cultlike adoration. It is widely considered one of the finest historic buildings in Los Angeles, a city with only four official National Historic Landmarks.
Mr. Yelin, who spent $5.6 million to buy the Bradbury (the renovation cost another $6 million, plus $2.4 million for seismic strengthening) is banking on a revival of the Broadway area, which is strategically positioned at the core of the city. Just to the west is Bunker Hill, on which the newest office towers have been built; to the east is the new Ronald Reagan State Office Building and booming Little Tokyo; to the north is the Civic Center and the Los Angeles Times building. He foresees a corridor of development, with the Bradbury in the center, connecting these focal points of Los Angeles's civic life.
The Bradbury was originally commissioned by Lewis Bradbury, a mining magnate. He gave the task to Wyman, a young draftsman who worked for a local architect. Wyman was a kind of architectural supernova; the Bradbury was his one flare of glory, but a magnificent one.
By the time Mr. Yelin bought the building in 1989, the oak paneling and railings were so dark with dirt that his architect, Brenda A. Levin of Levin and Associates in Los Angeles, thought they were made of mahogany. Ms. Levin migrated here from New Jersey 15 years ago and has since become one of Los Angeles's leading restoration architects, having also restored the Oviatt and Fine Arts buildings.
She said she was daunted by the Bradbury task. "This is the most significant piece of architecture in the city of Los Angeles," she said. "I had a fair amount of apprehension dealing with someone else's vision."
She tried to preserve every possible original detail, while updating to modern office standards and safety codes. There were numerous difficult decisions. For example, more than 50 panes of untempered glass in the dome were broken. The question was whether to replace the entire skylight with tempered glass or keep the existing glass with wire mesh below. She decided to keep the original glass for fear of changing the color of the light in the atrium.
The restoration encountered not a few political problems. For example, the Fire Marshal at first wanted to have the wrought-iron staircases enclosed, which would have been something like placing a plaster robe over Michelangelo's statue of David. The compromise was to install sprinklers all around the interior galleries of the atrium.
But the greatest challenge may not be so much esthetic as economic. The surroundings remain intimidating. Derelicts and drug addicts haunt the doorways and alleys in the neighborhood. Across Third Street, just north of the Bradbury, the city has permitted another developer to put up El Metro Plaza, a garish structure for Mexican restaurants with brass-colored piping and with two odd cupolas that would seem offensive even in Tijuana.
Moreover, the building reopens at a particularly inopportune time, with downtown vacancy rates in Los Angeles running at about 20 percent and with another 3.8 million square feet of Class A office space under construction. So far one tenant has signed up for the Bradbury, Kathleen Sullivan, the Treasurer of California, who has taken 4,477 square feet in the southwest corner of the fifth floor for her Los Angeles office.
Whatever its economic prospects, architectural historians welcome a salvaged Bradbury Building that Thomas S. Hines, an architectural historian at the University of California, Los Angeles, calls the earliest example of Los Angeles's "tradition of futurism."
"It is really a machine-age building," he said, "It is an early monument in a city that has come to be recognized as one of great 20th-century architecture. When we find a 19th-century building that provides a prelude for the 20th century, then you have reason to celebrate."

HEADLINE: Aquino May Agree to a U.S. Pullout Over 3 Years

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANILA, Sept. 24

 BODY:
Faced with widespread opposition to her proposal for a national referendum to approve a new 10-year American lease on the Subic Bay Naval Station, President Corazon C. Aquino may accept a compromise allowing for a three-year American withdrawal from the huge military base, Philippine officials and Western diplomats said today.
Despite what appears to be a political defeat for Mrs. Aquino, diplomats in Manila said that there was still no evidence to suggest that the United States would be evicted from the base anytime soon, and possibly not for several years. 
 "There's a general election next year to pick Mrs. Aquino's successor and a new Senate," an American official noted. "If the compromise is a three-year withdrawal, that would leave three years to work out a new arrangement for Subic. The new Senate may be much more amenable to an agreement."
On Sept. 15, Mrs. Aquino went on national television to call for a "people's initiative" to overturn a looming vote in the Philippine Senate to reject the new American lease for the base, the largest American military base in Asia.
 
Public Support for Bases
 The landmark 12-to-11 vote rejecting the lease came the next day, with the majority describing their action as a long-delayed demonstration of sovereignty and national pride in the Philippines, which was an American colony from 1898 to 1946.
Polls indicate that the public strongly supports the American bases, which employ thousands of Filipinos and pump hundreds of millions of dollars into the country's struggling economy. But Mrs. Aquino's plan for a national referendum to overturn the Senate vote has met with little public enthusiasm in the last week, and it has inspired an angry debate within the Philippine Government over the legality of the referendum plan and over Mrs. Aquino's allegiance to the Constitution that she helped craft after her election in 1986.
Under the Constitution, the new American lease for the naval base would have required two-thirds approval in the 23-member Senate. It also says that American troops should have left the Philippines by Sept. 16 if a new lease had not been approved by the Senate.
 
Statement by Aquino
 On Monday, Mrs. Aquino said in a statement sent to news organizations that "our main thrust continues to be the call for a referendum." But she added that "we are always willing to talk to anyone, especially the senators who may have compromise positions" and she said that one senator's proposal for a seven-year American withdrawal from Subic was "interesting and should be considered."
Lawmakers and diplomats took the statement as evidence that Mrs. Aquino was prepared to back down from her call for a national referendum and leave a final decision about Subic's future in the hands of her successor and the new Senate. Mrs. Aquino has insisted she will not seek a second term.
Senators on both sides of the issue have moved this week to reach an agreement that, depending on the proposal, would allow the United States to withdraw from Subic over two to seven years -- an agreement, in effect, to leave a final decision on the base's future until after next year's general election.
In a speech today to a Manila business group, the president of the Philippine Senate and one of the base's fiercest opponents, Jovito Salonga, outlined a proposal for a two-year American withdrawal from Subic.
Mrs. Aquino is calling for ratification of a new lease for Subic on economic grounds, saying that in addition to the economic benefits to the Subic Bay area the impoverished Philippine Government needs the more than $2 billion that the United States has offered in rent payments over the next decade.

HEADLINE: The Governor's Gift: Energy

 BODY:
Gov. Mario Cuomo's ambitious plan to revitalize New York City is more than welcome. It is essential. Mr. Cuomo, while remaining helpful, had kept aloof from the city's deepening fiscal crisis. But now he has acknowledged his leadership role as Governor and come up with an imaginative roster of programs that, though short on detail, is long on promise.
Not all his ideas are new. Many are familiar old ones cleverly repackaged, and many rely on money and an economy he does not control. Indeed, several of his proposals are expensive prescriptions for his successor. But even so, he offers New York City a gift: the energy of leadership. 
 What New Yorkers need now is chapter and verse. But if the city can realize even half of his wish list, he will have created a solid legacy. And in the meantime his initiative puts constructive pressure on the other players in this great municipal drama -- City Hall, the labor unions, the business community and the State Legislature.
The most significant fiscal part of Governor Cuomo's new program is his overdue declaration of a campaign for a gradual state takeover of Medicaid, as Mayor David Dinkins has long urged. New York is one of only five states that require localities to pay part of those soaring expenses. Mr. Cuomo proposes that they surrender some of their tax revenues -- though he has yet to say how much. The state would also run Medicaid, finally assuring that the same government that provides the money is responsible for spending it.
The Governor also offers to support a list of public works proposals that would create thousands of jobs. Few are new and many have long been stalled. Even so, by adopting them as his own priorities he might move them along. Among the proposals are these:
Transit to and Between Airports. Mr. Cuomo proposes using a $3-a-passenger tax to build a light rail system of "people movers" connecting city airports, subways and commuter rail lines. The idea requires Port Authority approval of the tax and its use.
Rail Freight Connection. He recognizes the importance of finishing the Oak Point rail freight link in the South Bronx, to relieve the city of much truck traffic. This long-stalled project needs an additional $93 million, from the state and the Port Authority.
Hunters Point. This huge residential and commercial project along the East River in Queens would be nearly the size of Battery Park City. The Governor's commitment to create a subsidiary of the Urban Development Corporation to coordinate the project could, if the economy cooperates, give it a jump-start.
Riverside South. Mr. Cuomo wants to push along this immense West Side development by financing environmental and planning studies for a new road to replace the Miller Highway. The source of funding remains unclear, however, and there's no certainty he can win approval to demolish the Miller Highway, now being rebuilt with Federal funds.
Science Library. The Governor's plan encompasses the creation of the world's largest science, industry and business library. The state and city have agreed to provide about a quarter of the needed $75 million to $80 million. The rest will come from the New York Public Library, donations and state bonds.
There are other proposals in Governor Cuomo's program, like the long-deferred Second Avenue subway and a fanciful suggestion for high-speed ferries. But the test of his initiative does not lie in the specifics of individual proposals, no matter how wishful their concept or uncertain their fate. What the Governor has now given New York City is leadership, and hope.

HEADLINE: U.S. Blockade Is Cuba's Economic Problem

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The United States-Cuba policy formula in "Fortress Cuba, Lonely Cuba" (editorial, Sept. 8) seems to be reducible to the proposition, let Cuba rot. I am prepared to accept that your conclusion may be the result of faulty data, and point out mistakes that deserve correction: 
Cuba has a constitution adopted by 97.7 percent of voters in a 1976 referendum by secret ballot. Elections, also by secret ballot, are regularly held among candidates for local bodies, who elect members of provincial and national bodies. The system is similar to those of many Western European democracies where the government is elected by the members of Parliament.
Candidates in Cuba do not need to be millionaires; they are freely nominated to run from the ranks of their own constituencies and periodically must account to their voters. Even though voting in Cuba is not compulsory, and elections are held more often than in the United States, participation in all our elections runs higher than 90 percent.
You overlook the illegal, implacable economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed on Cuba by the United States for more than 30 years. That blockade prevents Cuba from even purchasing foodstuffs and medicines from the United States. That is the major cause of the material difficulties Cuba faces and a continuing source of hardship for its people.
It was the United States Government in 1959 and 1960, in violation of bilateral agreements, that reduced and then canceled Cuba's sugar quota in the United States market. Washington began this and other economic aggression before Cuba proclaimed socialism as a goal. As Dwight D. Eisenhower and Richard M. Nixon recognized in their memoirs, from the first weeks of 1959 the United States began drawing plans against Cuba, and on March 17, 1960, the President approved and ordered execution of the plan that would culminate in the Bay of Pigs failure.
You fault Cuba for lack of economic diversification. Cuba now successfully uses every industrial possibility of sugar cane -- production of energy, paper, cattle feed, particle board and many other byproducts. Biotechnology, the pharmaceutical industry and manufacture of medical equipment and electronics play an increasingly important role in our economy. Many United States citizens suffer the consequences of not being able to buy type B antimeningococcal vaccine, which the United States does not produce, but whose importation the United States prohibits.
It is true that, as a result of the United States blockade, Cubans face difficulties and limitations. But in Cuba, no one knows hunger or malnutrition. Despite enormous external obstacles, our socialist society guarantees a dignified and decent existence to all, including free education, and medical and hospital assistance.
No one in Cuba suffers the sad and miserable life of countless millions in other parts of the world, including the United States, who lack employment, schools and medical attention, and who wander the streets without housing, without care and without hope.

Representative of Cuba at the U.N.

HEADLINE: Bush Forecasts G.O.P. Victory In Trenton Fight

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., Sept. 24

 BODY:
President Bush came to New Jersey tonight and raised $800,000 for Republican legislative candidates, who he predicted would take control of the State Legislature in November.
"After talking to Republican leaders and reading about what is happening in the state," the President said to about 1,000 Republicans at a fund-raising dinner at the Ramada Renaissance Hotel here, "I believe the Republicans will take both the Assembly and the Senate in the fall." 
 Although it was a political speech, the President never mentioned state tax increases engineered by the Democrats and the Governor, nor did he mention Gov. Jim Florio by name.
The only reference in his address was oblique, when Mr. Bush said, "Frankly, I wish Tom Kean was still governor of this state."
 
Florio Goes Unmentioned
 Former Gov. Thomas H. Kean, who sat at the head table and introduced the President, thanked Mr. Bush for campaigning on his behalf in 1980, but he also did not mention Governor Florio.
The President's speech came against a favorable political background, in which Mr. Bush has few problems save a stuttering economy and rising unemployment.
Mr. Bush alluded to the jobless when he said that Democrats wanted to extend unemployment benefits. But he said that doing so would increase the national debt.
The President is reluctant to tap into the $8 billion Unemployment Trust Fund, although many Republicans in Congress favor using the fund for a 10-week extension of benefits for those whose payments are running out. Democrats want 10 or more weeks.
Mr. Bush said the best way to attack unemployment was to "pass the capital gains differential," an income-tax revision that would allow greater tax deductions for investment income. That, he said, would spur industrial and research growth that would ultimately lead to job creation.
He also chided Democrats for attacking his domestic program.
"I'm a little tired of hearing from Democrats that we have no domestic agenda," Mr. Bush said, adding that "our national drug policy is working," and "our crime package is the most comprehensive in American history."
He suggested several times that voting for Republicans would "bring common sense back to government" in New Jersey and the nation, a hint that "common sense" could be a Republican theme in elections this fall.

HEADLINE: Brazil Seeks Credit Deal

BYLINE: By AP

DATELINE: BRASILIA, Sept. 25

 BODY:
Brazil said today that it would present a new plan to foreign creditors next week to reschedule the $52 billion it owes to private banks.
The Brazilian central bank said its top debt negotiator, Pedro Malan, would travel to New York to meet with the banks' steering committee on Monday. 
 Officials hope the United States Government will put pressure on the banks to reach a deal with Brazil, which owes a total of $123 billion to foreign lenders.
In August, Brazil offered to convert its private foreign debt into five new types of medium- and long-term bonds. But creditors demanded a shorter repayment period, higher interest rates and payment guarantees.
No details of Brazil's new proposal were given. But the Government is expected to ask for new loans in exchange for concessions on the bond issue. The money would reportedly be used to buy United States Treasury bonds. Their earnings would guarantee the payment of principal on the new bonds that Brazil issues.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Copper at Five-Month High On News of Zaire Violence

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Copper futures prices jumped to a five-month high yesterday on New York's Commodity Exchange amid reports that violence in Zaire had spread to the copper-rich southern tip of the central African nation.
Copper for delivery in September climbed 2.85 cents, to $1.1025 a pound, the highest settlement of a near-term copper contract since April 18. Other copper contracts finished 1.75 cents to 2.65 cents higher. 
 The chief market influence was the increasing unrest in Zaire, the world's fourth-largest copper exporter, where 30 people were reported to have been killed this week in rioting and looting by mutinous Zairean soldiers. The rioters aim to unseat Zaire's ruler of 26 years, Mobuto Sese Seko.
European officials of the state-owned mining company, Gecamines, were unable to confirm reports that the company's offices in the southern city of Kolwezi had been bombed.
The reports fueled speculation that Zaire's 1991 copper production will fall far below the company's recent forecast of 250,000 tons, compared with last year's 400,000 tons. Many analysts expect Zairean production of 180,000 tons this year.
Bette Raptopoulos, metals analyst with Prudential Securities Inc., said Zaire's copper output could fall as low as 125,000 tons.
The copper mines are Zaire's economic lifeline, said James Steel, an analyst with Refco Inc. in New York. "That's all they have," he said. "If they seize the mines, this President will fall."
Mr. Steel said copper's other supply-and-demand fundamentals were negative but that prices would surely rise if shipments from Zaire were interrupted.
Crude oil ended nearly unchanged on the New York Mercantile Exchange after recovering from a decline started by a tentative agreement among OPEC ministers to increase their oil production ceiling by a million barrels a day. The move is likely to hold cash crude prices steady in coming months, OPEC officials said.
Crude for delivery in November rose 2 cents, to $22.21 a barrel; October heating oil fell 0.09 cent, to 63.60 cents a gallon; October unleaded gasoline rose 0.70 cent, to 61.78 cents a gallon; November natural gas rose 1 cent, to $1.899 for 1,000 cubic feet.
Grain and soybean futures ended mixed on the Chicago Board of Trade as selling linked to the advancing Midwest harvest offset buying prompted by easier credit terms for the Soviet Union.
Wheat for delivery in December settled 3/4 cent higher at $3.27 1/4 a bushel; December corn finished 1 1/4 cents lower at $2.47 1/4 a bushel; December oats fell 1 1/2 cents, to $1.29 a bushel; November soybeans ended 1 3/4 cents lower at $5.90 1/4 a bushel.
Cattle futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in line with higher cash cattle prices and signs of stronger wholesale beef demand. Pork futures retreated as hog traders began evening up their positions ahead of tomorrow's quarterly hog inventory report, which is expected to show an expanding hog supply.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off in U.S. Trading; Iraq Move Eases War Fears

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell in quiet domestic trading yesterday after posting gains overseas. Gold prices were mixed.
Analysts attributed some dollar selling to an Iraqi promise to allow unimpeded helicopter flights by United Nations nuclear inspection teams. The move by Baghdad helped ease some concerns of traders about a possible renewal of conflict in the Middle East. 
 The dollar, which is seen as a safe currency in times of international turmoil, had gained over the last week from Iraq's refusal to allow inspections of its suspected nuclear sites and President Bush's threat to escort the United Nations flights with American warplanes.
Mr. Bush put that threat on hold yesterday.
Analysts said the dollar was not affected by the Commerce Department's report that durable goods orders fell 3.8 percent in August.
"The durable goods was somewhat anticipated," said Walter Simon, a vice president at Bank Julius Baer & Company. "People are taking a break after 10 straight days of fairly big moves." The report concerns orders for goods that are expected to last three years or more.
The British pound rose to $1.7355 in New York, from $1.7290 late on Tuesday. But in earlier trading in London, sterling fell to $1.7330, from $1.7430 on Tuesday.
The dollar fell to 133.22 Japanese yen in New York, from 133.45 on Tuesday. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar rose to 133.22 yen from 132.97 yen, and in London, it fell to 133.20 yen.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late on Tuesday, included: 1.6805 German marks, down from 1.6865; 1.4635 Swiss francs, down from 1.4690; 5.7260 French francs, down from 5.7455; 1,256.75 Italian lire, down from 1,261.00, and 1.13455 Canadian dollars, up from 1.13375.

HEADLINE: India Approves Ventures With Americans

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 25

 BODY:
India's Commerce Minister announced today that his Government had approved two joint ventures between American multinationals and local companies, and preliminary plans for two others.
The minister, Palaniappan Chidambaram, said India had given final approval for a joint venture by I.B.M. and the Indian conglomerate Tata Industries to produce I.B.M. Personal System 2 computers and computer programs, and by the Indian auto maker Maruti Ltd. and the Ford Motor Company to produce aluminum radiators for cars. 
 The International Business Machines Corporation is returning to the Indian market after the company left in 1977 in response to a law limiting foreign ownership to 40 percent. The bitter dispute was a landmark in efforts by third world countries to limit the influence of multinational corporations.
 
Change in the Law
 A new law that took effect on July 24 provides for the automatic approval of foreign stakes up to 51 percent, and an accelerated approval process for foreign companies seeking higher stakes, Mr. Chidambaram said. The Indian Government has eased restrictions on foreign investment as part of a broader strategy of reducing the Government's role in the economy and reducing India's reliance on bank loans to finance economic growth, the minister said.
India is struggling with a large trade deficit, continuing trade disputes with the United States and a $69 billion foreign debt. On Friday a group of international lenders led by the World Bank endorsed the Government's economic stabilization plan, which calls for a 23 percent devaluation of the rupee and smaller budget deficits, and increased assistance to India.
But Ajay S. Kapur, an economist at the WEFA Group, an economic consulting firm in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., said that India still faced formidable problems in attracting foreign investment. India's reputation for low manufacturing wages is an illusion because of low productivity, steadily rising government salaries and powerful unions with close ties to political parties, he said.
"One shouldn't think of India as a land of multitudinous landless laborers waiting to be hired to make transistors," he said, while adding that engineers, software programmers and other professionals were often paid far less in India than in the West.
 
Few Investments Come In
 India attracted only $70 million worth of foreign investment last year, compared with $480 million even in the Philippines, Mr. Kapur said.
Mr. Chidambaram is on a five-day visit to the United States to woo American businesses and discuss trade issues with the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills. But the Indian Commerce Minister said he had not discussed the United States' investigation of charges that India allows the piracy of American patents, copyrights and trademarks. The four-month-old investigation could lead to trade sanctions on Nov. 26.
The Indian Government has also approved preliminary plans by the General Motors Corporation and Hindustan Motors Ltd. to build cars and automobile parts, and for the Kellogg Company to set up a breakfast cereal factory and sell stock to local investors, the minister said.
Richard E. Lovell, a spokesman for Kellogg, which is based in Battle Creek, Mich., said India's growing middle class and strong domestic transportation and distribution network had attracted the company. "We see India as a good-potential, long-term-growth market," he said.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Taxable Money Funds Off; Tax-Frees Up

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Yields of tax-free and taxable money market funds moved in different directions for the week ended yesterday, with tax-free yields moving up and the yields on taxable funds going down.
Walter S. Frank, chief economist for IBC/Donoghue's Money Market Fund Report, which monitors the funds, pointed out that "tax-frees are affected more by supply and demand, while the taxables are influenced primarily by monetary policy." 
 Mr. Frank explained that recently a larger supply of tax-free securities had been available. He said that the increase in the supply of municipal debt came after a period of low-supply had driven up prices.
 
Response to Fed
 "Now the prices of tax-exempts are coming down, and yields going up," he said, adding that the yields on taxables have been moving down because of the Federal Reserve's recent easing of rates.
The average 7-day compounded average yield for the tax-exempts rose to 4.43 percent from 4.30 percent a week ago, while the simple yield rose to 4.33 percent from 4.21 percent. The average 30-day compounded yield rose to 4.28 percent, from 4.20 the previous week, and the 30-day simple yield rose to 4.19, compared with 4.12 percent the previous week.
The assets of tax-exempt funds dropped by $308 million, to $87.1 billion, and portfolio holdings averaged 60 days to maturity, compared with 61 days a week ago.
The highest yield among funds with assets of more than $100 million was the Strong Municipal Money Market Fund, with a 7-day compounded yield of 5.32 percent.
Among funds investing in individual state securities, in New York, the Salomon Brothers New York Municipal Money Market continued to provide the highest 7-day compounded yield at 4.98 percent, up from 4.83 percent.
In Connecticut, the Prudential Connecticut Municipal Money Market Series again led with a 4.76 percent 7-day compounded yield, up from 4.58, while in New Jersey, Calvert N.J. Tax Free Reserves reported a 7-day yield of 5 percent, up from 4.92 percent.
On taxables, Mr. Frank said that the average 7-day compounded yield was 5.31 percent, down from 5.35 percent, and the simple yield was 5.18 percent, down from 5.21 percent. The 30-day average compounded yield dropped to 5.38 percent, down from 5.41 percent, and the 30-day simple yield was down to 5.24 percent from 5.27 percent.
 
Taxable Assets Decline
 Assets of the taxable funds declined by $900 million, to $456.1 billion, Institutional ownership, however, was up by $670 million, which means that the public was doing the selling and probably moving into short-term bond funds or other fixed-income assets for better yields. Mr. Frank said the average maturities of the taxable funds remained at 60 days.
For the third straight week, the taxable fund with the best return was Riverside Capital Money Market Fund of Columbus, Ohio, with a 7-day compounded yield of 6.44 percent.

HEADLINE: Durables and Resales Of Homes Off in August

BYLINE: By AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 25

 BODY:
Factory orders for durable goods and sales of existing homes fell last month, according to reports released today, prompting concern about the sectors that were expected to lead the economy out of recession.
"The reluctant recovery does not look too durable at the moment," said John M. Albertine, the head of an economic forecasting firm here. 
 Daryl Delano, an economist with Cahners Economics in Newton, Mass., concurred, saying, "There's reason to fear the recovery has stalled."
 
'A Solid Gain'
 But Michael J. Boskin, the chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said the economy was growing in the July-to-September quarter and played down the August decline in durable goods orders, those for items expected to last three or more years.
Noting that orders posted a record gain in July, Mr. Boskin said the two months taken together reflect "a solid gain." But he acknowledged a need "to see an improvement in the consumer sector."
The Commerce Department said today that durable goods orders fell by 3.8 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $125.9 billion, from $130.8 billion in July. A sharp drop in transportation orders led the declines in most large categories.
"We have severe doubts about whether the surge in manufacturing can be sustained, given the drop in consumer confidence and the weakness in domestic automobile sales," Mr. Albertine said.
 
Realtors' Report
 In another report, the National Association of Realtors said today that sales of existing single-family homes fell by 2.1 percent in August, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.2 million, down from 3.3 million a month earlier.
The report also showed a revised drop in sales in July -- 7.5 percent, steeper than the 6.7 percent decline initially reported. Sales of new homes also fell in July, according to Government figures.
Until July, sales of new and existing homes had risen every month since the housing recession bottomed out last January.
The July rise in durable-goods orders was revised to 11.7 percent, the biggest gain since the Commerce Department began tracking them in 1958. Orders were first estimated to have advanced 11.2 percent.
Still, it was just the third advance since the beginning of the year, and the August relapse meant orders for the first eight months were down by four-tenths of a percent from those of the 1990 period.
Durable goods are considered a barometer of manufacturers' production plans. A decrease could result in less production and a loss of jobs.
A Production Slowdown
Mr. Delano said most of the good economic news recently had concerned production, including manufacturing and housing. But, he added, this activity is slowing because of a lack of demand from consumers, who represent two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
"People are still concerned about jobs and income," he said.
The durables report showed that transportation orders fell by 9.2 percent in August, the first decline since April. A large decrease in aircraft orders offset gains in other equipment including automobiles.
Transportation orders had risen by 27.1 percent in July, three-fourths of which was from the aircraft industry.
But even without the decline in the transportation category, overall orders were still down by 1.6 percent.
 
Nonmilitary Orders Down
 Nonmilitary orders for capital goods, excluding aircraft, also fell, by 2.7 percent, to $24.8 billion, after advancing 5 percent a month earlier. This category is often a measure of business confidence and plans to expand and modernize.
But unfilled orders rose three-tenths of a percent, to $502.1 billion, the second straight advance after four consecutive drops. A rise in unfilled orders often portends increased output to keep up with demand.
The often-volatile military category posted a 14 percent gain, to $10.7 billion, after a 13.2 percent advance in July. These orders had plunged by 13.1 percent in June. Excluding the military category, orders were off by 5.2 percent.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
A Campaign 'Of a Lifetime' By Mercedes

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
THE most extensive advertising campaign ever for the most expensive line of Mercedes-Benz automobiles ever -- with an expected sticker price as high as $125,000 -- will introduce the redesigned S-Class as "the car of a lifetime."
Beginning on Monday, elegantly understated advertisements by McCaffrey & McCall Inc., will herald the first complete overhaul of the top-of-the-line S-Class in 11 years. Besides two lushly celebratory television commercials and Mercedes-Benz's largest distribution of magazine inserts, the company will send out brochures and videotapes to pique the interest of affluent car buyers, who are being pursued as never before. 
 "We've been more aggressive than most people would have anticipated from Mercedes-Benz," said John Doig, deputy chairman and chief creative officer for McCaffrey, the agency for Mercedes-Benz of North America Inc. since 1979. Still, the campaign speaks in the characteristic voice of the German car maker, a mix of the "poetic" and "motor oil," he said in an interview yesterday in his midtown Manhattan office.
"You have to feel moved to get into this car," added Albert Weiss, general manager of marketing communications for Mercedes-Benz, during a call to Mr. Doig's office from a dealers' meeting in San Francisco. "Part of it is the emotion, or, you might say, the passion, of Mercedes."
Stirring that passion is the mission of the commercials, which will start their run during "Monday Night Football" on ABC. "You have built a rewarding life on understanding the difference between excellence and next-best," a soothing-voiced announcer says in one spot, as a car emerges from misty mountains. "Now, Mercedes-Benz has built the car for you."
The spots call the S-Class "the car of a lifetime, for the people who have created it and the people who will drive it."
The multi-fold-out insert echoes that hushed tone. "Nothing feels like a Mercedes," it says. "The sense of security as deep as the pilings under a bridge. The sheer unflappable poise. The strength. The substance." More than 20 million inserts will appear through January in 21 magazines from Architectural Digest to Travel & Leisure.
The 28-page brochure, as well as the 10-minute videotape, will offer more detail about the S-Class's five models, including their self-closing doors, double-paned glass and Bose sound system. The campaign continues using the long-time corporate theme, "Engineered like no other car in the world."
The recession is complicating the S-Class introduction. It is "probably one of the first where affluent people haven't spent freely through it," said Will Metzger, McCaffrey's executive vice president and management supervisor, who accompanied Mr. Weiss to San Francisco. The agency is undaunted, he added, because the company's "values of safety, durability and reliability" should mesh with car buyers' new, less flashy attitudes.
"You can sell them," he continued, "but it takes a much more concentrated effort."
The S-Class models cost more than most other imported cars. While Mr. Weiss would not discuss prices, which are to be announced on Tuesday, they are expected to range from around $65,000 for the 300SE and 300SD (diesel) sedans to around $125,000 for the 600SEL sedan with a V-12 engine. Current S-Class prices range from about $53,000 to $90,000.
Mr. Weiss also declined to discuss the S-Class ad budget, other than to say it would be "the largest effort we've ever put together for a new product." From 80 percent to 90 percent of all Mercedes-Benz's national advertising for the rest of the year will be devoted to the line, he added.
National ad spending for all Mercedes-Benz cars totaled $88.3 million last year, according to Leading National Advertisers, and $42.6 million for the first six months of this year.
Through August, Mercedes-Benz's United States car sales were down 21.2 percent from the first eight months of 1990. That compares with declines of 17.9 percent for BMW, 21.1 percent for Volvo and 48.2 percent for Jaguar.

Regular Bidding Pattern Returns

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Customers returned to their regular bidding patterns at yesterday's auction of $9.25 billion worth of new five-year Treasury notes.
The notes were sold at an average yield of 7.05 percent, down from the average yield of 7.37 percent at the last five-year note sale on Aug. 28. 
 Of the bids that were accepted by the Treasury, more than 93 percent were submitted by New York-based primary dealers.
That was a sharp turnaround from Tuesday's two-year note auction, when New York dealers ended up buying only 78 percent of the $13 billion worth of notes that were sold. Typically, about 90 percent of all winning bids are placed through New York dealers.
The big drop in New York's share on Tuesday led to speculation among some market participants that the Salomon Brothers scandal might have persuaded banks, pension funds and other big institutions that in the past have placed bids through New York's 35 primary dealers to bypass the dealers and submit bids directly with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
 
No Ready Explanations
 Traders and analysts were at a loss to explain the swing back in the number of dealers placing bids. But because of its longer maturity, the five-year securities are more speculative instruments than two-year notes. As such, dealers are generally more comfortable buying the riskier securities than other investors might be.
"In terms of distribution, this was a much more normal auction," one government bond trader said. "But it is also the first auction since the Salomon scandal broke that the price of the issue has fallen after the results were announced. Now we will have to see how the market reacts to paper that for the first time in six weeks or so is trading at a loss."
Late yesterday the five-year notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 7.06 percent.
The five-year auction took place during a session when prices in the secondary market for Treasury notes and bonds fell slightly in light trading.
Reports that new orders for durable goods and sales of existing homes both fell during August were largely shrugged off by traders.
 
Drop in Durable Goods
 The 3.8 percent drop in durable goods orders was somewhat smaller than most analysts had expected, and only partly erased the huge 11.7 percent increase reported for July.
To some analysts, a second consecutive increase in order backlogs was more important than the drop in new orders.
"The fact that unfilled orders rose for the second straight month suggests a continued moderate increase in production," said Dana Johnson, chief money market economist at the First National Bank of Chicago. "What remains unclear is whether there will be enough of a pickup in final demand to support further growth."
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 102 19/32, down 5/ 32, to yield 7.89 percent, compared with 7.88 percent late Tuesday.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 102 1/8 in late trading, down 2/ 32, to yield 7.56 percent. And the 6 1/8 percent two-year notes auctioned on Tuesday were offered on a when-issued basis late yesterday at a price to yield 6.10 percent.
 
Bill Rates Off Slightly
 Rates on short-term Treasury bills fell marginally.
By late in the session three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.15 percent, down 2 basis points, or two-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by 1 basis point, to a late offered rate of 5.19 percent.
In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, investors snapped up a $524 million offering of serial bonds from the State of California.
The securities, which were sold at competitive bid, were won by a group led by BankAmerica.
The securities were reoffered to investors at yields from 4.30 percent on bonds maturing in 1992 to a maximum yield of 6.35 percent on securities maturing in 2010 and 2011.
The issue is rated AAA by both Moody's Investors Service and by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Investment bankers involved in the transaction said late yesterday that all but $46 million of the bonds had been sold.
 
Corporate Issues
 In the investment-grade corporate bond market, Salomon Brothers acted as lead manager on an offering of $150 million worth of three-year notes for Wells Fargo & Company.
The 7 5/8 percent notes, which mature Oct. 1, 1994, were priced at $99.724 to yield 7.73 percent, 1.35 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 6 7/8 percent three-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated A-2 by Moody's and A-minus by Standard & Poor's.
Participants in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds said prices of most widely quoted issues dipped by about 1/8 point.
Corporate bond traders said price of most issues in the secondary market for investment-grade issues were little changed. Activity remains very light, they said.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of five-year Treasury notes:

French Retailer Seeks Piece Of the Fifth Avenue Trade

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
As Galeries Lafayette prepares to open its first American store in Trump Tower on Saturday, two questions seem to be on everyone's lips: Who will Donald Trump escort to the black-tie gala this evening? And can the fashionable French store survive some of the stiffest competition in American retailing?
The question about Mr. Trump's sidekick will be answered tonight, but questions about Galeries Lafayette's success will take longer to answer. After all, other French, Japanese and Italian retailers have faltered badly in the United States. After the curiosity seekers have browsed through the store, retailing experts say, they wonder whether Galeries Lafayette can attract the jaded and cautious shoppers who have severely cut back their spending at its Fifth Avenue neighbors. 
 "It must be different," said Kurt Barnard, a widely followed retailing consultant and publisher of Barnard's Retail Marketing Report. "If it can't distinguish itself from other specialty stores, people will come on opening day to see what it's like and then go right back to shopping at Bloomingdale's and Saks."
Georges Meyer, the Paris-based chain's vibrant chairman and chief executive, simultaneously acknowledges his competition and dismisses it. "I would be a fool not to be concerned, but I can only say that it's always the same thing," he said. "In the desert island, you have no competition, but you also have no customers. In New York, you have many, many customers and also much competition."
Among Galeries Lafayette's nearest neighbors are Bergdorf Goodman and Henri Bendel, while Bloomingdale's and Saks Fifth Avenue anchor the outposts of one of the world's premier shopping districts.
The mere mention of such names has chilled the ambitions of many potential competitors. But Mr. Meyer and Eugenia Ulasewicz, the former Bloomindale's executive he chose to head up Galeries Lafayette U.S.A., are forging ahead with an almost exclusive mix of European labels, carrying price tags of $300 to $700 for women's suits and dresses. The Manhattan store will carry only women's clothing, accessories and cosmetics.
From the cafe au lait and croissants on opening day to the cash registers with bilingual displays, Galeries Lafayette, at Fifth Avenue and 57th Street, is making a point of being Gallic. "We don't have to be French; we are a French store," said Ms. Ulasewicz, who is an American. "As a French store, we are going to be different from the merchandise we sell to the currency exchange service we have."
The French sights, sounds and smells all add up to a loud vive la difference, which retail experts say is almost the only way Galeries Lafayette can survive. Other foreign retailers have faltered in the United States because they emulated their successful American counterparts too closely, said Jack Hyde, a professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology.
He cited Seibu, the flashy Japanese department store chain that opened a branch in Los Angeles in the early 1960's. It closed when customers learned they could get the same merchandise across the street at the May Company.
 
Others' Attempts
 After its initial success, Benetton, the Italian sportswear company, has had difficulty in the United States market. And Takashimaya, the Japanese department store chain that is building an office tower on Fifth Avenue, has planned a retail store on the lower floors but is proceeding cautiously after a previous specialty store venture in New York failed to meet the company's expectations.
"Differences in culture, differences in society, make it difficult for outsiders to operate a department store here," said Jiro Shinohara, executive vice president of Takashimaya U.S.A.
Mr. Meyer contended that there were very specific reasons why other foreign retailers failed to win over the price-sensitive American consumer.
In the case of a well-established competitor, Au Printemps, a French department store that opened an American branch in 1987 and closed it in 1989, its location in a mall outside Denver had more to do with its demise than its choice of merchandise or its selling strategies, he said.
At Galeries Lafayette, only one American garment maker, Nicole Miller, is represented among the predominantly French designs hung on the sculptured steel racks specially designed for the store by the Walker Group, a New York-based architectural firm.
Kookai, Claudie Pierlot, Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, Lolita Bis, Plein Sud and P. J. Hoenscheid are among the many European labels that make up the $10 million worth of merchandise in the store for the opening. Some of these labels are carried by other New York specialty and department stores, but Galeries Lafayette will carry them in greater depth.
Other experts say Galeries Lafayette may even turn the tables on its American competitors. Many American chains are saddled with huge debts, are in bankruptcy or are simply suffering through the recession, which gives foreign retailers an advantage.
 
Good Timing for a Move?
 "Yes, it's a zero-sum game, but the toll of that game has left the U.S. retailing industry in a very precarious position," said Randall E. Gebhardt, senior partner with Retail Planning Associates Inc., a retail consulting firm based in Columbus, Ohio.
"Take Bloomingdale's and Macy's," Mr. Gebhardt said. "Both of those operators because of their financial structures are unable to implement the aggressive marketing and merchandising strategies that would enable them to fend off an aggressor like Galeries Lafayette."
That advantage, coupled with the strong relationships Galeries Lafayette has built with designers over its 99-year history, will give the store an advantage.
Galeries Lafayette can coax its designers into producing exclusive merchandise or allowing Galeries Lafayette to introduce their lines in the United States. Lolita Lempica, for example, is starting her more moderately priced or "bridge" line.

HEADLINE: Dow Off 8.05 as Nasdaq Index Sets Record

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks fell slightly in rudderless trading yesterday, while smaller issues reached record levels for the second time in four sessions.
The Dow Jones industrial average dipped 8.05 points, to 3,021.02. But the Nasdaq composite index, which tracks the performance of smaller stocks traded over the counter, rose 1.34, to 527.81, shattering the record set on Friday. In that session, the index surged 4.52, to 527.19. 
 "People are looking to the over-the-counter market for smaller stocks that haven't participated in this overall rally," said Norman J. Shapiro, the senior vice president and manager of equities at Vantage Securities in Edison, N.J. "People are looking for value."
 
Trading at 153.9 Million
 Volume on the Big Board was light, with 153.9 million shares traded; a moderate 171.5 million shares changed hands on Tuesday. Declining issues outpaced advancing ones yesterday, 838 to 732.
Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.83, to 386.88, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index lost 0.37, to 212.53. But the American Stock Exchange market-value index crept up 0.75, to 372.91.
As in Friday's session, the interest in smaller stocks was fueled yesterday by gains in computer and biotechnology issues, analysts said.
Oracle Systems, up 2 1/8, to 13 5/8, was the most actively traded over-the-counter issue, with 10.2 million shares changing hands. The software company said on Tuesday that net income for its first fiscal quarter, which ended on Aug. 31, was $2.4 million, or 2 cents a share, compared with a loss of $29 million, or 22 cents a share, in the 1990 period. The report was better than expected, and several analysts raised their earnings estimates for the company.
Other over-the-counter winners were the 3Com Corporation, a computer company, which climbed 1 1/2, to 9 3/4; Immunex, a biotechnology company, which soared 4 3/4, to 51, and Chiron, another biotechnology company, which inched up 1 5/8, to 70 1/4.
But blue-chip issues did not fare as well, bobbing up and down within a narrow trading range for most of the day before slipping a bit in the last two hours of trading.
 
Some Staying Out
 Many investors, eager for fresh economic news and uneasy about third-quarter earnings, continued to sit on the sidelines. But trading was active in some selective stocks.
Upjohn, up 3 1/4, to 47 1/2, rose sharply on what traders said were recurring rumors that the pharmaceutical company might soon face a hostile takeover attempt. Upjohn would not to comment on the rumors.
General Dynamics, up 3 7/8, to 49 1/2, was the biggest winner on the Big Board, following positive remarks by its chairman and chief executive, William A. Anders. He said the company's third-quarter earnings would probably exceed $1.50 a share, the median of estimates by analysts. Mr. Anders also said the company was considering the possibility of a stock buyback or special dividend.
For the second straight day, Salomon Brothers gained on the Big Board, closing up 5/8, to 23 1/8. Though it dipped on Tuesday morning to its low for the year, the stock rebounded that afternoon and closed up 3/4, to 22 1/2. Trading in the stock continued to be heavy yesterday.
In a letter made public on Tuesday, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, indicated that Salomon's house-cleaning in response to the Treasuries market scandal last month might preserve its status as a primary dealer.
Another brokerage, Morgan Stanley & Company, leaped 3 5/8, to 52 5/8. Some analysts said yesterday that they had increased their projected 1991 earnings estimates for Morgan. It was the second strong performance for the stock in as many days; Morgan closed up 1 1/4, to 49, on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Inventors in Search Of New Must-Haves

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN

 BODY:
MEMORABLE dates in the annals of home improvement. 1860: Li- noleum. 1938: Teflon. 1945: Tup- perware. 2001: Floating furni- ture.
History marches on. 
 Humankind has a seemingly inexhaustible lust for invention. Ten years ago, it was almost impossible to predict that by 1991, fax machines and portable telephones would be the stuff of everyday life. By 2001, according to a new book, they may be joined by voice-activated microwave ovens, floating furniture, robot bartenders and remote-controlled vacuum cleaners.
Dr. Myun W. Lee, a human factors engineer and director of the Research Institute of Engineering Science at Seoul National University in South Korea, is convinced that the world will be a better place because of his mushroom-shaped, remote-control vacuum cleaner, now in production. It works like a toy robot and has a snap-off control box attached to its handle.
"If you are in the mood for exercise, go to the aerobics club," he said in a telephone interview. "Don't vacuum."
"More Future Stuff: Over 250 Inventions That Will Change Your Life by 2001," by Malcolm Abrams and Harriet Bernstein, to be published by Penguin Books next month, explores the outer limits of human ingenuity. From Jetsonian high-tech engineers to resolute backyard putterers, the book chronicles designs that are actually on the drawing board or in production.
Many of the ideas spring from personal experience. "We all have an element of creativity," said Gerald Udell, a professor of marketing at Southwest Missouri State University who evaluates inventions for individuals and companies. "The question is, do we take that creativity and do something with it?"
Ingenuity needs to be matched by gumption. Had a Swiss machine shop operator not been obsessed with burrs, there would have been no Velcro. Had an Oregon track coach not stuffed a piece of rubber into his wife's waffle iron, the world would be without the Nike waffle sole.
According to Harold Livesay, a professor of business and economic history at Texas A & M University in College Station, Tex., there is now a tendency to view inventors as kooks despite a flourishing culture of entrepreneurship. In contrast to Thomas Edison's era, he said, "we've become awfully homogeneous."
"Inventors are risk-takers," he added. "Somewhere early in the 20th century, we shifted from being a risk-taking to a risk-minimizing society."
So behold the risk-takers, the absent-minded professors, the ordinary people equipped with extraordinary ideas. Time will tell which of their concepts will be the microwave ovens of the future, and which are destined for the manual garbage compactor (a new invention).
"A robot bartender might not change the world," said Mr. Abrams. "But if we ever stop believing, we're at a standstill."
Here are some of the new inventions.
 
Vacuum Cleaner
 Dr. Myun W. Lee's motto is, "Let your fingers do the cleaning."
His remote-control vacuum cleaner, called the Power Brush, is one in a line of "High-Touch" products being manufactured by Daewoo Electronics of Seoul, South Korea. In developing the design, which is currently in production but being revised, Dr. Lee had "people with disabilities, the elderly and yuppies" in mind (estimated cost, $500).
To operate the Power Brush, attach the control box to the base and take a seat. To empty, lift the flip-top lid.
Most high-tech products force consumers to "tip-toe through too many functions," he said, adding, "Ordinary people have to learn too many transient things."
Among Dr. Lee's inventions are a voice-activated microwave oven and a personalized television. Upon hearing a verbal command, the oven opens and delivers its tray. Its data base, containing more than 200 recipes, can tell a cook when to "prepare onions"; the rather presumptuous contraption will also have a personalized salt and sugar detector.
Dr. Lee's television adjusts the color according to the program. "If you're watching sports, you might want to emphasize red, blue and yellow," he explained. "Indicate 'Drama' and the colors will go pastel."
 
Infant Exerciser
 On a single day, Drs. Daniel and Lois Fermaglich, husband-and-wife pediatricians in Denville, N.J., treated three infants who had severely injured themselves in walkers.
"Children move five feet per second in a walker," Lois Fermaglich said. "If we don't come up with an alternative, people are going to keep using them."
The Fermaglichs took the challenge. Their stationary infant exerciser, which has yet to find a manufacturer, uses a treadmill that allows a baby to exercise his or her legs without getting into mischief.
The baby sits on a rotating seat in the middle of a circular tray. The device "lets a baby use the upper arm muscles, which develop first, as well as sit, stand, turn, look around the room and play," Dr. Fermaglich said.
A perennial parenting problem is where to seat the baby. Dr. Fermaglich said infants love the stationary walker. Until their idea reaches fruition (estimated cost, $80 to $100), she advises parents to take the wheels off walkers.
"Frustration is a parental concept," she said.
 
Holographic Windows
 Watching the winter sunlight stream through her apartment overlooking the Charles River in Boston, Elisabeth King, an architectural designer, began to dream about new ways to get sunlight into buildings.
She and three colleagues, Hendrik J. Gerritsen, Donald Thorton and David Pitcher, are now developing holographic windows. Their "holographic diffractive structure," a ridgy plastic film, would be incorporated into windows and bend sunlight in a new way.
"Instead of hitting the floor, it would hit the ceiling," Ms. King said. "Rooms would be suffused with a broad gentle glow, like a very big skylight without the hole."
The partners in the Advanced Environmental Research Group Inc. of Providence, R.I., have yet to invent a mass-production process, but are confident of its viability and its ramifications for home design.
"Getting beautiful sunlight into buildings usually requires large amounts of glass," she said. "This would bring nicer light into small areas. You could even project sun to where the plants are."
 
Floating Furniture
 Dr. William Calderwood, a family practitioner in Peoria, Ariz., has a rather Disneyesque idea.
"Space is at such a premium," he said. "I thought, wouldn't it be wonderful if the bed could rise up majestically off the floor?"
The doctor is quite serious about his patented invention, which was inspired by his 6-year-old son, Adam, , who has spinal muscular atrophy. With the Silver Rainbow Company of Hayward, Calif., Dr. Calderwood developed a prototype helium-filled floating bed, which "prevents pressure sores," he said. And unlike a water bed, it is lighter than air.
 
Robot Bartender
 Stephen Grevan, the president of Honeybee Robotics of Manhattan, calls his Robotender "the first step to a more completely automated home."
Mr. Grevan's company designs robots for NASA; this one, however, has commercial potential. With a reach of 4 1/2 feet, the steel-armed bartender (estimated cost, $175,000) is programmed to mix more than 100 drinks, ordered via a personal computer. It can also make coffee and tea.
"Robots like highly organized environments," he said, adding that this one can "measure the perfect dryness in a martini and keep it uniform. That's not something people can do."
 
Portable Vacation Homes
 Hypertat is an acronym for High Performance Habitat, a modular building developed by Mike Jantzen and Ted Bakewell 3d of St. Louis. Like gigantic Lego blocks, the modules, made primarily of plastic, are designed to create small, well-insulated buildings as well as complexes of several thousand square feet, said Mr. Bakewell, a builder.
Unlike a tent, Hypertat is a permanent, rigid-walled structure that sits on telescoping legs above the ground.
There are three test units in the field: an atmospheric research lab 12,000 feet up in the Rockies, a NASA lab in Mississippi and one in the Biosphere 2 in Arizona.
"We want to bring sustainable, energy-efficient creature comforts to remote areas," he said.
The cost for the "ecologically sensitive" habitat would range from $50 to $150 a square foot. The idea, he said, is to "combine the convenience and freedom of an RV with the size and comfort of traditional buildings."
 
Bike Wheels
 Futuristic bicycle wheels, which take their design cues from NASA airfoils, are already on the market. They were designed by Mark W. Hopkins, an avid cyclist and a senior research engineer with Du Pont's Advanced Composites Division, and his colleague Frank Principe.
Instead of bladed spokes, the wheels have three thick high-performance spokes configured like a large peace symbol. The airfoil shapes allow air to pass with minimum resistance, resulting in lower drag.
The wheels, consisting of an aluminum rim and spokes made of carbon, epoxy resin, glass and Kevlar fibers, enable a serious biker to travel a full mile an hour faster.
At $750 a wheel, that's who they are intended for -- though "some people are buying them because they look neat," Mr. Hopkins said.
 
Roll-Up Grill
 LeRoy Shinler, a sprinkler fitter in Rush City, Minn., loved family snowmobile outings but hated cleaning up after the hotdog roasts.
"After cooking, you have a greasy mess," he said, "and what do you do with it?"
For years he tried to figure out a way to make a roll-up grill that could be tucked under the snowmobile hood. He finally succeeded in developing a prototype; it has four bendable legs and rolls one way into a cylindrical container -- an ingenious procrastination device that staves off cleaning until you get home (estimated cost, $40).
 
Manual Compactor
 Henry Massonnet, a French inventor, has made a product for the 90's that is already in the marketplace: a manual garbage compactor. Now being distributed by Compac Manufacturing of Virginia Beach, Va., the compactor, which retails for $39.95, is the size of a large-size kitchen garbage can.
"There are more and more packages, and we are creative," Mr. Massonnet said. "This compacts them, you know?"
A standard garbage bag fits inside; when a lever on the lid is pulled, the refuse is crushed.
 
Gutter Cleaner
 William Putnam, a machine operator for Boeing who lives in Portland, Ore., dreads cleaning gutters.
"It's one of the most neglected chores," he said. "It's painstaking. It's dangerous."
So he went to the hardware store, convinced, he said, "that there's got to be some tool for the homeowner that does the same thing as a ladder and water hose."
There wasn't. So he invented one.
He bought some plastic plumbing and a pop-up sprinkler and took a sliding handle off a car-wash brush. The result is his patented Gutter-Cleaning Machine, yet to be manufactured (estimated cost, under $20.) As he explained, it allows the homeowner to "spray along the gutter channel and do the job while they're just walking along."
 
NewHardy Grass
 From the National Turfgrass Evaluation program in Beltsville Md., a self-supporting program partly financed by the Federal Department of Agriculture, comes a new product and uplifting news: a fast-seeding grass that requires 30 to 50 percent less water. The lawn is a mixture of zoysia, known for its ability to withstand heat, drought and poor soil, and tall fescue, a type of cool-season grass. Previously, zoysia had to be planted plug-by-plug like a hair transplant, a time-consuming and expensive business. It also turned brown in winter.
Kevin N. Morris, an agronomist who is the program's director, said the new mixture, which will probably be available in two to three years, is "just about year-round green."
Seed for a 5,000-square-foot lawn would probably cost about $50. A test patch of four acres planted on the Washington Mall withstood the Operation Desert Storm celebrations and recovered in six weeks.
The lawn is potentially exciting because, as Mr. Morris said, "it can forgive the homeowner." The grass, which in tests established itself in 12 to 14 weeks, stayed greener with less water and fertilizer than conventional grass and -- mowers, take heart! -- if not mowed for several weeks, "the neighbors won't call the police on you."

HEADLINE: PARENT & CHILD

BYLINE: By Lawrence Kutner

 BODY:
CHILDREN who are old enough to know what they want, but not yet aware of how much things cost, sometimes become angry and confused when their parents cannot afford to buy things their friends have. Their innocence allows them to ask questions and make statements that can upset parents or make them feel guilty.
Sandra Bou-Assi remembers the confused look on her 8-year-old son Bashir's face this summer. They had invited another boy to their home in Arlington, Mass., to play. The boy refused because they did not own a Nintendo game. 
 "I told Bashir that his friend is the one who's missing out because we do a lot of fun things here," said Ms. Bou-Assi, a single unemployed mother of two sons whose budget is stretched to the limit. Her sons have been asking for separate bedrooms; they do not understand that she cannot afford higher rent. They also refuse to eat the free breakfast and lunch the school provides because doing so will encourage their classmates to tease them.
"It's difficult for them because children can be vicious," Ms. Bou-Assi said. "When their friends go to Disneyland, they want to go, too. I tell them that they'll get there eventually, but they'll have to wait."
To understand why children are so envious and demanding at certain ages, parents must consider a child's stage of development, the values of their household and the symbolism involved.
Preschoolers' demands are likely to be transient. A 4-year-old who sees a particular doll or toy for the first time may insist, with great melodrama, that she has wanted it "all her life!"
"Often the best thing you can do is to avoid impulse buying," said Dr. Martin E. Ford, a developmental psychologist and an associate professor of education at Stanford University. "If you wait a few days, the child's desire will often go away by itself."
In elementary school, children are much more interested in comparing themselves to their peers, and have a much greater desire to fit in. As with adults, money takes on a more symbolic value.
"Adults use money to buy security, affection, power and recognition," said Dr. Kenneth O. Doyle, a psychologist at the University of Minnesota specializing in the psychology of money, who added that children learn the value of money from their parents. He has found that what bothers many children is not being poorer, but standing out from the crowd.
"When children interact, poorer children can feel ashamed, unloved, isolated or weak because they don't have or do the things other children can," Dr. Doyle said. "But richer children can feel tainted by money because it might cause them to be rejected by their classmates. Deep down, they're convinced that their family must have done something bad to have gotten it."
Psychologists stress the importance of looking beneath the surface to learn why a child wants something expensive.
Children can be helped to understand those reasons and explore alternatives. For example, a child who insists on buying expensive athletic shoes may just want to belong to a particular social group at school. He views the shoes as a ticket to acceptance, but may not see other ways to fit in with the same crowd.
Similarly, a girl who covets a particular piece of jewelry may be looking for a sign that her parents recognize her growing maturity. An increase in her privileges might give her the same satisfaction.
"You can use these situations to begin teaching your children what you value," Dr. Ford said.
By exploring beneath the surface, parents can also gain control of their own emotions, which are often triggered by a child's questions.
"The big error is for the parents to feel humiliated and shamed for not providing everything the children want," said Dr. Rita P. Underberg, a clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of Rochester Medical Center. "The attitude of the parents will affect how the children feel about themselves."
 
Discover What the Real Need Is
 HAVING your child ask for something you cannot afford or prefer not to buy can be very distressing. Here are some ways to find out what the child's real need is:
Take your child's emotions seriously.
"Don't minimize your child's disappointment,," said Dr. Rita P. Underberg, a clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of Rochester Medical Center. A request for something extravagant or unusual is often a sign the child is feeling rejected by other children. If you ignore those feelings and desires, the child will feel even more rejected and may conclude that you are not a safe person to talk to since you are rejecting him as well.
Try to keep your own emotions out of it.
Remember that money is often a symbol for something else, although it may symbolize different things to you and to your child.
"Be matter-of-fact in stating that you cannot afford something, rather than weighing your child down with your own anxieties over finances," advised Dr. Kenneth O. Doyle, a psychologist at the University of Minnesota specializing in the psychology of money. "Talk about ways you might be able to save enough to do it in the future."
Remember that preschoolers often interpret a rejection of their ideas as a rejection of themselves. "Try not to convey the attitude that they're bad if they ask," Dr. Doyle said.
Talk to your children about the values of the television programs and commercials they watch.
Many programs offer an unrealistically high standard of living. Commercials tout the social and practical benefits of products without mentioning the costs. Children do not have much perspective on either.
"It makes many children feel that Mom and Dad aren't successful because they don't live like most of the families on TV," Dr. Doyle said. "That breeds shame and resentment."
Consider offering your child a "matching grant" for an item she wants.
If your child wants a thing that is only a bit out of your normal price range, think about whether she might combine money she saves with money from you. This has two advantages: It delays the purchase, so the child may decide it is unnecessary. And children tend to be much more critical shoppers when their own money is involved.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
Borden Official Moves Up To Post of Chief Executive

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

 BODY:
Anthony S. D'Amato was elected chief executive of Borden Inc., the company announced yesterday. He has been president and chief operating officer of the food and industrial products company since July 1990.
Mr. D'Amato, who succeeds R. J. Ventres on Nov. 1, said in a telephone interview yesterday that his priority for the company was completing a two-year-old restructuring plan intended to streamline its business and shed unprofitable operations, particularly in the dairy industry. 
 The company has said it expects an earnings decline in the third and fourth quarters, and lower per-share earnings for the year if the pressures of the recession and stiff competition in the snack food industry continue.
"This is the world we live in," Mr. D'Amato said. "The economy has not been great. We are into one heck of a contest in the snack food area."
But Mr. D'Amato said he expected the company, which had flat growth last year with $7.6 billion in sales, would begin to realize the benefits of its $700 million program of modernization, construction, and consolidation in the coming year.
"In 1992," he said, "I expect earnings will start to be generated."
Wall Street analysts were cautious, however, about Borden's immediate prospects. William F. Mcguire, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, said that Mr. D'Amato's background in chemical and other non-food divisions of the company, put him in a disadvantage in handling food operations, which are responsible for roughly 75 percent of the company's sales.
"It means that in the next four or five years he has to learn about food on the job," Mr. Mcguire said. "The fact of the matter is that we on Wall Street don't have great confidence that he knows a lot about marketing and that is the name of the game in the 1990's."
Mr. D'Amato attended the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn as an undergraduate and spent two years at Northwestern University as a graduate student. After working for the General Electric Company for seven years, Mr. D'Amato joined Borden in 1959 as an engineering manager for film operations. He was later named general manger of the Resinite department and was later made vice president and president of the Chemical division, succeeding Mr. Ventres.

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Asked to Expand Undercover Bias Testing

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 25 -

 BODY:
Scholars and civil rights supporters are calling on the Federal Government to expand the use of undercover investigations to root out discrimination in employment, housing and business.
Arguing that much bias against black and Hispanic people goes undetected, the scholars say such operations would go a long way in documenting the problem and could be an effective tool in enforcing antidiscrimination laws. 
 "It's cheap, it's doable and it provides conclusive evidence of discrimination," said Michael Fix, a senior researcher at the Urban Institute, a nonprofit research institute based here that is holding a conference Thursday on the use of undercover investigations in antidiscrimination policy.
 
Checking for Race Bias
 The technique generally involves sending people who are alike in virtually every way except race or ethnicity to apply for jobs, housing or mortgages. The results are then analyzed for how differently whites are treated diferently from black or Hispanic people .
State and local fair-housing groups often use testers to ferret out bias in the sale and rental of housing.
The group of scholars and civil rights backers plans to publish its findings and make them available to Congress and other policymaking bodies. In addition to researchers at the institute, the group includes professors from several universities and lawyers from the Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.
At present, only the Department of Housing and Urban Development, among Federal agencies, provides money for undercover operations to enforce antidiscrimination statutes or to study the extent of discrimination.
 
Ethical Concerns
 Citing ethical concerns, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve today rejected a proposal to use undercover investigators to expose mortgage lenders who discriminate against minority borrowers. "I have very serious questions about whether the central bank should be sponsoring and supporting deception," Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Fed, said at the meeting.
Figures that will be reported at the Urban Institute's conference indicate that New York City had one of the country's worst records when it comes to housing discrimination.
A study conducted by the Federal housing department found that in 61 percent of the cases in which white and Hispanic people attempted to purchase a house in New York, the whites received more favorable treatment. The study found that in 44 percent of the cases the whites were treated better than blacks when trying to buy a house.
The study considered unfavorable treatment to have occurred when a minority person was told that an advertised house or apartment was no longer available when in fact it was, or when a white was shown more houses or apartments than a black or Hispanic person, or when minorities were quoted different financial terms, from the amount of rent and security deposit to or whether utilities were included.
 
New Issue in the Debate
 Mr. Fix is among those who say using undercover investigators in employment discrimination could put to rest a thesis, which has gained currency recently, that the main type of bias today is favoring minorities over whites, or "reverse discrimination."
Many civil rights groups and Government agencies rely on statistics to provide evidence of lingering discrimination. These groups reason that the lack of minorities in a company or getting mortgage loans indicate the presence of bias.
Conservatives have argued that statistics are not proof of discrimination, since they cannot show whether the disparity was the result of bias or of other factors.
In a paper that he will present at the conference, Mr. Fix and his colleague Raymond Struyk compare the debate over the 1988 amendments to the Federal Fair Housing Act to the current Congressional battle over the civil rights bill. The two authors assert that because studies using undercover testers have been so common in the housing area, few people question the fact that discrimination is widespread there.
This authors argue that as a result, there was little difficulty in gaining passage of amendments to the Fair Housing Act that would allow for fines of up to $100,000 for anyone convicted of discriminating in housing. The measure was strongly supported by George Bush, who was then Vice President.

HEADLINE: Washington Memo;
Painted by Numbers, 1980's Are Rosy To G.O.P., While Democrats See Red

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 25

 BODY:
There's a story line for sale in Washington these days, and it goes something like this:
In 1981, a Republican President came to town, deeply concerned about social justice. Over the next decade, he and his successor raised the tax burdens of the rich, expanded social spending for the poor and eased the financial woes of the middle class. By every important measure, 10 years of Republican rule have made America a fairer place. 
 Whatever one thinks of the story, it does not sound familiar. And its Republican authors say that is precisely the point.
Stung by the repeated Democratic assertion that the Reagan-Bush years enriched the wealthy at the expense of everyone else, they have been arming themselves with fresh studies and a newly insistent tone for what is being called the "fairness debate."
 
Swapping of Statistics
 "The rich got richer and the poor got richer, and that's a good thing," said Senator Pete V. Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who helped write a study defending the 1980's as a jeweled crown of growth and prosperity for all. "I don't think there was any unfairness in it."
Such suggestions make the eyes of Democratic leaders widen and their veins bulge. They counter with a barrage of numbers that purport to show a tattered safety net, widening income gaps and tax breaks for the rich.
At stake in this swapping of often-esoteric statistics are decisions on taxes and spending that involve hundreds of billions of dollars, as well as an edge in the 1992 Presidential race. Both sides play with sharp elbows, few statistical referees and the frequent imputation that their adversaries have all the intellectual credibility of unreconstructed Soviet historians.
"This is in the spirit of 'Joseph Stalin was a sweet man,' " Representative Thomas J. Downey, Democrat of Long Island, said in an interview this week of what he called the Republican rehabilitation of the 1980's.
 
New Poverty Figures
 The partisan jousting over social equity is likely to take on new life on Thursday, when the Census Bureau makes public its annual measure of poverty in America, a count colored by recession and expected to show significant increases in the number of poor people.
So divided are the two sides that they cannot even agree when the 1980's began. Republicans tend to date their analyses forward from the growth that began in 1983, while Democrats sometimes talk of the Reagan-Bush era while pointing to trends in inequality that began in the 1970's.
 
Republicans Play Catch-uUp
 During last year's budget debate, the Democrats used their arguments about fairness to great effect, turning back Administration proposals that they said would have required a larger sacrifice from the poor than from the wealthy.
Since then the Republicans have been involved in a game of catchup. The latest salvo has come from Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the ranking minority member of the House Ways and Means Committee. Writing in the summer issue of Policy Review, published by the Heritage Foundation, he trieds to rally the conservative faithful, saying, "The facts are on our side."
 
The Boom Years
 When Republicans talk about income growth, they tend to emphasize the period from 1983 to 1989, when it could fairly be said that the rich got richer and the poor did too.
In that period, the nation enjoyed its longest peacetime expansion, the poverty rate steadily declined and median family income reached its an all-time high of $34,200, using 1989 figures adjusted for inflation. Meanwhile, they say, both inflation and unemployment dissipated.
Most of what makes this statistical picture hold, however, is the declaration that the 1980's began with the roaring year of 1983 and the ommission of the current recession. Defending this choice, many Republicans say it took two years for the Reagan policies to take effect.
 
Still Below High of '79
 But others cry dirty pool.
"If you compare things at the bottom of a recession to a recovery year, of course things are going to look good," said Robert Greenstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a research organization attacked by Republicans for its statistics on income inequality.
Democrats say the poor were devastated by the recession in the early 1980's -- which many in the party say was induced largely by Republican choice -- and that they have still not recovered. In 1989, the mean family income for the poorest fifth of Americans was $9,400, or $400 less, in dollars adjusted for inflation, than its all-time high 10 years earlier.
Democrats also argue that while incomes grew for everyone they grew much faster for the wealthiest. Figures of the Congressional Budget Office figures show that from 1977 to 1988, the inflation-adjusted incomes of the bottom 90 percent grew by only a 10th of a percent. Those of the richest 1 percent exploded with a 96 percent gain.
 
Patterns of Stagnation Seen
 Democrats use figures like those to argue that the middle class is under stress, and that Republican boasts of record median incomes mask darker trends. The median family income of $34,200, while a record, represents only a 2.4 percent increase over 10 years, a rate they call meager.
They argue that the only reason middle-class families have seemed to keep pace is that they are working harder, adopting a treadmill life style that more and more relies on a second wage earner.
Many point to the research of Frank Levy, an economist at the University of Maryland, who traces wage stagnation back to the rise in energy prices in 1973. From 1958 to 1973, he said, the median income of a 50-year-old man, working full time, grew by more than half, from $20,400 to $31,900 in numbers adjusted to 1989. Since then, it has virtually languished, coming in at $32,700 in 1988, dealing a blow to the American expectation of generational progress.
 
'Rich Man's Burden'
 On taxes, those emphasizing the fairness of the 1980's essentially repeat the arguments with which the decade was launched: When rates are cut, the economy booms and the rich end up paying more in absolute dollars than they would have.
Representative Archer points to what he calls the "rich man's burden." In 1981, he says, the wealthiest 5 percent of Americans accounted for 35 percent of total tax receipts; by 1988, that figure had risen to 46 percent. Over the same period, the share contributed by the entire bottom half of American earners dropped from 8 percent to 6 percent.
And while income taxes fell for everyone, he says, they fell most of all for the poor. Citing budget office data, he noted that income tax rates fell by 9 percent for the wealthiest fifth, but 20 percent for the middle three-fifths and 275 percent for the bottom fifth.
In 1980, the poorest fifth of Americans received refundable tax credits worth 0.4 percent of their income. By 1990, that figure had risen to 1.5 percent. While the budget office warns that expressing that change as a 275 percent gain is statistically "meaningless," Mr. Archer disagrees.
The Republicans also point proudly to the 1986 tax act that removed about six million poor families from the income tax rolls.
Not so fast, says the other camp: If the richest are contributing a greater portion of total tax dollars, that is only because they are receiving an even larger portion of total income.
And Democrats say whatever mercies were extended to the working poor by lowered income tax rates were more than offset by rises in Social Security taxes. When all Federal taxes are included, the richest fifth of Americans saw their tax rate drop from 27.3 percent in 1980 to 25.8 percent in 1990, a decline of 5 percent. At the same time, the poorest fifth saw their rate rise, from 8.4 percent to 9.7 percent, a 15 percent increase.
Perhaps nowhere do sharper differences emerge than when the two sides look at spending trends. Representative Archer argues that the Reagan years actually expanded the social safety net.
He has compiled a table of 38 Government programs for children and families and calculated an 18 percent, inflation-adjusted increase in social spending from 1981 to 1989. The calculations exclude huge programs like Social Security and Medicare, which primarily help the elderly.
An expanding social safety net? "Preposterous nonsense," snorted Representative Downey, just this side of apoplectic, before pinning responsibility for homelessness on what he called cuts in housing assistance.
It depends on what you count. Half of the increase in social spending figured by Mr. Archer came from a rise in health insurance costs for Federal and military workers. Colin Powell's health plan is scarcely what the Democrats consider a social program.
 
Program Cuts Listed
 Mr. Archer argues that housing assistance has grown by 65 percent. Mr. Greenstein argues that its rate of growth fell by 75 percent, and that the slowdown occurred just as the private market for low-income renters fell apart, causing the need for inexpensive housing to soar.
Outside the fray, observers often argue that the efforts at political scorekeeping detract from thinking about solving endemic economic problems, ranging from Government deficits to health care costs to failures in education and training.
"It begs the essential question: Have we laid the groundwork for a healthy future?" said John Karl Scholz, an economics professor at the University of Wisconsin and a former aide at the Council of Economic Advisers. "I think there's much reason for concern."

HEADLINE: News Media's Libel Costs Rising, Study Says

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
News organizations are increasingly likely to lose libel suits that go to a jury, and if they lose they are increasingly likely to face multimillion-dollar damage judgments, according to a new study by a New York-based organization that tracks libel law.
The organization, the Libel Defense Resource Center, said in a report to be released today that news organizations lost two-thirds of the libel trials in which they were involved in 1989 and 1990, and that the average award was just under $4.5 million. That was a tenfold increase from the average award of $432,000 in 1987-88, when defendants won half of such trials. 
 The report also estimated that about 90 percent of libel actions against the news media are dropped, settled or dismissed before going to trial.
 
Record Judgments Cited
 More and more juries are awarding huge sums in libel cases. For instance, a record libel judgment of $34 million set in 1990 against The Philadelphia Inquirer was broken earlier this year with a $58 million judgment against the Dallas-based Belo Broadcasting and its affiliate, WFAA-TV.
Such judgments have proved so potentially devastating to even the largest news organizations that some of them are settling with plaintiffs rather than risking a loss on appeal.
While The Inquirer, which is owned by Knight-Ridder Inc., is contesting its judgment, Belo Broadcasting, which is owned by the A. H. Belo Corporation, said in June that it had settled the case for an undisclosed sum.
In a letter to employees, Robert W. Decherd, Belo's chairman, said that because of the "sheer size" of the judgment the company's libel insurers had pressed for settlement, in part to avoid paying interest on the judgment during the appeals process, which could have taken three years.
Similarly, Harte-Hanks Communications Inc. of San Antonio has announced the settlement of a $29 million judgment for an undisclosed amount.
 
Raising the Ante
 "Huge awards are the most reversible, yet the economic ante has been raised to the point that the actuality of having the award collected is too Draconian," said Henry R. Kaufman, general counsel for the center. He added that such settlements can only encourage other libel plaintiffs.
The largest libel award ever affirmed by a Federal appeals court was in 1987 against WBBM-TV, a CBS-owned station in Chicago, for $1 million in compensatory damages and $2.05 million in punitive damages. In a commentary, a news anchor had suggested that Viceroy cigarettes had developed advertisements intended to attract minors to smoking, and the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation sued.
For a decade, the center has been analyzing trends in libel law, and the most recent two-year period reflects a renewed hostility to news organizations not seen since President Ronald Reagan's first term.
From 1981 to 1984, the average damage award was more than $2 million. In the 1985-86 period, the average declined to $1.2 million, and in 1987-88, the average dropped further, to $431,000.
The giant leap in the average damage award in the past two years to $4.5 million suggests that juries are once again inclined to punish news organizations.
"If there was a honeymoon it was a brief one," Mr. Kaufman said.
But there may have been some encouraging news in the center's report in that an average of 15 libel actions went to trial each year in 1989 and 1990, compared with an average of about 30 each year in the earlier 1980's.
News organizations may view that decline to an increased willingness by judges to dismiss libel suits before they get to trial. But the decline may also reflect a greater willingness for news organizations to settle libel suits outside court. Moreover, it may reflect a chilling effect on aggressive coverage by news organizations that might risk a libel action.

HEADLINE: Salvadoran Rebels Adjust to Fall in Political Power

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN

 BODY:
Not so long ago in the arid hills that straddle El Salvador's northern border, it seemed that the Marxist guerrillas who died fighting the Salvadoran Government would simply be replaced by their sons and daughters.
So profound was the feeling of injustice in the region, rebel leaders insisted, that the civil war could go on forever unless the Government made profound political concessions. In the pockets of Salvadoran territory that the guerrillas controlled, boys carrying semi-automatic rifles echoed those assertions. 
 But with the signing yesterday at the United Nations of the first seemingly conclusive accords in seven years of peace talks, the guerrilla front appeared to have recognized that El Salvador has changed and that a generation of Salvadorans was slipping from its influence.
 
Trying Times
 Despite the global shift that helped to unseat their Sandinista patrons in Nicaragua and isolate Fidel Castro in Cuba, the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, known by its Spanish initials as the F.M.L.N., remains probably the most militarily potent insurgency that Latin America has ever seen.
What the rebels are no longer, according to opinion polls and independent analysts, is a strong and growing political force.
"The F.M.L.N. is worried because its political image has deteriorated significantly," said Ruben Zamora, a Salvadoran legislator who having long been allied with the guerrillas was the most prominent leftist politician to return from a life of exile to institutional politics.
"They recognize now that we were right," Mr. Zamora said in a telephone interview yesterday from San Salvador. "They want to achieve peace to participate in the elections of 1994."
The return to a legal political role has been a stated goal of the rebels since 1984, when the late Jose Napoleon Duarte, then the newly elected Christian Democratic President, called them to talks in the mountain town of La Palma.
 
Low-Intensity War
 But throughout the tortuous series of encounters that continued into 1988, neither the warriors who held sway in the rebel alliance nor the ascendant generation of commanders in the armed forces showed much willingness to compromise.
As the Salvadoran Army swept through rural areas with civic-action campaigns intended to gain the trust of peasants, the rebels countered with a two-track policy. In essence, the front tried to build its support among unionized workers and other Government opponents in the cities while pressing a low-intensity war of ambushes, land mines and sabotage in the countryside.
Late in 1985, the five factional armies of the rebel front renewed their efforts to unite under a single Marxist-Leninist political party. The attempt, which failed, suggested that the front had deferred its hopes of generating the kind of international support that buoyed the Sandinista insurrection in 1979 and instead saw the need to build internal unity and discipline as a greater priority.
Despite about $4 billion in economic and military aid from the United States to the Salvadoran Government, the war remained deadlocked after 1984. But that did not budge army and rebel leaders from their respective convictions that they could win military victory.
Salvador Sanchez Ceren, the 47-year-old former teacher who heads the oldest rebel army, the Popular Liberation Forces, underscored the paradox during an interview in a remote Salvadoran village late in 1985. For the war to end, he said, the Government "has to be convinced that the F.M.L.N. will never give up its guns."
But in trying to make that argument persuasively, the rebels found their military success increasingly in conflict with their political aims. Peasants and workers who had provided their traditional political base grew deeply tired of the fighting.
The guerrillas' goal of Marxist revolution also began to clash with the ideological direction of the governments and parties from which they had drawn support abroad. In 1982, France and Mexico pronounced the rebels a representative political force.But late in 1988, when they sent a diplomatic mission to European and Latin American countries, the rebels found themselves startlingly unwelcome.
In September 1989, Joaquin Villalobos, a former student activist who heads the People's Revolutionary Army faction and is recognized as the pre-eminent rebel leader, said for the first time that only with peace could the F.M.L.N. achieve its revolutionary goals. Yet many analysts believe that it took the outcome of the countrywide offensive that the rebels launched two months later to convince Mr. Villalobos and his comrades of his thesis.
The large-scale operation showed surprising rebel power and left little thought that they could be defeated on the battlefield. The simultaneous killings of six Jesuit priests, apparently by army soldiers, also dramatically undermined United States assertions to have reformed the Government armed forces.
But the insurgents also ran into devastating evidence that their hopes of setting off a popular insurrection had been far-fetched. In some poor neighborhoods, as guerrilla fighters approached, their would-be supporters ran away.
In a country where sympathy with the guerrillas has often been considered a crime, the reliability of polls of their popular support is difficult to judge. But apparently independent surveys showed support for the rebels at well under 10 percent while the the backing for Mr. Zamora and other leftist politicians who risked their lives to return home rose significantly. In 1989 elections, their Democratic Convergence polled less than 4 percent; last year, the Convergence gathered more than 12 percent.
The difficult chemistry between the Government and rebel officials was apparently overcome when Mr. Sanchez and Mr. Villalobos joined the three other senior rebel commanders -- the Communist Party leader, Shafik Handal; Eduardo Sancho, a former high school teacher who leads the National Resistance faction, and Francisco Jovel, another former student leader who leads the smallest F.M.L.N. faction -- at the United Nations.
Still, it was impossible last night not to wonder how easily men like Mr. Villalobos, a guerrilla for half his life, would be able to reintegrate themselves into Salvadoran society.
"If all of these changes are made, it would be worth it to lose some elections," the boyish-looking commander, often called one of the most ruthless of rebel leaders, said in an interview after the accords were signed. "Without them, it would not be worth anything to win them."
Throughout most of a news conference, rebel leaders appeared almost sobered by the prospect of the negotiations ahead. But at one moment, Mr. Villalobos marveled at the thought that the security forces that have been blamed for thousands of killings would be disbanded.
"Can you imagine what this implies?" he asked, smiling. "This, obviously, is a real revolution."

HEADLINE: SALVADORAN CHIEF AND REBELS REACH BROAD AGREEMENT

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 25

 BODY:
The Salvadoran President, Alfredo Cristiani, and five guerrilla commanders reached a broad agreement today on the country's political and economic future that was seen as a major breakthrough in the search for peace in El Salvador.
Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, who convened negotiations between the two sides in New York 10 days ago, said it was his "firm expectation" that what is called the New York Agreement would break the deadlock in the negotiations. He said negotiations would resume Oct. 12 for a cease-fire. 
 President Cristiani, in an interview shortly before departing for San Salvador, predicted an end to the country's 11-year-old civil war by the end of the year.
 
'Victory of Democracy'
 Schafick Handal, leader of the Salvadoran Communist Party and spokesman for the five insurgent groups, said the agreement was of "great transcendence" and constituted "a new victory of democracy in El Salvador." He said it represented social and political advances made possible by the 11 years of civil war.
The agreement, which climaxes a negotiating process begun 18 months ago under the auspices of the United Nations, covers a broad range of security and economic issues having to do with the reintegration of the guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front into civilian life.
Under the agreement, the rebels will be able to seek appointment to a new civilian-controlled police force without discrimination and the Government will protect the right of guerrilla families to hold on to the land they have occupied. A peace commission will also be set up to oversee the carrying out of the accords.
Truce in Weeks Predicted
 Representative Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey and chairman of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, telephoned from Washington to say that the "pace of the breakthrough caught everyone by surprise." He predicted that it would lead to a cease-fire within weeks.
Bernard W. Aronson, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affiars, called this "sort of the definitive moment." He added, "If the guerillas mean what they say in these documents then the war is over."
Mr. Cristiani said that only a handful of issues, mainly having to do with the reform and reduction of the armed forces, remain undecided before a cease-fire. He said there was already consensus on some of them.
"As I said in my speech Monday, 1991 will be the year of peace," he said, referring to his address to the General Assembly.
Mr. Perez de Cuellar announced the accord after a brief signing ceremony in his offices.
The five guerrilla commanders and a government delegation led by Mr. Cristiani's chief of staff, Oscar Santamaria, and the Deputy Minister of Defense, Col. Mauricio E. Vargas, signed the agreement.
The guerrilla leaders are Mr. Handal, Joaquin Villalobos, Salvador Sanchez Ceren, Eduardo Sancho Castaneda and Francisco Jovel. Mr. Sanchez is also known as Leonel Gonzalez, his nom de guerre, Mr. Sancho as Ferman Cienfuegos, and Mr. Jovel as Roberto Roca.
Critics have maintained that Mr. Cristiani, who has been under great pressure from the Salvadoran armed forces and his own political party not to give away too much, will have difficulty keeping his commitments in terms of the behavior and reform of the armed forces, but the United Nations mediator, Alvaro de Soto, discounted that.
Mr. de Soto, the Secretary General's representative in conducting the negotiations, said he had "no reason to doubt that the armed forces will accept it."
He noted that Colonel Vargas was here for the negotiations and had signed the accord and that the Defense Minister, Gen. Rene Emilio Ponce, had been regularly consulted.
The accord, which complements earlier accords on human rights protection and political reform, has these main points:
* A National Commission for the Consolidation of Peace will be set up to oversee the carrying out of the accords. It will consist two members each from the Government and guerrilla front, plus representatives of the political parties, the church and the United Nations,
*The armed forces will be "purified" on the basis of the evaluation of its members by an ad hoc commission. In settlement of a long-contended point, the guerrillas agreed to a Government request for two army officers to take part in the deliberations, without a vote.
*In principle, it was agreed to reduce the size of the army, although the numbers and details are still to be negotiated.
*Former guerrilla combatants will not be discriminated against in consideration for membership in the new national police to be created under civilian leadership.
*The Government agreed to a guerrilla request to protect the right of guerrilla families and sympathizers to hold onto lands they have occupied in guerrilla-dominated areas since early in the war.
 
Guerrilla Demand Abandoned
 The guerrilla front apparently abandoned a long-standing demand for incorporation of some of its members into the army at all levels, including command posts. Mr. Cristiani simply noted that the topic did not figure on the agenda that had been agreed upon for the remaining negotiations, and he said there was agreement not to add any more issues before a cease-fire.
El Salvador's civil war grew out of the rise in the 1970's of public frustration with one of the most entrenched military governments in Latin America and the fascination of reformers and university students with the seeming potential of Marxism-Leninism to end social and economic inequities.
Opposition political parties, particularly the Christian Democrats, had grown throughout the decade but saw their quest for power blocked by fraudulent elections in which the military front party always managed to get its presidential candidate elected.
In the mid- and late-1970's, three newly formed clandestine organizations -- the People's Revolutionary Army, the Popular Liberation Forces and the National Resistance -- began to kidnap for ransom, commit political assassinations, and take over farms and businesses with the help of the vast network of so-called mass organizations that they created.
 
The Most Violent Year
 The armed forces and rightist paramilitary groups reacted with a rising tide of repression and death squad killings, but the Government of Gen. Carlos Humberto Romero weakened rapidly and seemed unable to deal with the growing chaos.
The downfall of the Somoza Government in nearby Nicaragua in July 1979 after a brief insurrection and the rise to power there of the leftist Sandinista Front, which was believed to feel a commitment to reciprocate for help it had received from the Salvadoran guerrillas, seemed to set the stage for a quick rebel victory in El Salvador.
But a military coup in October 1979, led by midlevel officers and encouraged by the United States, brought to power a military-civilian junta that promised reforms and eventual free elections to try to head off the insurgency. At the same time, the Carter Administration, increasingly concerned about the path the Sandinistas were taking in Nicaragua, began to advise the new Government actively and to consider military aid.
The land redistribution enacted by the new Government early in 1980 set off a binge of political killings and massacres that made that year more violent than any in the war that was to follow. As many as 10,000 people died in political killings that year, including Archbishop Oscar Romero, three American nuns and a religious laywoman, and the head of the land redistribution program and two Americans assisting him.
With this backdrop and the junta seeming to totter on the brink of disintegration, the guerrillas began their first big offensive of the war on Jan. 10, 1981. Expecting it to be the only one they would need, they called it the "final offensive." Instead, it was the first of many big battles in the long war.
The Salvadoran Army pulled itself together enough to repel the guerrillas in that first offensive, and the Carter Administration in its final days approved military aid. The incoming Reagan Administration committed itself to propping up the Salvadoran junta, which by then included Jose Napoleon Duarte and his Christian Democratic Party.
In an appearance before Congress early in 1981, Secretary of State Alexander M . Haig promised that the United States was prepared "to go to the source" -- meaning Cuba -- to block the supply of weapons to the Salvadoran rebels.
The United States immediately began to send military trainers and advisers in small numbers to equip and train the Salvadoran armed forces. Over the coming decade, military and economic aid to the country of some five million people came to an estimated $4 billion.
In the process, aid to El Salvador and continuing support for the Government there became one of the most sensitive issues in American foreign policy. Critics maintained that the successive Salvadoran governments did not deserve aid because of their failure to reform the armed forces and halt political killings and other human rights abuses.
 
Elections Are Held
 Under United States pressure, the junta held elections in 1982 for a constitutional assembly, which wrote a new constitution and in 1984 called presidential elections, won by Mr. Duarte.
But as the war raged, the other political phenomenon that developed alongside the Christian Democrats was the Nationalist Republican Alliance, or Arena, founded in 1981 by Roberto d'Aubuisson, a cashiered army officer who had been accused by Mr. Duarte and others of being behind many of the death squad killings of 1980.
Mr. d'Aubuisson, a charismatic man who virulently attacked both the Christian Democrats and the guerrillas, found strong voter support from a curious mixture of peasants, small farmers and shop people and the most powerful landowners and businessmen in the country.
In the 1989 elections, with Mr. d'Aubuisson's past always a shadow over the party, Mr. Cristiani, a smooth-talking businessman and coffee grower from the mainstream of the party, was picked to run for President.
With Mr. Duarte dying of cancer and the Christian Democrats under heavy criticism for corruption, Mr. Cristiani won easily.
One of Mr. Cristiani's promises was to bring peace to El Salvador, and while critics at first doubted his intentions, he quickly set out on the path of negotiations that culminated in the accords announced at the United Nations today.

5 Killed Scattered Violence
 SAN SALVADOR, Sept. 25 (AP) -- Scattered fighting between leftist rebels and troops took at least four lives on Tuesday, reports from the Government and the guerrillas indicated today. A construction union leader was also slain in the capital in what appeared to be the work of a rightist death squad.
 Radio Farabundo Marti, the rebels' clandestine station, said that guerrilla forces ambushed a paratroop battalion on Tuesday in Cabanas province, about 50 miles northeast of the capital. It said two Government soldiers were killed in the fighting, but gave no other details.
 A Government communique said that two guerrillas were killed and a third was wounded in a clash near the town of San Jose las Flores, 55 miles northeast of the capital, and two more guerrillas were wounded in fighting outside the city of Chinameca, 75 miles east of San Salvador.
 The police said Miguel Angel Martinez, a 26-year-old union leader, was shot to death on Tuesday evening and his body dumped by a passing car onto a street in San Salvador's business district. The authorities said they had no leads on who was responsible for the slaying. Members of a United Nations human rights mission went to the scene to examine Mr. Martinez's body.

HEADLINE: The Bush-Hussein Duel;
U.S. Aides Admit Iraq Is No Armed Threat But Say That Control Must Be Established

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 25

 BODY:
The showdown in a Baghdad parking lot between United Nations inspectors and Iraqi officials was less a struggle over a batch of documents than over who is calling the shots in the Persian Gulf's unstable peace -- George Bush or Saddam Hussein.
With Baghdad's new overture tonight to the United Nations, President Bush may have won the central gamble behind his strategy in the gulf. Administration officials have said they were betting that Mr. Hussein would back down and that Mr. Bush would never actually have to carry out his strongly implied threat of using military force.
 
Again Using U.N. Aegis
 Clearly, Mr. Bush is driving the Western approach to the Iraqi President in the latest struggle, although he is careful to do so in the name of the United Nations, as he has been throughout the last year. 
 The United States provided the intelligence that is leading the inspectors to increasingly sensitive Iraqi military installations in ways that Pentagon planners are fully aware will irk the Iraqis. Washington is supplying the technology for the inspectors to communicate with the outside world and thus turn their dispute into a public spectacle.
Like the recent tension over Iraq's refusal to permit the unfettered use of helicopters by the United Nations inspectors, the dispute over whether they may take documents out of Iraqi Government buildings narrowly sprang from efforts to carry out the Security Council resolutions that established a cease-fire in Iraq last spring.
 
It's More Complicated
 But the motivations for the latest standoff between Mr. Bush and Mr. Hussein go well beyond the legalities of enforcing the resolutions or even removing Mr. Hussein's ability to develop nuclear weapons. American officials, including Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, acknowledged today that is not any real threat -- in the short term or even medium term.
Rather, the new tensions, and Mr. Bush's warnings of the possible use of force, demonstrate vividly that what exists in Iraq is not a permanent peace, but a continuation of the tenuous truce established after the allied ground offensive drove Iraqi forces from Kuwait last winter.
That was only one of three major objectives set by the anti-Iraq coalition for the war. Mr. Bush and his allies are still fighting -- with little evident headway -- to secure the two others: demolishing Iraq's ability to field a modern army that could threaten another neighbor and, perhaps more important to the President, eliminating Mr. Hussein as a political and military force in the Middle East.
The President would very much like to see Mr. Hussein ousted. He has said so at every opportunity, reaffirming in recent days that he will oppose the lifting of economic sanctions as long as Mr. Hussein is in power.
The President and his advisers continue to insist that they are not undertaking any open or covert effort to overthrow Mr. Hussein, although they would certainly deny any secret operations even if one were under way. Washington has often turned to the Central Intelligence Agency and covert operations against a foreign government in circumstances similar to the current situation in the gulf, where other means, including open warfare, did not fully achieve American objectives.
"We're still not foolish enough to fall for the trap of changing the U.N. agenda to target any one individual," an Administration official said today.
 
Warning From the White House
 What then does Mr. Bush hope to accomplish by keeping open the threat of possible new military action against Iraq? Clearly that is what the President was doing today by proceeding with deployment of Patriot missiles to Saudi Arabia, huddling in the Oval Office with General Powell and other advisers, and then putting out the word that his patience was wearing thin and that "all options are open."
Administration officials freely acknowledged that Mr. Hussein and his political power are a central target of current American policies in Iraq, which they hope will prevent him from dragging a political victory out of his military defeat and making, as one official put it, "a mockery" of the President's painstakingly wrought coalition.
"If you're going to build any kind of credibilty for a new world order," another official said, "you've got to make people accountable to legal procedures, and Saddam's flaunted every one."
Was the United States deliberately trying to increase tensions with Mr. Hussein as a way of provoking a military confrontation and giving it an excuse to resume the war, this time with more ambitious objectives?
Administration officials say no, and it is evident that the Pentagon is reluctant to take on another fight. General Powell has firmly established himself as a war planner who demands clear-cut military and political objectives and then does not move until he has more than enough reserve power to handle any contingency.
Some influential lawmakers, including Representative Les Aspin, Denmocrat of Wisconsin and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, believe that Mr. Bush has backed down from the brink of military confrontation several times in recent weeks. "It looks like he's bending over backward to avoid it," Mr. Aspin said.
 
Various U.S. Objectives
 Asked why Mr. Bush had been engaged in another test of wills with Mr. Hussein, Administration officials begin with the argument that they are simply trying to carry out the United Nations mandate to plumb the depths of Iraqi efforts to build a nuclear weapon, develop germ-warfare devices and stockpile poison gas for use in war -- and then obliterate those programs.
Beyond that, officials said Mr. Bush is driven by complex political pressures, including his desire to hold together the anti-Iraq coalition, to maintain the United States' role as the enforcer of the peace in the Mideast as he seeks to drag the region's fractious people into a peace conference, and to maintain a strong American military presence as the agreement to keep a rapid-deployment force in southern Turkey nears its Sept. 30 expiration date.
"The long-term threat is that the coalition could fragment and the sanctions against Iraq would simply fall by the wayside," an official said.
 
'Worst-Case Scenarios'
 Another said: "Saddam's power is growing every day and the President cannot tolerate that. If he keeps solidifying this political power, and the coalition breaks up, then you're back to square one before the war. True, he won't be a real military threat to anyone for years. But you have to think in the long term and base your policy on worst-case scenarios, even if you don't believe they're going to happen."
Mr. Aspin argued that there are legitimate roles the United States military can play under these circumstances, saying: "First of all, sending the military in to escort inspectors could avoid the kind of standoff in the parking lot that you've got right now because you would have guys carrying guns to make sure they could leave with the documents. Of course, you'd have to have the backup there in case it turns into a firefight."
Mr. Bush, Mr. Aspin continued, "may have some further military role in mind "to leverage further cooperation by Saddam."
"Is there a military-target list or something else the military might do in order to put political pressure on the Iraqi Government?" he asked. "I wouldn't be surprised if they were looking at a list of targets. But the military would still want to know specifically what they were being assigned to do and what the measure of success would be, instead of just being drawn into some vague mission."

HEADLINE: '48 Hours' Quietly Succeeds at CBS

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

 BODY:
Quietly, "48 Hours," the other CBS news-magazine program, has become a vital part of that network's prime-time schedule.
Two weeks into the new television season, "48 Hours" is now firmly established as CBS's anchor at 10 P.M. Wednesday night. Its success is a big surprise, not least to CBS: the program, which examines one topic intensively over a two-day period, was only an official announcement away from being canceled last spring. 
 For most of its early existence -- almost two full years on the air -- "48 Hours" functioned more as economic necessity than as programming choice. It stayed on because CBS had few programs that were successful, and "48 Hours," beyond its journalistic value, had one virtue many of the network's other struggling programs did not: it was cheap. Its weekly budget often was less than half the $1 million spent for an hourlong entertainment show. Still, when CBS's prime-time standing started to improve, the anemic ratings of "48 Hours" made it a target.
"I know there were serious discussions about knocking us off," said Andrew Heyward, the program's executive producer.
 
A Last Chance
 After watching his program languish most of last year at 8 o'clock on Wednesday night, Mr. Heyward went last March to Jeff Sagansky, CBS's Entertainment division president, and asked for one last opportunity for the program to prove itself, in a spot where it stood at least a fair chance of reaching an audience. He asked for Wednesday night at 10.
None of the three networks had been able to find a hit to place in the 10 o'clock spot on Wednesday, with the result that many Wednesday viewers had simply deserted network television.
In its first try, on April 10, "48 Hours" won that time period with a highly promotable look at the phenomenon of college spring break in Florida. But as the spring and summer went on, using topics as diverse as battered wives and New York City traffic, "48 Hours" continued to win.
In fact, over the last dozen weeks, "48 Hours" has been the No. 1 program in the time spot 10 times. Its average rating grew to an 11.2 at 10 P.M., after averaging only an 8.9 when it played at 8 P.M.
Much of that success was achieved against summer repeats on the other networks. But last week, in its first try against new programs, "48 Hours" still finished a strong second, after NBC's "Quantum Leap."
David F. Poltrack, the senior vice president of research for CBS, said that the network had no lingering doubts about the program's progress. "We certainly don't expect it to finish third in the time period, and we think it can win."
Mr. Heyward went further: "My goal is to make us like a '20/20' franchise by the end of this season." ABC's news magazine, "20/20," is one of the strongest hourlong programs in television.
Beyond the more viable time period, several factors have contributed to the climb of "48 Hours," Mr. Heyward said, starting with a growing understanding of which topics work best in the program's format.
"I don't know infallibly what will work," Mr. Heyward said, "but our stock in trade is the gritty exploration of a social issue as seen through the lives of people who experience them." In many instances that has translated to crime: street crime, organized crime, crime detection. Last night's program focused on scientific crime solving, including such techniques as "blood spatter" detection.
On occasion the program has been criticized for leaning too heavily on crime topics because those seem to draw the best ratings. But Mr. Heyward said that some distinctly non-criminal subjects, including life in the Appalachian mountains, have also worked well. "Our great vulnerability," he said, "has always been that we're about a single topic." That means some topics simply can't be examined because the producers know the audience will not be interested. Foreign stories, for example: You won't see many of them on "48 Hours."
"On a conventional magazine show," Mr. Heyward said, "You can always reward the viewers for watching a story on South Africa with a great celebrity interview."
 
Growing Acceptance
 Mr. Heyward said a factor in the program's favor was the growing acceptance of news programs as network entries at 10 P.M. In addition to "20/20" on Fridays, where it has often finished among the top-rated programs on television, ABC's Thursday-at-10 news program, "Prime Time Live," is slowly building strength.
Still another advantage of the 10 P.M. time period for a news program, Mr. Heyward said, is the support it draws from CBS stations around the country because it delivers a news-watching audience for their local late newscasts.
Indeed, local stations often find a local angle for the stories covered on "48 Hours," and then promote their own newscasts during commercial breaks in the network program. Since "48 Hours" was moved to Wednesdays at 10, local CBS station managers have been among the program's most vocal supporters.

HEADLINE: 18th-Century Furniture And Art to Be Auctioned

BYLINE: By RITA REIF

 BODY:
The collection of 18th-century French furniture and European paintings put together by Elizabeth and Howard B. Keck of Los Angeles is to be auctioned in December at Sotheby's in New York, the auction house announced yesterday.
The Keck collection -- 300 pieces of furniture, decorations and paintings -- was assembled over the last 15 years by Mr. Keck, the 78-year-old son of the founder and the former chairman of the Superior Oil Company, and his wife. The couple were divorced this year. Sotheby's identifies Mr. Keck as the seller of the collection it estimates will total more than $20 million. 
 Although the auction house describes the Keck holdings as "the finest collection of French 18th-century furniture to be auctioned in the United States in about 20 years," the presale estimates on the most important pieces are equal to or below prices paid at auction in the 1980's for French furniture of comparable or lesser importance.
Asked if the recession had influenced the auction house's valuations on the Keck art and antiques, Diana D. Brooks, the president of Sotheby's in New York, said: "No. As far as we are concerned, there has been no recession in the French furniture field. The best way to present property today is to place estimates that are perceived to be extremely reasonable and, as much as possible, based on historical precedents."
The prize items in the sale are a Louis XVI chest and a fall-front secretary, awash with gilded bronzes and Japanese lacquer panels, by Adam Weisweiler. The Weisweiler chest and desk belonged in the 19th century to the Duke of Hamilton, and are to be sold as one lot, with an estimate of about $2 million. That price would equal the current record for one piece of French furniture sold at auction in the United States -- a Louis XVI secretary covered with Sevres plaques, that brought $2.09 million in 1986 at Sotheby's in New York.
Another piece of Keck furniture is a Louis XV flat-topped desk by Joseph Baumhauer, formerly in the collection of Nathaniel Rothschild of Vienna. Sotheby's expects it will sell for more than $1 million.

Looking Racism in the Face in St. Louis

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
Tonight "Prime Time Live" uses hidden cameras to catch some common affronts by white Americans that keep reminding black Americans that the colorblind millennium has yet to be achieved. Diane Sawyer goes to St. Louis, Mo., with two 28-year-old men, Glenn Brewer, who is black, and John Kuhnen, who is white, and assigns them to shop in the same stores, try to rent the same apartment and apply for the same job. The results, visible at 10 on Channel 7, will shock only the most naive viewers but should distress everybody.
At several stores, Mr. Kuhnen gets instant service; Mr. Brewer is ignored except at a record store, where a salesman keeps a close eye on him without offering any assistance. When they go for a walk, separately on the same street, a police car passes Mr. Kuhnen but slows down to give Mr. Brewer a once-over. At a car dealership, Mr. Kuhnen is offered a lower price and better financing terms than Mr. Brewer. Inquiring about a job at a dry cleaner that has advertised for help, Mr. Kuhnen is told jobs are still available; Mr. Brewer is told, "The positions are taken." Following up a for-rent sign, Mr. Kuhnen is promptly offered an apartment, which he does not take; 10 minutes later, Mr. Brewer is told it has been rented for hours. It adds up to a quick course for whites in the run-of-the-mill indignities that many blacks endure day after day. 
 If the two men were treated the same anywhere, that is not shown; you just have to trust Ms. Sawyer's reporting. Two observers, Julianne Malveaux, a University of California economist, and Clifford L. Alexander, former Secretary of the Army, are brought in as a kind of chorus. Unfortunately, their comments sound like routine newspaper editorials. Hard-headed analysis of why the attitudes and practices found here survive and perhaps prevail in St. Louis and elsewhere would have been welcome, but this is not that sort of program.
The juiciest scenes are the ones in which Ms. Sawyer and her camera crew do some confronting. "What's the difference," she keeps asking the automobile salesman who quoted different figures on the same red convertible, and gets no coherent answer. At the apartment that was, then was not for rent, she asks the same question. The manager tells her: "Oh, ma'am, I am not prejudiced. I got Mexican. I got Jewish." But he concedes there are no black tenants. The "Prime Time" staff members are then thrown out by the building's owner, who insists, "We have never discriminated, as long as they don't have four or five kids."
Maybe these people are worried about the law. Maybe they are just embarrassed. Either way, their distress is the only cause for optimism in tonight's painfully pertinent report.

HEADLINE: 35 Law Firms in New York Pledge More Minority Hiring

BYLINE: By DAVID MARGOLICK

 BODY:
Seeking to combat the persistent underrepresentation of minorities in their offices, 35 major law firms in New York City pledged yesterday to hire more black, Hispanic, Asian-American and American Indian lawyers and to treat them equally in assignments and promotion once they arrive.
The law firms set a goal of hiring one minority lawyer for every 10 new lawyers they recruit over the next five years -- almost double the current rate. 
 They also pledged to address systemic problems that have seen minorities fare much worse, and stay more briefly, than their white counterparts at New York's most prestigious law firms. The moves are part of a City Bar Association initiative to enhance opportunities for minorities.
"There are problems at every level -- at recruitment, at retention and promotion, and the only way to make sure that changes occur is to address them all at the same time," said the president of the City Bar Association, Conrad K. Harper. He said he hoped that other firms and corporate legal departments would join the initiative, which he called "a major step toward the complete integration of the legal profession in New York City."
"These firms are more committed than I've ever seen them to doing something significant, and doing it now," said Mr. Harper, a partner at Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett, who is the bar group's first black president. "Bleak as the situation is, it has gotten better in the last few years and with this kind of commitment I expect it to get better still."
Mr. Harper maintained that the sour state of the legal marketplace, which has seen many of the 35 firms curb hiring and lay off record numbers of lawyers, would in no way blunt the initiative.
"The firms," he said, "clearly recognize that we're looking toward the long term, and the economy of the moment will not be the economy over the next five years."
The participating firms include some of the city's largest and most renowned, like Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, Debevoise & Plimpton and Cravath Swaine & Moore.
Minorities now make up 15 percent of the enrollment in the major law schools from which New York's largest firms recruit. But the number of minorities joining large law firms has consistently lagged far behind, largely because they have viewed such firms as inhospitable.
And the percentages remaining there to become partners are starker still. Mr. Harper said minorities accounted for only 28 of the more than 1,000 partners in the 35 firms. taking part in the bar association effort. "At that level, the number drops almost to invisibility," he said.
The New York numbers are not atypical. According to a 1989 survey by The National Law Journal, 4.1 percent of the lawyers at the nation's 250 largest law firms are black, Hispanic, Asian-American or American Indian. In the partnership ranks, minorities accounted for only 1.9 percent.
"There's been some marginal success, but trying to move legal institutions is like trying to turn a battleship on a dime," said Robert J. Grey, a Virginia lawyer and chairman of the American Bar Association's commission on opportunities for minorities.
The Law Journal's next survey, to be published later this fall, is expected to show little improvement in the situation, nationally or in New York. A few large firms, like Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton and Debevoise & Plimpton, are at or near the 10 percent figure. But of the 1,100 lawyers at three other New York firms -- Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson; Stroock & Strook & Lavan, and Dewey, Ballantine, Bushby, Palmer & Wood -- only 22 are minorities, and but one of them is a partner.
Other local bar groups have adopted similar, or even more ambitious, measures. Two years ago, for instance, 90 law firms and corporate legal departments in San Francisco pledged that by 1995, 15 percent of all their associates and 5 percent of their partners would be members of minority groups. By the year 2000, the numbers would be 25 percent and 10 percent.
Minority lawyers have long complained that once they join large law firms, they are placed on a separate, slower track. Beyond more aggressive recruiting of minority lawyers, the firms have pledged to insure that they consistently receive comparable assignments, serve the same important clients and generally "receive equal training, mentoring, guidance, feedback and opportunities to grow and succeed."
 
Social Activities
 The program also calls for minority lawyers to be included in "work-related social activities" -- the outings, dinners and other occasions where valuable contacts are made. Signatories also pledged to hold no functions at private clubs that discriminate on the basis of race, creed, religion or sex.
The city bar committee was established last year, in large part after the black partners at major firms complained about the slow increase in their ranks since 1969, when Amalya L. Kearse became the first minority partner at a major New York firm. "At the rate we were going, there were going to be only 30 of us by the year 2,000," one proponent of the program, who asked not to be identified, recalled. The panel was headed by Cyrus R. Vance, the former Secretary of State and a partner at Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett.

HEADLINE: Inmate Count In Some Jails Drops Sharply

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB

 BODY:
Two months after New York City officials warned that they were running out of jail space, the city's prison population has decreased so sharply that as many as 1,100 cells were vacant this month. It is the first time in two years that any significant number have been empty.
City officials and criminal-justice experts point to a variety of reasons for the decrease: faster transferring of convicted inmates to state prisons, and rearranging of court vacation schedules to avoid the traditional summer slump in resolving criminal cases. Also, fewer felonies are being reported and fewer felony arrests are being made. In addition, more of those arrested for misdemeanors are being given desk-appearance tickets instead of jail time. 
 The decrease has opened a debate among city officials over whether the Dinkins administration should push ahead with a $291-million prison-expansion program, which would create about 3,000 new beds in cells and dormitories on Rikers Island over the next two years.
 
Room for New Prisoners
 The city's increased efficiency in passing inmates to state prisons has led to an increase in crowding there: the number of state inmates rose this month to 57,000, from 54,000 in February. James B. Flateau, a spokesman for the State Division of Correctional Services, said room for new state prisoners was being created through more double bunking and supervised work-release programs for inmates who are close to parole eligibility.
The city's inmate population decreased from a peak of 22,273 inmates in July to about 20,800 last week, according to the city Correction Department, the agency that runs the jails. In the last month, the census has hovered between 95 percent and 96 percent of capacity compared with overflows of 102 percent in the spring and summer.
Correction Department records indicate that between 800 and 1,156 cells and dormitory beds have been available in recent weeks, the first time since December 1988 that so much space has opened in a jail system that usually has no vacancies.
Though some city officials and prison experts are questioning the expansion program, citing the jail-census decline, the city's Correction Commissioner, Allyn R. Sielaff, cautions that the downward trend could quickly reverse, with a return to bulging, explosive prison conditions.
Critics, however, say the construction plan should be halted, pointing out that 1,600 more jail beds are scheduled to be available through completion of a new rigid-frame plastic building next month and the expected arrival of a prison barge in February.
Mr. Sielaff, who supports the building program, said in an interview that the jails could be filled again if the state ran out of room for prisoners or arrests in the city soared. "It is far too early to say the population is down signficantly," he insisted. "We need a bit of cushion so that we are not always at the edge of an overcrowding precipice."
Mr. Sielaff emphasized that many of the city's jails were in disrepair and would have to be replaced or renovated.
But the city's Deputy Mayor for Public Safety, Milton Mollen, said some projects may be delayed or scrapped.
"We have to take into consideration that the jail occupancy is less than we feared it might be this summer," Mr. Mollen noted in an interview.
The City Comptroller, Elizabeth Holtzman, who temporarily blocked emergency contracts for several of the proposed jails in July, said in an interview that the overall building plan was "wasteful and inexcusable" in light of the city's financial difficulties. The Comptroller can record a formal objection to contracts awarded by city agencies but the Mayor has the final authority to approve or rescind the contracts.
Richard T. Wolf, the executive director of the city Board of Correction, an independent oversight agency, said that if a downward trend was underway, the city should reconsider building plans and "redouble efforts for prudent alternatives to incarceration."
Mr. Sielaff described the jail decrease as "unprecedented for this time of the year." In a report sent on Sept. 6 to Judge Morris Lasker of Federal District Court in Manhattan, who has oversight jurisdiction for conditions in city jails, Mr. Sielaff attributed the decline to the larger exodus to state prisons and to faster court dispositions of cases.
The state has responsibility for imprisoning criminals sentenced to more than one year; the city is responsible for holding defendants awaiting trial, prisoners sentenced to terms of less than one year and people accused of violating parole. The length of time detainees stay in city jails depends on how long it takes to try them, and how long it takes to process them for transfers to upstate prisons.
In past summers, the courts often slowed down because of vacations by court personnel and lawyers. Mary deBourbon, a spokeswoman for court administrators, said that vacation schedules this summer were juggled and that more judges and clerks were assigned to the State Supreme Court, where felony matters are heard. As a result, the number of felony cases completed in the city courts during the summer term -- June 17 to Sept. 9 -- rose to 15,278 compared with 14,011 for the same period last year.
 
Desk Appearance Tickets
 In addition, fewer people were being locked up in the first place. The felony crime rate and the number of felony arrests both declined for the first half of this year compared with the same period last year. Through June, 265,001 felonies were reported, down 4.8 percent and 75,126 felony arrests were made, down 6.4 percent.
And Mr. Mollen and several criminal-justice experts said that a torrent of police desk-appearance tickets for misdemeanors this year may have contributed to the decline in jail population. Through July 31, the police issued 37,995 desk tickets compared with 23,527 for the same period last year.
A defendant who gets a ticket is given a court date but is released. Those who are arrested for the same offense could be briefly jailed if bail is set and they are unable to raise it.
But Jeremy Travis, the Police Department's Deputy Commissioner for Legal Matters, said the desk tickets probably had little effect on the jails because most are given for minor, nonviolent offenses that rarely result in a defendant being held for bail.
 
Sanctions on Overcrowding
 In July, Mr. Sielaff said that he might be forced to release prisoners awaiting trial because of court sanctions on overcrowding. He projected that the jail population could swell to 26,000 in the autumn unless the state prison authorities expedited the transfers of those classified as state-ready.
The city says the improvement is a result of the state's willingness to accept larger weekly transfers. State officials, however, asserted that previous backlogs had been created mainly by the failure of the city jail authorities to prepare medical and administrative records required for transfers.
The low point in transfers of state-ready prisoners occurred in the week ending July 12, when only 201 were removed, according to the Correction Department. Since then the weekly flow has ranged between 417 and 614. The backlog decreased to 1,113 last week compared with a peak of 2,513 on July 15.
This month the weekly transfers have fallen below 500. Mr. Flateau of the State Correctional Division, attributed the dropoff partly to high unemployment in the city: the number of inmates in the city who can find jobs and thereby be freed through new state work-release programs has fallen. With more inmates remaining in upstate prisons, there is a shortage of beds for newcomers from the city.
Mr. Flateau added that the weekly transfers would soon rise with more space in state prisons provided through double bunking.

HEADLINE: Cuomo's Blueprint: Building a Legacy

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Sept. 25

 BODY:
While intended to breathe life into New York City's moribund economy, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's blueprint for fiscal recovery could also establish a lasting legacy for the third-term Governor.
Like the economy itself, Mr. Cuomo's record of governmental activism has withered somewhat during the recession. But the ingeniously packaged plan he presented this week provides an opportunity to resuscitate an image that has been deflated by an ambivalent electorate, devastating budget cuts and conflict with the Legislature. 
 Following the examples of two of his predecessors -- one remembered for rescuing New York City, the other for building massive public works -- Mr. Cuomo proposed a plan aimed at nursing an ailing city to health with a broth of bricks and mortar.
As was apparent to those who listened to Mr. Cuomo's speeches on Monday and Tuesday, the strategy of linking his political recovery to that of the city's economy is fraught with peril. Even as business and civic leaders have applauded the Governor's courage, they have raised questions about both the feasibility and the true impact of his proposals.
Today, for instance, the co-chairman of Mayor David N. Dinkins's management advisory task force, Donald D. Kummerfeld, argued that the Cuomo plan will do little to help the city in its time of real need, the next four years.
 
Help, in Awhile
 The Governor's proposal for the state to assume the local share of Medicaid costs eventually could save the city $1 billion a year, but not until the end of the century. It might take almost that long to create many of the jobs promised by his public works initiatives, if they are built at all.
"Until there's some specific hard dollars coming from a source other than the taxpayers of the City of New York, I don't know that you can allege that there is any help," Mr. Kummerfeld said.
What makes the Governor's plan risky is that the successes and failures of his plan for "a new New York" can be easily measured. If subway trains never speed below Second Avenue or water ferries never skim across New York Harbor, Mr. Cuomo will be held accountable.
But Mr. Cuomo calculated that the gamble had to be taken to raise the city's confidence. Someone, he determined, had to provide momentum simply by talking about the future rather than dwelling on the disheartening present.
"We need to stop moaning and start moving," the Governor told a meeting of business and political leaders on Tuesday morning.
It was not the Governor's first instinct to ride to the rescue. In July, he played down the potential for restructuring the Medicaid program, citing the difficulty of winning approval in the Republican-led State Senate. That fed criticism that Mr. Cuomo is often unwilling to expend his political capital, particularly in his dealings with the Legislature.
But what became clear to the Cuomo administration as the summer progressed -- particularly as public confidence in the city's economy and its leadership waned -- was that the Governor would be held accountable along with the Mayor for the city's problems. The public mood threatened to poison his reputation, both in New York and across the country.
"The Governor realized that he and the Mayor were both in a box created by the city's fiscal problems," a Dinkins aide said, "and that he had to find a way for them to get out arm in arm."
Mr. Cuomo, with a keen ear for public opinion, has spent the last year listening to the wails of a disgruntled public. He heard the voices of the voters who reprimanded him with a 52 percent showing at the polls last November and the profane shouts of the state workers who marched on the Executive Mansion last winter.
He took particular offense at a Time magazine cover story that asked whether the Big Apple was rotting. His blood boiled when politicians, both Democrats and Republicans, suggested that the Democratic Party would be embarrassed by holding its 1992 convention in New York City.
"Why did I do what I did when I did it?" Mr. Cuomo asked today, while addressing a reporters' luncheon in Washington. "It pains everybody who's from New York City. You have the recession, you have the drugs, you have the AIDS, you have less and less money from Washington, you have the whole world beating you up. People get depressed. They get angry. Things get worse and you say, 'Let me see if I can do something.' "
 
From Schools to Prisons
 Mr. Cuomo also was pained that the state's severe fiscal problems had forced him to pare the social programs at the heart of his own agenda. After overseeing huge increases in education funding, he cut aid to schools. After trumpeting his Decade of the Child agenda, he killed the college scholarship program that was to be its centerpiece.
What often seemed to be left of Mr. Cuomo's legacy was the construction of a record number of prison cells, a dubious accomplishment by even the Governor's reckoning.
"Rockefeller left the road system, the mall in Albany, all the universities," said Assembly Speaker Mel Miller. "Hugh Carey's monument is that he saved the city from bankruptcy. Maybe it sunk in that what you're remembered for as a Governor are the institutions you create and the temples you leave."
Mr. Cuomo's closest advisers uniformly dismissed the notion that the Governor was motivated by building a concrete legacy. But several said he did want to shuck the criticism that he is more interested in the politics of the nation than the problems of the state.
"I think he really wants to appear gubernatorial," said Lieut. Gov. Stan Lundine. "At the same time he is speaking out on national issues, traveling internationally, he wants people to understand he is engaged in the most pressing problems of the state. And right now, those are centered in New York City."

HEADLINE: UKRAINIAN LEADER AND BUSH CONFER

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 25

 BODY:
The Ukrainian leader, Leonid M. Kravchuk, met with President Bush today to discuss his breakaway republic's economic needs and nuclear weapons policy. It was the first visit to Washington by a leading Soviet republic official since the failed coup last month.
A State Department official who specializes in Soviet affairs said the 45-minute discussion in the Oval Office did not signify recognition of Ukrainian independence, but was "part of the process of U.S. contacts with people in the Soviet Union at all levels -- in Moscow and at the republic level." 
 Mr. Kravchuk, 57 years old, who is chairman of the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet and the leading candidate in coming presidential elections, said he told Mr. Bush that the Ukraine needed help from the United States to employ new technology to augment the production and export of grain. The republic of 52 million people is the Soviet Union's chief grain-producing area.
The Ukrainian leader also reiterated that his republic had no intention of keeping the nuclear weapons based on its territory, promising to transfer them to he control of the central authorities.
 
A Peace Corps Program?
 Mr. Bush outlined possible economic aid to the Ukraine, including consideration of a Peace Corps program and technical assistance, a White House statement said. The two leaders came to no agreements, but arranged for continued meetings between specialists to develop assistance programs and future contacts.
The statement quoted Mr. Bush as saying that the Ukraine "has a special place in the hearts of Americans."
The President has been walking a fine line between endorsing democracy in the republics and supporting efforts by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to keep the Soviet Union unified in some form. He backed independence for the three Baltic states, but has stopped short of recognizing the independence of several other republics.
In a speech to the Ukrainian Parliament on Aug. 1, he warned against the dangers of "suicidal nationalism."
This morning, Mr. Bush called Boris N. Yeltsin, the President of the Russian republic, to wish him good health -- Mr. Yeltsin was out of work part of last week with what aides described as a minor heart problem -- and to discuss what progress has been made between Moscow and 12 republics in negotiating a treaty that will dictate their future relationship.

HEADLINE: Family Leave: Fine, in Modest Doses

 BODY:
The idea of guaranteeing unpaid leave to workers who must cope with family emergencies has great appeal. It also carries hidden economic costs. Now, two Senators have created a sensible plan that respects both humanitarian needs and business realities.
Sponsored by Christopher Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, and Christopher Bond, Republican of Missouri, the bill would guarantee many workers 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for babies or seriously ill family members. But by scaling back the number of eligible employees and toughening the definition of "seriously ill," the Senators hope to avoid the fate of last year's bill: a Bush veto. 
 Whatever Mr. Bush decides to do this time around, he won't be able to ridicule overly harsh mandates. The Dodd-Bond bill would exempt small business, high-paid "key" employees and many part-timers; indeed, it exempts more than half the work force. And it provides for light penalties and strong employer protections, like the right to require a second medical opinion.
Nevertheless, the bill is setting off alarm bells in executive suites. The reason has less to do with what's in this bill than with what employers fear will be in the next one. To them, unpaid leave is a short skip away from mandated paid leave and a growing array of enumerated emergencies. These fears are not ill-founded; some family-leave advocates have said that the Dodd-Bond compromise is as important for the precedent it would set as for the benefits it would confer.
But if mandates mushroom, what began as a wholesome expression of concern for families will become an economic affliction. Employers are likely to compensate for costly mandates by cutting jobs or lowering wage offers and fringe benefits, like health insurance. This could hurt poor workers most; they're less likely to take the unpaid leave but will still suffer lost benefits.
Employers are increasingly offering on-site day care, guaranteed leave and other benefits that make caring for children easier. This response is no act of charity but rather a strategy for attracting applicants from a labor pool that increasingly comprises two-earner families and for cutting down on worker turnover.
If Washington tramps too heavily, it risks stifling this encouraging trend, wiping away options in favor of a one-size-fits-all benefits package. Mandated benefits thus warrant caution.
The Dodd-Bond bill is cautious; its cost will likely be measured in hundreds of millions, a minor threat to a $6.5 trillion economy. Meanwhile, the bill sends an important signal about how society values families and children. These gains are worth grabbing -- even as Congress needs to be reminded that more of the same is not necessarily better.

HEADLINE: Defeating Hussein, Once and for All

BYLINE: By Al Gore; Al Gore, Democrat of Tennessee, is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. This article is adapted from a Sept. 19 Senate speech.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
I support the President's moves to force Saddam Hussein to comply with the terms of the gulf cease-fire. But I disagree with the President's policy at a more fundamental level -- namely, his persistent view of Saddam Hussein as an acceptable part of the landscape, if and when we finally get him cut down to size.
The only way we can hope for long-term relief from Saddam Hussein is if Saddam Hussein ceases to hold power, and if his Baathist regime is dismantled as well. Realizing that the burden of proof rests with those who say that Mr. Hussein can be toppled, I think it possible to describe how that might be done. 
 In general, the formula for deposing him involves these elements: blocking his access to international support, building up his opponents and cutting off resources for rebuilding his military machine.
Under the first heading -- blocking Saddam Hussein's access to outside support -- I have to ask again why we didn't long ago begin documenting Iraqi war crimes against Kuwait. Even though we may never get him or his lieutenants into the dock to face war-crimes charges, the historical record should be filled in rather than allowed to fade. The truth should be spread in Iraq and the Arab world, using overt and covert methods to make sure that the message gets through.
We also need to isolate Saddam Hussein by improving our relations with Iran as rapidly as conditions permit. Meanwhile, the central U.S. role in Mideast peace talks, from which Iraq is completely excluded, has the benefit of destroying his usefulness to the Palestinians.
As for building the stock of Saddam Hussein's opponents, we should be using every resource to weaken his image and destroy the illusions his propaganda machine labors to create. Surely that is something our intelligence services know how to do! At the same time, we should be helping opposition forces -- most of them in exile -- to unify and improve their organization.
Under the third heading -- stopping Iraq from rebuilding its military -- we have to make sure that the economic tourniquet stays on tight, but take steps to assist the Iraqi people. The U.N. has it about right: sales of oil for humanitarian purchases, with neither the money nor the goods passing through the hands of the Iraq Government. The message to the Iraqi people has to be that Saddam Hussein is not only powerless to end their misery but is its cause.
There are other steps we should take, aimed at blocking Iraqi access to knowledge and technology. That means doing everything to halt Iraqi work in space science and nuclear physics to the extent they depend on equipment, services or training -- including university training -- from countries with advanced capabilities.
We also need to encourage a flow of intelligence from Iraq by offering protection and rewards to anyone who comes forward with useful, verifiable information. The standoff between Saddam Hussein and the courageous team of U.N. inspectors has been a perfect summary of what we face. Nothing could more clearly demonstrate that U.S. policy must address the underlying problem: Saddam Hussein's rule and system of Government are incompatible with the peace and security of our own country.
Finally, we have to get much tougher about exposing the foreign suppliers that Iraq used to acquire nuclear, chemical and biological facilities in the first place. If this means deeply embarrassing certain friendly governments, so be it. Otherwise, nothing will change.
There are other examples, but I would like to draw attention to the Swiss, who have benefited enormously from the security we have provided in Europe for the last 50 years. Switzerland has become a well-known haven for arms dealers and proliferators. Its Government values the security and tranquillity of its own people, but in this area its contribution to the security of other people in the world is substantially negative. It is time for the Swiss to live up to their image of clean rectitude. Other countries may feel pinched by that same shoe. So be it.
We can no more look forward to a constructive long-term relationship with Saddam Hussein than we could hope to housebreak a cobra. But it is not just enough to say that there will not be normal U.S. relations with Iraq while he is in power.
It is time to get down to cases. Sooner or later, he will go. Sooner is better. And with him, the entire Baathist rule by terror has to go as well, or we may simply exchange one brutal character for the next.

Dollar Advances in the U.S. After a Mixed Day Abroad

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar advanced yesterday in hectic domestic trading after finishing mixed overseas.
The dollar settled mixed overseas and headed lower when trading shifted to domestic markets. Traders sold the dollar after the release of worse-than-expected economic data that indicated the recovery might be waning. 
 The Government reported that the economy declined at an annual rate of five-tenths of 1 percent in the spring. A separate report showed an 8.9 percent increase in the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits.
"That made a lot of people feel that the dollar would soften, that the Federal Reserve may take action to keep interest rates soft," said Andrew Busch, a trader with Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago. Lower interest rates tend to erode the value of dollar-denominated securities, lessening demand for the United States currency.
 
Many Traders Caught Short
 But many traders were caught short once the dollar had fallen and were forced to buy it back in busy, technically driven trading.
The dollar also drew support from hints that the United States could become involved in military actions against Iraq.
"The market does not want to be short dollars in a big way with all the uncertainty in the gulf, the Soviet Union, in Yugoslavia," said Randolph Donney, research director at Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J.
The dollar typically is viewed as a safe haven in times of world turmoil.
Mr. Donney described the day's trading as "very choppy and indecisive."
In Tokyo, the dollar finished trading at 133.43 yen, up 0.21 yen from Wednesday's close. Later, in London, it was quoted at 133.60 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 133.95 yen, up from 133.22 yen on Wednesday.
In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.7325, compared with $1.7330 late Wednesday. In New York it cost $1.7285 to buy 1, less expensive than Wednesday's $1.7355.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.6875 German marks, up from 1.6805; 1.4675 Swiss francs, up from 1.4635; 5.7490 French francs, up from 5.7260; 1,263.85 Italian lire, up from 1,256.75, and 1.1360 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1346.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Prices for Silver Contracts Retreat Again in New York

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Silver futures prices fell sharply yesterday as weak economic data and a relaxation of tensions in the Middle East knocked out the market's main supports.
Gold futures also retreated, grains and soybeans fell, livestock and meat futures were mostly higher and energy futures were mixed. 
 Silver for delivery in September tumbled 10.9 cents, to $4.108 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange in New York. The more heavily traded December contract dropped 11 cents, to $4.155. October gold fell $2.20, to $350.80 an ounce.
 
Reversal of Factors
 The losses by silver extended a decline that began on Wednesday after it had climbed a total of about 18 cents in three sessions to its highest price in more than two months.
The rally was partly based on economic data that suggested industrial demand for silver would soon strengthen and on the Bush Administration's threat to force Iraq to cooperate with United Nations weapons inspectors.
Both factors were reversed yesterday.
The Government reported the American economy declined at an annual rate of five-tenths of 1 percent in the spring, a revision of more robust estimates issued in earlier reports, and there was a big jump in the number of people seeking jobless benefits early this month.
The United Nations Security Council, meanwhile, accepted an Iraqi proposal aimed at ending the three-day detainment of its inspection team in Baghdad.
Crude oil prices finished largely unchanged on the New York Mercantile Exchange, as traders digested news from an OPEC meeting and watched developments in Iraq.
Light sweet crude oil for delivery in November settled unchanged at $22.21 a barrel; October home heating oil fell 0.5 cent, to 63.10 cents a gallon; October unleaded gasoline rose 0.24 cent, to 62.02 cents a gallon; November natural gas rose 1.9 cents, to $1.918 for 1,000 cubic feet.
Grain and soybean futures prices settled mostly lower on the Chicago Board of Trade as harvest pressure replaced increased Soviet grain purchases as the big market influence.
Wheat for delivery in December settled 1 1/2 cents lower at $3.25 3/4 a bushel; December corn fell 1 3/4 cents, to $2.45 1/2 a bushel; December oats dropped 2 1/4 cents, to $1.26 3/4 a bushel; November soybeans fell 2 1/4 cents, to $5.88 a bushel.

Municipal Debt Ratings Fell In 3d Quarter, S.& P. Says

 BODY:
The Standard & Poor's Corporation said yesterday that the quality of municipal debt declined sharply in the third quarter.
The rating service said $17.4 billion in municipal debt received lower credit ratings in the quarter, while only $1.9 billion in debt received higher ratings. A hundred issues were downgraded, while 30 were upgraded. Most of the municipal issues were general-obligation and housing debt. 
 In contrast, $5.2 billion of municipal debt was downgraded during the second quarter, S.& P. said, while $1.4 billion received higher ratings. In that quarter, 74 issues received lower ratings, while 38 were upgraded.
States whose debt received lower ratings in the third quarter included New Jersey and Connecticut, as well as Illinois, which was under review for several months.
S.& P. attributed the decline in credit ratings mainly to the recession, which has sharply the tax revenues of a number of states, making it more difficult for them to balance their budgets.

Ameritech Is Offering Its Own Mastercard

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
Following the success of A.T.&T. and its Universal card, Ameritech yesterday became the first "Baby Bell" to offer a credit card that can be used for consumer purchases and to pay for telephone calls.
The new card, to be called The Ameritech Complete Mastercard, will be offered to most of the phone company's 10 million residential customers in the Midwest, depending on credit history. 
 The card will not carry the typical bank annual fee of $15 to $20, but will have an interest rate of 16.8 percent to 19.8 percent, depending on the balance owed; the more owed, the lower the rate. The card will also carry a 10 percent rebate offer on local and long-distance calls.
The American Telephone and Telegraph Company, already the fifth-largest issuer of Visa and Mastercards, has been so successful with its Universal card that by the end of the year it will become the second-largest issuer in the $269 billion market, according to the Nilson Report, a newsletter in Santa Monica, Calif. By then, A.T.& T. card holders are projected to have charged nearly $13 billion for retail goods and telephone calls.
Stephen G. Ford, an Ameritech spokesman, said his company's credit card had been under study for several years. "We've been contemplating this long before A.T.& T.'s Universal card," he said.
Ameritech has joined with a unit of Household International of Prospect Heights, Ill., the largest non-bank issuer of credit cards. Household, with nearly $4 billion in credit-card receivables, will own and finance the Ameritech receivables. Ameritech, based in Chicago, said it would pay for marketing costs.
Because of the arrangement, it is unclear whether Ameritech will ever make much profit from the service, but analysts say the new card could encourage use of local pay phones and aid brand loyalty for Ameritech.
"This is more of a marketing tool than a profit center," said David Robertson, president of the Nilson Report.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Up After Jobless Report

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
An unexpectedly large rise in weekly unemployment claims in the week ended Sept. 14 helped to push up prices of Treasury notes and bonds and caused interest rates to fall yesterday.
The release of the Labor Department figures is timely because President Bush is scheduled to meet today with key economic advisers, including the Federal Reserve Board chairman, Alan Greenspan. 
 That meeting comes only days before the Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee is scheduled to gather in Washington. The timing of the two sessions, coupled with continued weak economic data, suggested to market participants that the chances have increased that the Fed may be on the verge of cutting short-term interest rates again.
 
'Political Pressure on the Fed'
 "The market is sensing that the political pressure on the Fed is intensifying," said James A. Fralick a principal and senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company.
The initial claims report was "another piece of data that raise the question of whether we are in a recovery," said Robert A. Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities International. "Looking ahead, we will see more layoffs and more problems in the labor market."
Even if the Fed does decide to ease policy again, Mr. Brusca said, there is little reason to suggest that another cut in the overnight Federal funds rate would do much to spur the economy. The funds rate, which analysts say the Fed is currently trying to keep at 5 1/4 percent, is the rate the Fed charges banks that need overnight loans.
With the exception of the last two quarter-point cuts in the funds rate, the bulk of the rate relief supplied by the central bank came late last year and early in 1991.
With the lagging effect of changes in monetary policy, "we should be seeing the benefits of most of the Fed's easing moves right now, but we aren't," Mr. Brusca said.
 
Bullish Notions'
 After the claims numbers were announced "everybody started to refurbish their bullish notions," one government securities trader said. "What they are looking at is that the major impetus behind the lift we have seen over the last quarter -- the manufacturing sector -- may well stall out in the next month or two."
Market participants said trading activity was brisk throughout the session, especially in maturities from three months out to three years.
While short-term securities were the most popular, longer-term notes and bonds also posted gains.
By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 102 26/32, up 7/32, to yield 7.87 percent, compared with 7.89 percent late Wednesday.
Analysts said that further declines in the yield on the benchmark issue seemed likely.
"I think bond yields are headed toward 7.50 percent, and it is likely that will not be the low," said Roger Froelich, president of Technical Dimensions, a Mount Kisco, N.Y., firm that provides analysis on the credit markets. "Technically, the market is still very strong. And economic fundamentals are showing a recovery that is weak at best."
In the Treasury note market, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered in late trading at 102 11/32, up a quarter of a point, to yield 7.53 percent.
Prices of the two issues auctioned by the Treasury earlier in the week also advanced.
By late in the day, the 6 1/8 percent two-year notes sold on Tuesday were offered at a price to yield 6.04 percent. And the 7.00 percent five-year notes sold on Wednesday were offered at a price to yield 7.00 percent.
Anticipation of another easing move by the Federal Reserve pushed down short-term Treasury bill rates.
Three-month bills were offered late yesterday at a discount rate of 5.12 percent, down 3 basis points, or hundreths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by 4 basis points, to a late offered rate of 5.15 percent.
 
Money Supply Figures
 The Fed's weekly money supply report did little to discourage thoughts that the central bank might ease policy further, even though the figures announced yesterday were slightly larger than the market had expected.
The Fed said that all three measures of the nation's money supply rose during the week ended Sept. 16.
M-2, the monetary aggregate most closely followed by the Fed, rose by a healthy $5.2 billion. But the increase left M-2 growth for the year at just above 2.5 percent, which is the lower end of the Fed's target range.
The rise in Treasury prices and the drop in yields was sufficient to encourage six more companies to price more than $1.5 billion in new securities in the investment-grade corporate bond market.
Among the issuers was a financing subsidiary of Sears, Roebuck & Company, which offered $500 million worth of five-year notes backed by Sears credit-card receivables.
The 7 3/4 percent notes, which have an expected final maturity of Sept. 15, 1996, were priced at $99.468 to yield 7.88 percent, 85 basis points above the prevailing yield on the Treasury's new 7 percent five-year notes at the time of pricing.
Dean Witter Reynolds acted as lead underwriter for the offering. The securities are rated AAA by both Moody's Investors Service and by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
 
G.M. Acceptance Offering
 The General Motors Acceptance Corporation offered $300 million of five-year notes through an underwriting syndicate led by the First Boston Corporation.
The 8 percent notes, which mature Oct. 1, 1996, were priced at $100, or par, 95 basis points above the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 percent five-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities, which are noncallable for life, are rated A-1 by Moody's and A by S.& P.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, participants said prices of most issues were unchanged in sluggish trading.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt securities, municipal bond traders said prices of most widely quoted issues rose by about an eighth of a point.

HEADLINE: Dow Falls 3.80 as Small Investors Stay Out

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks were slightly lower yesterday in moderate trading, as investors with little interest in buying trudged to the sidelines. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 3.80 points to close at 3,017.22.
Big Board volume was 160.3 million shares, compared with 153.9 million on Wednesday. Advancing issues outpaced declining ones, 877 to 709. 
 While the market closed slightly down from the previous session, Hugh A. Johnson, the chief investment officer at the First Albany Corporation, noted that there were actually some good up and down swings, and at one point late in the afternoon the Dow was up at least 15 points before fading.
Professionals in Control
He described yesterday's activity similar to what had been going on in the market all week, with swings driven solely by professional trading in the absence of smaller investors who have stayed out.
"The market has remained within this 2,900 to 3,050 range because there is a debate going on," he said. "The debate is whether we are getting a recovery or not. There is deep concern that we may not get strong enough earnings to validate or support stocks at current levels."
The downward revision of the second-quarter gross national product, a measurement of the value of the nation's output of goods and services, and greater-than-expected number of new jobless claims reported yesterday cast further concern among investors about the state of the economy and approaching tide of new corporate earnings.
Large blue-chip issues gained strength in afternoon trading, with some cyclical stocks like Ford Motor, which rose 7/8, to 30 1/4, and General Motors, which also gained 7/8, to 37 7/8, adding support to the market. Bonds also added strength to the market.
 
Other Indexes Lower
 The New York Stock Exchange's composite index slipped 0.09, to 212.44, while the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks was down by 0.39, to 386.49.
Over-the-counter trading was brisk, as the composite index dropped 0.88, to 526.94. Part of that market's decline could be attributed to Scimed Life Systems, which fell 29 3/4, or 34.2 percent, to 57 1/4. The medical-supply company said late on Wednesday that it "was evaluating the future commecial status" of its Express catheter line in the United States.
Scimed also said it expected Eli Lilly's Advanced Cardiovascular Systems unit to receive another patent on a rapid-exchange catheter in the near future. On Aug. 21, the Lilly unit filed a complaint chargingg patent infringement. In addition, Scimed has reported weaker-than-expected earnings for the second quarter.
The drug group is characteristic of just how sensitive the market is to earnings news, Mr. Johnson said.
Trading on the American Stock Exchange fared a little better, with the composite index up 0.71, to 373.62.
Three groups, airlines, automobiles and technology, displayed some strength yesterday. "These groups are particularly sensitive to the economy," Mr. Johnson said. "It shows at least that some investors are looking beyond the soft economic numbers. They believe the outlook is brighter than the overall market suggest."
Some of the special situations in yesterday's market included Transco Energy, which rose 1 1/4, to 18 1/4. Lawrence A. Crowley, an analyst for Rauscher Pierce Refnes, upgraded the stock to "buy" from "neutral." He said he thought the recent selloff in the stock was "completely overdone," and from a price point of view, attractive.
He and other analysts think a ruling from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Wednesday over past pricing policy was not as negative as some investors had expected. On Wednesday, the stock dropped 2 1/8.
Salomon continued to rebound yesterday, as the stock closed higher for the third consecutive trading session. It rose 1 1/4, to 24 3/8, while other securities firms were mixed -- Morgan Stanley fell by 7/8, to 51 3/4; Paine Webber slipped 1/8, to 26 1/4, and Bear, Stearns was unchanged at 15.
Pyramid Technology's stock fell 1 7/8, to 16 1/4, on news that a Treasury Department contract for which it was the main subcontractor was being reviewed. The contract was given to American Telephone and Telegraph, but the General Services Administration has asked the Internal Revenue Service, which awarded the contract, to seek further information on its choice of A.T.& T.
The motion came after I.B.M. filed a protest against the selection of A.T.& T.

HEADLINE: U.S. Inquiry Into Salomon Is Expanded

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 26

 BODY:
The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether Salomon Brothers' efforts to corner the government securities market were also an attempt to manipulate foreign exchange rates, Richard C. Breeden, the commission's chairman said today.
"It is possible to manipulate interest rates and seek to profit from that manipulation in the foreign exchange market," Mr. Breeden told the oversight subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee. "We're looking at it," he added, "because it would be possible to use one market to attempt to influence the other." 
 Paul W. Mozer, who was dismissed by Salomon last month, was head of both Salomon's government securities desk and its foreign exchange desk. He is under investigation by both the S.E.C. and the Justice Department.
Robert E. Denham, Salomon's general counsel, whose testimony to the subcommittee today preceded Mr. Breeden's, told the panel "it would be very hard to manipulate the price of a two- or five-year security as a way of making money on the foreign exchange market."
Mr. Breeden also told the subcommittee that "it appeared that there may have been some concerted activity" involving Salomon and other firms or people at the May Treasury auction in which Salomon has already admitted violating trading rules. He said the issue required "a careful assessment of the activity" when the bonds were resold.
Mr. Breeden said further that "it appears that a large number of dealers may have reported deliberately inflated estimates of customer interest" when purchasing the debentures of Government-sponsored enterprises like the Federal National Mortgage Corporation and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.
Mr. Breeden and other regulators who testified today, however, warned Congress against taking precipitious action.
"Overreaction or adoption of ill-considered changes could result in significant costs to the Government and ultimately the taxpayers," Mr. Breeden said. "In addition, no system of regulation, however thorough or costly, can totally prevent the determined efforts of persons willing to lie, alter or falsify documents or otherwise conceal abusive activity."
 
Senate Adopts Violation Measure
 Meanwhile, by a voice vote Wednesday, the Senate adopted a measure supported by Mr. Breeden that would make it an explicit violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for any broker, dealer or bidder in government securities to knowingly make false or misleading statements. A similar measure is pending in the House. Under current law a violation of the Securities Exchange Act is subject to civil fines and may be referred to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution.
Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and co-sponsor of the Senate measure, said that it was needed to insure that regulatory agencies had "the broadest possible authority to prevent, detect and prosecute those who make false or misleading statements" in connection with purchases of government securities.
Deryck C. Maughan, Salomon's newly appointed chief operating officer, told the subcommittee that Salomon had made "millions" from the May auction, and that these profits were translated into bonuses for Salomon's managers and employes.
The subcommittee's chairman, Representative J. J. Pickle, Democrat of Texas, said he suspected that Salomon was not alone in violating the securities laws. "If you were taking advantage of the system, it seems to me that others were doing the same thing," he said.
 
Allusions to Other Violators
 Indeed, Victoria Whitenton, director of money markets for the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, told the subcommittee that "Salomon has not been alone in its manipulation" of the debenture market. She said that 18 of 27 members of Freddie Mac's debenture dealer group "indicated that they had supplied false information" about their purchase of debt instruments. None, including Salomon, has been barred from future purchases.
Similarly, Linda K. Knight, vice president of the Federal National Mortgage Association, said that "several dealers may have engaged in misstatements in the past." None has been barred from future purchases.
"We do not condone it," Ms. Knight said.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Hill & Knowlton Chief Makes an Abrupt Exit

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Robert L. Dilenschneider, the ambitious architect of Hill & Knowlton Inc.'s drive to become one of the world's largest public relations agencies, abruptly turned his job over yesterday to Thomas E. Eidson, the chief operating officer.
Hill & Knowlton, a subsidiary of Britain's WPP Group P.L.C., said Mr. Dilenschneider had resigned, which he denied. "All I am free to say is that I left and that I will finalize my new plans shortly," Mr. Dilenschneider said. 
 Sources familiar with Hill & Knowlton described a confrontation between the 47-year-old executive and Martin Sorrell, the chief executive of WPP. Mr. Dilenschneider had been unhappy with the pressure to focus on improving margins rather than pursuing growth opportunities, they said. Hill & Knowlton had lost a number of key clients in recent years and had been singed by internal dissent over its willingness to take on controversial assignments like the anti-abortion campaign of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. In addition, the recession demoralized the company, putting pressure on it to lay off employees and cut expenses.
"I don't know anyone working there who isn't dreaming of getting out," said one former senior executive who had clashed with Mr. Dilenschneider and other managers over the decision to represent the bishops. "They treat everybody as an expendable commodity."
 
Reputation of New Chief
 Mr. Eidson (pronounced ED-son), also 47, is assuming the titles of both president and chief executive. He has a reputation for being more concerned with details and predictable in his goals. He is inheriting a firm with 66 offices and 1,800 employees in 25 countries. The company had revenues of nearly $197 million last year. Its earnings are not publicly reported, but both profits and revenues are said to be down this year.
Timothy Metz, a senior vice president of Hill & Knowlton, described Mr. Dilenschneider as "a Vesuvian personality," adding, "I think he believes you die if you can't grow."
Mr. Dilenschneider declined to comment yesterday on widespread reports that he left Hill & Knowlton without having to promise not to compete, a common restriction in executive resignations and dismissals.
Mr. Dilenschneider joined the company in 1967 after graduating from Ohio State University's School of Journalism. He rose through the Chicago office to become chief executive in 1986. He began acquiring smaller public relations firms almost immediately. The expansion continued after Hill & Knowlton's parent company, the JWT Group (formerly J. Walter Thompson), was acquired by WPP in 1987.
Hill & Knowlton was founded in 1927 by John Hill, a conservative Midwestern Republican, and nurtured by its relationships with blue-chip companies like Mobil Oil, Pepsico, Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson. Under Mr. Dilenschneider, it became equally well known for crisis management and its participation as an adviser in bruising hostile takeovers. Mr. Dilenschneider further raised both the company's profile and his own with a book about public relations, "Power and Influence."
There was not much surprise at his departure, Mr. Metz said, but plenty of mixed feelings. Mr. Eidson, who has been with the company for 19 years, began his career as an account executive in Los Angeles. Mr. Metz said that many executives felt Mr. Eidson was better suited to lead the company in the 1990's.
In a telephone interview yesterday, Mr. Eidson declined to criticize Mr. Dilenschneider but sketched a sharply different focus for the firm.
"There was too much concentration in our industry on rate of growth in the 1980's," he said. "The business needs to be focused on serving the existing client, our most precious resource."
 
Relationship With Mazda
 He cited his slow cultivation of Mazda Motor, the Japanese car maker that has become the company's biggest client. "If that's a slow build, so be it," he continued. "It's a stable build. Just as in advertising, it's become very costly to go after new business. It's not unusual to spend $50,000 to try to land a new business."
In recent years, Mr. Eidson has been involved in reorganizing Hill & Knowlton operations overseas and in the United States. "I feel fairly comfortable with our structure at the moment," he said. "A shake-up now would be undoing everything I just did."
Mr. Eidson became general manager of the company's operations in the Western United States in 1981. He became president and chief operating officer of the company's domestic business in 1986, and last year was named president and chief executive of Hill & Knowlton International, the overseas division.

HEADLINE: Japanese Finance Minister Reportedly Sets Resignation

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 26

 BODY:
Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has told elders of the ruling party that he will resign to take responsibility for Japan's ongoing financial scandals, but not until after an important meeting of world financial leaders in Bangkok, Thailand, next month, according to reports here today.
Just about every major newspaper and television news broadcast carried the reports. Mr. Hashimoto's office refused to comment, but a member of Parliament from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and some senior Finance Ministry officials said they understood the reports to be correct. 
 The resignation would be a symbolic assumption of responsibility for the scandals. Since the resignation is likely to come after the passage of tougher securities laws and after Mr. Hashimoto has fulfilled his international obligations, political analsyts said the timing might help save his political career.
 
Important Global Issues
 If, as reported, he does stay on through the Bangkok meeting, Mr. Hashimoto is likely to give Japan a stronger, more experienced voice at the crucial series of talks, where large-scale financial aid to the Soviet Union and Soviet membership in the International Monetary Fund are expected to be discussed.
His presence could also benefit the United States at the meeting, since Mr. Hashimoto has often aligned himself with American positions. He was instrumental in Japan's decision to provide billions of dollars to the United States during the Persian Gulf war, a stand that won him public praise recently from Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady.
There has been speculation for several months that Mr. Hashimoto would resign because of the scandals, which have implicated just about every major securities house and bank in Japan in unethical practices. The scandals have also tarred the ministry by suggesting that its oversight of the financial industries was lax and that in some instances regulators winked at such unethical practices as improper payments to cover stock market losses of some brokerage house clients.
Mr. Hashimoto was personally embarrassed when one of his political secretaries admitted helping arrange illegal loans from a major bank for three friends of Mr. Hashimoto.
Mr. Hashimoto has hinted several times that he is prepared to resign. He is, however, widely reported to harbor ambitions of being prime minister someday, and he apparently is letting politics influence his timing. He has said he does not want to step down until he has taken measures to prevent similar financial scandals from occurring in the future. A bill to toughen the securities laws is expected to pass Parliament in the next few weeks.
 
Key Role in Talks
 Today's reports were a relief to ministry officials, who were concerned that Japan would be entering the Bangkok meetings with a newcomer or interim official as Finance Minister. Besides attending the annual meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund there, Mr. Hashimoto is expected to be the chairman of a meeting of the finance ministers of the seven leading industrial nations, known as the Group of Seven.
He is expected to deliver an important speech underscoring Japan's growing commitment to Asia as a focus for aid, investment and trade, a trend that has gathered momentum in recent years. The speech is also expected to hold up the economic success of Asia as a model for the rest of the world.
The meetings in Bangkok end Oct. 17, just before the ruling Liberal Democratic Party holds elections for a party president, who always becomes prime minister. Mr. Hashimoto's resignation at that time would be considered a token gesture, a party official said today, because there would be a Cabinet reshuffle after the election anyway. But the official added, it would allow Mr. Hashimoto to say he had lived up to his responsibilities, and thus it would perhaps salvage his political career.

HEADLINE: Chief Is Toppled at British Aerospace

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Sept. 26

 BODY:
Sir Roland Smith, the chairman of British Aerospace P.L.C., is resigning after a reported rebellion by large shareholders and the board of the company, which is Britain's largest military contractor and exporter of manufactured goods.
By several accounts, Sir Roland's downfall is a result of a clumsily handled share offering now under way, a sharp drop in the company's profits, an autocratic management style and differences over the company's efforts to diversify from the military and aerospace businesses. 
 "Some institutional investors have been very upset," said an investment manager at a large British insurance company, who insisted that he not be named.
British analysts and newspapers said board members and senior executives, including Richard H. Evans, British Aerospace's chief executive, were irritated by Sir Roland's strong will and his tendency to act on his own.
"The professor's style was a little bit more abrasive than other directors liked," said Keith I. Hodgkinson, an analyst at Lehman Brothers International Ltd., referring to Sir Roland, a longtime marketing professor. "He would tend to dictate."
Some analysts wondered today whether Sir Roland's ouster would cause British corporations to question whether someone could really serve effectively as the chairman of several companies at the same time, a common practice here. Sir Roland was chairman of seven or so companies and a director of several others.
Unlike chairmen in the United States, chairmen of British companies often are not also chief executives and may not be deeply involved in the hands-on management of the company.
British Aerospace's board said Sir Roland would be replaced temporarily by Sir Graham Day, the 58-year-old chairman of Rover, the car company that British Aerospace bought from the British Government in 1988. Sir Graham is also chairman of Cadbury Schweppes, the food and drink company, and Powergen, a new investor-owned power-generating company. He is a director of several other companies, including the Laird Group P.L.C. and Thorn EMI P.L.C.
Sir Graham said he would relinquish his duties temporarily at Rover and the other companies to devote time to British Aerospace.
Efforts to reach Sir Roland, Sir Graham and Mr. Evans today were unsuccessful.
This is hardly the first board room coup at a blue-chip British corporation. The chairman of Midland Bank, one of the nation's largest financial institutions, was toppled last March after the board decided he was not moving fast enough to revive the troubled bank.
Still, the abruptness of the British Aerospace announcement, coming late Wednesday night after a reportedly stormy board meeting, shocked many in the country. "The British way is to retire the person gracefully," said Nigel Nicholson, director of the Center for Organizational Research at the London Business School.
In a front-page article today, The Independent, a British newspaper not given to sensationalism, called the resignation "one of the most spectacular and brutal board room coups witnessed in many years." Several newspapers said Mr. Evans was a leader of the group of outside directors and senior executives who demanded Sir Roland's resignation, which becomes effective Oct. 7.
Sir Roland, 62 years old, has been chairman of British Aerospace since 1987. He oversaw its diversification into areas like cars, real estate and construction. He has also been pushing the company to form partnerships in the aerospace business to reduce the high costs and risks involved in developing and building new products.
Like contractors everywhere, the company has been struggling to adjust to an era of much lower military spending by Britain and other countries.
Even the addition of different products has not helped much in these tough times. The British and American recessions and the economic slowdown in other European countries have depressed Britain's real-estate and car businesses. Orders for civilian aircraft fell because airlines were hit hard by the recessions and a drop in passengers during the war against Iraq.
On Sept. 11, British Aerospace announced that its pretax profits in the first half of this year had plunged by 49.4 percent, to 86 million ($139.4 million). It also disclosed that it expected a program to overhaul its businesses, which includes cutting about 10,000 jobs, to cost 520 million ($900.9 million) by the end of 1993. As a result, the company said it would take a charge against earnings this year of about 250 million ($433.1 million).
That means the company will suffer a pretax loss of about 100 million ($173.3 million) for the year, Mr. Hodgkinson, the Lehman Brothers analyst, predicted.
Sir Roland's problems culminated this month when plans for a 432 million ($748.4 million) share offering by British Aerospace leaked out, depressing the company's stock price.
In trading on the London International Stock Exchange, British Aerospace's shares closed today at 4.28 ($7.42), up 3 pence (5 cents). Earlier this month, the stock had plunged to a low of 3.95 from 5.55 on Sept. 8. Its 1991 high is 6.64.
In a statement issued late Wednesday night, Sir Roland said: "In order to end damaging speculation about the future of the company, I have decided that it would be in the best interests of British Aerospace if I resigned now so that the management of the company can implement its strategy without any of the uncertainties which have surfaced since the announcement" of the share offering.

HEADLINE: Nintendo and Minnesota Set A Living-Room Lottery Test

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
In Minnesota, all you will need is a dollar, a dream and a Nintendo set.
The state plans to test a system that will allow people to use Nintendo equipment to play the state lottery in the comfort of their living rooms. 
 With the growth of lotteries tapering off, industry executives and officials in other states are eager to see whether this approach can draw more people to the games by letting them play without standing in line to buy tickets.
 
Combating a Slowdown
 "The lottery industry is looking for ways to expand its horizons," said Connie Scovin, an executive with the Control Data Corporation, the Minneapolis-based company that developed the idea and is designing the test system.
Nearly a third of the nation's homes have Nintendo sets, and if the Minnesota test is successful, Control Data plans to make the system available to other states.
The test will involve 10,000 homes next year. For the test, the state will provide the video game sets and the modem devices that allow them to communicate with a central computer. Participants, who will pay a service charge of $10 a month, will get software that lets them play all of Minnesota's games, including the biggest jackpots.
After players set up accounts with the lottery, they will be able to select their lottery numbers on their television sets at home. The numbers will be stored electronically in the central lottery computer and in a file in the player's Nintendo set.
Small prizes will be credited to the player's account. To collect a large jackpot, winners will have to go to a state lottery office and identify themselves as the holder of the winning account.
It is illegal in Minnesota for minors to play lottery games, and the Nintendo plan has been criticized by the State Attorney General and others who say it will make it easy for children to gamble. The system will have passwords and other safeguards intended to thwart unauthorized playing.
"Kids are gambling now; this will allow them to gamble more," said Tony Bouza, the former Gaming Commissioner in Minnesota. Young people today are well acquainted with technology, and they will inevitably devise ways to bypass the security measures, he predicted. He also said that gambling at home by adults sets a bad example for children. "You can't create safe sins," he said.
But others say the new system could serve a broader purpose, providing the catalyst that will encourage more people to use computers and phone lines to tap into a growing pool of information and services.
Nintendo's use as a gambling device may help put spark into the market for such on-line services, said Gary Arlen of Arlen Communications Inc., a research firm in Bethesda, Md. "I've been looking for the killer service," he said. "This is the kind of thing that makes sense."
For more than a decade, large corporations like Sears, Roebuck and I.B.M. have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in networks that allow people to shop, read the news, and make travel reservations using home computers linked to telephone lines. Such systems, including a Sears-I.B.M. joint venture, Prodigy Services Company, have been somewhat cumbersome to use and have been viewed more as a novelty than a necessary adjunct to daily life. Only about 3 percent of the households in the United States use an on-line service like Prodigy, Mr. Arlen said.
But as giant corporations have stumbled, Nintendo has been lurking in the background, the envy of the industry, with 30 million units already in use. Nintendo has had its eye on far more than the video-game market since it sold its first machine in the United States in 1986.
In Japan, Nintendo customers use their machines for banking and for buying and selling stocks. In a prescient bit of engineering, Nintendo included a plug to snap in a modem on the bottom of every machine sold in the United States.
With the lottery game, Nintendo will introduce its modem to the United States. As a contractor to Control Data, Nintendo will supply the modem and a specially designed software cartridge that provides lottery graphics. Control Data officials said Nintendo was providing the 10,000 machines and the other equipment for the test at no cost. The machines retail for about $80.
People who already have Nintendo machines would have to retrofit them with a modem to take advantage of on-line services. Computer modems are currently available for less than $100, and Mr. Arlen said Nintendo engineers could probably come up with a modem that would cost $50 to $75. Still, he questioned how many consumers would be willing to nearly double their investment in the machines.
Nintendo has also explored setting up a game network in which players could challenge other players, and has considered a stock trading service with Fidelity Services of Boston. Both projects are on hold. Nintendo said in a statement, "We are constantly approached by third parties who have ideas that are outside the traditional video-game arena."
Some in the industry say Nintendo may harm its image by its association with a lottery. They note that the company is already under fire from some parents and educators who say its games lack educational content.
"It's Jimmy the Greek comes home to your kid's bedroom," said Bob Heitman, general manager of the Sierra Network, a computerized game network that charges players to use its service. The network is a unit of Sierra On-Line Inc., a maker of computer games.
"I have a bad feeling for lotteries," he said. "As a family game company, I would not do it or advocate that our company do it."
 
New Uses for Older Machines
 For Nintendo, the lottery business could help prolong the life of its older model, which has been outmoded by a more powerful Nintendo machine introduced in the United States last month. Also, the introduction of gambling could help combat the general decline in interest in video games.
In a statement, Nintendo said, "This test could provide us with some insights into the potential for further network applications; however, our main focus is to find the kind of entertainment software that will truly take advantage of that potential."
Nintendo says that its machines are more than just toys and that 35 percent of Nintendo players are over the age of 18. Minnesota lottery officials and Control Data executives say their system's safeguards should be adequate to keep children from playing the lottery at home. Otho Brown, a vice president of Control Data, likened the situation to banking through automatic teller machines -- parents who keep the password a secret should have no concern about a child's misusing a cash card.
The lottery system has a number of built-in safeguards, including a feature that disables the unit if an incorrect password is entered. Becoming eligible to play the lottery at home is an involved process that requires mailing in a copy of a driver's license or other photo identification. And, all play is prepaid through deposits the account holders make with the lottery, so no one can run up a big unpaid bill. A $50 daily limit will be put on each player.
 
Control Data's Hopes
 If the home system is successful, it could provide an important business advantage for Control Data. The Minnesota-based company lags behind the Gtech Corporation of West Greenwich, R.I., the leader in supplying computer equipment and services to lotteries.
"We entered the test with the idea that lotteries would use it nationwide," said Mr. Brown of Control Data. He said lottery growth has slowed because the games have already attracted all the people interested in playing.
Nationwide, more than $20 billion was spent on lottery tickets last year, an increase of 2.8 percent from a year earlier, according to the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries in Washington. There are lotteries in 33 states and the District of Columbia.
As a result of the slowdown in the rate of growth, Mr. Brown said the lottery industry has been exploring ways to increase the appeal of the games and attract new types of customers. A group of state lotteries is considering sponsoring a nationally televised lottery show.
Mr. Brown said Nintendo owners are better educated and more affluent than the typical lottery players. He said that if home lottery play caught on, it could increase volume by 10 percent to 15 percent a year.

HEADLINE: West Reluctant to Quell Zaire Unrest

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 26

 BODY:
Western Governments, including those that have sent troops to help evacuate foreigners from riot-ravaged Zaire, expressed reluctance today to help quell disorder that is endangering the rule of their longtime ally, President Mobutu Sese Seko, as civil unrest reportedly spread across the country.
American and French officials said Kinshasa, the capital of Zaire, appeared calm today after unpaid troops sacked the city on Monday and Tuesday. 
 As United States military transport planes continued to move hundreds of French and Belgian troops to bases near Zaire today, Western officials said their efforts would be limited to evacuating foreigners.
"We are not there to help Mobutu, that's absolutely clear," said Laurent Aublin, a spokesman for the French Embassy in Washington.
In 1978, when French, Belgian and Moroccan troops intervened with United States support in southeastern Zaire, they not only rescued foreigners but also helped suppress an incursion from Angola of dissident troops opposed to General Mobutu. The officials today said that they would not intervene against domestic opponents of General Mobutu, who did not seem able to form a cohesive military force.
"The French intervention then was also aimed at turning back the aggression," Mr. Aublin said. "This time that is not the case. France has not taken responsibility for restoring order in Kinshasa."
American and Belgian officials made similar remarks, with one Belgian saying that there had been no opposition to his country's efforts to take control of airports in southeastern Zaire for the evacuation. "There was no typical military fighting at the landing locations, so I wouldn't characterize it as a military confrontation," he said.
The local police have taken control of Kinshasa and its airport, which French troops had occupied this week to evacuate their citizens. A spokesman for the State Department, Richard Boucher, told reporters today that while Kinshasa and another city, Lubumbashi, appeared calm, civil unrest had been reported "in several provincial areas."
Reuters reported that General Mobutu was on a yacht about 30 miles from Kinshasa.
 
Security Forces Kill 50
 His unpopularity in the West has grown because complaints of human rights abuses and corruption in his country, while hardly a recent development, have been intensifying, and because of the decline of Soviet power and the departure of Cuban troops from neighboring Angola. These developments have also reduced his value as an anti-Communist bulwark.
As many as 50 unarmed people have been killed by Zaire's security forces at opposition demonstrations since April, said Curt R. Goering, the deputy executive director of Amnesty International USA, a New York-based human rights group. Last year at least a dozen students were slain at a demonstration in Lubumbashi, and there were unconfirmed reports of as many as 100 to 150 dead, he said.
When Belgium demanded a full investigation last year into the Lubumbashi killings, General Mobutu responded by closing three provincial Belgian consulates, expelling 800 Belgian development workers, restricting Belgian flights and halting interest payments on Zaire's $500 million debt to Belgium, the Belgian official said.
[The European relief organization Doctors Without Borders estimated that about 100 people had died and 1,250 to 1,750 people had been injured in the riots since Monday, The Associated Press reported from Kinshasa.]
The troops who terrorized Kinshasa this week, after learning that they would not to be paid, usually receive as little as $10 a month. In contrast, estimates of the President's personal wealth run as high as $5 billion to $6 billion, said Phillip G. LeBel, the director of the Center for Economic Research on Africa at Montclair State College in Upper Montclair, N.J.
"He has created such an intricate web of corrupt business and political arrangements that he has stifled all economic activity," Mr. LeBel said.

HEADLINE: The Salvador Accord: Conflict Is Far From Over

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 26

 BODY:
The two sides in the Salvadoran civil war have agreed, in the accord signed Wednesday evening, that their country should become a fairer place in which to live. But the transformation of this hope into reality will essentially rely on the good faith of two foes who have given each other no quarter until now.
Pressures born of a shift in the global political balance brought the guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front and the Government of President Alfredo Cristiani to this breakthrough, but the rank and file on each side is deeply distrustful of the other. 
 In the towns, hamlets and byways of the tiny Central American country, where soldiers and guerrillas still confront each other daily in a war in which no prisoners are taken, neither side feels it has lost. Therefore, neither side feels it should concede or give up anything.
 
The Challenge Ahead
 That is the challenge awaiting those who negotiated the agreement in New York in 10 days of sometimes round-the-clock sessions under the direction of the United Nations' Secretary General, Javier Perez de Cuellar. Indeed, observers of the process said the two sides often spent more time negotiating with their own people than with the enemy.
The accord, which Mr. Perez de Cuellar said has untied the Gordian knot that had deadlocked the negotiations earlier this year, consists of broad agreements on the organization of a new national police force under civilian control, "purification" and reduction of the armed forces, an assurance that families and sympathizers of the guerrillas will not have to vacate lands they occupied a decade ago in guerrilla-dominated areas of the country, and creation of a commission to carry out the agreement.
The New York accords complement agreements reached earlier on respect for human rights and political changes intended to give the former guerrillas a better chance of winning elections. Negotiators said the next round of talks, to begin Oct. 12 in Mexico, will deal with a few remaining points on the armed forces and then the form of a cease-fire.
 
The Distrust Is Evident
 Although there is a general sense among all concerned that the guns should be silenced by the end of the year, the extent of the distrust remaining between the two sides was obvious in comments made almost as soon as the document was signed.
"Something the army hasn't seemed to understand is that the bell has tolled to end the war," proclaimed Joaquin Villalobos, considered the most skilled and ruthless of the five guerrilla leaders.
"They don't want to hear it," he asserted, "because they've converted the war into their business, into their reason for being."
And just days before signing the accord, another guerrilla leader, Salvador Sanchez Ceren, declared in an interview, "Even if the army is reduced and reformed, and even if a United Nations verification mechanism is established, neither we nor Salvadoran society can have enough confidence in the army."
 
'A Defensive Strategy'
 President Cristiani, for his part, said that if the guerrillas were to launch a significant military operation before the Mexico round of talks "it would not look good for the peace process." But he said the army would not give up its currently aggressive patrols in guerrilla areas, which he described as falling "within a defensive strategy."
Mr. Cristiani, who represents the more conciliatory wing of his rightist party, the Nationalist Republican Alliance, has often come under criticism from his own supporters and from within the army for his willingness to negotiate. While he was in New York, a Salvadoran newspaper closely identified with the powerful landholding class from which the President comes sharply criticized him in an editorial.
He dismissed such critics by saying there was "basically no alternative" to negotiating.
Mr. Cristiani not only faces the challenge of keeping the army and extreme right on board but also will be tested in his ability to respond to social and economic demands made by the guerrillas and by soldiers who will lose their jobs in the army reduction.
The once-fraudulent electoral process has been cleaned up significantly in recent years, and the political parts of the peace accords further improve the left's chances of fair treatment, but the guerrillas will eventually be tested on whether they are truly able to put faith in elections as the way to solve political differences.
Mr. Villalobos is the guerrilla chief whom the Government thinks will have the most difficulty keeping the promise of the rebels to confine their future struggles to peaceful political activity. Mr. Sanchez, by contrast, talked of a new phase "in which the forces in search of democracy and liberty are going to express themselves more in the political fight."
The ultimate tests will be how the former guerrillas react if the voters find little appeal in their electoral messages, and how the right and the army respond if the voters do like the message of the former rebels.

HEADLINE: U.S. Policy on Yugoslavia Shifts to Curbing Serbs

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 26

 BODY:
In vehemently denouncing Serbia before the Security Council on Wednesday and accusing it of special responsibility in Yugoslavia's intensifying civil war, the Bush Administration has abandoned its earlier policy of finding blame on all sides and has decided to try to use its influence to limit further expansion by the Serbs.
The United States and its allies apparently chose to raise the intensity of their warnings to Serbia at this time, after the current Serbian offensive againt Croatiabogged down, hoping that the Serbs can be disuaded from making any new drives on areas beyond Serbia where there are significant Serbian populations. 
 "The government of Serbia and the Yugoslav federal military bear a special and indeed growing responsiblity for the grim future which awaits the peoples of Yugoslavia if they do not stop the bloodshed," Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said during a special session of the Security Council held Wednesday to impose a total arms embargo on Yugoslavia and to endorse European Community mediation efforts.
"Clearly, the Yugoslav Federal military is not serving as an impartial guarantor of a cease-fire in Croatia," he continued. "On the contrary, it has actively supported local Serbian forces in violating the cease-fire, causing deaths to the citizens it is constitutionally supposed to protect. The military has initiated what can only be described as outright military intervention against Croatia, while repudiating the authority of Yugoslav Government institutions which have sought to control it."
 
Stopping the Serbs and the Army
 For now at least, it appears that the Bush Administration has abandoned any hope it had for rebuilding a federal Yugoslavia and has decided instead to concentrate on preventing Serbia and the Yugoslav army that it dominates from dismembering other independence-minded republics and establishing its own "small Yugoslavia," or "Greater Serbia," as Mr. Baker put it.
"Secretary Baker has inserted the United States into a conflict, which up to now he has allowed to be primarily handled by the Europeans, in a way that appears to place America on the side of the Croats, even though he calls on all sides to end the violence," said Steven Burg, an expert on Yugoslav politics at Brandeis University. "While he appears to have been motivated by the opportunity to achieve a cease-fire in place, at a moment of relative balance, the irony is that his statement may weaken the American claim to be an honest broker capable of neutral mediation in the future."
Although in May and July the State Department reprimanded the Serbs for trying to impose their will on other Yugoslav republics, it always accompanied those warnings by cautioning the other republics against unilaterally pulling away from the Serbian-dominated central Government. Washington warned all of them not to expect American diplomatic recognition.
 
German Threat of Sanctions
 In fact, Mr. Baker was accused by some conservative commentators of having implicitly encouraged the Serbs to try to forcibly hold Yugoslavia together by the vigorous manner in which he seemed to oppose the uniltaeral, and inevitable, declarations of independnce by Slovenia and Croatia.
That posture contrasted sharply with that of the Germans, who for much of the summer pressed the European Community to chastise Serbia, even raising the prospect of economic sanction against Belgrade.
Mr. Baker, speaking at Wednesday's special meeting of the Security Council, certainly went out of his way to erase any lingering impression that the United States was ready to countenance Serbian efforts to hold Yugoslavia together by force, making it clear that the United States has joined an increasingly large international chorus in singling out the Serbs for particular responsibility.
"It is clear that the Serbian leadership is actively supporting and encouraging the use of force in Croatia by Serbian militants and the Yugoslav military," he said. "The apparent objective of the Serbian leadership and the Yugoslav military working in tandem is to create a 'small Yugoslavia' or 'Greater Serbia,' which would exclude Slovenia and a rump Croatia."
"This new entity would be based on the kind of repression which Serbian authorities have exercised in Kosovo for several years," the Secretary of State said referring to a region where ethnic Albanians are in the majority. "This entity would also be based on the use of force -- well underway in Croatia, and beginning to take shape in Bosnia and Herzegovina -- to establish control over territories outside Serbia."
Mr. Baker, in remarks addressed to various Yugoslav-American groups, said the United States appreciated the concerns of all the peoples of Yugoslavia everywhere about their future in the event that Yugoslavia disintegrates.
"But the United States cannot and will not accept repression and the use of force in the name of those concerns," he said.

HEADLINE: Senate-House Conference Agrees To Extend Unemployment Relief

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 26

 BODY:
Senate and House conferees reached quick agreement today on a $6.4 billion measure to provide extended unemployment benefits for people who have been out of work at least half a year.
The measure, which would provide up to 20 weeks of additional benefits in the states hit hardest by the recession, faces an almost certain veto by President Bush, but Democrats hope to override a veto by him for the first time. 
 The compromise agreement, adopted by exchanging documents without a face-to-face meeting, includes a House provision that would pay for the measure by declaring an emergency under last year's budget act, either upon Mr. Bush's signing the bill or a successful effort to override his veto.
 
Bill Returns to Each House
 In its version of the bill, the Senate had included a two-step provision, like the one Mr. Bush used to kill a similar measure in August when he signed the bill but blocked the benefits from flowing by refusing to issue a separate declaration of emergency. This two-step provision was abandoned by the Senate in the conference with the House, so Mr. Bush will have to veto the bill to stop it.
Now the measure returns to each house for a final vote, and the removal of the two-step provision may cost the bill Republican votes in the Senate. Thirteen of the Senate's 43 Republicans voted for the bill on Tuesday when it passed, 69 to 30. The House, which pressed for emergency designation, will not vote before Tuesday when it returns from a four-day weekend recess, but the Senate may vote as early as Friday.
If as many as four Republican Senators change their votes and oppose the bill, they would deny the bill the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto. The Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, has been saying, publicly and privately, that he has enough Republicans ready to switch to sustain a veto.
The House passed the bill 283 to 125 and is expected to be able to muster more than a two-thirds majority when it votes on the compromise.
The bill would replace, temporarily, an existing extended benefits program that is drawn so narrowly that benefits are now paid only in Rhode Island and Puerto Rico. The new program would be paid for entirely out of Federal funds, drawn from a $7.7 billion trust fund created to pay for extended benefits.
The existing progarm is paid half from that trust fund and half from state funds, and provides up to 13 weeks of benefits after someone covered by unemployment insurance exhausts his or her benefits. In most states, benefits are limited to 26 weeks and have averaged $167 over the last 12 months.
Under the bill, up to 20 additional weeks of benefits would be paid in states where total unemployment averaged 8 percent over the previous six months. Currently that would include Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi and West Virginia as well as Puerto Rico and Rhode Isand.
Workers in states where unemployement has averaged 7 percent or more would be eligible for up to 13 additional weeks. Thirteen states, including New York and California, and the District of Columbia, are on that list. Workers in all other states would be eligible for 7 additional weeks of benefits.

HEADLINE: NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN POVERTY SHOWS SHARP RISE IN U.S.

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 26

 BODY:
The poverty rate rose sharply last year and the incomes of Americans declined, according to a Census Bureau report that provides the first detailed look at suffering in the current recession. The report immediately touched off a debate about how much pain the recession would ultimately inflict, on whom, and for how long.
But by the bureau's estimate, 2.1 million more Americans were living in poverty in 1990 than in the previous year. 
 The trends of rising poverty and declining income, while broad, were not universal. For instance, the main increases in poverty occurred among white and Hispanic people, not blacks, and took place in the Northeast. The poverty rate rose for both children and the elderly. It rose inside metropolitan areas, but not beyond them.
The main drop in income was among white men, rather than among women or blacks. Income declined in the Northeast and the West, but not in the South or Midwest. It dropped for households at all earnings levels, but not for those 65 years old or more.
 
Role of Geography
 Census officials speculated that the racial differences were primarily being driven by geography, since 71 percent of blacks live outside the Northeast and the West, where the recession is taking its greatest toll. They also said a larger percentage of poor black families were headed by an unmarried woman, than poor white or Hispanic families. Such households are more likely to rely on welfare and less likely to have their incomes cut by recessionary layoffs. They added that as the recession went on, they did not expect blacks to be spared.
The poverty rate is a controversial measure intended to reflect the percentage of Americans living below a threshold of minimal need, estimated at $13,359 for a family of four in 1990. It is not adjusted for regional variations in the cost of living. Many conservatives have said the measurement, which excludes noncash benefits like food stamps and health insurance, exaggerates the extent of poverty.
The poverty rate is mainly of interest because of the measure it provides of social well-being rather than for allowing individuals to qualify for government assistance.
In 1990, the bureau estimated, 33.6 million Americans were living in poverty, pushing the poverty rate up to 13.5 percent from 12.8 percent a year earlier. Median household income fell 1.7 percent, to $29,943.
Many analysts, including some inside the Census Bureau, expressed surprise at the magnitude of the changes, since the recession did not officially begin until halfway through 1990. They said its full effect might not be known until next year's survey, which will cover 1991.
Democratic leaders, who have been emphasizing what they call the unfair economic effects of the 1980's, quickly seized on the report to argue that it portends high poverty rates and a suffering middle class well into the future.
"This is really distressing," said Senator Paul Sarbanes, the Maryland Democrat who is chairman of the Joint Economic Committee and who renewed his call for extended unemployment benefits.
 
Contrast in Views
 "The siren song that the Administration has been singing that this is a short and shallow recession is being belittled by all the evidence," he said.
But those with a more sanguine view of the future were interpreting the numbers as predictable and passing.
"It's about what you'd expect," said Ben J. Wattenberg, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, who has written a book predicting robust economic growth for the next decade. "Without being facetious -- surprise, surprise -- in a recession some people lose their jobs and poverty goes up a bit."
Mr. Wattenberg said this was the ninth recession since World War II, adding that in each case median incomes subsequently surged to record highs.
Some of those who expressed surprise at the magnitude of the rise in the poverty rate turned to unemployment statistics by way of comparison. The unemployment rate only rose to 5.5 percent in 1990 from 5.3 percent in 1989. If a small change in unemployment could send an additional 2.1 million Americans into poverty, they say, the effects will be much worse for 1991, when unemployment is expected to average about 6.7 percent.
Citing such numbers, Isaac Shapiro, an analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington research center, argues the poverty statistics "are surprisingly bad given how early we are into the recession."
A different gauge of their effect comes more informally, from a Census Bureau office pool by those involved in the measurement. The median guess was that the poverty rate would reach 13.1 percent, said one analyst, who said the professionals were surprised when the number surged to 13.5 percent.
If there was good news in the report, it was that differences narrowed in the earnings between blacks and whites and between men and women. In 1990, black married couple families had 84 percent of the income of married whites, an all-time high. Women's earnings rose to 71 percent of those of men, also an all-time high.
But that silver lining came with its own cloud: the gain was a result of declines in the earnings of white men, rather than in gains by other groups. Men's earnings fell 3.6 percent, to an average of $27,866 in the third consecutive year of decline. Women's earnings remained unchanged at $19,816.
"Women as a whole haven't been as badly hit by the recession because they're not in the factory-line manufacturing jobs," said Patricia Ruggles, an economist at the Urban Institute. "They tend to be in the service sector, with jobs like waitresses, maids, clerks."
Median household income fell by 5 percent in the Northeast, to $32,676. In the West, it fell by 3.1 percent, to $31,761. Both areas still had significantly higher household incomes than the Midwest or South, which registered $29,897 and $26,942, respectively.
On a per-capita basis, real income for all Americans declined for the first time in eight years, by 2.9 percent to $14,387.
Despite the rising poverty rate, today's number of 13.5 percent remains below the recent high in 1983 of 15 percent. Nonetheless, it is higher than at any time in the 1970's.
Ms. Ruggles and others expressed particular concern about the long-term effect on the poorest fifth of Americans, who were battered by the 1981-82 recession and whose average incomes are still less than they were in 1979, when adjusted for inflation. She said she feared the poor might be caught in a one-step forward, two-step backward pattern of battering recessions and slow recoveries. The poverty rate for whites rose to 10.7 percent, from 10 percent in 1990. For Hispanic people, the figures rose to 28.1 percent from 26.2 percent.
The rate for blacks, though not registering a statistically significant gain, remained the highest of the three groups, at 31.9 percent. By Census figures, Hispanic people may be either black or white.
The Northeast was the only region to experience a growth in poverty, to 11.4 percent from 10 percent in 1989, although its rate remained the country's lowest. In 1990, the rate was 12.4 percent for the Midwest; 15.8 percent for the South, and 13 percent for the West.
The poverty rate inside metropolitan areas rose to 12.7 percent from 12 percent in 1990.
 
Rise in Elderly Poor
 The poverty rate for the elderly rose to 12.2 percent from 11.4 percent, even though the overall earnings of the elderly did not decline. Analysts say that is because a large proportion of the elderly are concentrated just above the poverty line, so a small changes can push them across the official barrier.
While the elderly rate rose, it is still sharply diminished from its levels a generation ago. In 1967, the poverty rate for the elderly was 29.5.
The poverty rate for children also rose, to 20.6 percent in 1990 from 19.6 percent the previous year.
Analysts have said the high percentage of children in poverty is being driven by the increasing numbers of female-headed households. Married couples continued to have the nation's lowest poverty rate: 5.7 percent.
The Census Bureau produces the annual report by interviewing 60,000 households each March, in a data base separate from the decennial census.
In calculating its official rates, the bureau counts only cash income and not benefits like subsidized housing, Medicaid or food stamps. It then computes the percentage of people who fall below an income threshold, which is adjusted each year for inflation.
A number of conservatives have said that by failing to count food stamps and other Government benefits, the bureau vastly overstates the amount of American poverty.
Others, including Ms. Ruggles of the Urban Institute, have argued that the bureau underestimates poverty.
Census officials have argued that any measure of poverty is subjective and the rates are chiefly of interest in tracking trends, which remain about the same no matter which definition is used.
Some programs do use the poverty line in determining eligibility, but usually not on a one-to-one basis. The food stamp program, for instance, typically provides assistance to families with incomes of about 120 percent of the poverty threshold.
Democratic leaders lost no time in calling for stepped-up measures of Government intervention. "The country cannot continue to tolerate this," said Representative Thomas Downey, a Long Island Democrat. "You're not going to be able to put enough locks on the door to protect yourself from people being dislocated."

Arkansas Traveler

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark.

 BODY:
Can the Governor of one of the smallest, poorest states in the South win the Democratic nomination for President? Can he if he is an intellectual, a one-time Rhodes Scholar, a Yale Law graduate? If he has a certain detachment, a sense of humor about his ambition?
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas is about to find out. He has scheduled a press conference for next Thursday to announce his plans, and nobody doubts that he is going to run. 
 After a speech to the National Newspaper Association here in Little Rock, he was surrounded by local reporters. "Can you beat George Bush?" one asked.
"Not tomorrow," he said. "That's what we have elections for."
Mr. Clinton talked about issues. Then Bill Simmons, chief of the Associated Press bureau here, said: "That sounds awfully high-minded for a competition that can be settled on Willie Horton." The Governor replied that the Willie Horton tactic in the 1988 Bush campaign could have been handled -- by answering it directly and addressing the real issue of crime and people's fear of it.
Later, in a conversation on board a plane, Governor Clinton talked about the irrelevance and ugliness of recent campaigns. "Maybe you have to be crazy to run for President these days -- anybody who files should be disqualified," he said with a smile.
"But I don't see this as a Don Quixote venture," he went on. He told a story about a police officer who drove with him on a recent visit to Houston: a man 27 years on the force, who called himself a conservative.
"I saw you on C-Span," the officer said. "You going to run for President?"
"Do you think I have a chance to win?" Mr. Clinton replied.
"Hell no! With that war and all . . ."
As they drove along, the Governor asked what issues the officer would use if he were running. The officer talked about economic stress, stagnant wages, the ever-rising cost of health care . . . . And those are some of the very issues that Mr. Clinton thinks can win the 1992 election for a Democrat if he manages to focus the campaign on them.
"People now believe the Presidency is about foreign policy," the Governor said. "But that's not what they really care about in their own lives.
"I basically agree with E. J. Dionne's argument [in his book "Why Americans Hate Politics"] that the recent elections have given Americans false choices. The Republicans won by dividing us -- by saying, 'If you're for civil rights, you're pro-quota,' 'If you want government to help solve problems, you're for more taxing and spending.'
"So the Democrats lost the elections, but the people lost the aftermath. In 1988 Americans knew the cold war was over. They wanted to move on from Reagan. Bush knew that -- it's why he talked about being the Education President, the Environment President. But he won on 'Read my lips' and plastic surgery on Dukakis.
"Bush was hurt by the way he won that election. He was below 50 percent in the polls in 1990, but he was saved by Saddam Hussein."
The next campaign, Mr. Clinton said, should be about how to rebuild this country's internal strength so it can live up to its vision of itself and carry out its responsibilities in the world.
"We have no strategy for our economic future," he said. "We have the biggest underclass of any major country. The middle class is under stress. The Reagan-Bush policy is just Keep inflation down, reduce government. I don't think that will cut it."
Education should be a major national emphasis, Mr. Clinton said -- as it has been in Arkansas during his years as Governor. Sending a child to college today takes three times the percentage of family income that it did a few years ago. He spoke of a new national program of college loans to be repaid out of graduates' income or by doing national service. The Reagan-Bush effort to reduce Federal support for college students was "nutty," he said.
"The Democratic primaries could define the issues for the general election," he said -- "present the real choices this country faces. Bush may win in the end because people see him as having the experience in foreign policy, but the worst that could happen is to make him a better President in a second term."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
A Japanese Shift Away From U.S.

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
TO diversify the risks to its economy, Japan is shifting the focus of its global strategy away from the United States and toward Southeast Asia and Europe.
The shift results in part from a decision to resist what the Japanese Government and many business executives regard as a rising threat of American protectionism. This week, Japanese companies said they would retaliate against a 63 percent United States tariff on advanced screens for computers. Citing the tariff, the Toshiba Corporation said it was moving its manufacturing operations out of the United States. 
 But the Japanese decision to diversify also stems from a conviction that economic growth in the United States will continue to lag behind that in some other regions. A white paper presented to the Japanese Cabinet last May noted that despite some improvements in American manufacturing productivity, "these indicators of improvement should not lead us to be too optimistic, for a number of problems still remain, such as the economy's deep-rooted reliance on imports, the sluggish growth in R.&D. investment and capital stock, and the slowdown in investment for strengthening productive capacity."
In a study for the Conference Board, two economists, Gail D. Fosler and Kenneth Goldstein, wrote that the motivation behind the shift in Japan's strategy "is no mystery." They attributed it chiefly to the long-run rise in the yen's value. They wrote that "the cost of Japan-based production, which is already relatively high, will be increasingly disadvantaged."
Production abroad has other advantages. A Toshiba spokesman said his company would prefer to continue production in America because "our policy is manufacturing as close to our customers as possible."
But that also goes for customers other than Americans. Japan is trying to establish a much stronger presence in Europe before economic unification gets into full swing there at the end of 1992.
There is another reason Japanese industries are diversifying their direct investment globally: the rising cost of capital in Japan, with Japanese costs approaching the levels in other countries.
Capital costs are likely to continue to rise, especially after the beginning of the new century, for demographic reasons: Japan has the fastest-aging population mix of any industrial country. At a recent conference of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Kumiharu Shigehara, director of the Bank of Japan's Institute for Monetary and Economic Studies, said the demographic changes "will reduce Japan's savings substantially from around the start of the next century."
One policy implication of this trend, he said, is that Japan should aim at a high savings rate mainly through an increase in consumption taxes, and should devote most of the extra savings to domestic investment in infrastructure and housing. "But a portion of such savings," he added, "might better be channeled to developing countries in the forms of direct investment and lending to them directly or through multilateral institutions."
Japan's diversification strategy has been in motion since the mid-1980's. The Conference Board study shows that in the first half of the 1980's Japan's exports to the United States rose from 24 percent of its total exports to almost 40 percent, while the share going to Southeast Asia and Europe declined. But in the second half of the 1980's, while the share of Japan's exports to the United States dropped to 31 percent, it rose to 22 percent from 14 percent for Western Europe and to 29 percent fom 19 percent for Southeast Asia. The growth rates are even more pronounced: From 1985 to 1990, as Japanese exports to the United States rose just 39 percent, the country's exports to Southeast Asia and Europe shot up by 150 percent.
Japanese direct investment shows similar global shifts, especially in Southeast Asia. Twenty years ago, of all foreign direct investment in that region, 12 percent came from Japan, 20 percent from Europe and a little more than half from the United States. By 1990, the United States' share had fallen to 20 percent, Europe's share to less than 5 percent, while Japanese direct investment in Southeast Asia surged to nearly 40 percent of the total.
These trends are likely to result in important shifts in regional economic relations and in the United States-Japan relationship. After World War II, Japan depended heavily on the United States both as a provider of security, sponsor of its acceptance in the international community and its most important economic partner by far. Today Japan is increasingly chafing under its bilateral dependency on the United States and is moving to a more diversified global strategy.

HEADLINE: Incomes Rise 0.4%, but Spending Is Weak

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 27

 BODY:
Incomes grew four-tenths of 1 percent in August, but consumers increased their spending by only one-tenth of 1 percent, the Government said today in a report showing that consumers are not providing their usual lift to the economic recovery.
During past downturns, consumers used their economic muscle to bring the economy out of recession. Their spending represents two-thirds of the nation's economic activity. 
 "Obviously, consumers are not leading the way out of the recession," said Lawrence A. Hunter, an economist at the United States Chamber of Commerce.
Sung Won Sohn, an economist with the Norwest Corporation of Minneapolis, said: "It's going to be a while before we see consumer spending perk up. The fundamentals are not there: jobs, income growth and rising confidence."
The Commerce Department reported that incomes totaled $4.82 trillion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate in August, up from $4.80 trillion a month earlier. It was the sixth straight advance; an initial decline of one-tenth of 1 percent reported for July was revised in today's report to a gain of two-tenths.
Disposable income -- income after taxes -- rose five-tenths of 1 percent in July, after remaining unchanged a month earlier.
Personal consumption, on the other hand, was at a $3.840 trillion annual rate, up from $3.837 trillion in July, but the smallest increase since spending fell five-tenths of 1 percent in April.
The spending and income figures were not adjusted for inflation, leading Mr. Hunter to suggest the increase in consumer spending in August was "an illusion."
"When adjusted for inflation," he said, "spending actually was down two-tenths of a percent." He added that "there is reason to believe that consumer spending may not grow at all in the next several months."
Disposable incomes, when adjusted for inflation, were up two-tenths of 1 percent, but Gordon Richards, an economist at the National Association of Manufacturers, said that even if that gain was sustained for the next 12 months, it would translate into only a 2.4 percent increase.
That, he said, is "scarcely enough to accelerate the economy."
A key component of the income category -- wages and salaries -- rose $13.7 billion, wiping out an $8.8 billion loss the previous month. The improvement had been anticipated after earlier reports of increases in both wages and the length of the workweek.
But Mr. Sohn said: "I don't think that's going to be repeated in the near future. Employment is really going nowhere. The number of hours worked is going to slow down. Wages are not going up that rapidly."
The difference between incomes and spending meant Americans' savings rate -- savings as a percentage of disposable incomes -- edged up to 3.9 percent, from 3.6 percent in July.

HEADLINE: Weak Economy Takes Toll on Its Experts

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Sept. 25

 BODY:
The recession, which they failed to predict and now declare over, is weighing heavily on the nation's economists.
The weak economy, combined with a wave of mergers in the banking industry and a mixed forecasting record, has dimmed employment prospects for the people who earn their living analyzing it. And, except for the academic branch, economists are sharing the worries of other Americans, from the assembly line to the executive suite, about whether they will be victims of downsizing. They recall the corporate casualties of the mid-1980's, when in some cases entire departments were eliminated. 
 "Business economists are plagued with a new round of anxiety about the standing of our profession and, to be frank about it, new concerns about job security," Richard D. Rippe, president of the National Association of Business Economists and a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds, told the annual meeting here.
Unlike many conventions, the association's gathering saw only a minor amount of overt job-searching among the 400 members who attended, 100 fewer than at last year's meeting in always-popular Washington.
Here, they padded about the lush Biltmore Hotel on Pershing Square, birthplace of the Oscar and site of numerous movies and television series, but the talk in the corridors was of casualties at such employers as the First National Bank of Chicago, General Motors and First Interstate Bancorp. The economists also did a lot of talking about how to make themselves more clearly relevant to their employers' bottom lines.
"It's a bad time to look," lamented Richard Nelson, a former professor who is about to leave his post as chief economist at the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco. "There are clearly fewer jobs for economists than there used to be."
One member sent a $475 company check in July to register for the convention, but he had to change his plans when his department was wiped out in a cutback.
Only 22 job openingsappear in the association's latest quarterly posting, fewer than half the number at the 1989 peak. About half of the recent listings had an international element. Only a few mentioned compensation; except for one six-figure salary, the average was below $50,000.
Of those seeking jobs, David Williams Jr., an association staff aide, said, "I'd say 75 percent are on the street; the other 25 percent know they're going to be on the street sooner or later."
Bank economists, in particular, are honing their skills to address specific practical topics, like a particular industry or geographic area. In many cases they have become tactical advisers to their organization's securities traders. The idea is to demonstrate to management that they can contribute directly to profits.
 
Offering Advice
 James Annable, a senior vice president of the First National Bank of Chicago, said that during the 1980's his department was among the first to argue that Rust Belt industry would revive, not disappear, and that the bank should dispose of bad loans made to less developed countries.
"We're the people who recommended dumping our L.D.C. debt early, saving us hundreds of millions of dollars," Mr. Annable said. Even so, he lost two of his staff last week, part of a bank-wide reduction of 1,000 positions resulting from market pressure to become more efficient.
Jerry L. Jordan, senior vice president and chief economist at First Interstate, which has had heavy losses in real estate, said he now gives most of his attention to certain industries and to international issues, spending only 10 percent of his time on the traditional macroeconomic, or big-picture, analysis.
"What we had to learn to do is spend more time framing the questions people ask us and stop dreaming up our own questions," Mr. Jordan said, adding that he now advised young economists to learn finance, accounting and computers.
 
Revising Their View

Others see themselves as internal consultants with a single client, top management. They seek to "add value," as economists put it, by helping strategic planners or by analyzing the effect of possible economic shocks.
To be sure, some of the problems of the fraternity, including what Mr. Rippe called doubts about the economists' standing in the eyes of superiors and a loss of self-esteem, arose from flawed analyses that were offered. In some cases, particularly those involving elaborate computer simulations of the economy, members promised far too much.
Mr. Rippe found that while the association's panel of forecasters had done an adequate job during the 1980's predicting gross national product and inflation, the record was poor regarding interest rates, on which far more money rides.
He cited one study of 19 periods in which the economists got the direction of Treasury bond rates wrong 14 times and the direction of bill rates wrong 11 times. Predictions of corporate earnings were similarly deficient.
 
Picking Convention Sites
 A certain degree of humility about the limits of forecasting has also crept into the association's planning for future conventions. This gathering, which involved a long trip for most members at a time of financial pinch, was planned 10 years ago. Now the sites are picked only three years ahead, with Dallas and Chicago scheduled to be followed by Philadelphia, in 1994.
But painful as the squeeze has been for many, economists do not seem inclined to view their situation as terminal. This reflects not only a conviction that they still have a role to play -- in many cases as part of a line operation -- but also a respect for the laws of economics and the intricate way the market system, in which they are all believers, allocates society's resources.
"There's no sympathy," commented Stuart G. Hoffman, the chief economist for the PNC Financial Corporation in Pittsburgh. "It's the market working -- for you or agin you."

HEADLINE: Bond Rates Drop as Fed Move Is Seen

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Long-term interest rates fell to their lowest level since March 1987 yesterday on speculation that the Federal Reserve Board and the Bush Administration were formulating a plan to jump-start a very sluggish economy.
Based on the day's developments, credit market analysts and traders seem to see a plan that includes lower interest rates, a cut in military spending and a cut in taxes. 
 The speculation, which began on Thursday, was prompted by a meeting Mr. Bush held at the White House yesterday with key economic advisers. The meeting came only days before the Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee is scheduled to meet and at a time when the recovery that has been widely heralded by Administration officials appears to be losing steam.
Prices of Treasury securities were moving higher before the meeting was convened yesterday, and the rally gathered strength as the session progressed.
Early news reports on the meeting suggested strongly to traders that the Bush Administration expects the Fed to provide more stimulus to the economy through an easier monetary policy.
"Bush clearly expects the Fed to do more to help the economy," said James R. Capra, a principal at Moore Capital Management, a money management firm in New York. "With the Fed's Open Market Committee meeting on Tuesday, the market is of a mind to think that the Fed is going to ease."
Those thoughts were given additional credence after a Market News Service report on the meeting moved across trading screens. Mr. Bush, the story said, made it clear to Mr. Greenspan that he expected greater efforts to stimulate growth.
A sense in the market that some sort of fiscal stimulus might accompany an easier monetary policy appeared after it was announced that Mr. Bush would be making a televised address on military policy at 8 o'clock last night.
"If the rally we saw were solely on the thought that the Fed is going to ease, bonds wouldn't have moved so much," said Raymond W. Stone, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J., firm that provides research and commentary on developments in the foreign exchange and fixed income markets.
"Thoughts of cuts in defense spending could well have been another reason why bond yields fell. The Fed should be delighted that this is not just a rally in short-term rates."
By late yesterday, the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 103 17/32, up 23/32, to yield 7.81 percent, compared with 7.87 percent late Thursday.
According to analysts at Ramirez Capital Consultants Inc., it is the lowest rate on the benchmark issue since March 31, 1987, when yields on the bond also stood at 7.81 percent. Four years ago, however, bond yields were in the process of moving higher.
In the secondary Treasury note market, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 102 23/32 late yesterday, up 13/32, to yield 7.47 percent.
And prices of the new two-year and five-year notes auctioned earlier this week also improved.
The 7 percent five-year notes were offered on a when-issued basis late yesterday at a price to yield 6.94 percent. And the 6 1/8 percent two-year notes were offered at a price to yield 6.00 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were unchanged to down slightly.
Late in the day three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.12 percent, unchanged from late Thursday. But six-month bill rates fell by three basis points, or three one-hundreths of a percentage point, to a late offered rate of 5.14 percent.
Issuance of new investment-grade corporate debt continued yesterday, although at a less hectic pace than earlier in the week.
Among the new issues priced yesterday was a $200 million offering of three-year notes by the Commercial Credit Corporation.
The 6.95 percent notes, which mature Oct. 1, 1994, were priced at $99.932, to yield 6.975 percent, 70 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 6 7/8 percent three-year notes at the time of pricing.
Morgan Stanley & Company acted as lead manager for the underwriting. The securities, which are noncallable for life, are rated A-2 by Moody's Investors Service and A by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.

A Revamping At Control Data

 BODY:
The Control Data Corporation said yesterday that it would create "separate legal entities" for its three primary businesses: information services, government systems and computer products.
The announcement lifted Control Data stock, which closed on the New York Stock Exchange at $9.875, up $1.25. About 1.6 million shares were traded. 
 No timetable was given for the restructuring. Lawrence Perlman, president of the Minneapolis-based company, which had 1991 revenue of $2.9 billion, said Control Data had been put on a sound financial footing in the last two years. He added. "The company must be reshaped to enable each business to gain access to capital and to increase its flexibility in forging strategic relationships that can broaden customer and technology bases."
Control Data earned $3 million, on revenue of $1.69 billion, in 1990. Revenue in the second quarter of this year fell 8.5 percent, to $371.3 million, and earnings fell 47 percent, to $5.9 million. The company said the decline stemmed from the weak economy and lower demand for computer products.
Rick J. Martin, an analyst for Prudential-Bache Research, said the announcement was probably intended to send a message to Wall Street that Control Data was more than a mainframe computer maker.
Its computer operation generates 40 to 45 percent of revenue, Mr. Martin said, but only 25 percent of its profits. Military systems generate roughly 20 percent of revenue, but only 5 percent of profits. Information services account for 35 to 40 percent of revenue but 65 to 70 percent of profits.

HEADLINE: Your Money;
A Longer Life, And Saving for It

BYLINE: By Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
Americans are on a collision course with economic reality, living longer, retiring earlier and saving less than they did a generation ago. At the same time corporations are shifting their focus away from traditional employer-paid plans that provide defined benefits to defined contribution plans, like 401(k) plans, that require employees to defer a portion of their compensation for retirement and often to decide how to invest that money.
"The days of paternalism are over," said Joel S. Isaacson, director of financial planning at Clarfeld & Company in New York. "The burden of meeting any retirement objective falls on the employee." 
 But the great majority of Americans have failed to realize this. Merrill Lynch & Company, in a recent survey of people aged 45 to 64, found that 80 percent felt they would be well prepared for retirement, and that 59 percent expected to rely primarily on Social Security or employer-provided pension benefits.
According to the Treasury Department, however, among people older than 65 with annual incomes greater than $20,000, Social Security now provides only 20 percent of their income and pensions only 15 percent, while personal savings and investment provide 39 percent. Some continue working because they cannot afford to retire.
Commenting on the gap between expectations and reality, John L. Steffans, executive vice president, Merrill Lynch private client group, said, "Beginning early in the next century, America may face widespread indigence, or poverty, among the elderly, on a scale previously unseen in the United States," unless personal savings are dramatically increased from the present annual rate of 3.7 percent.
Avery E. Neumark, partner in charge of pension and benefits planning for Weber, Lipshie & Company in New York, said he advised clients to put away 10 percent for retirement savings on a personal basis, regardless of any employer-provided benefits, beginning with a tax-deferred 401(k) plan if one is available.
"Expect the unexpected -- sickness, disability, problems with a pension plan," he said. "The employee has to do it himself, and it requires a lot of self-discipline."
Merrill Lynch calculated different annual savings needs for different age groups to provide a retirement income of 60 percent of present level income. Based on average household income of $40,000 in 1990, 7 percent interest on savings, 4 percent annual salary growth and life expectancy of 78 years, the firm said the following amounts would be needed: age 35, $1,542; age 40, $2,089; age 45, $2,942; age 50, $4,108, and age 55, $6,387.
But those figures may be conservative. Inflation could exceed 4 percent, needs could be greater than 60 percent, and many people live beyond 78. Indeed, Mr. Steffans noted that "women who reach age 65 this year will live to an average age of 89, men to age 83." In the 1950's, people typically lived only a few years beyond their retirement age of 65. "The more you build up, the better you sleep at night," Mr. Isaacson said, adding: "You have to give very strong thoughts to investing the money. You shouldn't be passive and leave it in money-market or fixed-income funds." He recommended stock funds for long-term growth.
David M. Blitzer, chief economist for the Standard & Poor's Corporation, which is publishing a new newsletter called Your Financial Future for companies to send to employees with their quarterly 401(k) statements, said many people "are conservative to a fault." Because their "dominant concern is safety," they have placed the bulk of their 401(k) money in guaranteed investment contracts. But some people are growing concerned about the safety of some of these investments, which are guaranteed by insurance companies. In any event, Mr. Blitzer noted, historic studies have shown that over time equities have provided a far greater return.
"For the generation now retiring, housing provided a huge portion of retirement savings," he said. People who bought a house in the 1950's could sell it, buy a smaller house or apartment and have a tidy nest egg to live on. But real estate is no longer appreciating as it did, he noted.
Richard Pallan, senior managing director and chief of defined contribution plan services for the Putnam Companies in Boston, suggested money in 401(k), I.R.A. and other retirement accounts be divided into three groups: growth, or small-capitalization stocks; conservative growth, typified by the S.& P. 500 stock index, and conservative income, as characterized by bond funds.
He would allocate these amounts: for people in their mid-20's to mid-30's -- 60 percent growth, 30 percent conservative growth and 10 percent conservative income; in their late 30's to late 40's -- 50 percent, 40 percent and 10 percent; early 50's to early 60's -- 30 percent, 30 percent and 40 percent, and retired -- 15 percent, 25 percent and 60 percent.
The goal, he said, is to "maximize the end value of your investments so you have maximum flexibility" in retirement.

HEADLINE: BUSH WANTS A RISE IN BANKS' LENDING

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 27

 BODY:
At his second meeting in three days with his economic advisers, President Bush today asked banking regulators to review their procedures to make sure they were not inhibiting banks from making loans, White House officials said.
The President and his advisers are clearly concerned about the slow pace of the economy almost a year before the Presidential election. But because of the large budget deficit, expected to be well over $300 billion in the next fiscal year, they do not have the leeway to cut taxes or increase spending, the usual steps for an Administration facing a sour economy in an election year.
 
Pressing a Point
 That is one reason they are focusing on bank regulations, and today they called two of the nation's top bank regulators to an otherwise routine meeting of the President's Economic Policy Council. The regulators were Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and William Taylor, who has been nominated to be chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
 On Wall Street, long-term interest rates fell today to their lowest level in four and a half years because of speculation that the Bush Administration and the Federal Reserve were working on a plan to stimulate the economy.
But officials who attended today's White House meeting said no bold new initiatives were under discussion. They also said that this was not an occasion to press Mr. Greenspan to lower interest rates further. The Federal Reserve has been lowering interest rates steadily since the middle of 1989.
Officials said Mr. Bush wanted to hear from the regulators and to encourage them to weed out unnecessarily stringent practices that might be preventing banks from lending to qualified borrowers. Fewer bank loans mean slower growth in the money supply and thus a weaker economy.
"People are still having trouble getting money, especially small businesses," Marlin Fitzwater, the President's spokesman, told reporters. "We want to make sure that examiners are aware of this problem and that steps are being taken by the banking industry to see that indeed they are not being overly restrictive on their loans."
Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher said in an interview after the meeting that he had argued forcefully that the economy was being dragged down by what he called a "credit crunch."
"We want to make sure we're doing everything we can to be helpful," Mr. Mosbacher said. "It's not a minor problem. It's very serious. Small businesses can't get loans.
 
Offering an Example
 Mr. Mosbacher told the group of a Rhode Island consulting firm, Aquidneck Management Associates Ltd., that was being forced out of business by credit restrictions set by the F.D.I.C.
Mr. Greenspan and other economists in and out of the Government say that unreasonably strict behavior by bank examiners may be one reason that lending is so restrained, but that it is not the main reason.
More important factors, they say, are that the demand for loans is still down because businesses are not expanding, that banks with many bad loans on their books are gun-shy about new lending and that many banks are working to improve their ratio of capital to liabilities.
Late last month, the Fed reported that its quarterly survey of financial officers at large banks showed that they expected their lending to rise only modestly if at all for the rest of the year.
In the spring, when the Administration was jawboning about tight credit, officials urged bank regulators to use new accounting procedures that would let banks write off portions of bad loans and not the entire loan. But opposition from the General Accounting Office and the Securities and Exchange Commission kept the new procedures from being put in place.
 
A Nominee to the Fed
 The President also today formally nominated Susan M. Phillips, a former chairwoman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and now an administrator at the University of Iowa, to a vacant seat on the Federal Reserve Board.
The President's intention to pick Ms. Phillips was an open secret and was widely reported last spring. She would replace Martha R. Seger, who resigned in March. Ms. Phillips's views on monetary policy are not pulbicly known.
Another Bush nominee for the board, Lawrence B. Lindsey, a White House economist and former professor at Harvard, is encountering difficulty in winning Senate confirmation.
Senator Terry Sanford, a North Carolina Democrat, is leading the opposition. The Senator contends in public that Mr. Lindsey is not really from the Richmond district that he was nominated to represent, but the more likely reason for the opposition is Mr. Lindsey's conservative views.
 
Optimism From Greenspan
 The consensus of the officials at the Economic Policy Council meetings Wednesday and today is that the economy bottomed out in the late spring or early summer and will grow at an annual rate of 2.5 percent to 3 percent in the last half of the year.
Mr. Greenspan is said to have told the group that he was encouraged about economic prospects for the rest of the year because inventories were low and consumption was now greater than production. That means production should increase in the months ahead and give stimulus to the economy.
"But everyone is concerned about the strength and durability of the recovery, and everybody thinks it should be doing better," one senior official said.
The Economic Policy Council is headed by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. Other members include Commerce Secretary Mosbacher; Richard G. Darman, the budget director, and Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.

The Economy
President Bush asked banking regulators to make sure they were not inhibiting banks from lending. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and William Taylor, who has been nominated to head the F.D.I.C., met with the President and his economic advisers, who are clearly concerned about the economy's slow pace barely a year before the Presidential election. [Page 1.] 
 Incomes grew four-tenths of 1 percent in August, but consumers increased their spending by only one-tenth of 1 percent. [36.]
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady proposed giving the Administration greater control over the quasi-independent agency that manages the rescue of the savings and loan bailout. He conceded that fundamental changes are needed before Congress will vote more money to pay for the highly unpopular effort. [35.]
The nation's economists are deeply troubled by the recession, which they failed to predict and now declare is over. The weak economy, combined with a wave of mergers in the banking industry and a mixed forecasting record, has dimmed employment prospects for people who earn their living analyzing it. [35.]
Companies eager to keep organized labor out of their work sites are increasingly cutting short organizing drives by dismissing campaign leaders, and even entire staffs, labor experts say. [21.]
 
 Markets
Long-term interest rates fell to their lowest level since March 1987 on speculation that the Fed and the Bush Administration were planning to jump-start a very sluggish economy by lowering interest rates and cutting military spending and taxes. [35.]
Stocks slipped for the day and for the week, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 11.18 points, to close at 3,006.04, in a day with eight program trades. For the week it was down 13.19. [38.]
The dollar fell, reflecting continued pessimism about falling interest rates following the meeting between President Bush and Mr. Greenspan. Gold prices also closed lower. [43.] Coffee prices plunged on forecasts for more rain in the previously dry growing regions of Brazil and on growers' failure to reduce the glut. [43.]
 
 Companies
First American Bank officers and directors told hostile lawmakers that they were unaware until earlier this year that B.C.C.I. owned the institution. [35.]
Citicorp Mortgage is being reorganized to cut costs and tie its operations more closely to the branch networks of Citibank. It is one of the nation's largest home-mortgage lenders. [37.]
Community Psychiatric Centers saw its earnings shrink to 1 cent a share, surprising analysts, who had expected 40 cents. The company's stock plunged 27 percent to $17.25, making it the largest percentage loser on the New York Stock Exchange. [37.]
G.M. killed 20,000 animals in automobile safety tests in the last decade, The Detroit News reported. A group called People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals urged a boycott of G.M. [26.]
A shopping mall anchored by Macy's and Nordstrom's was opened in Menlo Park, N.J. The 1.3-million-square-foot mall was the third mega-mall within a few square miles. [21.]
A jury awarded a Texaco employee $6 million in damages. She said she was rejected for management jobs because of sex discrimination. The award is subject to judicial review. [25.]
 
 Today's Columns
Americans are living longer, retiring earlier and saving less than they did a generation ago, and employers are providing less in the way of traditional pensions. Financial experts warn that indigence lies ahead unless people save more. Your Money. [36.]
The elements for a robotic ant were patented by a professor of electrical engineering at Boston University. The six-legged machine is small enough to handle individual cells under a microscope or, possibly, to serve as a miniature spy. Patents. [36.]

HEADLINE: BUSH'S ARMS PLAN;
Arms Plan Hailed in Congress But Some Call for More Cuts

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 27

 BODY:
Senators and arms control experts mostly praised President Bush's proposals this evening for eliminating short-range nuclear weapons, calling bombers off alert and asking for new talks with the Soviet Union on long-range weapons.
But leading Democrats faulted the President for not placing enough emphasis on the nation's economic troubles, while disarmament advocates said the plan did not go far enough. 
 Senator Bob Dole, the Kansas Republican who is the Minority Leader, said that the plan seized the initiative and showed that the United States was providing "strong, sensible leadership for the world."
 
'The Nuclear Abyss'
 Senator George J. Mitchell, Democrat of Maine, the Majority Leader, welcomed the move as a way to reduce stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction, shrink the risk of conflict and move the nation, "away from the nuclear abyss."
But in an official Democratic response, following the President's nationally televised address, Mr. Mitchell also struck a partisan note. "We're pleased that the President has accepted the view we've been urging for years," he said, reiterating the Democratic call for more attention to economic growth in the United States.
"To maintain our status as the world's superpower, to retain our military strength, to compete in the international economy, to provide a better life for all Americans, those now living and those yet to come -- if we're to do all these things, we must have a strong and growing economy," he said.
Senator Joseph R. Biden, the Delaware Democrat, welcomed the President's initiative to remove tactical nuclear weapons from Europe and from ships at sea but asserted that it does not go nearly far enough.
 
The Obvious and the Dubious
 "What disappoints me is that he continues to support strategic weapons like the B-2 and Star Wars for which there is no compelling case," Mr. Biden said, refering to a new strategic bomber and defenses against ballistic missile attacks on the United States.
"Nor did he propose a plan for the radical cuts in strategic arms that are now warranted and for which Gorbachev and Yeltsin have called," Mr. Biden said. "In short, he conceded the obvious but defended the dubious."
Senator Al Gore, Democrat of Tennessee, said, "The President has responded to the need for real innovations in the new international landscape forever altered and changing still because of the coup in the former Soviet Union."
Jack Mendelsohn, the deputy director of the Arms Control Association, a Washington-based research group, said that the proposal to eliminate multiple warheads only for land-based missiles is heavily weighted in favor of the United States. The United States has a much higher proportion of its multiple-warhead missiles aboard submarines than the Soviet Union.
Mr. Mendelsohn predicted that this offer would be quickly dismissed by the Soviet authorities.

HEADLINE: BUSH'S ARMS PLAN;
Remarks by President Bush on Reducing U.S. and Soviet Nuclear Weapons

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 27

 BODY:
Following is the text of remarks by the President in an address to the nation tonight, as recorded by The New York Times:
Good evening. Tonight I'd like to speak with you about our future, and the future of the generations to come. 
 The world has changed at a fantastic pace with each day writing a fresh page of history before yesterday's ink has even dried. And most recently, we've seen the peoples of the Soviet Union turn to democracy and freedom, and discard a system of government based on oppression and fear.
Like the East Europeans before them, they face the daunting challenge of building fresh political structures, based on human rights, democratic principles, and market economies. Their task is far from easy, and far from over. They will need our help. And they will get it.
But these dramatic changes challenge our Nation as well. Our country has always stood for freedom and democracy. And when the newly elected leaders of Eastern Europe grappled with forming their new governments, they looked to the United States. They looked to American democratic principles in building their own free societies. Even the leaders of the U.S.S.R. republics are reading The Federalist Papers, written by America's founders, to find new ideas and inspiration.
Today, America must lead again -- as it always has, as only it can. And we will. We must also provide the inspiration for lasting peace. And we will do that, too. We can now take steps in response to these dramatic developments -- steps that can help the Soviet peoples in their quest for peace and prosperity. More importantly, we can now take steps to make the world a less dangerous place than ever before in the nuclear age.
A year ago, I described a new strategy for American defenses, reflecting the world's changing security environment. That strategy shifted our focus away from the fear that preoccupied us for 40 years -- the prospect of a global confrontation. Instead, it concentrated more on regional conflicts, such as the one we just faced in the Persian Gulf.
 
A Smaller Military
 I spelled out a strategic concept, guided by the need to maintain the forces required to exercise forward presence in key areas, to respond effectively in crises, to maintain a credible nuclear deterrent, and to retain the national capacity to rebuild our forces, should that be needed.
We are now moving to reshape the U.S. military to reflect that concept. The new Base Force will be smaller by half a million than today's military -- with fewer Army divisions, Air Force wings, Navy ships, and strategic nuclear forces. This new force will be versatile, able to respond around the world to challenges -- old and new.
As I just mentioned, the changes that allowed us to adjust our security strategy a year ago have greatly accelerated. The prospect of a Soviet invasion into Western Europe, launched with little or no warning, is no longer a realistic threat. The Warsaw Pact has crumbled. In the Soviet Union, the advocates of democracy triumphed over a coup that would have restored the old system of repression. The reformers are now starting to fashion their own futures, moving even faster toward democracy's horizon.
New leaders in the Kremlin and the republics are now questioning the need for their huge nuclear arsenal. The Soviet nuclear stockpile now seems less an instrument of national security, and more of a burden. As a result, we now have an unparalleled opportunity to change the nuclear posture of both the United States and the Soviet Union.
If we and the Soviet leaders take the right steps -- some on our own, some on their own, some together -- we can dramatically shrink the arsenal of the world's nuclear weapons. We can more effectively discourage the spread of nuclear weapons. We can rely more on defensive measures in our strategic relationship. We can enhance stability, and actually reduce the risk of nuclear war. Now is the time to seize this opportunity.
After careful study and consultations with my senior advisors, and after considering valuable counsel from Prime Minister Major, President Mitterrand, Chancellor Kohl and other allied leaders, I am announcing today a series of sweeping initiatives affecting every aspect of our nuclear forces -- on land, on ships, and on aircraft. I met again today with our Joint Chiefs of Staff, and I can tell you they wholeheartedly endorse each of these steps.
I'll begin with the category in which we will make the most fundamental change in nuclear forces in over 40 years -- non-strategic or theater weapons.
Last year, I canceled U.S. plans to modernize our ground-launched theater nuclear weapons. Later, our NATO allies joined us in announcing that the alliance would propose the mutual elimination of all nuclear artillery shells from Europe, as soon as short-range nuclear force negotiations began with the Soviets. But starting these talks now would only perpetuate these systems, while we engage in lengthy negotiations. Last month's events not only permit, but indeed demand swifter, bolder action.
I'm therefore directing that the United States eliminate its entire worldwide inventory of ground-launched short-range, that is, theater nuclear weapons. We will bring home and destroy all of our nuclear artillery shells and short-range ballistic missile warheads. We will, of course, insure that we preserve an effective air-delivered nuclear capability in Europe. That's essential to NATO's security.
In turn, I have asked the Soviets to go down this road with us -- to destroy their entire inventory of ground-launched theater nuclear weapons: not only their nuclear artillery, and nuclear warheads for short-range ballistic missiles, but also the theater systems the U.S. no longer has -- systems like nuclear warheads for air-defense missiles, and nuclear land mines.
 
Recall for Tactical Nuclear Arms
 Recognizing further the major changes in the international military landscape, the United States will withdraw all tactical nuclear weapons from its surface ships and attack submarines, as well as those nuclear weapons associated with our land-based naval aircraft. This means removing all nuclear Tomahawk cruise missiles from U.S. ships and submarines, as well as nuclear bombs aboard aircraft carriers. The bottom line is that under normal circumstances, our ships will not carry tactical nuclear weapons.
Many of these land and sea-based warheads will be dismantled and destroyed. Those remaining will be secured in central areas where they would be available if necessary in a future crisis.
Again, there is every reason for the Soviet Union to match our actions -- by removing all tactical nuclear weapons from its ships and attack submarines; by withdrawing nuclear weapons for land-based naval aircraft, and by destroying many of them and consolidating what remains at central locations. I urge them to do so.
 
Treaty as a Springboard
 No category of nuclear weapons has received more attention than those in our strategic arsenals. The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start), which President Gorbachev and I signed last July, was the culmination of almost a decade's work. It calls for substantial stabilizing reductions and effective verification. Prompt ratification by both parties is essential.
But I also believe the time is right to use Start as a springboard to achieve additional stabilizing changes.
First, to further reduce tensions, I am directing that all United States strategic bombers immediately stand down from their alert posture. As a comparable gesture, I call upon the Soviet Union to confine its mobile missiles to their garrisons, where they will be safer and more secure.
Second, the U.S. will immediately stand down from alert all intercontinental ballistic missiles scheduled for deactivation under START. Rather than waiting for the treaty's reduction plan to run its full seven year course, we will accelerate elimination of these systems, once START is ratified. And I call upon the Soviet Union to do the same.
Third, I am terminating the development of the mobile Peacekeeper I.C.B.M. as well as the mobile portions of the small I.C.B.M. program. The small single-warhead I.C.B.M. will be our only remaining I.C.B.M. modernization program. And I call upon the Soviets to terminate any and all programs for future I.C.B.M.s with more than one warhead, and to limit I.C.B.M. modernization to one type of single warhead missile, just as we have done.
And fourth, I am canceling the current program to build a replacement for the nuclear short-range attack missile for our strategic bombers.
And fifth, as a result of the strategic nuclear weapons adjustments that I've just outlined, the United States will streamline its command and control procedures, allowing us to more effectively manage our strategic nuclear forces.
 
More Direct Command Structure
 As the system works now, the Navy commands the submarine part of our strategic deterrent, while the Air Force commands the bomber and land-based elements. But as we reduce our strategic forces, the operational command structure must be as direct as possible. And I have therefore approved the recommendation of Secretary Cheney and the Joint Chiefs to consolidate operational command of these forces into a U.S. Strategic Command, under one commander, with participation from both services.
Since the 1970's, the most vulnerable and unstable part of the U.S. and Soviet nuclear forces has been intercontinental missiles with more than one warhead. Both sides have these I.C.B.M.s in fixed silos in the ground where they are more vulnerable than missiles on submarines.
I propose that the U.S. and the Soviet Union seek early agreement to eliminate from their inventories all I.C.B.M.'s with multiple warheads. After developing a timetable acceptable to both sides, we could rapidly move to modify or eliminate these systems under procedures already established in the Start agreement. In short, such an action would take away the single most unstable part of our nuclear arsenals.
But there is more to do. The United States and the Soviet Union are not the only nations with ballistic missiles. Some 15 nations have them now, and in less than a decade, that number could grow to 20. The recent conflict in the Persian Gulf demonstrates in no uncertain terms that the time has come for strong action on this growing threat to world peace.
Accordingly, I am calling on the Soviet leadership to join us in taking immediate concrete steps to permit the limited deployment of non-nuclear defenses to protect against limited ballistic missile strikes -- whatever their source -- without undermining the credibility of existing deterrent forces. And we will intensify our effort to curb nuclear and missile proliferation. These two efforts will be mutually reinforcing. To foster cooperation, the United States soon will propose additional initiatives in the area of ballistic missile early warning.
 
Talks With Russians Sought
 And finally, let me discuss yet another opportunity for cooperation that can make our world safer.
During last month's attempted coup in Moscow, many Americans asked me if I thought Soviet nuclear weapons were under adequate control. I do not believe that America was at increased risk of nuclear attack during those tense days. But I do believe more can be done to insure the safe handling and dismantling of Soviet nuclear weapons. And therefore, I propose that we begin discussions with the Soviet Union to explore cooperation in three areas.
First, we should explore joint technical cooperation on the safe and environmentally responsible storage, transportation, dismantling, and destruction of nuclear warheads. Second, we should discuss existing arrangements for the physical security and safety of nuclear weapons and how these might be enhanced. And third, we should discuss nuclear command and control arrangements, and how these might be improved to provide more protection against the unauthorized or accidental use of nuclear weapons.
My friend, French President Mitterrand, offered a similar idea a short while ago. After further consultations with the alliance, and when the leadership in the U.S.S.R. is ready, we will begin this effort.
The initiatives that I'm announcing build on the new defense strategy that I set out a year ago -- one that shifted our focus away from the prospect of global confrontation. We're consulting with our allies on the implementation of many of these steps which fit well with the new post cold war strategy and force posture that we've developed in NATO.
As we implement these initiatives we will closely watch how the new Soviet leadership responds. We expect our bold initiatives to meet with equally bold steps on the Soviet side. If this happens, further cooperation is inevitable. If it does not, then an historic opportunity will have been lost. Regardless, let no one doubt we will still retain the necessary strength to protect our security and that of our allies, and to respond as necessary.
 
Honoring Commitments
 In addition, regional instabilities, the spread of weapons of mass destruction, and as we saw during the conflict in the Gulf, territorial ambitions of power-hungry tyrants, still require us to maintain a strong military to protect our national interests, and to honor commitments to our allies.
And therefore, we must implement a coherent plan for a significantly smaller but fully capable military, one that enhances stability but is still sufficient to convince any potential adversary that the cost of aggression would exceed any possible gain.
We can safely afford to take the steps I've announced today, steps that are designed to reduce the dangers of miscalculation in a crisis. But to do so, we must also pursue vigorously those elements of our strategic modernization program that serve the same purpose. We must fully fund the B-2 and S.D.I. program. We can make radical changes in the nuclear postures of both sides to make them smaller, safer and more stable. But the United States must maintain modern nuclear forces including the strategic triad and thus insure the credibility of our deterrent.
Some will say that these initiatives call for a budget windfall for domestic programs. But the peace dividend I seek is not measured in dollars but in greater security. In the near term, some of these steps may even cost money. Given the ambitious plan I have already proposed to reduce U.S. defense spending by 25 percent, we cannot afford to make any unwise or unwarranted cuts in the defense budget that I have submitted to Congress. I'm counting on congressional support to ensure we have the funds necessary to restructure our forces prudently and implement the decisions that I've outlined tonight.
Twenty years ago when -- when I had the opportunity to serve this country as Ambassador to the United Nations, I once talked about the vision that was in the minds of the U.N.'s founders -- how they dreamed of a new age when the great powers of the world would cooperate in peace as they had as allies in war.
 
Positive Soviet Response Seen
 Today I consulted with President Gorbachev. And while he hasn't had time to absorb the details, I believe the Soviet response will clearly be positive. I also spoke with President Yeltsin and he had a similar reaction -- positive -- hopeful.
And now, the Soviet people and their leaders can shed the heavy burden of a dangerous and costly nuclear arsenal which has threatened world peace for the past five decades. They can join us in these dramatic moves toward a new world of peace and security.
Tonight, as I see the drama of democracy unfolding around the globe, perhaps -- perhaps we are closer to that new world than ever before. The future is ours to influence, to shape, to mold. And while we must not gamble that future, neither can we forfeit the historic opportunity now before us.
It has been said, "Destiny is -- is not a matter of chance, it is a matter of choice; it is not a thing to be waited for, it's a thing to be achieved." The United States has always stood where duty required us to stand. And now let them say, that we led where destiny required us to lead -- to a more peaceful, hopeful future. We cannot give a more precious gift to the children of the world.
Thank you, good night, and God bless the United States of America.

HEADLINE: Soviets Voice Doubt Mideast Talks Will Get Under Way on Schedule

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Sept. 27

 BODY:
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said today that there were "some doubts" that a proposed peace conference between Israel and its Arab neighbors would be convened before the end of October, the goal set by American and Soviet officials when they announced plans for the talks in July.
Mr. Gorbachev, who spoke at a news conference following talks here today with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, did not say what had raised the doubts. But he said he remained hopeful that the peace talks would start next month as planned. 
 "We and the U.S. as co-chairmen are acting on the basis of the time-frame agreed," he said. "I think this process is so essential, and we have come so close to it, that all sides understand their responsiblity and are taking steps."
 
Palestinians Meeting in Algiers
 Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon have all agreed to come to the proposed peace conference. Israel has conditioned its attendance on a demand that the proposed Jordanian-Palestinian delegation not include Palestinians from East Jerusalem, stateless Palestinians or members of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
For their part, the top Palestinian leadership is now gathered in Algiers to decide whether or under what circumstances to send a delegation to the talks.
During his one-day visit to Moscow, Mr. Mubarak met for 90 minutes inside the Kremlin with Mr. Gorbachev and had a 15-minute telephone conversation with Boris N. Yeltsin, the president of the Russian republic. Mr. Yeltsin is on vacation at a Black Sea resort.
President Mubarak told Mr. Gorbachev that he was counting on Moscow to play a strong role at the proposed peace conference, Egyptian officials said later.
Mr. Mubarak also expressed support for Mr. Gorbachev and his policy of democratic and economic change.
 
Egypt Backing Gorbachev
 Egypt, the Arab world's most populous nation and a close ally of the United States, has become one of Mr. Gorbachev's firmest supporters in the Middle East. Mr. Mubarak has asked the wealthy Persian Gulf Arab states to consider economic and political support for the Soviet Government.
Egyptian officials say the Soviet Union provides an important symbolic and practical balance to Washington, which is closely tied to Israeli policy. Among other things, Moscow has consistently spoken out on behalf of the Palestinians.
Moscow has sharply cut back its support of Arab governments, including Syria and Libya, which for years depended on them for arms and aid. At the same time, Moscow has moved closer to Israel, agreeing to establish full diplomatic relations.

HEADLINE: Here in the Suburbs, Malls (Like Hope) Spring Eternal

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MENLO PARK, N.J., Sept. 27

 BODY:
Here in suburbia, where malls are Broadway, Main Street and the town common all rolled into one, the opening of a 1.3-million-square-foot shop-'till-you-drop paradise today was a major municipal event.
Never mind that the Menlo Park Mall is the third mega-mall within a few square miles or that there is a recession going on. The 30-minute ceremony this morning had all the pomp and circumstance once reserved for mayoral portrait unveilings and city hall cornerstone layings and other community events that people tell their grandchildren about. There were perky singers up on a stage, front row seats filled with V.I.P.'s in pin-stripe suits and speeches by elected officials, including Gov. Jim Florio. 
 He said he liked the mall because it was bringing 170 stores and 4,000 jobs into an area that already had two malls within half an hour's drive of each other. About 85 percent of the space has been rented -- a cause for a good deal of executive back-patting in a recession that has left other New Jersey shopping complexes struggling.
"Sure, the fact that we're in a recession is a concern," said Jeremiah W. O'Connor Sr., the chairman of the O'Connor Group, which runs the mall, "but we're not looking at whether it will turn in '91 or '92 because we'll be here in 2001 and 2002. Recessions come and go. These things you build for 20 to 30 years."
What put Menlo Park on the map the first time was the electric light bulb. Thomas A. Edison invented it in a laboratory here. What put Menlo Park and all of Edison Township on the map in the 1980's was a real-estate boom that turned communities like these from remote suburbs into a new kind of American downtown.
Some real-estate people talk about location, location, location. To mall owners like Mr. O'Connor, the make-or-break factor is anchors, anchors, anchors: the big stores that retailers count on to serve as magnets for customers. "We've got Macy's and Nordstrom's," Mr. O'Connor said. "We're down the road from Penney's, Steinbeck's, Fortunoff, Sterns, A.&S. They just don't have the same power in anchors."
Mr. O'Connor said that when he bought the mall in 1988: "We saw a property that had a 3.5 percent share of the market. We said it ought to be four times that. We we said to Nordstrom's, 'What do you think?' and here we are."
Whether its anchors can carry the mall in a depressed, saturated market is an open question. "The issues in a state that has no growth are, will Nordstrom's have pulling power, and whose teeth are they going to pull?" said George Sternlieb, a professor emeritus of urban studies at Rutgers University. "This is a zero-sum game."
And it is an increasingly competitive game. The International Council of Shopping Centers reported earlier in the year that 68 shopping centers with 5.2 million square feet of space were started in New Jersey in 1987 and 55 with 3.2 million square feet in 1990.
 
Greeters Like Beauty Queens
 Even so, a mall ribbon-cutting was a not-to-be-missed experience for the crowd that arrived an hour before the stores opened for the first time.
Alan Borack of Fords, N.J., took the day off to attend, "and I don't particularly like malls." Kathy Scutro of Garwood, N.J., said she was going in late.
There were even official greeters. They were the ones with the Menlo Park banners slung over their shoulders like beauty queens. Their job was to walk up to shopper after shopper and say, "Welcome. Have a good day today."
 
12 Movie Screens
 The opening day shoppers looked in on Wings 'n' Things and Linens 'n' Things. (One sells fast food, the other home furnishings.) They walked down columned corridors with The Gap, a Baby Gap and a Gap Kids. And 130,000 square feet was leased to stores run by The Limited: Lane Bryant, Lerner New York, Structure and Victoria's Secret, along with The Limited and The Limited Express.
The mall's owners destroyed the mall to save it. They tore down all the stores in a 30-year-old shopping complex except Macy's. The two-story structure they built has sculpture -- two totem-pole-like creations, an abstract work called "The Happy Shopper" and a bronze creation called "Puddle Jumpers." It has what John F. Phelan, an executive vice president in Mr. O'Connor's company, called the "water feature," a machine that makes water bubble like a brook right there in the middle of the mall.
Then there is the "entertainment component" the 1,000-seat food court and the 63,000 square foot movie-theater complex -- with 12 screens, the largest in New Jersey, Mr. O'Connor said.
The whole mall, Mr. O'Connor said, sets a new standard for architecture, increasingly important in luring customers from nearby malls like Bridgewater Commons and the Woodbridge Mall. "This is terrazzo here," he said, pointing to the floor in the food court, "but it's beautifully done. And in the main mall, it's beautiful marble. It's real where you expect it to be faux."
If that does not appeal to shoppers, the mall's owners are hoping that the theme they have chosen will. The theme is N.J. Style.
"We were throwing around ideas," said Tammy Crimando, the marketing director, who grew up in Newton, N.J., went to Rutgers University, now lives in Ledgewood, N.J., and claims to have heard all the jokes about New Jersey that have ever been told. "We kept coming up with stylish, stylish, stylish. My boss said, 'How do you say New Jersey and stylish together? It's an oxymoron.' Our idea was not necessarily high style."

HEADLINE: About New York

BYLINE: By Douglas Martin

 BODY:
Her head bent over a ledger, Olga Loeb was in control. She gripped a wad of cash in one hand, a pen in the other.
"Just let me get this out of the way," she said, barely looking up. "I don't like to carry it over the weekend." 
 Certainly, ma'am. This, after all, is the gift shop of the Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center -- the special realm of the plain-spoken monarch known simply as Mother Loeb to her many friends on the tattered Grand Concourse. More than a quarter century ago, this diminutive woman created the gift shop from nothing.
It is a place of flowers and magazines and candy bars and teddy bears and cigars for proud fathers. It has raised more than a million dollars for the hospital that her late husband, a surgeon, helped found and to which she has dedicated much of her life.
She opens the shop herself every weekday morning and locks the door every night. On Oct. 21, she will be 95 years old.
Mrs. Loeb characterizes her motivation as purely selfish. "It gives me a lift," she said. "Can you imagine if I sat home everyday and looked at the wall?"
This "selfishness" relates to her philosophy of life. "You get what you give, and if you don't give, you can't expect to get."
A delivery man comes in with a box full of scarfs and hats, items Mrs. Loeb had picked out herself in a showroom. As she counts them, she advises a nervous new father on receiving blankets. She tells someone else where M & M's are stored. She quotes the price of a box of tissues from memory.
Mrs. Loeb was born in Vienna. Her father made fringe for fancy chairs. The family came to America to seek a newer world. They landed at Ellis Island, settled in Philadelphia and moved to the Bronx in 1911.
It was a beautiful place, more country than city. The subway had just come, and the flowers on a breezy spring day recalled a Monet landscape. It was a time strangers tipped their hats and smiled.
It was also a time of common hardship. Many people worked in garment industry sweatshops and were unemployed for months during slack periods. There were no unions, no unemployment insurance, no welfare. "Families took care of each other," Mrs. Loeb said.
As a girl, she carried a can from house to house to collect pennies for a new dispensary that became the forerunner of what is now Bronx-Lebanon, at East 174th Street and the Grand Concourse in the Tremont section.
The mail carrier arrives. "You look beautiful as always," he chirps. "Like a rose, baby." The phone rings and Mrs. Loeb is asked how she is. "You know how old people feel," she answers. "Sometimes they're very good, sometimes they're pretty good."
Mrs. Loeb built a successful career at a time when most women didn't work, buying fine merchandise for fine stores. She worked in Manhattan, then Syracuse, Little Rock and Ithaca. At age 40, she returned to the Bronx to marry the distinguished Dr. Martin J. Loeb, who was 17 years older and quite a catch.
"I guess at that time I was a very attractive young woman," she allowed.
Doctors' wives then didn't work, so she threw herself into volunteerism. She became active in the hospital's ladies auxiliary, spearheading such efforts as selling new mothers certificates with doctors' signatures and photos of the new arrivals. She talked a reluctant board into converting a waiting room into a shop to be run by volunteers.
When her husband died in 1961, she pushed ahead. "I didn't sit and bemoan my fate," she said.
As the day scurries on, Mrs. Loeb calls the bank to see if a check has cleared, lends an orderly $20, chats with the head of the nursing staff, arranges papers for an upcoming meeting of the hospital's board, of which she is a member.
It occurred to her interviewer that she must have a lot of funny stories of hospital life. "Stories are usually sad," she answered.
Bronx-Lebanon serves the nation's poorest Congressional district and faces a never-ending flood of all the health problems afflicting the urban disadvantaged: hypertension, hepatitis, high infant mortality, etc. This is a hospital that gives away millions of pounds of food to the needy.
And as AIDS has ravaged those with too many problems already, Bronx-Lebanon has marshaled more and more resources to fight the disease. One resource is Mrs. Loeb, who makes a habit of visiting AIDS patients to talk, bring a candy bar, hold a hand.
"You can go up and see a patient today and tomorrow he's gone," she said. "It's very sad."
There are days when it is hard to get out of bed, but Mrs. Loeb manages. "When problems come up from doctors to porters, they look for me," she explained. "Can I fix it?"
Yes.

HEADLINE: Cuomo, Heading to Tokyo, Says It's Strictly Business

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Sept. 27

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who often boasts that if New York State were a country it would have the world's ninth-largest economy, leaves for Tokyo on Saturday on a trade mission that comes against the backdrop of a precipitous decline in new Japanese investment in New York in recent years.
While much of the decline is tied to internal economic problems in Japan and is common to other states, several American and Japanese executives said the slowing of investments was magnified in the New York City area, with many Japanese investors increasingly nervous about the city's prospects in the wake of its fiscal turmoil and tremendous social problems. 
 In that sense the Governor's visit, aimed largely at attracting Japanese capital to New York, may be a tough sell, even with his dramatic proposal this week of a state-backed $7 billion package of public-works measures that he said would help rejuvenate New York City.
On the brighter side, New York State's exports to Japan, which is now its second-largest foreign trading partner after Canada, have more than doubled in the last three years, to $3.9 billion. That gain far outpaces the United States average for exports to Japan, and stems from a growing trade in everything from antiques and jewelry to chemicals and heavy machinery.
The Governor will meet with a variety of top political and business leaders, including a tentatively scheduled visit with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, although Cuomo administration aides have insisted this week that the trip is solely intended to promote New York's economy and not the Governor's profile as a foreign-policy expert.
And despite the embarrassing release recently of a memorandum from one adviser to the Governor suggesting that he berate the Japanese on free-trade issues in order to demonstrate his toughness on foreign affairs, the aides said Mr. Cuomo is going to Japan to reap goodwill, not a diplomatic confrontation.
"The message is going to be 'We like you here in New York; we want you to come in a big way,' " said Vincent Tese, the state's director of economic development and one of Mr. Cuomo's closest aides. "There will be no element of Japan-bashing in our presence or our statements."
At an Albany news conference today, Mr. Cuomo himself declined to discuss what he plans to talk about, telling reporters it would be "disrespectful" to do so before they had been delivered to his Japanese hosts.
But he said of the visit, the only one he has made as Governor overseas outside of a 1987 trip to the Soviet Union: "I made a mistake in not going earlier. The visit is extremely important to Japanese business people." Referring to Japanese investments in New York, he added: "I should have gone a long time ago and paid my respects and said, 'Thank you. This is good.' Those Japanese signatures are on our paychecks."
In New York and elsewhere in the country, the recent falloff in Japanese investment appears to have received a mixed reaction. Japanese observers frequently point to Americans' clamoring for their capital at the same time that Japanese involvement in the purchase of some American landmarks like Rockefeller Center has prompted much hand-wringing about a possible Japanese financial takeover.
"We do send very conflicting signals," said John K. Wheeler, the vice president of the Japan Society, a nonprofit educational organization in Manhattan. "The Japanese are at the least confused, and sometimes very irritated."
In any event, investment is no longer growing appreciably.
For most of the last decade, the total Japanese investment in nonbanking companies in New York soared, to $6.5 billion in 1988 from $368 million in 1981, and the number of New Yorkers employed by these companies nearly tripled in that time, to about 40,000, according to figures compiled by the United States Commerce Department and the State Department of Economic Development.
Although specific figures are not available for 1989 and 1990, there is wide agreement that they have almost leveled off for the time being.
"I simply don't see any major investment taking place in any major industries in New York State right now" among Japanese companies, said Eiso Kawamoto, the president of the IRM Company, a Japanese-owned research and marketing firm with offices in Manhattan. Mr. Kawamoto added that while the trends in New York were not highly unusual, there had been at least modest growth in some states in the South and Middle West.
While Mr. Cuomo can obviously do little to influence Japan's economic conditions, several business executives said he would have an unusual opportunity to have his pitch for New York heard, because many Japanese continue to view him as a possible future President despite his professed lack of interest in the White House.
"They'll come and listen to him because of the Presidential possibilities, but then he's got an audience to work his message with," said Maynard Toll, an American who is the Tokyo-based president of CS First Boston (Japan) Ltd., an investment bank.
Cuomo administration aides said the Governor was expected to sign a handful of agreements in Tokyo involving export of New York State companies' products to Japan. But the primary purpose of the trip appears to be one of acting as chief chearleader for the state.
While there is nothing that the Governor can offer specifically to the Japanese, the aides added, he will discuss his development plans for the city as well as the standard array of incentives available to companies that consider locating in New York, including the investment tax credit for locating in one of 19 special "economic development zones" around the state.
Although they may not make or break bottom-line investment decisions, the Japanese place considerable symbolic importance on visits by dignitaries like Mr. Cuomo. Conversely, the trips can generate minor diplomatic strains within Japan, as when Mayor David N. Dinkins canceled a scheduled trip there last winter because of the Persian Gulf conflict. Even Mr. Cuomo's visit, while much heralded, caused some disappointment in Osaka when aides canceled a planned one-day stop there because of scheduling difficulties.
Still, the larger question raised by the recent falloff is whether Japanese companies' perceptions of New York City will make them reluctant investors even when their own economic conditions change and they have the capital to consider large-scale investments.

HEADLINE: More Employers Seen Using Dismissals to Fight Unions

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
Companies eager to keep organized labor out of their work sites are increasingly cutting short organizing drives by the blunt and often effective tactic of dismissing leaders of the campaigns, many labor experts say.
It is strategy that, in recent years, has been invoked even in a relative bastion of labor like the New York region. Sometimes, the leaders are discharged as part of a mass dismissal, like the one at The Sae Gae Times, a Korean-language daily newspaper on West 27th Street in Manhattan, where three-quarters of the editorial staff was dismissed in May, just days after the start of a union organizing campaign. 
 More frequently, labor experts say, companies discharge just a few key leaders. An effort to organize workers at two hospitals in Burlington County, N.J., foundered last year after management dismissed a hospital housekeeper, who union organizers said had been a principal force behind the drive. And in Brooklyn, after a union began a recruitment campaign at a used-clothing salvager, three of the six employees on the organizing committee were discharged.
"It happens in most organizing campaigns," said Jack Sheinkman, president of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union. "It strikes fear in the workers. What it does is deter union organizing."
Officials of the National Labor Relations Board said that there are no statistics that would show how frequently workers are dismissed for union activity.
 
Dismissals Are Denied

But Thomas A. Kochan, a professor of management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said his own analysis of the board's data showed clearly that the number of dismissals has been increasing. "There is no question that the number of people fired for organizing activity went up in the 1970's and continued to go up in the 1980's," Professor Kochan said.
On average, one worker active in recruitment campaigns was discharged for every 20 workers who voted on whether they wanted union representation, Professor Kochan determined in research he completed in 1987.
Management representatives agree that companies have become much more aggressive in fighting union-recruitment campaigns, but they deny that companies dismiss workers for union activity.
"I've participated personally in 700 elections and I've been involved in thousands of other campaigns that did not result in elections, and I can't think of a single instance where a company fired an employee engaged in union activity to discourage union activity," said Robert Lewis, a lawyer who has represented employers for 40 years and has written a book explaining how companies can win union elections.
Many labor leaders say that public opinion has made fierce tactics acceptable. As the public has turned more hostile to organized labor over the last two decades, they say, many companies have grown more willing to use hardball strategies, and even illegal ones like dismissals, to beat back recruitment drives.
 
Worker Intimidation
 Labor leaders say the Reagan Administration's defeat of the air-traffic controllers' union in 1981 with other successful uses of replacement workers in high-profile labor disputes, have also contributed to a climate that has emboldened employers. In the heyday of organized labor during the 1930's, 40's and 50's, companies were often reluctant to employ harsh or illegal tactics for fear of being tainted as union-busters. But the accusation no longer carries the same social stigma, or runs the same business risks, labor leaders say.
Union leaders and some labor experts contend that dismissals during recruitment drives can be critical to defeating a union. They can dispirit and intimidate workers, labor leaders say, and appealing such acts can take years at the National Labor Relations Board and in the Federal courts.
An employer can defeat a union campaign and save money, even if the Federal regulators ultimately rule that the employer improperly discharged workers for union activity and order payment of fines and back pay.
 
Workers' Leader Dismissed
 "It's profit-maximizing behavior," said Wayne Vroman, an economist at The Urban Institute in Washington.
Two years ago, the Communications Workers of America tried to organize workers at the Zurbrugg Hospitals, two medical centers in Burlington County, N.J., outside Philadelphia.
Larry Cohen, the union's organizing director, said that during the campaign the workers' leader, Betty Watson, a housekeeper in one of the hospitals, was dismissed.
A year later, in a hearing before the labor relations board, the hospitals' lawyer admitted that Ms. Watson was dismissed for her union activity, Mr. Cohen said. The hospital agreed to give Ms. Watson her job back, along with back pay.
 
A Personal Dispute
 But the loss for a year of Ms. Watson's leadership, along with the fear instilled by her dismissal, broke the back of the recruitment campaign, Mr. Cohen said. A vote of the hospitals' 600 employees on whether to affiliate with the union ended in a tie. A second vote ended in defeat for the union, he said.
Union leaders contend that an organizing campaign led to mass dismissals at The Sae Gae Times, the Korean-language newspaper. But it is too soon to know whether the discharges will undercut the recruitment effort.
The dispute began with a minor personal spat in early May. Cho Yun Suk, a low-level editor at the newspaper who was returning to work after lunch, had a chance encounter with Lee Yoon Sook, who supervises the typesetters. Ms. Cho said Ms. Lee made a disparaging remark about Ms. Cho's being unmarried.
One word led to another, Ms. Cho said through a translator, and eventually she called Ms. Lee a "Yankee bride," an insult that refers to Korean women who marry American soldiers stationed in South Korea. Ms. Lee is a member of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church, Ms. Cho said, and like many church members, is married to an American.
 
Disparate Suspensions
 The words set off sparks at the paper, where there had long been tension between supervisors, many of whom belong to the Unification Church, and reporters and low-level editors, most of whom do not and feel discriminated against.
Ms. Cho, who does not belong to the church, was eventually suspended without pay for 30 days. Ms. Lee, a church member, got a three-day unpaid suspension.
The disparity infuriated many reporters and editors who signed petitions, confronted management and then, nervous about their job security, went to the International Ladies Garment Workers Union for help. (The union represents workers at another Korean-language daily in Manhattan, The Chosun Daily News, where half the staff was dismissed last year during a union organizing campaign.)
"When we presented the protest petition, we were kind of scared," said Kim Bong Ho, who was a reporter at The Sae Gae Times. "We needed job security."
By late May, after 14 of the paper's 21 reporters and editors had signed cards saying they wanted to be represented by the union, two union officials went to the paper to demand recognition. They were turned away, said Ann F. Hoffman, the head of the division for professional and clerical workers of the I.L.G.W.U.
Two days later, on May 31, the newspaper's president, Kim Byung Ho, announced that 17 people were being dismissed, according to four employees who were discharged. Fifteen of the dismissed worked were reporters and editors, 10 of whom had signed union cards.
Employees said they were told by the president that the paper was losing money and needed fewer people because it was computerizing many operations. Mr. Kim also said that the layoffs had been under consideration for a while, but that the events of the previous two days had forced him to proceed immediately, the discharged workers said.
"It was saying that the real reason for what they were doing was union activity," Ms. Hoffman said.
Mr. Kim declined a request for an interview. An aide referred questions to the newspaper's lawyer, Mark Goldstein, who said he could not comment on the case because it is before the National Labor Relations Board.
The garment workers' union went immediately after the dismissals to the labor relations board, charging the newspaper with violating the law by discharging people for union activity.
It could be a long time before the matter is resolved. An administrative law judge will conduct a hearing, scheduled for December. His ruling can be appealed to the five-member National Labor Relations Board in Washington. The board's decision then can be appealed in the Federal courts.
The union fears that time will be on the employer's side. If the case takes two to five years, the union might win the battle but lose the war. Will the dismissed workers still be around to return to their jobs? Will the remaining workers still want to join the union?
Officials of the National Labor Relations Board said that, while some cases do drag interminably through the regulatory process and the courts, most get a quick response.
To cut through red tape when an employer is accused of extreme violations, Federal regulators can seek a court injunction ordering a company to rehire discharged workers while the labor relations board tries to resolve the overall dispute. But it is rarely invoked.
A request from the garment workers' union for such an injunction aganst The Sae Gae Times is being considered by the labor board.
A similar injunction was issued last month against a Brooklyn company, which was ordered to rehire 208 workers who had been on strike since January 1990. The dispute at the company, Domsey Trading, a salvager of used clothing, also had its origins in a union organizing campaign.
Employees had approached the garment workers' union two years ago, saying they were poorly paid and complained that they were forced to wear large numbers on their chests.
Minutes after a union organizer went to the plant in December 1989 to request formal recognition, the owners dismissed one of the six workers on the organizing committee, said Joe Blount, a union organizer.
Within a month, half of the six committee members had been dismissed, Mr. Blount said. Two-thirds of the workers then went on strike to protest the dismissals. An official of the company, who declined to identify himself, asserted in a telephone interview that no one had been dismissed for union activity.
The injunction ordered Domsey to take back the employees while the labor relations board considers the case. Union officials said they hoped that a similar court order would be obtained for those dismissed by The Sae Gae Times.
"We think the facts are pretty compelling," Ms. Hoffman said.

Lower Mortgage Rates

BYLINE: by ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
To stimulate the real estate market, mortgage lenders have been lowering rates to levels not seen since 1978. For homeowners with mortgages negotiated in recent years, this offers an opportunity to refinance. Getting the most out of refinancing depends not only on the lower rate but also on how long an owner plans to stay in a house. For those planning on staying three years or less, the rule of thumb is that a new mortgage rate should be at least 2 percentage points below the old rate in order to realize a benefit from the new closing costs. Homeowners expecting to stay at least six years need a rate at least one percentage point lower than their current rate to recover closing costs. Here are the national average rates this week for the most popular mortgages compared to rates a year ago. The rate given for a one-year adjustable rate mortgage, known as ARM, is the average introductory rate for an ARM with a 30-year term.

Mortgage	1991	1990	 	 	 	30-year fixed	8.77%	10.06%	15-year fixed	8.43	9.76	1-year ARM	6.60	8.25

HEADLINE: Rash Remedy on Illegal Aliens

 BODY:
The landmark 1986 immigration law set out to discourage illegal aliens by turning off the economic magnet and penalizing employers who hire them. Now opponents of employer sanctions argue that the law has provoked insupportable discrimination against legal residents who look foreign. They are pressing for a bill to repeal sanctions sponsored by Senators Orrin Hatch, Utah Republican, and Edward Kennedy, Massachusetts Democrat.
That represents a rash remedy for an uncertain ailment. The evidence is mixed and, in any case, proponents of repeal have yet to show why less drastic alternatives won't work. 
 The 1986 law was a compromise. It conferred amnesty on hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens already in the U.S. At the same time, it required employers to verify the status of new hires, to discourage more illegal immigrants from coming. Once employers are satisfied that any of about 20 documents that establish work eligibility, like a Social Security card, are not fraudulent, they notify the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Department of Labor.
It's a simple procedure that 80 percent of employers seem to be following. But last year the General Accounting Office, Congress's investigating agency, found that about 20 percent of employers avoided hiring people who looked or sounded foreign rather than risk being penalized.
Opponents of sanctions have seized on the G.A.O.'s finding of a "widespread pattern of discrimination" to urge repeal. They also cite a 1990 study by the Urban Institute and the Rand Corporation, two think tanks, concluding that the flow of illegals has not decreased significantly. If sanctions are causing discrimination and not discouraging illegals, critics argue, why continue them?
That's the theme of the Hatch-Kennedy proposal. It would repeal sanctions and increase the number of Border Patrol agents from 3,800 to 6,600. Better control of the borders is certainly desirable. But it ought not preclude other measures, short of repealing sanctions, that could lessen the law's discriminatory effect.
The G.A.O., which did not urge repeal, recommended at least two that haven't been adequately tested. One is better education of employers, which the Immigration Service has now begun. Another is reducing the number of acceptable work authorization documents to lessen the likelihood of fraud. Counterfeit-resistant Social Security cards are gradually being phased in, and states are experimenting with more secure licenses for drivers. But the immigration agency has not promoted greater reliance on fewer documents, and its own records are not always up to date.
Opponents of sanctions -- and all concerned with preserving civil rights -- are right to be concerned when a Federal law is shown to increase discrimination. But that's far from clear and, at least until lesser remedies are pursued, repealing sanctions remains premature.

HEADLINE: Peru's President: A Good Bet

 BODY:
Despite concerns about human rights, Congressional committees are about to release economic and military aid to help Peru's President Alberto Fujimori fight the cocaine trade. The concerns are valid, but Mr. Fujimori still deserves the show of confidence.
The Bush Administration's plans for $34.9 million in military aid, including 50 military advisers, stirred fears of United States involvement in a Vietnam-like quagmire. The Peruvian military's human rights record, as sorry as any in the Americas, makes the idea seem even more dismaying. 
 Yet a realistic attack on the drug problem requires some participation of the Peruvian military, since the Shining Path rebels exert strong influence over much of the highland areas where coca is grown. The rebels, who seek power through terrorism and intimidation, extort money from drug traffickers and protect coca farmers from Government attack.
Mr. Fujimori also insists that drug policy depends on much more than the military. Coca growers, he argues, don't deserve to be lumped together with criminal drug traffickers. Most are poor people for whom Peru's collapsed economy offers few options; many who had hoped to get rich growing coca are now disappointed: the growers' income averages only $400 per year.
Mr. Fujimori's response calls for military pressure on the Shining Path accompanied by ambitious economic restructuring, for which Washington would contribute an additional $60 million.
In exchange for their agreement to substitute other crops for coca, Mr. Fujimori would grant campesinos title to their lands, a step that would give them a personal stake and allow them to organize for sale of legitimate crops to big purchasers. He would also develop roads to ease transportation of substitute crops. And he would promote other development strategies in hopes of creating low-end jobs.
The total $94.9 million aid package is far less than what Peru might eventually require to regain control of the highlands and restructure its economy. But the money will make clear that Washington believes Mr. Fujimori deserves support. Such an endorsement would reinforce his influence over the military, with the promise of better performance on human rights.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off as Traders Focus On Bush-Greenspan Talks

BYLINE: By By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell yesterday, as traders showed continued pessimism about the direction of interest rates.
Gold prices also closed lower. 
 Analysts said the foreign exchange markets were focused on a meeting yesterday between President Bush and Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.
The White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, told reporters that Mr. Greenspan had told Mr. Bush he believed the fundamentals of the economy were strong and the recovery from the recession was continuing.
But Mr. Bush expressed concern that restrictive lending policies by banks could have a chilling effect on the economy, Mr. Fitzwater said.
Traders took a bleak view of the meeting and the economy, fearing that the Fed would continue to lower interest rates to stimulate activity, and many sold dollars.
The dollar, like other currencies, draws support from higher interest rates.
"There's not been any good news whatsoever in the last few weeks," said Robert Ryan, corporate foreign exchange manager with the Bank of New York Company. "All the fundamentals point to a weaker dollar, and that's what we have."
There was more evidence of a struggling economy yesterday as the Commerce Department reported that despite a four-tenths of 1 percent increase in personal income in August, consumer spending was up a barely perceptible one-tenth of 1 percent.
However, the figures, which were in line with market expectations, had little effect on the dollar.
The British pound gained against the dollar, rising to $1.7435 in New York, from $1.7285 late Thursday. In earlier London trading, the pound rose to $1.7370 from $1.7325.
The dollar also lost ground against the Japanese yen, falling to 133.15 yen in New York, from 133.95 yen on Thursday. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar closed at 133.82 yen, up 0.39 yen, and in London, it was quoted at 133.40 yen.
Other dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's prices, included: 1.6705 German marks, down from 1.6875; 1.4535 Swiss francs, down from 1.4675; 5.6905 French francs, down from 5.7490; 1,249.00 Italian lire, down from 1,263.85, and 1.13355 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1360.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday, included: 1.6755 German marks, down from 1.6820; 1.4590 Swiss francs, down from 1.4640; 5.7055 French francs, down from 5.7300; 1.8890 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8960; 1,253.00 Italian lire, down from 1,255.85, and 1.1338 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1348.
Gold fell on the Commodity Exchange in New York, slipping $1.70, to $349.10 a troy ounce.

HEADLINE: Class Struggle

BYLINE: BY ROBERT REINHOLD; Robert Reinhold is Los Angeles bureau chief of The New York Times.

 BODY:
ON A LEAFY SIDE STREET IN THE Los Angeles suburb of Glendale, parents and children are playing out the American ritual of going back to school. The youngsters, still adjusting to the unfamiliar surroundings of classes at the Columbus Elementary School, clutch glossy new textbooks. About 30 of them file into John Robertson's fifth-grade classroom, where the walls are decorated with Presidential portraits, diagrams of the 50 states and Navajo sand drawings. From all appearances, a traditional setting. But appearances are deceiving.
That becomes evident when Robertson addresses his charges, with names like Aram, Razmik, Sarkis, Su Chin, Pierre and Angela. The classroom, a typical one in the new California, is filled with immigrant children from Soviet Armenia, Mexico, El Salvador, Korea and Hong Kong, plus a few Americans. At the rear, a Filipino-American teacher's aide, Nanette Morales, prepares to help Armenian and Korean children learn English. 
 It is Robertson's task to bring these mostly foreign-born youngsters into the American fold, and one of his main tools is the new blue textbook that each child carries. It is entitled "America Will Be," and is one of a series of new schoolbooks published by the Houghton Mifflin Company. Robertson directs the children to start reading a literature selection from the book -- a Cherokee Indian version of the tortoise and the hare fable.
These youngsters and Robertson are at the front edge of a revolution in the teaching of history and social studies, one that has been building in many states for years but has reached its fullest flower in California. Four years ago, the state Board of Education adopted a history and social studies "framework," or curriculum, devised by a team that included Charlotte Crabtree, a professor of education at U.C.L.A., and Diane Ravitch, an Assistant Secretary of Education who was then an adjunct professor of history and education at Teachers College, Columbia University. It then invited publishers to submit a series of textbooks based on the new framework.
By all accounts, it was an intimidating invitation. The framework called for stretching the study of world and American history to three years each, introduced social studies into the earliest grades, restored the study of religion as a key factor in world history, emphasized history as a dramatic chronicle to be taught as "a story well told," reintroduced literature in historical instruction and fully integrated geography with history. And it demanded that the public schools "accurately portray the cultural and racial diversity of our society" while emphasizing the "centrality of Western civilizations as the source of American political institutions, laws and ideology."
The new books are the most visible product yet of this campaign to inject new life and relevance into the teaching of history. The express purpose of the undertaking is to force a sharp reversal of the decades-old trend of watering down textbooks to avoid controversy and appeal to the widest possible market.
And where the history is spicier, controversy is sure to follow, as was evident at the San Francisco School Board's public hearing on the books this June at the Everett Middle School. As the packed meeting got under way, most people stood for the Pledge of Allegiance. Indians, Chinese Americans, blacks, Hispanic Americans, Jews, Christians and Muslims all fell silent, placed hands over hearts and intoned "One nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."
But the raucous hearing that followed was anything but indivisible. In four and a half hours of shouting, a parade of speakers stepped before the microphone to denounce the books. Mary R. Hoover, professor of black studies at San Francisco State University, asserted that the new books distorted the history of blacks and other minorities "so Europe could be celebrated."
Christina Edwards, a lecturer in American Indian Studies at San Francisco State, introduced herself with the Lakota name of Cungleska Lutawin, and complained that the third-grade book trivialized Indian history. "It reduces our sun dance and medicine dance to a toilet-paper project," she said. She drew cheers when she envisioned the uproar that would follow if children were asked to make a crucifix out of two Popsicle sticks and a clay Christ figure daubed with ketchup.
A smaller number of witnesses stood to defend the books as better than anything ever before available to youngsters. They were jeered.
While its critics have been numerous and vociferous, the project has enjoyed the forceful support of California's pugnacious Superintendent of Public Instruction, Bill Honig. In an interview in his office in Sacramento, Honig stoutly defended the framework against what he calls "the victimization crew," the "tribalists" and "separatists" in universities who "make a livelihood on discrediting broader cultural ideas."
And despite widespread complaints about its purported insensitivities to minorities, subtle and not-so-subtle stereotyping and outright biases, the California framework has begun to make wide ripples across American education. With 3.7 million pupils in grades kindergarten through eighth, California represents 11 percent of the $1.7 billion national market for school texts. Already the texts tailored to the California curriculum are beginning to be adopted elsewhere, in West Virginia, Indiana, Arkansas and Oregon, as well as Newark and Dubuque, Iowa.
The process by which these books were written, debated, adopted, amended and refined sheds light on the enormous complexity and political contentiousness of teaching history in this polyglot country. It is a debate that has gained urgency in New York and many other ethnically diverse states but nowhere more than in California. By the turn of the century, according to various projections, well under half the children of California will be "Anglos," or people of European origin, and more than a third will be Hispanic and one in eight Asian.
The question for educators and parents is this: Can these children, from the earliest school years, be exposed to the full diversity of cultures and traditions that make up the United States and still arrive at the conclusion that we are united by ideals, bonds and legal instruments that support the national motto, E pluribus unum, or "Out of many, one"?
Alternatively, are those common ideals, and the immigrant-absorption model on which they are based, fundamentally white European formulations that have excluded and failed the people of color whose ancestors came not in steamers from Europe but in shackles from Africa or, in the case of Indians, were here long before Columbus?
SINCE THE 1978 PASSAGE OF Proposition 13, which limited the taxing authority of local governments, California schools have turned increasingly to the state government for money, greatly enhancing the power of the state board and the Superintendent of Public Instruction. California is one of 22 "adoption" states, in which the state government reviews books for statewide use. While local districts are not obliged to buy the state-approved books, they must spend 70 percent of the $28.90 a year the state supplies for textbooks for each pupil on the approved books. Their alternative is to seek a waiver or put the money aside for future spending on state-approved books. California has been using this considerable power in recent years to promote its new approach to teaching history.
Indeed, when the Glendale fifth graders opened their new history books, they unwittingly marked the end of a lengthy process that began even before California formally adopted the new framework in 1987. And closely watching the California process from the very beginning were representatives of Ligature Inc., a small company based in Chicago and Boston that specializes in textbook development.
Ligature and companies like it develop an idea for a book, engage the authors and then seek a partnership with a publisher. By 1987, Ligature, headed by co-owners Stuart J. Murphy and Richard M. Anderson, had already produced an outline for a history series and chosen three authors: Gary B. Nash, professor of history at the University of California at Los Angeles, a leading academic proponent of "multicultural ism"; Christopher L. Salter, chairman of the geography department at the University of Missouri, and a crusader for geography education, and Beverly J. Armento, the director of the Center for Business and Economic Education at Georgia State University, and an expert in teaching economics to elementary-school children.
After California announced the adoption of the new framework, Houghton Mifflin, with no existing history series and, thus, no investment to protect, quickly contracted with Ligature to produce the books. Calculating that the California market alone could yield sales of $52.9 million, the company provided more than half the working capital of $20 million. It also brought in a fourth author, Karen K. Wixson, professor of education at the University of Michigan, who is an expert on reading pedagogy.
The books' developers relied heavily on the latest visual techniques, according to Ligature's Murphy. "Some kids are visual learners," he says. "We attempted to give kids a real capability to learn from maps, variations in color." Whereas previous textbooks usually used pictorial material as decoration to break up blocks of text, these books often use it to deliver the main message.
To show children that history is not just a lot of dates, the books make extensive use of features like "A Moment in Time," a vivid full-page drawing of some typical person in history -- like an 18th-century Parisian market woman in a muddy skirt, a 10th-century crusader in chain mail, a 19th-century Cherokee mother and son. "Not one page was done without a designer, writer and editor sitting together," Nash says.
Critics and admirers alike agree that the new books are superior to the soporific history texts used by generations of American students. Never before have elementary-school texts made such an effort to include the broad sweep of history and the divergent cultures that flow into the American mainstream. The series consists of one book for each grade from first to eighth, and a separate fourth-grade book for six other states, including California. Each is filled with colorful charts, graphs, time lines, maps and photographs in a format suggestive of the newspaper USA Today.
The first three grades depart from the traditional practice of focusing on the family in the first grade, neighborhood in the second and the larger community in the third. Instead, the first-grade text ranges from the school, to town and country, city and suburb and "all around the big world," including a train trip across Canada. As an exercise, students write a letter to a cousin in Mexico.
The second-grade book focuses on family and citizenship, celebrating American institutions like the Presidency. But it also branches out, discussing Cambodian immigrants and people like Roberto Clemente, the Puerto Rican baseball star and humanitarian who died in an airplane crash while trying to deliver relief supplies to earthquake victims in Central America. The third-grade book takes children across the American continent, a geographical excursion that touches on rivers, forests, Pilgrims, prairie dogs, Indians, farmers and steelworkers.
The California version traces the state's history from pre-Columbian Indians to modern-day smog problems. The national volume offers a broader view of the American land, touching on different regions, and detailing the development of highways and factories. The fifth-grade book traces American history from the Indians to early 20th-century industrialization.
In the sixth grade, children are given their first introduction to the ancient world, including Mesopotamia, Egypt, China, Greece, India and Rome. The seventh grade continues this journey, explaining the slave trade in the Kongo (the non-Anglicized spelling of Congo) and early American civilizations like the Mayas. And finally, the eighth-grade books bring all this together into a chronicle of the American experience from the early European settlement to the Bush Presidency.
The series tries to correct the traditionally Eurocentric views of older texts. For example, the fifth-grade book (entitled "America Will Be," after a Langston Hughes poem) covers early American history and plunges students into the American ethnic rainbow with devices like a two-page color spread of different kinds of bread: pita for Greeks and Syrians, matzoh for Jews, corn bread for Indians, tortillas for Mexican and Central American Indians and so on.
The fifth-grade volume devotes roughly 50 pages to slavery in the South, with vivid, firsthand descriptions of its cruelty, and contains fairly frank treatment of the brutality visited on American Indians by European settlers. Among the primary sources quoted are Olaudah Equiano (an African slave), Abigail Adams, Marco Polo, Black Hawk and Jane Addams, the founder of Hull House. It quotes the writings of an escaped slave, the Rev. Josiah Henson, who described his mother, on her knees, begging the man who had just bought her to buy her baby too; she was kicked senseless.
The seventh-grade book, "Across the Centuries," devotes 51 pages to the history of Sub-Saharan Africa, tracing the Bantu migration, the rise of the Zimbabwe State and the Kongo Kingdom. It also covers Asian, pre-Columbian American and other civilizations, as well as Europe in the Renaissance, Reformation and the ages of colonialism and imperialism.
The fourth-grade book, "Oh, California," on the state's history, tries to describe the cruelties the Spanish mission system visited on the Indians of California. The books sometimes go to amusing lengths to achieve political correctness. The fourth-grade book has a full-page picture of a "vaquera" -- a Mexican cowgirl -- at a rodeo in 1820.
IN THE SPRING OF 1990, nine publishers submitted entries to the state board's Curriculum Commission, which set up three panels of teachers to evaluate them. Only Houghton Mifflin offered books for all grades through eighth. In the end, the commission approved just the Houghton Mifflin series and a single eighth-grade entry from Holt, Rinehart & Winston Inc., "The Story of America: Beginnings to 1914." But it insisted upon certain changes, which started a process known in publishing jargon as "corrigenda," literally a list of errors to be corrected before publication.
For example, the original fifth-grade book credited John Wesley Powell with being the first person to lead a group the length of the Grand Canyon. That was changed to read that he was the first white person to do so, since Indians had traveled the route for centuries. And some changes were made to accommodate Muslim sensibilities. They deleted three pictures of Mohammed -- in Islam, literal images of Mohammed are considered blasphemous -- and a suggestion in the teacher's manual to have children impersonate Mohammed and his family, suggesting instead that they interview a Muslim scholar.
Other changes were made to avoid misinterpretations. For instance, a sixth-grade lesson on the life of Jesus and the rise of Christianity was originally titled "An Age of Transition." To Jewish groups, this implied that Judaism was just a way station to Christianity. The lesson is now called "Religious Developments."
But the commission rebuffed numerous demands that it delete unhappy events or blemishes in history. "The purpose of history cannot be to expunge all such episodes from this record in the mistaken interest of filiopietism or children's self-esteem, but instead must be to help children to learn from them," the commission stated in its formal recommendations to the state board, which accepted the books last October.
THE PUBLISHERS WERE stunned by the bitterness of the protest that surrounded the process of public hearings and comment. That debate has now filtered down to nearly every one of the state's school districts, and even to every school in decentralized districts like Los Angeles Unified. Given little choice, most local boards have accepted the new books, with the notable exceptions of Oakland and Ravenswood City, a heavily minority school district in East Palo Alto. In those areas, they were rejected as insufficiently multicultural.
The debate this summer in San Francisco, where minorities make up 83 percent of the student population, typifies the controversy surrounding the books. While the school board ultimately voted 5 to 1 for adoption -- joining the approximately 600 of California's 1,016 school districts that had approved the texts by Labor Day -- it did so with no great enthusiasm. And it tacked on a lengthy supplementary reading list that included such titles as "Black Heroes of the Wild West," "Chinese Americans, Past and Present" and "Gays in America."
Even supplementary reading, however, is unlikely to placate all the critics, who understandably focus on religion and race issues as particularly problematic. Jewish groups complain about what they see as invidious comparisons between Judaism and Christianity. In one sentence about Jews, for example, the sixth-grade book refers to "their god," with a lower-case "g." Three paragraphs later, discussing Christianity, the text refers to "a vision from God."
Muslims say they would like to see more pictures of people and fewer of camels when their religion is discussed. "When it comes to Islam, there are virtually no people," says Shabbir Mansuri, director of the Council of Islamic Education, based in Tustin. "The faces of real people disappear in the text. There is no relevance to the student. They will come away thinking this is a religion that does not deal with the rational thinking of the modern day, the religion of the terrorists."
Critics also have attacked the treatment of the Spanish missions in California, citing passages like this one in the fourth-grade texts about Father Junipero Serra: "Father Serra would also teach the Indians farming skills and trade crafts so that they would be able to support themselves." The Indians had no trouble getting by before Father Serra destroyed their culture, critics note sarcastically.
And many opponents say the books, for all their improvements over past materials, remain essentially, if unintentionally, racist. One of the most determined of these critics is Joyce E. King, director of teacher education at Santa Clara University, who was a dissenting member of the state Curriculum Development and Supplemental Materials Commission that approved the books.
She cites the sixth-grade book's treatment of the early development of human culture, starting two million years ago with Homo habilis on the plains of eastern Africa. The original version of the text urged children to imagine themselves there as "two naked dark-skinned people walk down to the lake not far from you. . . . You point to your open mouth to show them you are hungry. . . . One person walks off toward a field. . . . Soon the first person returns with a bloody bone. . . . They invited you to eat the red marrow oozing from the bone." (After complaints, the published version omitted the words "dark-skinned," "bloody" and "oozing.") Three pages later, the text moves forward to 12,011 B.C. and shows a Cro-Magnon man, a handsome clean-shaven fellow in buckskins. A few pages farther on, the text says, "In terms of physical features, the Cro-Magnons looked like people today."
King, who is black, finds that objectionable, saying it draws unfavorable comparisons between the savage Homo habilis of Africa and the clean-shaven Cro-Magnon of Europe. "The chapter begins with an imaginary excursion to Africa," she says. "Then three pages later we have a shaved white guy near a cave in France. That juxtaposition was problematic. They deleted 'dark-skinned,' but those kinds of problems cannot be fixed. We are putting these books in the hands of children who already have stereotypes."
She also criticizes sections on slavery, saying they depict slaves as animals devoid of human thoughts and emotions, and the black migration to the northern cities and the ghetto life they met there. "The discussion of the experiences of African Americans in the urban North perpetuates a negative stereotype of black life," she says. "Black ghettos appear to be just naturally crime-ridden and dirty."
THE STARKEST paradox of the tempest aroused by the books is that the principal historian, Nash of U.C.L.A., is a man with impeccable left-liberal credentials. His books, "Red, White, and Black: The Peoples of Early America" and "Forging Freedom: The Formation of Philadelphia's Black Community," have been widely admired by black and American Indian scholars. That Nash, who is white, should now be painted as a racist is a source of considerable frustration and pain to him. "If I'm the bad guy," he asks, "who are your allies?"
California casual in a sweatsuit one recent morning, Nash spreads the books over his dining-room table in the affluent Pacific Palisades section of Los Angeles. Nash counters the criticism about the Spanish missions by pointing out that the books also describe the whippings and other cruelties suffered by Indians at the hands of Father Serra. He concedes some of King's points but stoutly defends the overall treatment of African history and slavery.
"I had never heard of the Bantu migration and the rise of the Zimbabwe state when I got my Ph.D. at Princeton," he says. "We have 80 pages on African history for 12-year-olds. This is what bugs me. Joyce King and other critics will not take notice of this and continue to say this is a Eu rocentric series."
Some critics have said the books should have omitted contemporary Southern arguments in favor of slavery. "I am not willing to make concessions on this," Nash says. "The Southern arguments are so patently false -- the kids see this." He argues that the eighth-grade book offers as harsh a portrait of slavery as ever given in an elementary text, reprinting lengthy passages from the powerful autobiography of Frederick Douglass, an escaped slave. "I do not think anyone reading this would think this trivializes slavery," he says.
Ultimately, Nash argues, the issue comes down to the political one of whose vision of America one accepts. "You can turn American history into a story of unremitting oppression of exploited minorities," he said. "That's just as distorted as the old view." Nash, at least, clings to the optimistic notion that all Americans can find common ground in the "ongoing struggle for greater equality and social justice -- this society sooner or later must be what it says it intends to be."
This is where the books come under the toughest ideological attack from critics who argue that the immigrant model marginalizes people of color. Chief among them is a Jamaican woman, Sylvia Wynter, who holds a joint appointment in African and Afro-American Studies and Spanish and Portuguese at Stanford University. Her lengthy critique of the fifth-grade book, "America Will Be," argues that it tends to equate the prejudice once experienced by white immigrants from Europe with the racism suffered by black, brown and yellow peoples, thereby justifying their exploitation.
What is needed, she wrote in a commentary to the state Curriculum Commission, is an entirely new framework that "seeks to go beyond the model of a nation-state coterminous only with Euro-immigrant America, to one coterminous as a 'world' civilization, with all its peoples: and therefore, for the first time in recorded history, coterminous (as a land that's not been yet but yet must be) with humankind."
State Superintendent Honig bristles at such arguments. "They do not like the idea of common democratic principles," he says. "It gets in the way of their left point of view that this country is corrupt. This country has been able to celebrate pluralism but keep some sense of the collective that holds us together. Everything is not race, gender or class. The whole world cannot be seen just through those glasses.
"Democracy has certain core ideas -- freedom of speech, law, procedural rights, the way we deal with each other," Honig continues. "If everything becomes hostile race and class warfare, we are going to lose this country. The issue is not multiculturalism. We agree with that. The question is, Are you also going to talk about the political and moral values that are essential for us to live together?"
THE BOOKS ARE MOSTLY welcomed by teachers and students in schools districts that have been testing the books for the last year. At the Oak Hills Elementary School in Agoura, a suburb about 40 miles northwest of Los Angeles, the principal, Anthony W. Knight, calls them balanced and, more important, interesting to children. "The old methods of social studies were clearly boring to children," he says.
One fifth-grade teacher, Enid Miller, says many of her pupils were startled to learn from the texts that they were all immigrants. She had them interview their own families, and the class became what she called a "tapestry" of different ethnic groups -- Iranian, Israeli, Chinese, Korean and Indian, among many others.
She says the chapters on slavery and the treatment of American Indians made a particularly strong impression on her students. "They are very sensitive," she says. "They feel outraged when they see what it really entailed." The Oak Park Unified School District recently adopted the books with little if any protest.
The visuals and graphics earn universal acclaim. In Tustin, a bedroom suburb in Orange County, 11 teachers piloted the book last year. One spring morning at the Currie Middle School, Sue Kraus's sixth-grade class was working on a crossword puzzle about the ancient Israelites. The pupils seemed genuinely absorbed. "It explains everything better, like daily life and religion, so you have a better idea of what things looked like," says Sarah Angle, a student.
Sheralin Conkey, a seventh-grade teacher at the Hewes Middle School in Tustin, says she jumped directly to the chapters about Islam and the Middle East when American troops went to Saudi Arabia last fall. "I found the book so much more detailed and comprehensive than the others," she says. "This book had two chapters on Islam and even went into the Shiites and the Sunnis and the lines of succession from Mohammed."
But the reception has been rougher in heavily minority districts, most notably the Oakland Unified School District -- 91 percent minority, mainly black (57 percent) and with a dropout rate of about 35 percent. Despite some reservations, the teachers and administration recommended adoption. "They were not perfect, but they were much better than what we had been using," said Robert L. Newell, associate superintendent for the division of instruction.
But in June the seven-member school board decisively rejected the books. "Almost 92 percent of our students are persons of color," said one board member, Toni R. Cook, who is black. "These books did very little for those children. We have 74 languages spoken in our schools. This is what the 21st century will be like.
"It's important for youngsters to see themselves," Cook insists. "How do we balance what they see on TV, lots of violence and crime. Their self-esteem is way down. They are portrayed as Willie Hortons. Oakland's challenge is how to truly have a multicultural curriculum. Ninety-one percent of our children are not European. How do we best excite them to the learning process?"
Two weeks into the school year, however, many Oakland youngsters weren't seeing anything. Parents, educators and activists still had not agreed on a new curriculum, and many students faced the new year without any textbooks at all.
THE ISSUES THAT have been raised by multicultural education have rubbed the rawest nerves, even in an America that is fundamentally pluralistic. A sharp debate broke out in New York State in late June over a paper prepared by a special panel for the State Commissioner of Education, Thomas Sobol, that urged a new curriculum that de-emphasizes the centrality of European thought and influence in the American experience. Noisy dissent came from some members of the panel, especially the historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr., who complained that "Europhobia" and a "cult of ethnicity" were turning America into a "quarrelsome splatter of enclaves."
The problem, in the view of Laurie Olsen, a former history teacher who is now with California Tomorrow, an educational group that develops and runs programs to deal with the increasingly multi-ethnic nature of California, is not the texts themselves. Rather, she says, it is "how polarized we are, how much fear there is about diversity, and how the schools have become the battleground." Lewis H. Butler, an Assistant Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare in the Nixon Administration and now chairman of California Tomorrow, says the whole episode has been a "rather sad event" that pits white liberals against black and Indian scholars. "People who thought they were good guys found themselves bad guys, called racists or separatists," he says.
If the concept of the melting pot is outdated, what is to replace it? History, some say, is a kind of property whose owner controls the future. From that perspective, the future in California still belongs, however tenuously, to the proponents of traditional Western values. The current debate suggests, however, that an increasingly polyglot America has yet to come to grips with the full depth of its diversity.

HEADLINE: SPECIAL EUROPE ISSUE;
Finding Bargains in the Off-Season

BYLINE: By SUZANNE MacNEILLE

 BODY:
A winter vacation in Europe may not suggest the travel-poster images of sunny sidewalk cafes in Paris or warm stretches of Ligurian beaches. It does, however, promise fewer crowds, a vibrant cultural scene and some interesting bargains that tour companies and airlines have recently announced.
Everything from reduced rates on rental cars and hotels to discounts at London hair salons is being offered to the hesitant tourist in these final months of a year marked by economic turmoil. 
 "There's nothing like a recession to focus companies' marketing efforts," said Sandie Dawe, spokesperson for the British Tourist Authority in London, which is projecting a 2 percent decline in foreign visitors to Britain this year. That would be the first decline since 1986, when the Chernobyl disaster and the American bombing of Libya kept frightened tourists at home.
But expectations are not entirely gloomy, according to Neil Martin, American spokesperson for the European Travel Commission. Although that organization is predicting that 15 to 20 percent fewer Americans will visit Europe in 1991 than in 1990, when a record 7.5 million Americans traveled there, Mr. Martin said he thought "the relative strength of the dollar, and the latest series of low air fare offers will improve the flow of U.S. traffic to Europe, particularly in the winter and spring of '92."
While the airline business is far too changeable to cite any fares with confidence that they will last, some of the recently announced round-trip fares of less than $400 to European cities suggest that attempts to lure the tourist to Europe this fall and winter are earnest. Among the fares, which generally have limited availablity and rise by $20 to $60 on weekends, are American's round-trip fare of $379 to London for travel through Dec. 17 (21-day advance purchase required) and Northwest's $398 London fare, which must be bought within three days of departure. Virgin Atlantic is extending its $199 one-way fare to London from Newark, New York and Boston until Oct. 14. The fare can also be booked on the return flight; tickets must be bought within 48 hours of departure.
Even the European carriers, which sometimes disdain involvement in fare wars, are discounting their seats. Air France is offering a free companion ticket for round-trip ticket holders traveling to Paris from Newark on its APEX fares, which are $771 on weekdays and $831 on weekends (fare must be purchased by Oct. 15 for travel between Nov. 1 and March 21). And Alitalia, which has just introduced new round-trip fares of $550 for a 6- to 14-day visit, and a $440 "weekend" fare to Milan or Rome for a 3- to 5-day trip, is offering companion tickets for $100 to travelers purchasing full economy, excursion or APEX fares.
Other airlines, including United, Lufthansa and Iberia (which recently advertised a $439 round-trip fare between New York and Madrid or Barcelona) are working with rental car companies to provide free rental cars to ticket holders. Lufthansa also offers a GermanRail pass at reduced rates beginning Nov. 1. The pass, good for five days of unlimited rail travel, costs $49, a savings of $81.
Companies offering winter packages to European destinations are also motivated. Some have actually lowered prices since last year. For instance, Central Holiday Tours has reduced the cost of its Sicily on Wheels program by $50 to $569. General Tours offers a winter bargain in Eastern Europe -- $899 for its eight-day Prague-Budapest tour. Last year, the company ran a similar nine-day tour that cost $1,299.
In addition to the traditional escorted programs, there is a diverse selection of packages that let individual travelers design their vacations by choosing from various hotel, rental car and tour options. Jet Vacations, for example, through its Flexi-Plan options, offers a full range of hotel rates in France, Spain, Portugal, Germany and other countries. The cheapest rate listed for Portugal, for example, is $15 a night for one person sharing a double room with private bath in the tourist-class Equador Hotel in Cascais, about 30 minutes from Lisbon.
Following is a sampling of the many packages available for this winter season -- generally speaking, Nov. 1 until March 31, 1992. Some companies extend the off season through April, others end it in February or earlier. Package prices and air fare goes up for holiday periods like Christmas.
When selecting a package, make sure you read all the fine print in brochures and advertisements to avoid unpleasant surprises. Trip-cancellation insurance is a good idea as most tours have strict and often hefty penalties for cancellation. Last-minute changes may also trigger a $25 or $50 fee. Many companies do not guarantee their published rates. Rising costs or big changes in currency exchange rates could push them up, but sluggish demand could lower the prices even further as early as December.
Unless noted otherwise, rates are for one person sharing a double room in a tourist-class hotel with a private bath. Included are breakfast, hotel service charges and taxes, and all transfers. Additional nights can usually be added and hotels can be upgraded for a supplemental charge. Most packages do not include $18 United States airport taxes.
Packages offered by airlines usually require that you use the same company for the trans-Atlantic flight, so it is a good idea to compare air fares as well as the price tags on land packages. Most of the tours have frequent departures -- at least several times a month, some with weekly departures.
 
Britain and Ireland
 London, the most popular trans-Atlantic destination for American travelers, is featured heavily in packages this winter.
British Airways, (800) 247-9297, offers a six-night London special, at $178; it is slightly less expensive than American's, but includes few extras. Accommodations are in the centrally situated President Hotel, near Covent Garden. Specialty packages, such as a Ye Olde England tour includes guided walking tours of "the London of Dickens and Shakespeare," a bus tour of Windsor and Runnymede and a ticket to an evening performance at the Players' Theater in the Strand. Prices for the six-night package start at $317.
The London a la Carte land package offered by American, (800) 433-7300, starts at $185 for six nights. The price includes six nights in the Plaza Hotel, which is in walking distance of Hyde Park, and a few extras like a cruise on the Thames and a city tour. For $34 more you can opt for the Discover London package, which includes a theater ticket, a three-day public transportation pass and a discount booklet for museums and other attractions.
Both T.W.A., (800) 438-2929, and Continental, (800) 634-5555, have London weekend specials, starting at $499 for three nights, including round-trip flights from New York. T.W.A.'s package, which offers sightseeing expeditions, dining and shopping discounts and up to 50 percent off Europcar rental cars, has a few more features. T.W.A.'s six-night London Theater Week is among the cheapest of the various land-only theater packages being offered this winter. It starts at $299 and includes tickets to two West End shows, sightseeing, accommodations, various shopping and dining discounts, and even a 10 percent discount at a hair salon.
American has an escorted bus tour of Scotland, which includes visits to Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness, the Caithness Glass factory and Aberdeen's Winter Gardens. The six-night tour includes all accommodations, tours and some meals, and costs $285.
Aer Lingus, (800) 223-6537, is offering three-night stays in Dublin in first-class hotels, including the Jurys Hotel in Ballsbridge and the Mont Clare, which is near Merrion Square, for $559, including round-trip air fare from New York. For $40 more, a rental car with unlimited mileage can be added to the same package. A three-night, fly-drive package, with accommodation in one from a list of Irish castles and manors, including the Adare Manor in County Limerick, costs $659, including air fare from New York.
 
Northern Europe
 Paris deals abound. Some, like American's six-night land rate of $279, are reasonable enough to justify splurging on some of the interesting add-on features that are popping up in brochures. American's $199 add-on includes a dinner and show at Paradis Latin, a tour of the Notre Dame Cathedral and the Louvre, and a demonstration session at the Ecole de Gastronomie Francaise Ritz-Escoffier. For shorter Parisian stays, both T.W.A. and Continental offer three-night specials, including air fare from New York, for, respectively, $658 and $629. T.W.A.'s, the more expensive of the two, includes some sightseeing excursions. K.L.M.'s three-night stay is cheaper at $599, though it requires changing planes in Amsterdam. Liberty Travel, (212) 689-5600, offers six nights, including air fare, from $699. The six-night Paris package offered by Air France's Jet Vacations, (800) 538-0999 -- which costs $215 for a stay at the tourist-class Vignon near the Place Madeleine -- includes a fashion show at Printemps, shopping discounts and a Seine cruise.
Austrian Airlines' three-night Vienna stay costs $575; six nights cost $729 (airport-hotel transfers are not included) at the Ibis Hotel, near the West Bahnhof. The price includes round-trip air fare from New York, and in the case of an $861 Vienna-Salzburg package, air transportation between the two cities.
Belgium's airline, Sabena, (800) 955-2000, has a four-night land rate at the deluxe Scandic Crown in Brussels from $175 only for the airline's passengers; until the end of the year a special round-trip fare from New York of $525 is good for stays of four to 21 days for those who buy a land package from the airline.
K.L.M.'s four-night Amsterdam stay is $759, including trans-Atlantic fare from New York. Three-night packages start at $597. Watch for sales; last December, K.L.M. lowered its three-night package by about $75. Another Amsterdam option is British Airways' London-Amsterdam combination, six nights for $457 (which includes the flights in Europe but not the trans-Atlantic fare).
Finnair, (800) 526-4927, offers Helsinki stays of three nights starting at $499 for January departures. The price includes air fare from New York and accommodations in the Hotel Strand Inter-Continental Hotel in central Helsinki.
Finnair has an eight-night Helsinki, St. Petersburg and Stockholm package, which starts at $999 (for departures in January and the beginning of December) and includes round-trip air fare, all transportation between cities and accommodations for three nights in St. Petersburg, two nights in Helsinki, one night in Stockholm and two nights aboard the Silja Cruise Line from Stockholm to Helsinki. Also included are guided tours, several dinners and a theatre performance in St. Petersburg.
Icelandair's two-night Helsinki special costs $457, including air fare, with accommodations in the first-class Hotel Esja or Loftleidir, a guided tour of Reykjavik and discounts on tours of the surrounding countryside. Additional nights can be added on for $33 a person Recently, Icelandair, (212) 967-8888, announced some short-notice fares to Luxembourg ($220 one way) Paris and Frankfurt ($260 for both) that must be booked within three days of departure. The same fare applies for the return flight, which also must be booked within three days of departure.
Continental has a six-night stay in Frankfurt at the tourist-class Altea Hotel, near the rail station in central Frankfurt, for $899, including air fare from New York. At the same price, a Germany fly-drive program includes renting a Fiat Panda at Kemwel with unlimited mileage and six nights at hotels across Germany.
S.A.S., (800) 221-2350, has two-night packages from Newark to Copenhagen for $455, to Stockholm for $485 and to Oslo for $475. Two-night, three-day cruises between a choice of Scandinavian cities are available for $125 a person sharing a double cabin and includes breakfasts and dinners.
 
Southern Europe
 Italiatour, (800) 237-0517, the in-house tour operator for Alitalia, is offering a three-night stay in Rome starting at $69 for three nights or $99 for five nights in the tourist-class Porta Maggiore, which is in a residential area near the central rail station. The package includes sightseeing tours and a Best of Italy card for discounts at selected stores and restaurants. Italiatour also books Rome's first-class Beverly Hills Hotel, near the Villa Borghese, at an increase of $40 a person, or $109 for the three nights. (Regular 1991 rates at the Beverly Hills are about $258 a night for a double, or about $375 a person for three nights.) There is also an eight-night Rome-Florence-Venice package starting at $399, which includes accommodations and transportation between the three cities.
British Airways, (800) 247-9297, offers several "London Plus . . ." options, which combine three nights in London with three nights in another European city (additional days can be added on to either city). In southern Europe, those cities include Madrid (from $664), Nice (from $635) and Venice (from $719). Prices include air transfers between the two cities, sightseeing expeditions and guidebooks. Trans-Atlantic air fare is not included.
K.L.M. and Austrian Airlines have similar arrangements. Using Amsterdam as the base city, K.L.M., (800) 777-1668, combines one night in Amsterdam with three nights in Barcelona (from $999) or Rome (from $819). Prices include round-trip air fare from New York, as well as the flight within Europe. Austrian Airlines, (800) 843-0002, has a six-night Vienna and Venice combination starting at $1,047, which also includes all flights.
More and more tour companies are offering apartments. Cavalcade Tours, which books its packages through travel agents, is charging a weekly rate of $126 for a studio apartment in Alvor, Portugal (in the Algarve). Sun Holidays, (800) 243-2057, offers extended apartment stays in a high-rise by the beach in Torremolinos on the Costa del Sol in Spain. Studio apartments there cost $799 a person for two weeks and $1,149 for six weeks. The price includes round-trip air fare from New York on Iberian Airlines. Additional weeks are $89 a person.
Other options in southern Europe include American Airlines' six-night land package in Madrid from $325 a person, Cavalcade's Lisbon four-night air-land package for $699, and Sun Holidays' six-night package to Barcelona and Mallorca for $1,025, including air fare from New York. TAP airlines and Abreu (800)223-1580, are offering a six-night air and land package in Cascais (about 30 minutes from Lisbon) for $693 through the end of February.
 
Eastern Europe
 Not only foreign tourists but also Germans and worldwide business people are flocking to Berlin. Perhaps because the city is, according to a Lufthansa spokeswoman, Lucille Hoshabjian, "the most popular destination in Germany today" bargain packages for that city are hard to come by. Lufthansa and Northwest, among other airlines, offer Berlin hotels at favorable rates. Among its "London Plus . . ." itineraries, British Airways combines three nights in London with three in Berlin starting at $724, including round-trip air fare between London and Berlin. Additional nights at the Hamburg Hotel cost $79 a person.
General Tours, (800) 221-2216, is offering a six-night air and land tour to Budapest and Prague from $899 to $1,099 (prices depend on departure date), including round-trip air fare from New York on Czechoslovak Airlines. Accommodations are in the first-class Hotel Korona in central Budapest near the National Museum, and in the new Atrium Praha hotel on the right bank of the River Vltava in central Prague. English-speaking guides, sightseeing tours and air transportation between the two cities are included.
Austrian Airlines has an eight-night package combining two nights in Budapest, two nights in Prague, three nights in Vienna and one night aboard the train between Budapest and Prague. The price, starting at $1,187, includes round-trip air fare from New York, sightseeing tours, rail travel and accommodations in first-class hotels. The airline also offers a six-night Prague-Vienna package starting at $977, and six nights in Budapest and Vienna for $838; both include round-trip air fare.

Hip-Hop's Prophets of Rage Make Noise Again

BYLINE: By JON PARELES

 BODY:
Public Enemy always wanted to be significant. From its first album, "Yo! Bum Rush the Show" in 1987, the group marketed itself as a distillation of black anger and resistance. It set out to be the voice of a community, not just one more posse of boasters; its logo, drawn by the group's main rapper and writer, Chuck D. (Carlton Ridenhour), was a silhouette of a black man in a rifle's crosshairs, and for millions of people that logo is now as recognizable as the CBS eye or the Coca-Cola wave. Public Enemy has become a self-made and self-conscious symbol, hip-hop's "prophets of rage."
Significance can weigh down a band, making songwriters didactic and overly deliberate; look what happened to Bruce Springsteen. Yet significance can also help performers grow up faster and think harder. Both happen on Public Enemy's fourth album, "Apocalypse 91 . . . the Enemy Strikes Black" (Def Jam/CBS 47374; all three formats). 
 This time out, the lyrics tend to stick to one topic -- slavery, alcoholism, individual responsibility, black economic self-sufficiency -- instead of zapping between ideas and inside references, while simulated radio and television sound bites drive home the lessons. Generally Chuck D. and his sidekick Flavor Flav (William Drayton) are weighing their words; the group has dropped divisive Black Muslim rhetoric, though it is by no means conciliatory. And while Public Enemy is now consolidating its sonic revolution instead of inventing new idioms, its latest songs are still packed with rhymes and noise.
Public Enemy's impact has as much to do with its sound as with its words. Chuck D.'s deep, booming voice, caroming off the beat in intricate metrical schemes, has a preacher's power and a boxer's jabbing attack; Flavor Flav offers regular-guy affirmation and comic relief. Their producers, the Bomb Squad, stack up riffs in music that turns abrasive noise into attention-getting hooks (and, when played on overloaded boom boxes and car stereos, back into even more abrasive noise).
By making America's racial tensions its central subject, Public Enemy has pushed plenty of hot buttons. Some fans equate the group with the cause of justice for blacks, placing Public Enemy above any disagreement or criticism. And some detractors, projecting their own guilt or fears, have imagined a group whose entire message is one of racial hatred.
With songs that mix political, personal and promotional statements in quick-cutting, often oblique language, Public Enemy has always been more complicated than that. Most of its messages have to do with black pride and black nationalism, and insist that the black community must unite to claim what it has earned. That message and the confrontational music are finding listeners. "It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back," released in 1988, and "Fear of a Black Planet," released in 1990, have each sold 1.3 million copies, and the group's success has spawned a whole wing of radical rappers.
Public Enemy has often been political without being politic. Its first two albums had a sexist streak, partially corrected on the third album with "Revolutionary Generation." Apparent endorsements of Louis Farrakhan (in "Bring the Noise" and "Don't Believe the Hype"), the Nation of Islam leader, have troubled non-believers; Chuck D. has said he supports Mr. Farrakhan's emphasis on black self-sufficiency, not his anti-Semitism. Public Enemy has made some missteps, particularly a ruckus over anti-Semitic interview statements by an employee who was eventually fired, and a few ambiguous lyrics reacting to the incident. Those slips have been widely publicized, sometimes with distortions that seem to validate the distrust for the press that Public Enemy proclaimed back in 1988 with "Don't Believe the Hype."
The title of "Apocalypse 91 . . . the Enemy Strikes Black" reveals the album's direction, as it denounces self-destructive behavior within black America. In one segment, a country-fiddle tape-loop plays as the Southern-accented voice of one "Bernie Cross house" of the Ku Klux Klan thanks black "gangs, hoodlums, drug pushers and users" for helping the Klan's mission by wiping themselves out. Chuck D. said in an interview in Spin magazine, "This record is the one where we deal with the problems we've got with us. Black accountability."
Is this the neoconservative Public Enemy? Not at all. Public Enemy's exhortations to self-improvement don't claim that blacks created their own problems or that discipline and bootstrap enterprise are cure-alls, and "Jack" -- the group's non-denominational nickname for white supremacists -- still lurks behind systemic discrimination. When Public Enemy decries alcoholism in "One Million Bottlebags," with horn squeals bouncing woozily from speaker to speaker, sound bites contend that alcohol is marketed disproportionately to black consumers, a situation Chuck D. calls "genocide."
But consumers aren't free of blame; he continues, "Plan that's designed by the other man/ But who drink it like water?" In "Shut 'Em Down," about the lack of black-owned businesses, he mentions how hard it is for black entrepreneurs to get start-up loans.
New songs also look beyond the ghetto. "By the Time I Get to Arizona," with a slow, buzzy clavinet riff, denounces Arizona's refusal to honor Martin Luther King Jr. Day. "Can't Truss It" is Afrocentric history, with Chuck D. imagining himself as cargo in the slave trade. Its desolate-sounding backup riffs are unsettling, but the singsong rhyme lacks momentum.
From its black-to-black perspective, "Apocalypse 91 . . . the Enemy Strikes Black" returns to familiar Public Enemy topics. "Nighttrain," a harsh, atonal stomp with a sung chorus and beeping Morse code in the mix, picks up one of the messages of the last album's "Welcome to the Terrordome." It asserts, "You mustn't just put your trust in every brother," especially thieves, drug dealers and Uncle Toms. "Move," with a dense, propulsive funk beat, free-associates among boasts and warnings: "If ya draggin' us down with the wack attitude/ Get up, look out, get out the way/ Move!"
Public Enemy also continues its electronic counterattack against mass-media clout. "How to Kill a Radio Consultant," with a dense, swirling mix of horns and voices and scratching, is its latest denunciation of radio stations that won't play rap; "More News at 11" is about watching black-on-black violence on television. In "A Letter to the N. Y. Post," Flavor Flav and Chuck D. denounce the newspaper's front-page coverage of Flavor Flav's arrest for assaulting his girlfriend: "Put my address in the paper 'cause I smacked that girl." (He pleaded guilty to third-degree assault and was sentenced to 30 days in jail; she was granted an order of protection against him.) Unfortunately, the song goes on to a homophobic digression that praises James Cagney as a gay-basher.
That's the only lapse on "Apocalypse 91"; otherwise, Public Enemy seems determined to avoid pointless contention. And the album ends by reaching out to white suburban audiences with a remake of "Bring the Noise" in collaboration with Anthrax, the speed-metal band whose pummeling guitars fit perfectly with the Bomb Squad's sirens and funk. Although both Anthrax and Public Enemy are million-sellers, the fusion of two grating bands from two fringes seems less commercially calculated than previous rap-rock partnerships.
Except for the Anthrax collaboration, "Apocalypse 91" doesn't make any musical or literary quantum jumps; it's a high-level holding action. But Public Enemy can still lead the radical rap movement it started. It shows the competition how to create agitprop that goes beyond sloganeering, in hip-hop whose sound is as insurrectionary as its words.

HEADLINE: Prices Decline as Gentrification Ebbs

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
IT was in 1986, near the height of New York City's real estate boom, when Victoria Irwin paid $125,000 for her 400-square-foot studio in the Christadora House, a newly refurbished 17-story condominium on Avenue B in the East Village. Her eighth-floor windows were directly over Tompkins Square Park.
"I knew there was some gentrification going on, but it didn't bother me," recalled Ms. Irwin, who is married to Mayor David N. Dinkins's press secretary, Leland Jones. She said the things that attracted her to the East Village then -- and still do -- are its diversity, bohemian spirit and resistance to change. 
 But by the summer of 1988, the dark side of that bohemian spirit became clear. In several violent clashes with the police that started in Tompkins Square Park, rioters made the Christadora House a symbol of what they considered the evils of gentrification, hurling bricks through its lobby windows, shouting obscenities at its residents and painting the epithet "Die Yuppie Scum" on its exterior.
Now, Ms. Irwin, a freelance writer, is one of a growing number of scholars, real estate executives, advocates for the poor and financially squeezed property owners who are witnessing the end of gentrification and are turning their attention anew to its checkered impact.
"I still think the East Village will get better, but I wish I could find a buyer," she said. Since marrying Mr. Jones in 1988, she has lived in Queens, rented the studio out on a month-to-month basis and tried, so far in vain, to sell it, even at a loss.
In some corners of the city, the experts say, gentrification may be remembered, along with junk bonds, stretch limousines and television evangelism, as just another grand excess of the 1980's.
"There was clearly a tendency to over-reach," said Peter Salins, a professor of urban planning at Hunter College. "Whether we are better or worse off because of gentrification is a judgment call. But what we ended up with at the peak of the cycle was a bunch of naive entrepreneurs, and the economic downturn has only exacerbated their problems."
Although the good and bad of gentrification may always be in dispute, all agree that the process has halted, at least for the time being. Nowhere in the New York area are waves of developers, investors and affluent young professionals moving to squalid, low-income neighborhoods as they did starting in the 70's and in greater numbers in the 80's.
As a legacy, some late blooming neighborhoods have been left with uncertain futures. When newly converted co-ops and condominiums sit on the same blocks as boarded-up buildings and garbage-strewn lots, it is difficult to foresee whether values will be set by the bad or the good.
At its height, gentrification moved in many directions at once. By the end of the last decade, the Lower East Side, the blighted blocks of Clinton west of Times Square and the Manhattan Valley section of the Upper West Side had all felt at least a first wave of speculative investment, co-op and condominium conversion and affluent young residents.
So had Fort Greene, Prospect Heights and Clinton Hill in Brooklyn and parts of Hoboken and Jersey City.
WHERE the process began in the 70's and was well advanced by the mid-80's, experts say, building improvements, new stores and higher levels of homeownership appear to have brought permanent improvement. They point to the Upper West Side from 86th Street to 96th Street, SoHo, Park Slope and Hoboken, all areas where, as recently as the 70's, buildings were abandoned and entire blocks blighted.
But the neighborhoods where gentrification came late have been particularly hard hit by city's economic downturn.
"As the dust settles, we can see that the areas that underwent dramatic turnarounds had severe limitations," said Elliott Sclar, a professor of urban planning at Columbia University. "Rich people are simply not going to live next to public housing."
Recent case studies of the Lower East Side and Manhattan Valley -- bounded by Amsterdam Avenue, 96th and 110th Streets and Central Park West -- provide a detailed look at what happened in the 80's and raise new questions about the fate of those neighborhoods in the 90's.
"When people visit, they often comment on how much better the block looks," said Teresa Kilbane, program director of the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board, a low-income housing group. "But if you ask the people who were forced out of the neighborhood, the opinion would be different."
Ms. Kilbane, who has lived in a railroad flat on 105th Street off Amsterdam Avenue since 1980, has analyzed rising property values and displacement of poor residents from Manhattan Valley.
A study on the Lower East Side released last week by Frank DeGiovanni, a professor of city planning at the New School for Social Research, tracked a fivefold increase in the prices paid by landlords for apartment buildings between 1980 and 1988, to an average of $43,000 per unit. It also showed the start of a downward cycle in 1989, when the average dropped to $40,000 per unit.
In the aftermath of the steep price increases, he said, there may be a reduction in maintenance and services by landlords who bought their buildings at the peak.
"The supposition is that landlords are in a bind, and can't afford to maintain their buildings," he said.
While the landlords are being squeezed, the sharpest impact has come in a steep decline in co-op and condominium values.
Both the East Village and Manhattan Valley "have begun to revert to their former state," said Clark Halstead, president of Halstead Properties, a Manhattan brokerage. He refers to the process now under way as "degrentrification."
Property values have plummeted throughout the city, as much as 30 percent in some neighborhoods. But in the partially gentrified areas, he said, the decline has been steeper. Some apartments have sold for half what their owners paid; some seem unsalable at any price.
The decline is reflected in several current listings. One is Ms. Irwin's. She began asking $132,000 for her studio in 1988 and has since lowered the asking price to $115,00, but has not had a bid.
Another owner in the Christadora House bought her 1,100-square-foot, two-bedroom apartment for $270,000 in 1986 has been trying to sell it for 14 months. She first asked $305,000 and has lowered her price to $260,000. Her only offer so far, which she rejected six months ago, was for $220,000.
Two blocks away, on 11th Street between Avenue A and Avenue B, the owner of a two-bedroom co-op on the top floor of a renovated five-story tenement has received a bigger blow. He paid $186,000 for it a year ago and has been trying to sell it for four months at $89,000. So far, no takers.
Manhattan Valley is experiencing a similar decline. The neighborhood has for decades been populated by low- and middle-income Dominican immigrants and Puerto Ricans, residents of 2,057-unit Frederick Douglass Houses, a public housing complex, and students at Columbia University.
Real estate executives say the gentrification of the neighborhood began in earnest in 1983 after William Zeckendorf Jr., the developer, opened a 35-story condominium, the Columbia, at 96th and Broadway. The apartments sold out quickly. While the Columbia falls just outside the boundary of Manhattan Valley, as the first new market-rate housing construction anywhere nearby in decades it encouraged investors to move north of what had been regarded as the upper limits of Manhattan affluence, 96th Street.
"Ninety-sixth was considered a demilitarized zone," said Andrew West, an accountant and real estate broker who became an investor in Manhattan Valley in 1987, buying insider rights to several apartments in a building being converted to condominiums at 102d Street and Central Park West.
He then sold his interests in all the apartments except a large two-bedroom with two bay windows that command a sweeping view of Central Park. Although he declined to say how much he paid for the apartment, he said he was offered $420,000 in 1989, which, henow sorely regrets, he turned down.
"When I bought I expected the whole area to be gentrified and to attract a better class of people and services," he said. But over the last two years, "Manhattan Valley has really been hit."
Now, Mr. West and his wife, Lisa, who have two children, want to move to the suburbs. But first they must sell the apartment. They began listing it for $330,000 in May and have not received an offer.
To be sure, the partially gentrified neighborhoods have in some ways been stabilized by the real estate slump because their new residents, like the Wests, cannot afford to move.
"The growth of these neighborhoods may have halted, but it is not in retreat," said Mr. Salins. "The yuppies are not moving back to Cleveland or Great Neck."
Some of the fashionable boutiques and restaurants that followed the affluent newcomers have come and gone. In the most dramatic exodus, more than 25 galleries that sprang up in the East Village in the early 1980's, making the remote, squalid blocks from Avenue B to Avenue D an international center of avant-garde art work, have left, most of them taking space in the better established gallery center of Soho.
"I moved because the location became inaccessible to most customers," said Pat Hearn, owner of Pat Hearn Gallery, which she operated on East Ninth Street between Avenue C and Avenue D from 1985 to 1988, then moving to Wooster Street off Broome Street. Although her rent was not raised on East Ninth Street, she said many of the other gallery owners left because their East Village landlords tried to impose large increases.
STILL, many of the new businesses have remained. In the East Village, which has for decades supported a rich diversity of ethnic restaurants, new sidewalk cafes and nightclubs line the blocks near Tompkins Square Park. Dry cleaners, video stores, fruit and vegetable stalls and other retailers are thriving. On Avenue A between Sixth and Seventh Streets in the East Village, and at 110th Street and Central Park West in Manhattan Valley, new supermarkets have been in business since the mid-80's, providing the first full service food distribution in each neighborhood.
And while some analysts, including Mr. DeGiovanni, maintain that the recent spate of investment in rental buildings may leave some financially squeezed landlords unable to maintain their buildings, tenants' rights advocates say the landlords appear to be working harder to keep their tenants.
"My impression is that there has not been an upsurge in complaints," said one analyst who has repeatedly charged landlords with neglect and harassment, Michael McKee, director of the New York State Tenants and Neighborhood Coalition. Because of the depressed real estate market, in which landlords are unable to raise rents when their most expensive apartments become vacant, "they are not eager for vacancies," he added.
Thus, the jury remains out on gentrification's impact. But while the process has halted, academic research is providing the first detailed assessment of how it changed the demographics and economic makeup of neighborhoods in the 1980's.
Mr. DeGiovanni, who did his study for the Community Service Society, focused on 446 rental apartments in 335 buildings on the Lower East Side, from the East Village to Chinatown. He interviewed the tenants of the apartments and analyzed property transfers, first in 1984 and again 1989.
He found that a third of the apartments changed hands and that 77 percent of the people moving into the neighborhood were white or Asian. The biggest outmigration was among Spanish-speaking people and those from Spanish-speaking countries, who represented only 19 percent of those moving in and 34 percent of those moving out.
Income levels rose sharply. Prof. DeGiovanni said 37 percent of those who moved into the neighborhood had incomes over $20,000 a year, compared to only 14 percent of those who moved out. Indeed, 51 of those who moved out were living in poverty, with household incomes under $10,000 a year.
In his interviews, Prof. DeGiovanni said he asked the tenants about their problems with heat, hot water and services in what he called a "scale of probable harassment" by landlords. The results suggested that tenant-landlord relations were improving, with 42 percent of the tenants describing serious problems in 1984 and only 30 percent in 1989.
But, he said, that finding could be misleading because "it may be that a lot of unhappy people are not showing up because they have already been harassed and they are gone."
Ms. Kilbane did her study of Manhattan Valley in 1989 as a master's degree thesis at Columbia University. She said her research was focused mainly on gentrification's impact on the poor through displacement and rising rents.
She found that investors in rental buildings raised rents rapidly either through the illegal harassment of tenants and the resulting vacancies, or through renovations that entitled them to rent increases under state guidelines. In tracking the increases, she analyzed the rents asked for all apartments in the neighborhood that were advertised in The New York Times or The Village Voice.
She found that average rents for two-bedroom apartments soared, from $200 a month in 1978 to $1,124 in 1988.
In that same period, she said, 28 apartment buildings in the neighborhood were converted from rentals to co-ps or condominiums, with the bulk of the conversions in the mid-80's. By far the steepest price increases came just as the decade was beginning, with the prices paid by outside purchasers soaring 363 percent from 1979 to 1982, and increasing only 46 percent during the following six years.
Three years after her academic research, Ms. Kilbane, still a resident and an advocate for the poor, said the process of gentrification has reached an uneasy impasse.
"People who bought into the neighborhood are inclined to stay put because they are not about to take a big financial loss," she said. As for the other, longer-term residents, she said: "Gentrification hasn't done as much damage as we feared. Perhaps because it has ground to a halt."

HEADLINE: Perspectives: New Midtown Rentals;
A Developer Rides the Market's Waves

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
TO others it fell to build hotels, office buildings and condominiumized apartment buildings in and around the theater district in central Manhattan in the 1980's. Jason Carter took a different tack.
On the land where Mamma Leone's restaurant once stood he put up a 44-story rental apartment house last year, thinking that with all that commercial activity coming to the Broadway area there would be a surge in young professionals in midtown who would appreciate the opportunity to walk to work. 
 "You want to make it in Manhattan?" he said. "You walk to work."
Walking saves time, he says, and time for work is what the ambitious need. Mr. Carter, 42 years old, practiced what he now preaches long before he built the 479 apartments at 235 West 48th Street that he named the Ritz Plaza. He started a career as a commercial broker 17 years ago by walking to work from his apartment in a plywood shack at the edge of a third-floor tennis court at 410 East 54th Street. He built the shack himself as a studio apartment. For most of the two years he lived in it he made more money as a tennis pro than as a leasing agent.
Now the downward swing of the rental market makes the biggest development achievement of his career something of a financial albatross. If a buyer came along with $110 million he would sell the Ritz Plaza tomorrow. That would free up the millions of dollars he plowed into the project, earned in brokerage commissions and condominium sales in Battery Park City and gut rehabilitations in SoHo. But the current level of rents does not justify the price.
Whatever happens on the financial side, the Ritz Plaza will remain a monument to the development initiatives inspired by the growth and confidence prevailing in Manhattan in the middle 80's. Mr. Carter is one of the handful of youthful developers unrelated to a New York real-estate family who made their mark in that period.
Some have lost their buildings to lenders, and with them all or most of their investment. Mr. Carter remains the owner, and operates in effect as the custodian or manager of the property for the mortgagee, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, earning no interest on his equity while trying to build the rent roll. H.U.D. insured the loan and has taken it back from the bank that issued it.
The seed that gave rise to the Ritz Plaza was planted in 1981, when Mr. Carter bid successfully at a city auction for a theater at 225 West 48th Street. The Shuberts had opened it as the Ritz in 1928. It evolved into the Robert F. Kennedy Theater for Children and a television studio before the city foreclosed. It sits on a plot 80 feet by 100 feet.
The theater's unutilized development rights appealed to Mr. Carter, but not to the competing bidder, Jujamcyn Theaters. Its representatives were apparently unauthorized to compete to the $1.6 million level at which he bought the property. Even before the closing, however, Jujamcyn had agreed to buy the theater from Mr. Carter at his bid price. Then, as partners, they rehabilitated it as the Ritz Theater in 1982. Seven years later Jujamcyn did more restoration and reopened it with a new name, the Walter Kerr.
The sale to Jujamcyn did not include the unutilized development rights that Mr. Carter also acquired when he bought the property at auction. "I saw the market moving west, and I had 80,000 square feet of development rights to peddle," he said. "Ultimately I bought my own air rights."
He also added to them. The zoning lot for the Ritz Plaza includes 80,000 additional square feet of rights from the Eugene O'Neill theater, directly north of the Mamma Leone's land. Owning all these rights not only gave more size to the project but also protected tenants' views from from possible future development.
And they gave the Ritz Plaza room for a central core and for a protruding section of the slab-like tower at the rear, giving double exposures to more apartments. There are balconies for almost all apartments, an indoor pool and health club, two garages for 164 cars, and 25,000 square feet of office space. The architect is the Manhattan firm of Schuman Lichtenstein Claman & Efron.
AT first, residential renting was vigorous. Renters' incomes -- averaging $90,000 a year for the first 100 apartments -- were at a level that seemed to justify the project's mortgage. One-bedroom apartments account for 400 of the building's 479 units and they were renting for an average of $1,600 a month.
But rents have tumbled generally in Manhattan. At the Ritz Plaza, vacancy rents currently average $1,450 a month and the household income of new tenants is in the range of $55,000 to $80,000 a year. Half of Mr. Carter's tenants are leasing apartments in Manhattan for the first time; about 35 percent of them will move out after a year. Almost all tenants take one-year leases only. The turnovers plus the building's 40 never-rented apartments put the vacancy rate at 15 percent.
In a key step to assist the development fiscally, Mr. Carter bought and gut-rehabilitated four buildings with 129 apartments in Harlem, and transferred to the Ritz Plaza the 421a tax benefits available for the creation of low-income housing. The effect of generating long-term tax savings of about $30 million is to free more building income for debt service. Nevertheless, "There is no way of retrieving any equity until the building increases in value," said Mr. Carter.
The son of the owner of a car dealership on Long Island, Mr. Carter began his real-estate career in a time-honored manner, doing "cold canvasing" for office tenants. He would make a thousand phone calls a week to office occupants, getting their names from building directories and offering assistance in a move. After one year his commissions totaled zero.
But a few deals materialized the next year. One was a move by Doyle Dane Bernbach, the advertising firm, into 10 floors at 11 West 42d Street. He learned of the firm's space needs from a tennis pupil. Colleagues at City Center Real Estate Inc., for whom he was then working, were the co-brokers.
Other office leases and a stint with Williams Real Estate followed, until, he said, "I realized that the landlord who paid you was on a better side of the fence than I was."
Mr. Carter took 14 night courses in real estate at the New York University School of Continuing Education in the 70's. He started in development by taking a long-term lease from the Plaza Hotel on the seven-story building at 22 Central Park South and gutting its upper floors to create 23 apartments. The financing for that became possible once he had negoiated a lease with a ground- floor restaurant at three times its previous rent.
Over the years Mr. Carter has done 12 gut renovations and, mostly with partners, nine new buildings. Several of the renovations were on Greene and Wooster Streets in SoHo. He was designated for two sites in Battery Park City, ultimately developed as 121 condominiums in partnership with William Zeckendorf Jr. and World-Wide Realty at the height of the condominium market.
At bottom, a contracting economy is what is hurting the Ritz Plaza and the city real-estate market in general, in Mr. Carter's view and everyone else's. "Between 1990 and 1991 rents have dropped 10 percent," he says.
But a developer who cannot see the positive side cannot be a developer. "On the positive side," he says, "there are vacant or mostly vacant new buildings in midtown that will be tenanted in a year or two." Among these are 1585 Broadway, 750 Seventh Avenue and 1540 Broadway.
"The more the area gains recognition, the more people will come here," he said. As that happens, rents will rise. Developers who have held on will see daylight again.

HEADLINE: Concrete Virtues

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In on article on June 21, Diana Shaman wrotes about a 22-story residential building with school gyms on Third Avenue at 87th Street that is using steel structural members, rather than a cast-in-place reinforced concrete frame. 
 As a structural system, concrete does offer the ability to span over gym floors and also has the important advantage of offering a reduced story height which results in an over-all reduction in the height of the finished structure. This factor also allows a 5.5 percent cost reduction in the structural frame.
In New York City this type of construction also means something rather special: It allows local dollars to remain in town rather than to be sent to outlying areas where steel or precast units are prefabricated. And, coupled with this, it means more jobs for local union members who, in turn, will spend their money in the local area.
There are five other advantages that have contributed to the choice of concrete over steel for New York City high-rise construction:
Economy: For high-rise structures in New York City, concrete has always meant a savings of up to 10 percent over steel frame.
Design Freedom: Not only is concrete a plastic material that can follow the imagination of the designer, but it also offers a variety of surface colors and textures.
Early Starts: In reinforced concrete construction there is no waiting for shipments of steel nor delays due to fabricator's strikes. All materials are local and readily available.
Low Maintenance: Concrete surfaces can and should be left unpainted and are unaffected by moisture and weathering.
Fireproof Construction: Fires in New York City have dramatically shown the superiority of concrete over steel frame protected by sprayed-on fireproofing material. This is rewarded with a saving in insurance rates for concrete structures.

A BRAZILIAN sculptor, Jose Resende, is renowned in his own country, having had a dozen solo exhibitions there in the last 20 years and having participated in twice as many group shows, including three Sao Paulo Bienals. Abroad, he has been in the Venice Biennale (1989), a survey of Brazilian art in Paris (1987) and, come 1992, will be in Documenta Kassel, in Germany.
But only now is the artist making his debut in the United States -- at the Joseloff Gallery at the University of Hartford. This delay, though deplorable, is not surprising, for the balance of power on the international art scene usually reflects that in global economics. But that natural law has not deterred Latin American artists from commenting defensively and with some justification on the patronizing attitude taken by the United States to art from countries south of the Rio Grande. As the Uruguayan Conceptualist Luis Camnitzer once remarked, New York City is "the center of the empire," and "the measuring stick for success" is set "by the empire and not in the colonies." 
 All the same, many attempts have been made to set the record straight in North America, notably the recent "Latin American Spirit," a survey staged by the Bronx Museum of the Arts. This made it embarrassingly clear that there is more to Latin American art than the work of Diego Rivera, Rufino Tamayo, Matta, Fernando Botero and the others who have made it within the empire.
The show also demonstrated that artists in the other America have long since taken matters into their own hands by eschewing the folk art approach beloved by sophisticates in the more prosperous countries and taking the international route. The two Brazilian pioneers of this in the 1960's were Helio Oiticica and Lygia Clark, and Mr. Resende has followed in their footsteps.
At first glance, there is nothing exotic about his work: it could have been produced anywhere in the Western world. In one way, place has nothing to do with it, for the 11 pieces were done from scratch on the Joseloff premises. They are, however, re-creations of works done in Brazil, which may explain some of their disconcerting effect.
As John Singer Sargent defined a portrait by its effect on a picky patron -- a likeness with something not quite right about the nose -- Mr. Resende can be described as a process artist who comes across as an Eva Hesse or a Robert Morris manque. That impression digested, the viewer focuses on the manque part only to find that the differences are far greater than the similarities.
For one thing, Mr. Resende is profligate with materials. Even as artists in the north are beginning to react against the waste of natural resources, this one from the south uses leather and copper as if they were plastic and newspaper.
The largest of these untitled works consists of three hides on which are poured two horizontal pools of paraffin wax. Congealed within the pools is a jumble of leather thongs and the entire relief is suspended by more thongs. The leather, which would provide shoes for the proverbial Ethiopian (or Brazilian) village, is a pristine pink-yellow, except where the wax has spilled and darkened it. As for the wax, it suggests windows of frosted glass, while the thongs could be vines closing from the outside.
In a floor piece, the leather plays the part of three giant lily pads and the wax the milky liquid retained by their curly edges. An argument could be made for a connection between these two works and the wonderful excesses of equatorial vegetation. Nature may also have been the unconscious inspiration for the seven-foot-tall cylinder of wax that is corked by a bundle of fresh leather and in which thongs turned black are imprisoned like insects in amber.
Though Mr. Resende studied at the College of Architecture and Urbanism at one university and taught for 10 years in a college of the same name at another, his sensibility seems anything but urban. He includes a snake sliding down the wall to the floor that is a stream of polished lead in which wire brushes are imbedded at regular intervals. His response to Giacometti is a figure made of blackened steel bars connected by eye hooks that is clambering onto a 30-foot-long wall made with bales of hay.
Then there is the ball of lead and copper wire that reposes in a small lake of motor oil. Twisted cables connect the receptacle to a slanted copper tube overhead that in turn is suspended from the wall by a single cable. It could be the playful invention of a farm worker with time on his hands. The difference between this and the "Venus" that greets the visitor at the entrance to the gallery is staggering. A 20-foot-tall torso with legs doing a split, the figure is cut from black steel and has a spiral of lead wrapped around the waist and each thigh. This is a monument that would look equally formidable in a jungle clearing or on a city plaza, and though not African in style, it bespeaks the African spirit that is said to infuse Brazilian life and customs.
Visitors who think "American art" upon entering the gallery will leave it not exactly enlightened about Brazilian internationalism, but they will be fully aware of its existence. As Elaine Barella says in her brochure introduction, Mr. Resende's vision is "universal in scope and specific in inquiry."
The works of Jose Resende remain through Oct. 9 at the Joseloff Galley at the University of Hartford in West Hartford.

HEADLINE: HOBOKEN JOURNAL;
In Mile-Square City, Buses Are Waging War for Commuters

BYLINE: By EDWARD SHANAHAN

DATELINE: HOBOKEN

 BODY:
EVERY weekday morning, as the sun rises over the Hudson River, a war is waged on the traffic-clogged streets of this mile-square city. It's not a drug war or a gang war. It's a bus war.
"I hate to use that term," said Lieut. John Aiello, commander of the Police Department's traffic division. "But that's pretty much what it seems like it's come to."
Hoboken residents who work in Manhattan don't have to race to catch their buses; one stops at each corner along Washington Street nearly every minute during the morning rush. 
 This glut of buses is a blessing to the city's large population of young professionals, many of whom moved to Hoboken because it allowed them to get out of New York City, but not too far out.
The quality of the ride varies from bus to bus, as does the price. Some buses offer air-conditioning in the summer, while others have only open windows. Fares range from $1.25 to $1.90. Paying top dollar does not always guarantee the most comfortable ride. For $1.25, a rider can sometimes get a plush, high-back seat on a retired touring coach.
 
'It's Great for Me'
 "It's great for me because I work at Rockefeller Center," said Mark Habersaat, a paralegal, as he waited for a bus at Washington and 12th Streets on a recent morning. "I usually don't have to wait more than two minutes for a bus. Today, I'm out here more than three minutes. That's unusual."
Competition for commuters has grown so fierce in recent years, however, that the city's Police Department is calling on state and Federal authorities to try to correct what it says is a dangerous situation.
"No question there's a demand for bus service," Lieutenant Aiello said. "But the way things have gotten, it's out of control. You have so many buses on Washington Street. They're all going after every passenger. We're having trouble maintaining safety."
 
State Agency Investigating
 Sonny Messina, head of the State Transportation Department's regulatory office, confirmed that the agency was investigating bus activity in Hoboken. "We're looking at the situation," Mr. Messina said. "That's all I'm going to say right now."
With three companies battling for as many as 10,000 riders every day, problems are bound to crop up on Washington Street, Lieutenant Aiello said. It certainly doesn't help that two of the companies fighting for passengers are owned by families that nurse a decades-old hatred for each other.
The kind of problems facing Lieutenant Aiello can be seen any morning between 6:30 and 9:30. During that peak period, 67 buses traverse the two-lane Washington Street every hour. Buses traveling south carry riders to the city's PATH train terminal. Northbound buses take commuters through the Lincoln Tunnel and into the Port Authority terminal on Eighth Avenue.
Because many people hop on whichever bus reaches them first, drivers have become adept at maneuvering the crowded main street in order to pick up as many passengers as possible. Drivers rarely pull up to the curb to load riders, often glide through red lights if they spy a sizable crowd of passengers ahead and invariably leapfrog one another in the frantic race to reach the next stop first, crossing Washington Street's center line to pass stopped competitors.
Sometimes, drivers from the same company team up to prevent a competing bus from moving forward. On a recent ride south on Washington Street, one passenger noticed that the bus he was riding had suddenly stopped at an intersection. The driver had stopped not to pick up passengers, but to block a competing driver in the oncoming lane from passing the bus in front of him.
"They violate the law every day," said a 76-year-old man who gave his name only as Charles. He spends many mornings sitting on benches at Washington Street bus stops, watching the cat-and-mouse maneuvers of the 50-seat buses up and down the crowded street. "The cops should be out here enforcing the laws," he said.
Though Lieutenant Aiello agreed that his officers could issue a slew of traffic summonses to bus drivers on a daily basis, he said he simply did not have enough manpower to fight the war. "I don't have enough men to control the buses," he said. "It would take half a dozen handing out tickets all morning long."
 
Beyond Traffic Violations
 While drivers for all three companies serving the New York route -- N. J. Transit, Red Apple Transit and Holiday Coach Touring -- violate the city's traffic laws to some degree, Holiday and Red Apple are by far the worst offenders, Lieutenant Aiello said.
Police records show that workers for the two companies have pushed the competition beyond mere traffic violations, vandalizing buses and assaulting one another. In some cases, drivers from one company have stopped their buses in the middle of Washington Street, sneaked up behind their competitors and disabled the vehicles.
"You need a shotgun to keep those guys apart," Lieutenant Aiello said, referring to the owners of Red Apple and Holiday. "It's always been like a Hatfield and McCoy situation."
Actually, it's a Sacco and Agresta situation. Joseph Sacco owns Holiday Touring and its local affiliate, Maria Transportation. Joseph Agresta and his cousin, William Errico, run Red Apple and Hoboken Transportation. The origin of their dispute is murky, but their hatred for each other is crystal clear.
"Agresta and Errico don't want us to make a living," said Keith Sacco, who helps his father run the family's bus business. "It's too late for us to reconcile."
Mr. Agresta maintains that the Sacco family isn't interested in providing service, only in hurting the competition for "personal reasons." Of his feud with the Saccos, Mr. Agresta said: "It's bad blood; that's all I can tell you. He's only in it for spite's sake."
The battle between the two families originally involved control of local bus routes, but escalated when the Federal Government deregulated interstate bus traffic in 1982.
"At that point, any small carrier could gain entry to any route," said Dennis Watson, a spokesman for the Federal Interstate Commerce Commission. "It meant anybody with vehicles and the proper insurance could go up against the big companies."
In Hoboken, deregulation meant that the simmering feud between the Agrestas and the Saccos was going to get hotter.
Until the laws governing interstate bus commerce were relaxed, N. J. Transit held a stranglehold on the New York route. In 1984 Mr. Agresta began running Red Apple buses into Manhattan. Mr. Sacco has tried several times to start New York service, most recently in January. N. J. Transit charges $1.90 each way for the 20-minute ride; Red Apple and Holiday each charge $1.25.
The added competition has had a big impact on N. J. Transit's ridership. The state-subsidized transportation giant currently carries about 59,000 riders a month on its 126 lines between Hoboken and the Port Authority Terminal. As recently as 1989, the 126 handled 109,000 passengers a month.
Neither Mr. Sacco nor Mr. Agresta could provide ridership figures, but each scoffed at the other's claim of carrying roughly 3,500 passengers a day.
 
Effects of Competition Felt
 "The regional economic downturn is responsible for some of our falloff," said Jeff Lamm, a spokesman for N. J. Transit. "But a lot of it is competition."
While the authorities keep watching them, Mr. Sacco and Mr. Agresta are watching each other. The companies are headed to court to try to settle their differences legally. Meanwhile, Keith Sacco has compiled a videotape of offenses he says were committed by Red Apple drivers against his buses, and Mr. Agresta and Mr. Errico spend their mornings driving Washington Street, monitoring the buses' maneuvers.
And how do riders feel about the bus wars?
"I don't notice how they drive," Eddie Curtis said. "I'm more concerned with getting to work."

HEADLINE: Wall Street;
Free Trade for Mutual Funds?

BYLINE: By Diana B. Henriques

 BODY:
The winds of globalization have swept away many of the barriers that corporations and brokerage houses once faced when they tried to trade securities or raise capital beyond their home market.
From London to Tokyo, from Toronto to Thailand, markets have opened their doors -- grudgingly, perhaps, but steadily -- to foreign money and foreign muscle. Foreign companies sell bonds and stock in the United States, and American firms compete for underwriting business abroad. Foreign currency trading follows the sun, influenced more by time zones than by national borders. Americans open bank accounts denominated in German marks; Asians invest in United States Treasury bills. 
 What's missing from this picture? Mutual funds, the favored vehicle for middle-class investors. Despite a decade of worldwide financial deregulation, trade barriers remain a stubborn fact of life for those who sell mutual funds and other "pooled investments." And unless regulators adopt a new approach to such funds, a leading industry official has warned, those barriers are likely to remain high for years to come.
David Silver, a former Securities and Exchange Commission lawyer who has been president of the Investment Company Institute in Washington since 1977, delivered his cautionary advice last week at the annual meeting of the International Organization of Securities Commissions, made up of market regulators from around the world.
A special panel on mutual funds was one of just eight "showcase" sessions scheduled by the regulators' group during the four-day conference -- a sign, Mr. Silver observed, of how important this type of investing has become on the world scene.
"Twenty years ago, it would have been extraordinary for this subject to have been included," he said. "Today, with worldwide mutual fund assets in excess of $2.5 trillion, it would be extraordinary for mutual funds not to be high on your agenda."
But despite the explosive growth, Mr. Silver said, "progress in cross-border sales of mutual fund shares has lagged far behind efforts toward easier cross-border transactions in other financial areas."
Mr. Silver placed at least half the blame for those difficulties on world securities regulators -- reserving the other half for the United States tax code, whose treatment of portfolio profits has made American mutual funds less attractive to foreign investors. But while Congress is weighing a change in the tax code, Mr. Silver predicted that little progress would be made on the regulatory front unless the watchdogs stop fretting about how a fund is organized and look instead at how well it protects investors.
Some countries -- including the United States -- require that mutual funds be organized as separate corporations, with boards of directors. Other nations permit "unit trust" organization, in which funds are simply products of the sponsoring management company. In that form, an independent trustee oversees the manager's actions on behalf of investors; in the corporate form, a board of directors has that oversight duty.
In Mr. Silver's view, the form a mutual fund takes is largely "an accident of history or cultural norms." Yet, typically, each nation will require that foreign mutual funds be organized the same way domestic funds are -- and will reject for domestic sale any fund that is organized differently.
Since that approach makes it unlikely that any fund could satisfy every nation, Mr. Silver suggested that regulators forget style and look at whether the fund provides investors with certain basic safeguards. Are there prohibitions on self-dealing by fund managers or their affiliates, limits on management fees and clearly disclosed investment policies and goals? Are fund assets safe from theft? Can shares be reliably priced and redeemed by investors? Is the capital structure simple and strong? Is accurate information supplied to new investors on a continuing basis?
Looking at countries around the world, Mr. Silver found considerable agreement on the need for these protections -- even where there were vociferous disagreements about which structure best provided them. For that reason, he said, "I am optimistic that by ignoring organizational structure and focusing on core investor protection concerns we can achieve greater success in breaking down existing barriers to cross-border mutual fund sales -- to the benefit of the world economy and to the world's investors."
And, of course, to the world's mutual fund industry. But at least one leading member of that industry is skeptical that cross-border sales are anything but a long-term prospect. Edward C. Johnson 3d, the chairman of Fidelity Investments' holding company and a participant in the regulatory panel, said he would be willing to tailor his funds to whatever rules the local authorities might cook up -- if they'd just let him compete on an equal footing with domestic fund companies.
What he frequently finds instead, he told the regulators, are vague administrative requirements that make it a practical impossibility to set up a profitable business even in markets that are ostensibly open. Fidelity has found most Asian markets, aside from Hong Kong, to be extremely inhospitable, he said, and has met with "only limited success" in Europe. "All I ask is to be treated like a local resident -- without advantage or disadvantage," he said.
"So while I support the idea of being able to sell a pooled investment in every single market," Mr. Johnson said, "in the practical world, it's going to be very hard to do -- unless we started saying to some of these countries that we would treat their exports to America the same way that we are treated there." After the panel concluded, Mr. Johnson expanded a bit on what he had in mind: "It just seems to me that, if Hyundai can sell cars here in America, I ought to be able to sell mutual funds in Korea. That's pretty simple, isn't it?"

HEADLINE: Forcing Salomon Into Buffett's Conservative Mold

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Warren E. Buffett, the vaunted Omaha investor, did not get what he bargained for when his Berkshire Hathaway company bought a $700 million stake in Salomon Brothers four years ago. Now, as Mr. Buffett scrambles to save the company, it is becoming clear that Salomon did not get what it expected either.
The new Salomon that Mr. Buffett is creating is likely to be a very different one from the old one -- smaller, less haughty and less inclined to take risks. That aversion to risk reflects Mr. Buffett's style, and may also reflect the nature of his investment, which will remain a safe one unless things get far worse than they are now. 
 But before he can forge the new Salomon, Mr. Buffett, now chairman, must assure its survival by finding ways around the four areas that are producing nightmares for some Salomon employees. They are:
* Government action. Foremost would be that the Government takes severe action against the firm. It is already a given that Salomon will pay huge civil penalties for violating the rules governing auctions of Treasury securities. But it hopes to retain its status as a primary dealer in Treasuries and to avoid criminal charges against the firm. Either action could severely weaken it, even lead to its failure.
* Massive staff defections. Important Salomon staff members who stick around through Dec. 31 will receive a share of a $100 million bonus pool put in place before the Treasuries scandal arose, as well as normal annual bonuses. But once January arrives and these financial handcuffs are off, there remains the possibility that large numbers of employees will walk. To counter this, Salomon plans to pay large bonuses to important staff members, despite the Congressional hostility and unfavorable publicity that is likely to result. And it will probably come up with an incentive plan putting more stock into the hands of some workers.
* Fleeing banks. Salomon does not now need new bank loans, in part because it has cut assets by $40 billion, back to the levels of last December. But it needs to preserve existing lines of credit, and to arrange additional financing backed by securities. If major banks agree to provide financing at reasonable terms, that would provide an important psychological lift. But if there are doubts about Salomon's long-term credit, some important areas of business could be closed off. This might not lead to the firm's failure, but it would certainly constrain it and leave it at a competitive disadvantage.
* Massive customer defections. When the Salomon scandal first arose, fear that customer defections could sink the firm were rampant. At this point, only a relative handful of customers have walked away, mostly government-related entities. But others have cut back their business, and Salomon knows that it will lose much of the business it has if people believe its customer relationships have withered to the point it will be difficult for it to distribute securities.
So far, none of these dire events have occurred. And if Mr. Buffett, armed with his reputation for integrity and a new management team, can hold them at bay, Salomon is likely to survive and could prosper.
Though Mr. Buffett and Deryck C. Maughan, the new chief operating officer, have been preoccupied with Salomon's problems and have had little opportunity to look forward, interviews with Salomon executives last week painted a portrait of a vastly different Solly.
 
Time for 'Tough Questions'
 "We will be more focused," said Mr. Maughan. "That means competing where we are strong." Marginal businesses, he said, will be cut off. He said he had not yet made much progress in identifying such businesses, but would do so before the end of the year. "Because we have had a large capital base," he added, "in the past we have not had to ask the tough questions."
Creating such a firm has the potential for considerable internal conflict, which could also affect business and hasten defections. Mr. Buffett has no experience as a Wall Street manager, and his conservative financial style clashes with that of Salomon.
Berkshire Hathaway, the company Mr. Buffett has built, owns $700 million in preferred stock, which could be converted into a 14 percent stake in Salomon at $38 per share. At the moment, with Salomon shares trading near $25, conversion is a long way off.
It is conceivable that the nature of this stake will reinforce Mr. Buffett's conservatism. In an annual report to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, he noted that the company would have done better if he had been willing to borrow more money. But he posed the hypothetical question of what he would do if he thought there was a 99 percent chance of raising profits by taking on more debt, and a 1 percent chance of results "falling somewhere between temporary anguish and default."
He answered this way: "We wouldn't have liked those 99:1 odds -- and never will. A small chance of distress or disgrace cannot, in our view, be offset by a large chance of extra returns."
It is fair to say that virtually any trader at Salomon would relish such odds.
Nonetheless, it is clear that Warren Buffett's Salomon will cut back on its debt level. Just before the crisis, every dollar of shareholder equity was supporting $37 of assets, with the rest of the money borrowed in one form or another. That ratio is down to around $27 now, and is likely to head lower.
To a large extent, the clock ticking the loudest for Solly is the staff bonus and defection question.
Mr. Buffett and Mr. Maughan have only three months to persuade the staff that there is a high likelihood of success in their efforts. If there are enough defections after Dec. 31, it is possible that none of the other questions will matter.
 
Can Managers Adapt?
 "There are a number of people who have lost faith, or who never had it, or who simply don't want to tough it out," Mr. Maughan said. "They will leave at the end of the year. But I am confident that the vast majority are willing to adapt to our new circumstances."
Other senior managers are not quite so confident. "It's tough to come in in the morning and open the paper. You just wonder when it is going to stop," said one executive. Another said he would stay, but added, "For the bulk of the employees, the critical question will be how much of the uncertainty has been taken out of the air."
The answer may be that not enough uncertainty has been removed, although Mr. Maughan vows that important decisions on the firm's priorities will be made by then. It is now virtually certain that the various Government probes will not be completed by the end of the year.
Salomon's fear of a criminal charge against the firm is based on the repercussions, not on the fine it would pay. States would line up to impose their own penalties and customers shy away from doing business with a convicted felon.
"I think we could survive a criminal charge, but it would be damaging," said Mr. Maughan. Salomon executives are quite aware that neither E.F. Hutton nor Drexel Burnham Lambert, the two firms that pleaded guilty to crimes in highly publicized scandals of recent years, is still in business.
Both of those firms fought the charges before eventually pleading guilty, and prosecutors came to feel that executives at the firms had tried to cover up the facts. Mr. Buffett's strategy has been to be open, hoping to win points by cooperation and by emphasizing that all those responsible for the violations are gone. The downside to that strategy is that there will be little hope for a defense if the Government decides to file charges.
The firm also hopes to regain its status as a primary dealer in Treasury securities. That is important not just because it is a profit center, but for the signal it would send from the Federal Reserve about the Government's official attitude to the new Salomon. "Our continued access to the secured borrowing markets could be impaired if our primary dealer status was removed," said John G. Macfarlane 3d, Salomon's treasurer.
So far, Salomon's strategy seems to have worked better with regulators than legislators. Both Richard Breeden, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, have praised the cooperation, encouraging hope at Salomon. But many key Congressmen have called for severe punishment of Salomon, and regulators know that if they seem to give the firm a break, there will be harsh criticism on Capitol Hill. On the other hand, if they are so tough that Salomon winds up severely damaged, it is hard to imagine any other firm choosing to cooperate in the future when it discovers violations.
Salomon is likely to further rile Congress when it awards bonuses this year. "It will not be radically different," said Mr. Maughan of the bonus plan, despite Congressional outrage at the huge pay some traders got last year. "We will pay for performance, as all Wall Street does." But there is talk that there will be a larger spread of bonuses, with top performers doing better than they might have expected, and lesser lights doing worse.
There is a school of thought in the firm that its compensation system, which paid one trader, Lawrence Hilibrand, $23 million last year, played a big role in the bond disaster. Mr. Hilibrand traded in the bond arbitrage department, using huge amounts of capital to seize trading advantages identified by computer programs. He did so under a deal the department had negotiated with the former top management, guaranteeing employees a share of the profits they generated.
The result, said a high Salomon official, was "a series of boutiques under one roof, as opposed to one firm." That reduced cooperation and customer service, he added.
For Salomon it is especially unfortunate that the illegal activities came in the heart of the firm. "The whole fixed income area is built on our strength in government bonds," said Eric R. Rosenfeld, a Salomon managing director who became head of the Government bond operation after the scandal broke.
One telling example: Competitors say Salomon used its strength in Treasuries to get World Bank business, then used that business to become a major underwriter of foreign government bonds. The World Bank has suspended Salomon until the end of October.
It is hard to overstate Salomon's position in the Government bond market. "They have an incredible franchise," said Raymond Mason, the chairman of Legg Mason, the regional brokerage firm based in Baltimore. "They were considered the premier bond firm in the country, certainly one of the best in the world, if not the best."
That position meant that institutions felt a Salomon relationship was a must. "They had a great set of customer relationships," said a top executive of a rival firm. "Every customer felt they had to do business with Salomon, or they would somehow miss out on important market information."
Salomon cultivated an image as a firm that would provide liquidity to the market when needed. If an institution wanted to get out of a big position in stocks or bonds, Salomon was almost certain to be on the list of firms that were called. It was the most likely one to make a bid, albeit one that could be well below the last trade in the security.
"Salomon is one of the few who will step up and take significant positions for their own accounts," said James A. Harmon, the chairman of Wertheim Schroder & Company, a competitor. "They take risks."
 
Signs of a New Caution
 Today, Salomon officials insist they stand ready to make markets, just like always. But speaking not for attribution, they concede they may be a little more cautious. If the perception spreads that Salomon is no longer willing to take risks, that could do more damage to the firm's franchise than the scandal has done. One of Mr. Buffett's challenges is to balance his own dislike of risk with Salomon's historic role.
Salomon's weakened financial position may have reduced the size of positions that can be taken, but so far it has not affected the willingness of others to trade stocks and bonds with it. But the same cannot be said of the markets in such highly complex areas as interest-rate and currency swaps. Taking a position in many of these markets involves a promise to make certain payments for up to seven years, and only those with the best credit ratings can play. Mr. Maughan says Salomon is determined to remain a player, but concedes it is now hampered.
Underwriting securities is one of the most vulnerable areas to scandal. Salomon officials say they had been scheduled as lead manager of one bank offering that will be announced soon, but were demoted to co-manager. There are at least two other underwriting assignments that the officials think they would have won but for the scandal.
The risk for Salomon is that as the uncertainty continues, its earnings capacity will wither while its fixed costs do not. If that happened, it might have to radically shrink to stay in business. But Salomon officials contend that will not be necessary.
"We will be a little leaner, but the basic business of being a full-scale financial intermediary will be there," said William A. McIntosh, a managing director in charge of sales management. "We intend to be a major participant in the stock and bond markets worldwide."
If it is to succeed at that, Salomon must first get by the Government hurdles, and then get its customers back. "Their brand name in the marketplace has been severely damaged," said Gordon S. Macklin, chairman of Hambrecht & Quist, and a former head of Nasdaq. "But if there is one individual who could restore credibility to a brand name, it is Warren Buffett. That could well limit the economic damage."
 
 
 
THE SALOMON SWAGGER
 There was a Salomon style in trading, and everyone knew it. It was big, bold and very confident.
"Part of Salomon's mystique was its macho kind of swagger," said a senior executive at a competitor. "They took multiples of risks on their desks," compared with other firms.
Managing traders taking such risks is a challenge, one that was largely met by executives who have now departed. Of the current leadership, said one competitor who refused to be named, only Stanley Shopkorn, the vice chairman in charge of equities, has proven he can do so.
Sometimes Salomon's style won praise, as when Salomon and Goldman Sachs agreed to buy stocks to counteract a wave of sell orders on Oct. 20, 1987, helping to halt the crash. But it was just as likely to stir outrage.
A classic example came in December 1986 when stock index futures were expiring. Conventional wisdom held that the expiration would cause a wave of selling, driving down prices.
In those days, firms were allowed, but not required, to disclose what trades they would execute at the close of trading to offset their positions in expiring futures. Salomon chose not to do so that month. As a result, other traders did not realize a lot of shares were waiting to be bought at expiration.
Prices rose at the close instead of falling and there were demands for an investigation. A lot of firms lost money, Salomon cleaned up and the rules were changed to keep such a thing from happening again.
It was that sort of action that created resentment of Salomon on the Street. "To the extent our hubris is the victim of the current events, so much the better," Deryck C. Maughan, Salomon's new chief operating officer, said in an interview last week.
Then, speaking of his success in building Salomon to the status of the most successful foreign firm in Japan, he said, "There was a less supreme attitude overseas."
 
 
 
HOW BERKSHIRE PLAYS IT SAFE

For Warren E. Buffett, Salomon Inc. was a new kind of investment. And despite all that has happened, it is unlikely to be a loser for Berkshire Hathaway Inc., the company he runs.
Mr. Buffett made his reputation investing in companies with secure market positions in solid businesses, and he tried to buy stocks when they were unpopular and cheap. Berkshire's 1.7 million shares in the Washington Post Company, to cite one example, were bought in 1973 at an average cost of $5.63. Now they trade for more than $200 each.
But by 1987, the stock market was booming and it was getting very difficult to find stocks that met Mr. Buffett's criteria. He had gone a couple years without a major common stock purchase.
So Berkshire tried a new strategy. It helped to fend off Ronald Perelman, who was threatening a raid on Salomon, by investing $700 million in Salomon preferred. Berkshire negotiated an unusually high dividend rate, considering the tax advantages of preferred stock, of 9 percent, and it received the right to convert the preferred to common, at $38 a share. If it did so, Berkshire would own 14 percent of the common, more than any other investor. But right now it owns no common stock.
A story went around that Mr. Buffett viewed the investment as a "Treasury bill with a lottery ticket attached." He denied saying that, but it did capture the flavor of the investment.
Berkshire later made similar investments in a number of companies. Only one, Gillette, has done so well that the lottery ticket became valuable.
Even in a worst-case scenario, it is hard to imagine Berkshire losing money on its Salomon investment. Salomon has common shareholders equity of $3.2 billion, enough to cover lots of losses from fines and operating setbacks. Only if that were wiped out would the preferred be in jeopardy. If it is not converted to common, Salomon must begin buying it back in 1995, and finish doing so in 1999.

COMPANIES
 
I.B.M.'s Strategy for the Future: Making Itself Indispensable 
 Last week, John Sculley, the chairman of Apple Computer, and James A. Cannavino, president of International Business Machines Corporation's personal systems group, explained their companies' joint strategies. They would release a powerful new operating system, called "Pink," which Apple developed. It will run on a new generation of flashy PC's the two companies would develop from I.B.M.'s chips. Also last week, I.B.M. announced a pact with the Thinking Machines Corporation, a maker of massively parallel supercomputers. Thinking Machines would modify its machines so they could plug into I.B.M.'s mainframes. I.B.M. would also supply Thinking Machines with chips. The announcements give a glimpse of how I.B.M. envisions the future -- as a network linked to supercomputers, through chips, mainframes and software I.B.M. controls. If it works, that puts I.B.M. everywhere.
 
A Foreign Stake in Time Warner?
 
Last week Steven J. Ross, chairman of Time Warner Inc., told shareholders that "serious and meaningful discussions were under way," with a potential foreign partner. A deal could be made before the end of the year, he said. Wall Street liked that. Time Warner's stock jumped $1.375 to $82.625. Time Warner, one of the few big American media companies not to take its orders from abroad, is sitting on a load of debt. Though it reduced what it owes by 22 percent this summer in a rancorous stock offering, the company still owes $8.5 billion. That, and the recession, have constrained growth and eaten into Time Warner's operations. Two weeks ago the company said it would lay off 600 editorial employees. The collective salaries of those employees, analysts were quick to point out after last week's meeting, equaled just half of Mr. Ross' annual compensation. Time Warner's stock finished the week unchanged.
 
A Costly Call for Bell Atlantic
 
When the Bell Atlantic Corporation announced last week it was buying Metro Mobile CTS Inc., a cellular telephone provider, it was a testament to its faith in the future. Like most cellular systems, Metro Mobile does not turn a profit, is loaded with debt and has few real subscribers. Bell Atlantic will pay nearly $2.5 billion for the company. Metro Mobile has 11.5 million potential subscribers in its service area (which includes children who don't drive yet), but so far only 180,000 have signed up -- slightly more than 1 percent. Bell Atlantic will pay what seems like a high price for all those potential subscribers -- $202 to $206 each. That is considerably higher than the last big deal: The Comcast Corporation's acquisition of the Metromedia Company's system last Spring at $193 per potential subscriber. Did Bell Atlantic pay too much? No, said Raymond W. Smith, Bell Atlantic's chairman. "It's worth a lot more than what we paid for it," he said.

Logo of a New Generation?
 
When what you sell is mostly sugar and water, you had better be good at marketing it. Last week the Pepsi-Cola Company made a move designed to do just that. It unveiled a snazzy new logo which it hopes will convey youth, vigor and -- by inference -- tell people Pepsi is everything it thinks rival Coca-Cola is not. It also hopes the new logo will be powerful enough to break through the visual clutter of the supermarket aisles. But not everybody thinks the new logo (a modified version of the old Pepsi bull's-eye) is all that dazzling. "The guy sitting next to me on the airplane said that it looks like the Korean flag," said Tom Pirko, president of Bevmark, a beverage consulting firm in Los Angeles.

Help for the Unstealthy Stealth
 
The end of the cold war may have caused cartographers to redraw their maps, but it has scarcely affected the Senate. Last week an amendment to stop the purchase of the B-2 Stealth bomber lost in a close vote. That was good news for the Northrop Corporation, which makes the plane and could sell 75 of them to the Air Force for $60 billion. The Senate is letting the B-2 fly even though its mission -- to sneak past dense clusters of Soviet radar -- is moot, as there is no longer a Soviet Union. The Senate also chose to ignore tests that said the Stealth shows up on radar. Don't worry about the radar, said the Air Force, it can be fixed. How much will that cost?

The Final Frontier: Tourism
 
In what could be called one of the century's more dubious scientific experiments, a crew of eight scientists were sealed inside the Biosphere in Oracle, Ariz., last week. The zoo-like $150 million glass structure was financed by oil heir Edward P. Bass (Edward's brother Sid is the businessman). Biosphere is filled with 3,800 species of plants and animals. As the experiment progresses, tourists will pay $9.50 to peer inside. If successful, Biosphere could start a theme park trend: Humans along with animals locked inside an exhibit.

 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Ammunition for Japan-Bashers
 
There are two schools of thought in Washington over what to do about Japan. One says Japan is just another country. The other says Japan is fundamentally different: An underdeveloped capitalist country with an overdeveloped industrial base. That school says watch out for tricks. Those in the Japan-is-different camp got some aid last week from the General Accounting Office, the auditing arm of Congress. The G.A.O., said 22 of 52 American companies interviewed reported difficultly or delays at least once when they tried to buy vital, high-tech computer devices from Japanese suppliers. Some of these delays led to big losses by the American firms. Japanese companies dismissed the report. "It contains very broad and vague allegations with some anecdotes sprinkled within," said David A. Huichital, of Nikon Precision, a division of Japan's Nikon Corporation.

A Scandal's Casualty
 
The scandals in the Japanese financial markets have made investors uneasy about investing there (the same can be said for New York, lately). Japan's biggest firms admitted wrongdoing but barely got a slap on the wrist. A few high-fliers took pay cuts -- briefly. But last week, after trying to tough it out by taking a pay cut of his own, Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's Finance Minister, is said to have told his party's leaders he would step down. Mr. Hashimoto has refused to comment.

Oil Prices Steady -- For Now
 
With batteries of Patriot missiles arriving in Saudi Arabia for what could be round two of Operation Desert Storm (if all goes wrong) the oil markets are nervous. Prices have been gyrating throughout the week to levels between $19 a barrel and $22 a barrel. To calm that market, Saudi Arabia said last week at the O.P.E.C. meeting in Geneva that it wanted to increase production by 10 percent. The goal, the Saudi delegation said, is to keep oil prices at about $19 a barrel. But many of O.P.E.C.'s other members objected. They want Saudi Arabia to cut its output. But "the Saudis got what they wanted and the others walked away empty handed," said Bahman Karbassioun, an oil economist. Unless there is war, consider the markets calmed.

Who Is Protecting Whom?
 
A Japanese typewriter manufacturer operating in the United States, Brother Industries (USA) Inc., asked the Commerce Department to protect it against competition from Smith Corona Corporation, a British controlled company also operating in the United States. Smith Corona uses a lot of parts from Singapore in its machines, but Brother uses more parts from abroad. The Commerce Department threw out Brother's request.
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY

 
Faith in the Future Wanes
 
If the economy is snapping back to life, as the Administration says it is, why are all those consumers so fearful? According to the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index, Americans have been losing faith in the future since June. The index, which measures consumer optimism, is a useful forecasting tool. Contented consumers buy, while gloomy ones shun all but the necessities. The index slipped from 78.0 in June to 76.1 in August and 72.1 in September. For consumers, the angst is over their pocketbooks. "The prime worry is jobs," said Fabian Linden, the director of the study.

No Air in Detroit's Tires
 
The United States still may be a car-culture country, but Detroit is not quickening very many pulses right now. Sales of American-made cars and trucks dropped 16.3 percent in mid-September. The annual selling rate since Labor Day, was 6.4 million vehicles. Though that is an increase from the period before (sales were at a 5.4 million annual rate just before Labor Day) it is still well below last year's 7.8 million rate.

Consumers Are Staying Stingy
 
Consumers may be dipping deeper into their pockets, but most of what they are coming up with is fluff. According to the Commerce Department, consumer expenditures in August nudged up an almost imperceptible 0.1 percent. Though personal income did slightly better -- it crept up 0.4 percent in August -- those gains were modest as well. The problem is that because consumers account for two thirds of economic activity, their reticent spending habits mean tepid growth at best.

An Unusual Way to Add Figures
 
The Administration has a novel way of reading the numbers. When the Commerce Department said last week that orders for big-ticket, durable goods fell by 3.8 percent, the Administration said: Don't worry. Take last month's numbers, combine them with the figures from the month before and average them together. If you do that, the statistics show "solid gains," said Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. To an economist like Mr. Boskin, if your feet are in the oven and your head is in the freezer, on average, your temperature must be O.K.

HEADLINE: Offshore Banking Gets New Scrutiny With B.C.C.I. Scandal

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH

DATELINE: GEORGE TOWN, Cayman Islands

 BODY:
For years, while other Caribbean islands concentrated on building resort hotels and duty-free shopping centers, a handful of tiny British possessions have quietly taken it upon themselves to become centers of international finance.
In less than two decades, the most spectacularly successful of the bunch, the Cayman Islands, have gone from being a well-kept secret of divers and deep sea fishermen to a tax-free and secret-keeping haven for most of the world's leading banks. The banks are attracted by the scarcity of requirements about financial reserves and waiting periods, as well as the absence of taxes. 
 Affluent Cayman Islanders can now boast that foreign-owned businesses registered on the island outnumber its 26,000 inhabitants.
But in the aftermath of the scandal surrounding the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, many residents of these prosperous slivers of coral and sand are wondering if the world's economic powers, eager to avoid future problems with lightly regulated offshore financial centers, will squeeze them out of business.
"Realistically, we have to say this is not going to help," said Nicholas J. Duggan, immediate past president of the Cayman Island Bankers Association. "B.C.C.I. will certainly increase the pressure on us, just as it has heightened awareness in the industry of the need for the highest standards."
Already, banking experts say, the United States and British Governments, the European Community, the Council of Europe, the Group of Seven and other leading international bodies have begun discussing measures to tighten regulation governing the world's offshore financial centers.
Although this island's strict confidentiality laws have kept many details of B.C.C.I.'s operations here shrouded in secret, banking experts say its George Town offices booked billions of dollars in international loans, many of them never to be repaid.
Like many of its other offices around the world, B.C.C.I.'s gilded headquarters here are now padlocked. A Cayman judge recently granted owners of the bank a three-month postponement of liquidation proceedings to come up with a rescue plan, but many doubt that such a plan will ever be carried out.
The region's offshore banking centers "were really shocked by the way this scandal developed and has continued to unfold," said Anthony P. Maingot, an expert in Caribbean affairs at Florida International University in Miami. "Now everybody is trying to get in the business of showing the world that they are aboveboard, but that is virtually impossible. Why do you think there is interest in offshore secrecy?"
B.C.C.I. had an affiliate here known as the International Credit and Investment Company. At first, regulators believed that it housed B.C.C.I.'s considerable charitable activities worldwide. But now, regulators here and in the United States believe it a hush-hush operation that covered up B.C.C.I.'s bad loans and trading losses.
Last year, even before the B.C.C.I. scandal broke, the British Government moved to reassert direct control over financial affairs in the neighboring islands of Montserrat, Anguilla and the Turks and Caicos.
In the late 1980's Montserrat, with a population of scarcely 12,000, suddenly became home to more than 350 offshore banks, many of them founded by Americans with little more to show than fancy stationery and a post office box. In the wake of the British action, only about 50 banks were left.
"There will be immediate pressure to raise the standard of operations or close the portions of the offshore business where small countries are unable to comply with the higher standards," said Bruce Zagaris, a Washington lawyer who edits the International Enforcement Law Reporter, a publication that often focuses on money laundering and other financial crimes.
"For places like this, there is a delicate balance involved," Mr. Zagaris said. "If you tighten up too much, and keep adding to the layers of paperwork you require, there is going to be a dislocation of their business."
Hearing talk like this, Cayman Islanders have become worried about new moves to regulate their financial institutions, which could scare off some of their estimated $300 billion in deposits. A public relations drive has begun, featuring advertising supplements in foreign publications, like Financial Times, the British newspaper.
"Excluding B.C.C.I., the problems with our banks are few and far between," said Mr. Duggan of the Banking Association. "Metropolitan countries try to close the loopholes we live by on a daily basis, but people of high net worth will always find the vehicles we offer them attractive."

HEADLINE: Good for the Gap, Not for Society

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Washington's Mistaken Apparel Policy" (Forum, Sept. 1) is an example of a concept much more important than "giving mills an incentive to compete in the global marketplace." We are talking about the reasons why our standard of living is in decline. 
 There are obvious advantages to the author's company, the Gap, in obtaining fabric and apparel from countries whose wage is 50 cents a day, as opposed to American wages of $5 to $10 an hour. Meanwhile, the American worker replaced by the third-world worker is without a job. His or her company is probably in contraction or out of business. The textile mills that supplied it are probably a shadow of what they once were, like their fiber supplier. All no longer purchase the software or the hardware they once needed, nor use freight lines or pay taxes the way they once did. Is there any wonder the American economy is in decline?
We spent 40 percent of our apparel dollars on imports in 1990. How much of ourselves do we want to give? We could give Don Fisher, the author, what he wants if we could figure out how to pay wages here at the level of Indonesia or Pakistan. What is good for Gap stockholders may not be good for American society.

Bob Evans, Fashion Designer

BYLINE: By ANNE-MARIE SCHIRO

 BODY:
Bob Evans designs evening wear with a difference. No floating clouds of chiffon. No grand ballgowns. His specialty is sportswear: jackets, blouses, skirts, pants and bustiers that can be mixed and matched just like daytime sportswear. The difference is dressy fabrics.
"The women I know dress that way," said the 39-year-old designer. "They mix their day and night clothes, wearing a favorite jacket with a satin skirt. Unless they need an occasion dress, women today dress down." 
 He offers each style in several colors so each store can buy his collection differently. They can decide on a cardigan jacket, say, and offer customers a choice of a short, straight skirt, or a pleated skirt, slim pants or wide-legged pants. Tops include bustiers, tanks and surplice-wrapped blouses.
Some styles come in satin and others in chiffon so a woman can develop an evening wardrobe by mixing a few pieces in different ways. For women who prefer dresses, there are short-strapless and off-the-shoulder styles with loose coats.
Mr. Evans did not plan to become a fashion designer when he studied economics at North Carolina University. But a job in a fashion photographer's studio led to modeling, and then one day he whipped up a pair of black moire evening pants and sold them to Henri Bendel. Suddenly, he was a designer.
He found it easier to run his business on a custom basis, which he did for six years on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. But he wanted to do ready-to-wear. He set up a showroom on Seventh Avenue in May and will give his first formal show in August. His clothes have been ordered by 20 boutiques. Prices range from $200 to $1,300.

HEADLINE: Market Magic;
But Just Who Is That Fairy Godmother?

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
SOMETHING called free-market capitalism has been declared the winner by a knockout in the former Iron Curtain countries, fanning hopes of prosperity for millions of people who have labored in vain, when they labored at all, under the centralized paralysis of Communism.
But there is no such thing as a free lunch -- Capitalist Lesson No. 1 -- and many countries are learning that "the free market" is in large measure shorthand for transitions involving cultural dislocation, unemployment, production problems and economic and political confusion. This is true in Poland, in the vanguard of Eastern Europe's transition to capitalism, where the unemployment rate today is above 10 percent, and in Argentina and Mexico, where in the shadow of capitalism's victory, politicians are preaching free markets in place of the state capitalism that was once the popular solution to Latin America's chronic hard times. 
 It is also true to some extent in the place that holds capitalism's patent, the United States of America. Basic questions about how much of what kind of capitalism to introduce at what stages in the Soviet Union and elsewhere have helped to set American economists to questioning the most recent results of the free market at home. A still developing but highly critical view of Reagan and Bush Administration economic policies, driven partly by conservative scholars, says that America's free market system has shown it cannot deal, by itself, with such explosive problems as rising poverty, the urban underclass and inadequate public schools.
Among many other questions, economists are also wondering whether free market capitalism as practiced in the United States can generate as much wealth for Americans as the German or Japanese models do for people in those nations. "There is not some glorious theoretical synthesis of capitalism that you can write down in a book and follow," said Robert M. Solow of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a Nobel laureate in economics. "You have to grope your way."
The groping shows up in the United States in various forms. University courses in comparative economics are suddenly very popular. New efforts are being made to measure the potential payoff to the economy from more public works projects, a potential that was minimized in the 1980's. And economists who have concentrated on broad theory are becoming more concerned with "micro" aspects of the market -- what makes it tick.
 
American vs. Japanese
 Why, for example, do Japanese car factories in the United States produce what many consumers rate as better quality cars than American-owned factories? (One answer: Japanese management techniques.) Or, what form of ownership makes a corporation most effective: the American approach, in which numerous shareholders delegate management to non-owner executives; or the Japanese system, in which various companies in a group own each other, making a core of executives, in effect, both the owners and the managers?
"With the ideological struggle over Communism out of the way, these differences are becoming more magnified," said Alan Blinder, a Princeton University economist. Perhaps most important, economists and sociologists are questioning a prime tenet of classical capitalism, one that has held sway in the United States from the Carter Administration in the 1970's through those of Presidents Reagan and Bush: that the marketplace should be largely ungoverned, left to the millions of people who operate in it, each seeking profit or some other material satisfaction. The by-product of such self-seeking, theoretically, is ever greater national wealth and a rising standard of living for everyone.
That has not happened. While virtually no American economist today doubts that self-seeking and the pursuit of profit must play a major role in any capitalist market economy, they are increasingly arguing that the marketplace alone, with its complex of self-centered attributes, is not enough for the United States.
"The most obvious market failure is the failure of the marketplace to provide jobs for a substantial part of the young black urban group," said Robert Gordon, a Northwestern University economist and a leader of the American Economic Association. "This really goes beyond economics, into the nature of culture and how we organize both our government and our private sector." Mr. Gordon notes, for example, that in Germany, a national apprenticeship program inserts millions of young people into jobs and eventually careers, rather than letting them fend for themselves after high school.
Albert T. Sommers, a senior economist at the Conference Board, a research organization funded by business, is also skeptical about the free-market mentality. "I would not question the importance of the profit motive, but I just don't want to surrender the whole system to it," he said. "When you preach profit and self-interest, people increasingly behave that way."
Sharpening this concern is the change taking place in the old Communist nations. Clearly, free markets are more effective than arbitrary central planning in channeling resources into producing what people most want. What's more, some think that buccaneer capitalism, with all its lack of concern for job security and worker welfare, might be the best way to instill a jugular instinct in people just making the transition to capitalism. "You get the impression that at the outset there is no other alternative," Mr. Solow said.
But different standards are called for in mature industrial societies like the United States, Mr. Solow said. Here, free markets and social welfare must be balanced. Even Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard economist and adviser to the Polish Government, agrees. Mr. Sachs is well-known for counseling Eastern Europe to leap into free market capitalism, although the immediate consequences are likely to be rising unemployment and shrinking social programs.
"The comparisons arising from Eastern Europe are feeding into the American debate," Mr. Sachs said. "A mature industrial society can and should extend unemployment payments to people whose benefits expire; we can afford it," he said, referring to the bill now in Congress that President Bush has threatened to veto. "We can also afford to provide adequate health coverage across the board. But the Eastern European societies are impoverished and restructuring the economies has to take precedence over social aspirations."
Reflecting this distinction, American economists increasingly are noting that the American economy is not simply a free-standing phenomenon, driven by humans calculating their best interests, detached from society. Other impulses and social goals, such as sharing income with the poor, training unskilled workers, organizing low-cost health care, excelling at technology and competing effectively with Europe and Japan, also shape American capitalism. When such concerns became pressing enough in the past, government took on a bigger role in meeting them.
"We have to recognize that there is no such thing as economics, only government and economics; political economy is the right term," said Eliot Janeway, an economic consultant. That recognition, always in the minds of many economists, is coming gradually to the fore, said Lawrence Summers of Harvard, currently serving as chief economist at the World Bank in Washington. "Some Government involvement that seemed flaky a decade ago seems less so today," he said, such as Federal subsidies for high-tech research.
Indeed, laissez-faire capitalism waxes and wanes, alternating with periods in which the Federal Government gets a bigger role. Herbert Stein, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, views these alternating periods as a demonstration of American capitalism's ability to adapt without noticeably inhibiting the marketplace.
The 1920's exalted the free market's power to generate steady economic growth and widespread prosperity. The Depression brought Roosevelt's New Deal programs to ease some of the suffering. Then, immediately after World War II, there was a reaction against too much Government. In 1948, the Revenue Act and the Taft-Hartley Act, for example, modified taxes and put limits on union power, undoing a little of the New Deal. In fact, from the war's end until 1960, no new regulatory systems were established, Mr. Stein said.
But when the Soviet Union in 1957 launched Sputnik, new doubts arose about American capitalism's capacity to maintain the nation's leadership in technology, and Government once again stepped in. From then until the Carter Administration, its role in the economy expanded rapidly. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration became a huge center of research that benefited many industries. Numerous social programs were born, among them Medicare, Head Start and the Job Corps.
The reaction to this in the 1980's held that Government's involvement in the economy had become bureaucratic and wasteful. New stature was attached to the theory that minimally regulated markets not only made commerce more competitive, but also would raise living standards and solve social problems. Because that has not happened, Mr. Stein, for one, believes that the nation is, or should be, on the eve of a new cycle.
 
Retarding the Change
 "I have felt that we are going to have another cycle, with increased interest in the Government helping to solve the problems of education, income distribution and the urban underclass," Mr. Stein said. "I had thought people would want a government that promised to do these things and accomplish something. Well, this Administration has found an outlet for that public desire in foreign policy, while at home it is still dragging its feet."
Undoubtedly, the historic victory of capitalism over Communism is helping to retard the change to a larger role for Government in the United States. So is the initial success of Mexico's incursion into free markets, with its emphasis on privatization of state industries and open borders with the United States. But Christopher Jencks, a Northwestern University sociologist, argues that as the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe venture into capitalism, their old concerns over welfare and income equality will be reasserted -- prompting Americans to be more concerned about these same issues at home.
Senator Paul Sarbanes, a Maryland Democrat who is chairman of Congress's Joint Economic Committee, agrees. "The Eastern countries are putting the question of what they want to take out of the Western industrial nations and what they want to reject," he said, "and now that there is no longer any over-arching competition between free markets and command economies, we are being forced into the same considerations."

HEADLINE: Bush Rewrites the Nuclear Rules

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
SENSING that the nation and the world had arrived at a moment when history must be seized by the throat, President Bush abandoned his cautious and incremental approach on Friday night and in a single speech proclaimed the transformation of the security apparatus that has shielded Americans for 40 years.
In what historians surely will rank as one of the most momentous steps even in these revolutionary times, Mr. Bush simply granted much of what the Soviet Union had long sought, including elimination of tactical nuclear weapons from American forces abroad -- among them troop units stationed in Europe and Asia and Navy ships at sea. 
 It was the most one-sided cut in nuclear armaments ever announced by a great power.
Mr. Bush, whose aides have been insisting for months that no new arms talks were likely for a considerable time, offered to open discussions at once with the Soviet Union about eliminating one of the most dangerous kinds of missiles, the long-range behemoths that carry a number of nuclear warheads.
There was more.
All strategic bombers, such as the immense B-52's with their globe-spanning range, will be pulled off round-the-clock alert status, and their bombs will go into storage. The intercontinental missiles scheduled to be eliminated under the treaty signed in Moscow only two months ago and not yet submitted to the Senate will be taken off alert, too, and neither short-range attack missiles nor mobile launch long-range missiles will be developed as planned.
The President demanded nothing from Moscow in return, but he expected a great deal. Senior officials said he hoped to spur the Soviet Union to follow suit and destroy its own ground-based and sea-launched short-range nuclear weapons, sharply reducing its stockpiles at a moment when the very shape of the country is changing and the danger of such weapons falling into the hands of extremists is ever-present.
 
Challenge and Exhort
 No more "Trust, but verify," a la Ronald Reagan; the new American operating mode is to challenge and exhort, as did Mr. Bush in declaring that the United States must "provide the inspiration for lasting peace."
Pressed for economic resources, Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Boris N. Yeltsin quickly promised reciprocal action, but the views of the Soviet military, already reeling from purges and reorganizations, was less clear.
Much of what the President did constituted a bow to the inevitable, given dwindling Soviet strength and Congressional pressure for more arms cuts. It also had clear political benefits, presenting him as the master of world strategy as he prepares for a campaign against a Democratic Party bereft of candidates with foreign-affairs credentials. But it was done with a visionary fervor that brought gasps of surprise from some of his fiercest critics.

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
Cardinal Glemp's Visit Points Up the Polish-Jewish Rift

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS

 BODY:
It was symptomatic that when Jozef Cardinal Glemp, Roman Catholic archbishop of Warsaw and Primate of Poland, arrived in the United States to visit Polish American communities, his first official event was a meeting with a dozen Jewish religious leaders.
"A thousand years of history were in that room," said Rabbi A. James Rudin of the American Jewish Committee, after hearing the Cardinal condemn anti-Semitism and express regrets that a homily he delivered in August 1989 might have fostered stereotypes of Jews and Judaism. The homily had followed a protest by Jewish demonstrators who entered the grounds of a convent adjacent to the site of the Auschwitz death camp. 
 A thousand years of history were also outside the room, it seemed. Some Jewish leaders, feeling that Cardinal Glemp's remarks still fell short of a retraction or an apology, boycotted the Sept. 20 meeting in Washington, and a handful of Jewish protesters picketed.
The Cardinal's two-week visit -- he will be in New York on Oct. 6 -- is set against the background of dramatic breakthroughs by the Polish Catholic Church to combat anti-Semitism, but it also began a week after hoodlums hurled bottles at the Warsaw synagogue.
The relations between Poles and Jews are filled with bright spots and dark shadows but, above all, with pain.
Poland and Poland's Jews flourished together in the late Middle Ages and the early modern period. For centuries, the vital center of Jewish life was in Poland. Driven from the Rhineland and Bohemia by the Crusades, the Black Death and persecution, expelled in 1492 from Spain, drawn by the promises of Polish rulers, about three-quarters of world Jewry came to reside in Poland.
Here, from the 15th to the middle of the 17th centuries, Polish Jewry enjoyed a golden age of relative freedom, material prosperity and intellectual and religious creativity. Here, as times grew more harsh and Poland was torn by war, partitioned by its neighbors and racked by the onset of modernity, the great movements of modern Jewish existence arose: Hasidism, socialism, Zionism.
The story ended horribly for Poland, and even more horribly for Polish Jews, all but a tiny remnant murdered. Poles and Jews were both victims of the Nazi death machine -- the former targeted for cultural and political subjugation, the latter for annihilation.
But even that suffering has more often divided than united the two peoples, overlaid as it is with bitter memories and a mutual sense of being wronged. Many Jews think of Poland as a land of almost universal and unremitting anti-Semitism. Poles counter with an image of an island of tolerance and hospitality where Jews had prospered. To qualify these descriptions is to risk being considered disloyal to those who have suffered and died. Discussions quickly enter minefields.
Poles sometimes feel that the historical onus of the Holocaust has been cruelly shifted from Germany's shoulders to theirs, and bridle at suggestions that they did too little. In no other nation was aiding Jews so severely punished by the Nazis, they point out; yet no other nation is more represented among the "righteous Gentiles" commemorated in Israel for rescuing Jews.
 
Stigma and Economic Jealousy
 Unfortunately, this position is undermined by a defensiveness that minimizes realities Jews cannot forget. Although Jews and Christians long co-existed in separate communities by mutual choice, that separation was never free of anti-Jewish religious stigma and economic jealousy, sometimes expressing itself in riots.
Although much of the greatest violence against Jews occurred in once-Polish territories under Czarist rule, anti-Semitism persisted in periods of independence as well. In the 1890's it became a component of the nationalism advocated by the National Democratic Party of Roman Dmowski. In 1945 and 1946, even after the Holocaust, pogroms broke out, with Communist connivance, it is believed, but also with Catholic acquiescence.
Until recently, says Lucjan Dobroszycki, a senior associate at YIVO Institute for Jewish Research in New York, Jewish and Polish scholars have viewed this past with almost totally different eyes. Dr. Dobroszycki warned against misunderstanding the Jewish condition in Poland before World War II, when Jews, 10 percent of the population, were an economically and culturally powerful force. For much of Polish history they had been the bulk of the middle classes, from shopkeepers and artisans to great manufacturers. They served as stewards for Polish landowners. Between the wars, a third of Poland's lawyers and half of its doctors were Jewish. Jews were well represented in Poland's Parliament.
With the exception of a restriction on kosher slaughtering, Poland had no anti-Jewish legislation in 1939. Some universities, which were self-governing, had quotas. Violence was largely the work of small fascist groups, and was opposed by the government.
At the same time, economic and psychological hostility was rising. Dmowski's xenophobic and anti-Semitic attitudes spread well beyond his party's ranks.
Only in the last few years have Poles had the freedom and psychological security to discuss openly how all this relates to the Holocaust. In 1987, the Polish Catholic weekly Tygodnik Powszechny published an essay by Jan Blonski, a professor of Polish literature, arguing that Poles "must stop haggling," that coming to terms with the past would begin with confessing a moral complicity in what had made genocide possible.
Professor Blonski's essay was fiercely challenged, but the debate it opened was as much about the future as the past. Today, Poland has the strange phenomenon of what is often called "anti-Semitism without Jews," the use of a malevolent, conspiratorial "other" to vent resentment at change and stigmatize proponents of a more open society.
Last week, Maciej Kozlowski, Deputy Chief of the Polish Mission to the United States and a former contributor to Tygodnik Powszechny, expressed his concern that these discussions will be curtailed by Polish reactions to the sharp criticism of Cardinal Glemp.
"I hope that the great work done in recent years between Catholics and Jews, and so many others of good will, won't be jeopardized," he said.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Cloaked in Humble Origins, Democrats Make an Entrance

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Early in "All the King's Men," the candidate Willie Stark is given some valuable advice: "Just tell 'em you're gonna soak the fat boys and forget the rest of the tax stuff."
As the 1992 Presidential campaign gets under way, Democratic consultants use more delicate language but the gist of their advice is much the same: Populism and class-based appeals are being retrofitted for the 1990's. Almost every candidate for the Democratic nomination places himself firmly on the side of The People -- in 1990's populism, this is generally referred to as the middle class -- and against an economic or governmental elite that is, at best, insensitive to their plight. 
 Everywhere he goes, Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa rails against the policies of George Herbert Walker Bush, wringing every aristocratic nuance from the name. (A contrast to the simple, Midwestern Tom Harkin, who proudly proclaims himself the son of a coal miner and an immigrant mother.)
Mr. Harkin is not alone. Among the candidates, humble roots are flaunted, and "fat boys" are scorned.
Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia attacks the Washington elites in both parties who have bollixed the Federal budget and left the middle income taxpayer with the bill. And Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas blasts the high-rollers on Wall Street who mismanaged their companies and landed softly with their golden parachutes -- while the White House looked the other way.
The new populism is fed by the recession, but also transcends it. One of the most prominent theoreticians is Kevin Phillips, a conservative analyst, who argues in "The Politics of Rich and Poor" that the policies of the 1980's produced extraordinary concentrations of wealth at the top of society and will lead, inexorably, to a reformist backlash. Democratic polltakers, like Geoffrey Garin and Stan Greenberg, say middle-class Americans feel increasingly stretched and neglected.
Mr. Garin said, "It's not really about jealousies; it's about people wanting to get ahead and feeling that nobody in the status quo is thinking about how to help them do that." This helps to explain all the talk from the Democrats about college scholarship programs, tax breaks for the middle class, reforming the health care system, improving the schools, upgrading the skills of the work force and generally improving the competitiveness of American industry. In many ways, this year, this is a gentle, suburbanized populism.
Sometimes there are outright class appeals, but there is also a queasiness at the approach -- after all, it conflicts with the notion that this is a classless society, happy and fluid and free. Republicans are quick to accuse the Democrats of practicing class warfare; Democrats say their opponents attack economic populism because it works. In fact, Republicans have long had a vulnerability on these grounds: 62 percent of those surveyed last June said they believed the Republicans favored the rich, according to a New York Times/CBS News Poll of 1,424 adults.
The budget negotiations last fall offered a test of these economic appeals: Some Republicans are still shaken by the success the Democrats had in casting Mr. Bush as a President unwilling to raise taxes on the rich. The legislation extending unemployment benefits has offered Congressional Democrats similar opportunities and in recent days they have been lining up to denounce Mr. Bush's opposition to their bill.
But at least in Presidential elections, Republicans are experts at countering these attacks by casting Democrats as a different kind of elite: Big Government people who support social engineering through measures like hiring quotas; Ivy Leaguers who smirk at traditional values like patriotism; smug liberals with an uncontrollable urge to cut America's defense. The 1988 campaign against Michael S. Dukakis was a textbook example of this.
So this time around, Democrats are talking a lot about traditional values -- indeed embracing them with new fervor.
In 1988, while the Democrats did little to inoculate Mr. Dukakis against a charge of cultural elitism, Republicans were careful to blunt the image of Mr. Bush as an aristocrat. He talked about his affection for pork rinds and country music. He quoted Clint Eastwood. He was a regular guy.
His opponents hope to remeind the voters of Mr. Bush's roots -- "born on third base and decided that he'd hit a triple," as a former Texas Agriculture Commissioner, Jim Hightower, put it. But can Mr. Harkin, or anyone else, turn the President into George Herbert Walker Bush once again?
Charles Black, a top Republican strategist, says no. "He's been President for three years," he said. "They're seen as genuine, down-to-earth people. It's going to be hard to turn him into a Greenwich, Conn., Wall Street banker who doesn't know any real people."
Kevin Phillips asserts that the elitist attack still has power against Mr. Bush, but he sees a strong Republican counteroffensive this time. "The new strategy is Kuwait, crime and quotas," Mr. Phillips contends.
And there are risks for the Democrats in this new populism. For example, much of the voters' anger, some political professionals say, is against Government -- and Democrats still control one of the three Federal branches, one whose members, it was recently disclosed, bounced thousands of personal checks. "You've got to be careful about where you aim the populist gun, because you might shoot yourself," said Will Marshall, head of the Progressive Policy Institute, an offshoot of the Democratic Leadership Council, which tries to push the party to what it considers the political center.
Democrats must also take care that they are not perceived as simply being anti-rich, rather than pro-middle class. "I think we learned a lesson -- and that is that every American wants to be rich, but no American wants the Government to protect the rich at the cost of everyone else," said a House Democratic strategist.
Mr. Phillips thinks the Democrats are still searching for the right language. Mr. Harkin's appeal, the battle of the small towns against the big interests, for example, seems uniquely suited for the Midwest. While Mr. Phillips says he is convinced that the movement is indeed coming in the 1990's, he adds, "The new populism isn't there yet."
 
 
 
Poor? They were so poor that . . .
The regional accents differ, but as the Democratic Presidential candidates begin their campaigns, the theme of humble beginnings is a constant. Following are some early variations.
 
 
 
Gov. Bill Clinton
'Nearly half a century ago, I was born in a little town called Hope. My mother, unfortunately, had been widowed three months before I was born. I was raised for four years by my grandparents, while she went back to nursing school. They didn't have much money, and I spent a lot of time with my great-grandparents and by any standard they were poor.'
 
 
 
Senator Tom Harkin
'I come from the wrong side of the tracks. My father was a coal miner who didn't even have an eighth grade education. My mother was an immigrant with no formal education. My parents raised six kids in a small, two-bedroom house. And I was the youngest. My father was 54 years old and working on W.P.A. when I was born. We were poor. But my parents instilled in us those traditional values.'
 
 
 
Representative Dave McCurdy
'I am deciding whether to run for President. It is a daunting task for a man raised in Oklahoma, middle America, by two parents who worked in a factory, were union, went to church and only aspired to give their children a better life. They did not leave me riches. No, they left me something far better. They taught me the values of hard work, individual responsiblity and family.'
 
 
 
Gov. L. Douglas Wilder
'As the grandson of slaves, I read about the Constitution, and I knew America and Virginia wanted more for me and my friends than did the politicians in power at that time -- and history has proven us right. As a soldier in Korea, I knew my fight and that of my fellow soldiers -- many of whom never returned home -- against communism was also a fight against the denial of freedom everywhere: and history has proven us right.'

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
An Era of Change Challenges France's Self-Confidence

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
FOR three decades after France lost its empire, the cold war enabled successive French presidents to keep alive the myth that it remained a great power. It had an independent nuclear deterrent, it was the political leader of the European Community, it was influential in the Middle East and it had a special relationship with Moscow that it frequently used to pique Washington.
But the events of the last year have badly shaken France's self-confidence abroad. The country now feels intimidated by the growing political power of a united Germany, it seems unsure how to handle a turbulent Eastern Europe, it has lost clout in the Arab world and it is uncomfortable with the United States as the sole remaining superpower. 
 President Francois Mitterrand has not helped things by gambling badly at several key moments -- trying to slow the pace of German unification, offering a face-saving deal to Iraq on the eve of the gulf war, appearing ready to accept the Soviet coup as a fait accompli. And this in turn has made the 74-year-old President a convenient scapegoat for the demise of French "gloire."
Yet France's troubled search for a new place for itself abroad might not matter to ordinary Frenchmen were it not accompanied by a simmering crisis of identity -- a loss of direction -- at home. And for this, Mr. Mitterrand is also blamed.
Last week, a new poll showed Mr. Mitterrand's approval rating had dropped to 46 percent, a five-year low. Two weeks earlier, another poll said 61 percent of those surveyed considered the President "worn out" after 10 years in office.
It could be, of course, that Mr. Mitterrand is just going through a bad patch and will, as before, bounce back. In 1986, his Socialist Party lost legislative elections and he was forced to "cohabit" with a conservative Prime Minister, Jacques Chirac, for two years; still, he won re-election to a new seven-year term in 1988.
Now, with his new Prime Minister, Edith Cresson, faring poorly, the prospects are again for a conservative victory in legislative elections in 1993, although no one would be surprised if the Socialists won the presidency again in 1995.
Yet the reasons for France's malaise today run deeper than party politics. Indeed, so indifferent are most French to the political debate that only 33 percent of registered voters cast ballots in a by-election last Sunday.
Disenchantment with politicians has been partly fed by several scandals over illegal funding of different parties. There is also the problem that no new leaders have emerged in the last decade: lined up against Mr. Mitterrand are still Mr. Chirac, former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing and the extreme rightist Jean-Marie Le Pen.
But, perhaps most of all, many French voters no longer think they have a clear political choice. Since 1983, when Mr. Mitterrand abandoned a disastrous experiment with nationalizations, his economic policies have moved steadily to the right so that today they are virtually indistinguishable from those advocated by conservatives. And if the opposition took office, it too would find French monetary policy is largely defined by the German Bundesbank, while many other economic decisions are taken by the European Community.
All this has become relevant in recent months as solid economic growth has given way to recession. Now the social costs of recent overall prosperity -- a high rate of unemployment and a permanent squeeze on workers' wages -- are more difficult to hide. Strikes, particularly of public services ranging from transportation to hospitals, are on the rise. Discontent among the country's long-cossetted farmers is bubbling to the surface. But the Government has no alternative economic model to offer.
On one subject, immigration, there is intense debate. Yet, for lack of a coherent response from the country's politicians, the discussion has only added to uncertainty about the future.
Until the mid-1970's, Arab and African immigrants were welcomed as temporary workers, but by the mid-1980's it was clear they had come to stay. And as they brought their wives from home and had children of their own, the emergence of new ghettoes in many urban neighborhoods fed French hostility toward third-world immigrants.
 
Ethnic Diversity
 Today, the growing reality of an ethnically diverse society -- 4 million of France's 55 million inhabitants were born abroad -- is seen as one more threat to the French way of life. And the trend is likely to continue. Poverty and high birth rates in North Africa have created millions more potential immigrants. Similarly, the economic plight of many Eastern European countries makes France very attractive to unemployed youths. And on Jan. 1, 1993, the European Community's 12 members are to dismantle their internal borders.
In recent months, politicians have scrambled to catch up with public opinion and Mr. Le Pen, who has long called for repatriation of illegal and unemployed immigrants, has had the satisfaction of seeing others move toward his position. Mr. Mitterrand himself has said France has reached "the threshold of tolerance" on immigration. Mr. Chirac gambled by publicly complaining about "the smell and noise" of immigrants. Last week, Mr. Giscard d'Estaing said France was experiencing "an invasion" of immigrants. But no new policy has emerged.
As with immigration, then, France today seems unsure how to handle change. Ordinary citizens worry about recession and unemployment, about falling educational standards and rising immigration. Prime Minister Cresson alarms them by talking heatedly about Japan's economic "takeover," while Foreign Minister Roland Dumas whispers about German influence embracing Eastern Europe.
Last week, President Mitterrand was at least able to flex French muscles by sending troops to restore order after an army mutiny in Zaire. But, back home, no one seemed too impressed.

HEADLINE: THE REGION;
From Albany, a Vision of a New New York City

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
One worn thread ties together the psychic and economic recovery of New York City that began in 1976 and the groping for solutions 15 years later. When Gov. Mario M. Cuomo unveiled his own blueprint for revival last week, Donald J. Trump's name was barely mentioned.
In 1976, the nation's bicentennial celebration and the Democratic national convention produced their share of euphoria. But it was Mr. Trump's bargain-basement investment in buying and then renovating the faded Commodore Hotel on 42d Street in Manhattan into the gleaming Grand Hyatt that, more than any single physical symbol, helped trigger the building boom that followed. Mr. Trump cannily played on City Hall's desperation to reduce his risk with property tax abatements. But his hotel renovation was a private investment. 
 Today, Mr. Trump is living on an allowance. Private development has evaporated. And it is government, personified by Mr. Cuomo, that is plunging into the void to jump-start the economy and generate jobs. One goal of his blueprint is to build confidence, if not necessarily the edifices themselves, with government's good offices and its direct investment. Among the re-packaged projects that would be expedited by Mr. Cuomo is Riverside South, which is owned by Mr. Trump.
While the Governor's lofty presentation last week was intended to rally glum business, labor and civic leaders with his tangible vision of a "New New York," its most enduring legacy could turn out to be his prescription for an assumption of local Medicaid costs by the state. While the speech may have appeared to cast him temporarily as Mayor Cuomo, it presents Mayor David N. Dinkins with another opportunity to demonstrate leadership in negotiating labor concessions and other savings that would pry hundreds of millions of deficit-closing dollars a year from the state's Municipal Assistance Corporation.
 
A Goal of Recurring Revenue
 "Historic" was Mr. Cuomo's word of choice in the speech he first delivered Monday night and embellished with a Jackie Mason-style tutorial on municipal bonds when he presented it to a second audience of opinion-makers the next morning. His remarks looked ahead, but also evoked New York City's last fiscal crisis which, Mr. Cuomo explained pedantically, was resolved largely with financial devices to bridge a recurring budget gap rather than with catalysts for economic development that would guarantee recurring tax revenue.
Mr. Cuomo's predecessor, Hugh L. Carey, left a concrete legacy, too, but will be best remembered for intervening to save the city from itself. Mr. Carey created the M.A.C. to borrow on the city's behalf and the Financial Control Board to circumvent the Mayor. Mr. Cuomo is chairman of the control board, but has been reluctant to invoke its full power because he would be perceived as compromising the city's first black Mayor.
Next week Mr. Dinkins goes before the control board to deliver a progress report on the four-year financial plan that the city is revising to address what Mr. Cuomo discreetly called its "vulnerability." Negotiations between the Dinkins administration and municipal unions have stalled; the teachers' union contract, which a year ago prompted angry demands for comparable increases from other labor leaders, expires tomorrow. Moreover, two major initiatives by the Mayor's Management Advisory Task Force are also problematic: a proposed user fee for sanitation services, which appears too regressive in its present form; and a recommendation to impose tolls on the free East River bridges, which which is likely to be a tough sell.
 
City Quibbles
 City Hall officials, scrounging to bridge projected deficits, are grateful to the Governor, but consider his Medicaid proposal too stingy because of its lengthy timetable and point out that it addresses only one of the so-called structural imbalances in the budget that the control board identified last spring. (The Governor himself acknowledged that "there will be more to do, especially in the field of criminal justice, health and social services.") Also, city officials are skeptical about some specifics of the economic development package, although they cannot afford to spurn any help, whether it is abstract or concrete. It is easy to quibble with some of the components -- Mr. Trump's project on the West Side may saddle the state with costly obligations for new parkland; the proposed airport train is less desirable than a direct link to midtown, although it would be financed by an airline passenger tax, and a downtown bus terminal might be more relevant than the partial resuscitation of a Second Avenue subway line.
Reflecting on the 1970's, Robert A. Caro, the Pulitzer-prize winning author of "The Power Broker," a biography of Robert Moses, the impresario of public works, once recalled: "There was a vacuum -- an almost absolute vacuum -- in planning and executing large-scale projects after the fiscal crisis. I'd have hoped that the gap would've been filled by public officials, and hopefully by a Mayor."
It wasn't, for the most part. And this time, a Governor is trying to fill the gap again. "There was a time when we looked to public officials to provide leadership in New York," Mr. Caro said the other day. "The Governor I thought of when I read Cuomo's speech was Alfred E. Smith. He was absolutely unafraid to tackle the biggest problems with solutions on a broad scale. If Cuomo does provide it and follows through, the state and the country will find something they are desperately looking for."

HEADLINE: THE REGION;
Cuomo on Finance? Don't Ask

 BODY:
ADDRESSING the Association for a Better New York last week, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo spoke softly and carried a big shtick. He delivered a Jackie Mason-style monologue, outlining the mandate of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, which was created during New York City's 1975 fiscal crisis to borrow on the city's behalf; the role of its chairman, Felix G. Rohatyn, and the fact that the M.A.C., supported by private bond rating analysts, among them Hyman Grossman of Standard & Poor's, has suggested that the city pare expenses before the M.A.C. releases money generated by refinancing its bonds. Here is an excerpt:
 
 Nobody knows what M.A.C. is. It's wonderful. No matter where you go, nobody knows what M.A.C. is. What's M.A.C.? What's his name? Royton. Philip Royton. No, we don't have a Philip Royton. No, I know the guy. M.A.C. He's a banker. No, it's not a bank. It's us, it's the state. It's a bank. Well, you said it wasn't a bank. Well, it's like a bank. It's the Municipal Assistance Corporation. We invented it.
M.A.C., that's the state. They borrow money. Why did you trust the state to borrow the money and not the city? Because we took the sales tax from the city and we used that as a guarantee. Why didn't the city take the sales tax from the city? What are you asking me for? It's so complicated, I don't remember.
So what does M.A.C. do? M.A.C. borrows money, gets it cheaper than anybody. Why? Nobody knows why exactly. It's government just like us, capable of the same stupidities, absurdities, miscalculations. But somehow they've worked it out because Royton's clever and his friends -- who are nameless, to show you how clever they are, when things go wrong Royton gets the blame.
M.A.C. is sitting there with a lot of money. They've got bonds -- they paid 9 percent, 10 percent, 12 percent. They can now get bonds at 8 percent. So what? You sell the one bonds, you get the other bonds, you save money. Great. What do you do with the money? Nothing. They sit there and they say, 'You want it, beg us.' So we go and we beg.
Even if M.A.C. didn't say it, the raters are saying it. Who are these raters? Nobody knows. They're another group. Hy Grossman. Who is he? From Jersey. He's a rater. He can hurt us? Oh, he can kill you. How? He can say you can't borrow. Why? What's the difference? If they say you can't borrow, you can't borrow. If they say the investment's no good, the investment's no good. Why do they do that? I don't know. Someday, I'm going to quit this business and learn all the things that made me crazy while I was in it.

HEADLINE: BUSH'S ARM PLAN;
Excerpts From Briefing at Pentagon: 'It Will Make the World a Safer Place'

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 28

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a briefing at the Pentagon today by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. Also at the briefing was Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
 
CHENEY STATEMENT
 Last night the President spoke to the American people and outlined his initiative for changing the size and the shape of the nuclear arsenals that belong to both the United States and the Soviets. . . . 
 This morning I have signed the execute order taking our strategic bomber force and our Minuteman II missile force off alert status, thereby implementing the first part of the President's decision announced last night.
 Before I get into specifics, I'd like to make a few points that I think need to be emphasized about the President's initiative. First of all, it is, in my opinion, the single biggest change in the deployment of nuclear weapons since they were first integrated into our forces in 1954. It will make the world a safer place. It will allow us to rely more on defenses in the future with respect to our relationship with the Soviet Union.
 These moves also challenge the Soviets, both the central Government and the republics, to do what we're doing by responding with initiatives of their own. If they follow through, as the President called upon them to do, they will not only shrink the world's nuclear arsenal, they will also free themselves of the expensive drag on their economy, which they do not need and cannot afford.
 The President's initiative has two main goals. First of all, it makes the world's arsenal of nuclear weapons significantly smaller and the world safer, and secondly, it gives the Soviets the incentive they need to shift their country away from the business of cranking out nuclear weapons and toward the work of building democracy.
 There is good reason to take these steps now. The world's in a new era of promise that started nearly two years ago with the collapse of the Berlin wall. The Warsaw Pact is history. Soviet forces are pulling out of Eastern Europe. The Soviet Union has reduced its military forces and made those that remain more defensive. And of course, we have recently signed landmark agreements affecting both conventional and strategic systems.
 The defeat of the coup last August by the people of the Soviet Union led to a new form of government in the union, one in which the republics are gaining increased influence over weapons and deployments. This gives an opportunity to move toward a safer, more stable relationship with the new Soviet Union.
 The leaders of the Soviet Union have expressed profound skepticism themselves about the massive strategic nuclear arsenal and the resources that they have continued to invest in maintaining that force. Both Presidents Gorbachev and Yeltsin have talked about their desire to reduce nuclear arsenal. We want to give them an opportunity to do this, to match their words with their deeds.
 The President's program includes initiatives that fall into two broad categories. First, changes in our own force posture and our modernization programs, changes which we are calling on the Soviet Union to match, and second, a set of initiatives which we hope to undertake with the Soviet Union to improve the stability and safety of the nuclear arsenals on both sides.
 The President's proposals were developed in consultation with General Powell, with the Joint Chiefs and myself. These initiatives have our full and unqualified support. They are in fact built on the new defense strategy the President announced in August of 1990, a course the department is already pursuing in its force budget and planning process.
Now on the specifics, let me briefly remind you of the key elements of the President's initiative. . . . The elimination of ground-launched tactical nuclear weapons, the withdrawal of tactical nuclear weapons from our ships at sea, standing down strategic bombers from alert, which we've accomplished this morning, standing down the ICBM's slated for de-activation under Start, canceling the Peacekeeper rail garrison program and the small ICBM mobility program, canceling SRAM II, simplifying our strategic command and control system under a new strategic command, proposing with the Soviets the joint elimination of multiple warhead or MIRVed ICBM's, cooperating with them to permit the deployment of non-nuclear missile defenses, and finally, cooperating on efforts to enhance the safety, security and command and control of the nuclear systems.
I noticed in some of the commentary after the President's speech a lot of talk about how much would be saved. It's important to make a distinction between savings that can be achieved in the short term, which are, as you can see here, not that large, but over the long term, over the lifetime of these programs, we obviously save significant money.
 If we cancel the rail-garrison mode for Peacekeeper, over the life cycle of that program, we save $6.8 billion. So far, we've obligated about $2 billion. The '92 budget request calls for us to spend $260 million on that program.
 If we cancel the mobile part of the small ICBM, again, over the life cycle of the program, we don't have to build the mobile launchers for that system, we save over $11 billion. Savings in '92, $115 million.
 If we cancel the short-range attack missile, SRAM 2, total life cycle cost if we were to build and deploy 700 missiles would have been $2.2 billion. Savings in '92, $177 million.
 Now, again, I cannot say today that we will save precisely that amount of money in fiscal year '92. We've still got a lot of work to do in figuring out what program termination costs are involved, et cetera. But there are over the long term, clearly savings, funds that will not be spent as a result of having canceled these programs.
 
Future Pacts With Soviets
 With respect to our efforts to pursue additional agreements with the Soviets, clearly foremost among those has to do with the agreement to -- or the proposal to eliminate MIRVed ICBM's, multiple land-based ICBM's. We would propose doing this within the context of the protocols established in the Start treaty already. What would be required here is to agree upon a timetable, if agreement can be reached with the Soviets . . .
 The second of the proposals that will require negotiations clearly deals with defenses. We continue to believe that the recent experience in the Gulf, in the Middle East, is a reminder of the importance of being able to deploy defenses against ballistic missiles in the future. While a Patriot system was effective against the limited Iraqi threat, we think it's absolutely essential in the years ahead to develop and to deploy advanced theater missile defenses against the more sophisticated threats we foresee and to be able to defend the United States and our friends and allies and troops deployed overseas against this threat.
 So the President has called upon the Soviet leadership to join with us in finding ways to allow the deployment of non-nuclear defenses against limited ballistic missile strikes. We think this is in the Soviet interest as well as in our own, and we're hopeful that we will be able to accomplish increase in mutual security if we can in fact consummate this proposal.
 The last of the initiatives, of course, has to do with cooperative work on measures to enhance the security of existing nuclear inventories, specifically focusing upon the safe and environmentally sound destruction of those systems upon command and control and upon the safety and security of those systems to insure that they don't fall into the wrong hands or that there are no unauthorized launches.
 I want to emphasize that as we put forward a sweeping package here and move to dramatically change our overall nuclear posture, that here in the department we have carefully considered the consequences of these reductions from the standpoint of being able to maintain the nation's security. I am absolutely confident based upon the work that we have done that we can have confidence that our security and that of our allies is protected even with these initiatives, that we will retain sufficient nuclear forces, and that we are committed to keeping them up to date and effective. The world has changed, but insurance is still a good idea, and under this plan, we believe we will have enough.
 The President's initiatives have set the stage for the Soviets and for the United States to seize a historic opportunity and to assist the Soviet and republic leaders to make some dramatic decisions. We can correct the nuclear risk they face from their own weapons and improve the nuclear relationship we have with the Soviets. We must not wait. We must act now. We are eager and hopeful that we will receive a positive and a reciprocal response from the Soviet Union.
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Talks on Arms at Sea
 Q. Mr. Secretary, is it correct that your proposal on the MIRVed ICBM's does not include the sea-based MIRVed ICBM's? And would the Administration be willing to enter into negotiations on that?
 CHENEY: It is correct that the proposal does not include sea-based ballistic missiles. We believe, have consistently argued and continue to argue that those sea-based systems are different than land-based systems; that a land-based missile with multiple warheads on it is a very ripe target for the other side and that there'd be a temptation in a crisis to launch rather than lose that capability.
 Sea-based systems are radically different. They're survivable, they're hidden, no one knows where they are. So it's just a different quality system. If you were to de-MIRV the sea-based leg, you'd also then be in a position where we're going to spend a lot of money buying one submarine that would have 16 missiles on it, each with one warhead. I mean, it gets to be a very expensive way to deploy the force.
 So the proposal is aimed specifically at encouraging the Soviets to reach an agreement with us which would eliminate what we believe is the remaining most destabilizing part of the forces on both sides -- -- that's multiple warhead system. They'd have to give up things like the SS-18. We'd give up things like Peacekeeper, and we'd have to download our Minuteman 3's.
 Q. Mr. Secretary, from their point of view, isn't that they would see that the United States would have an advantage, at least numerically, in the sea-based systems. Why wouldn't they want to engage you in negotiations on that?
 CHENE:Y Well, again, we just completed a lengthy negotiation through Start where the Soviets have in fact signed up for asymmetrical reductions. They have certain capabilities we don't have. They've got land-based mobiles. They've got the SS-25, which they would be able to keep under that proposal.; Iit wouldn't be affected by that proposal at all.
 They've had more of their systems over the years based on land, and we've had more of ours based at sea. But we think within the overall framework of the limitations that are provided for in the Start agreement, that it would be fair and equitable to move in this direction and it would eliminate one of the major sources of instability, which are those multiple warhead, land-based systems.
 
Soviet Control of Arms
 Q. Mr. Secretary, there has been concern in the Soviet Union since the coup and also concern in the United States since the coup about the control of such weapons in the Soviet Union, the fact that they're scattered throughout all the republics. How much of this initiative was based on concern by the United States, by the Administration, of just who has control of Soviet weapons?
 CHENEY: I think it would be fair to say we were confident through the coup, we're confident today, that the Soviets retain centralized control over their systems, that the possibility of an unauthorized launch or unauthorized individuals getting control of a nuclear weapon is relatively small today.
 What we can't be precise about is what kind of arrangements will exist in the future, two or three years from now. Are we concerned about a Soviet Union that is beset by significant difficulties, an area where there may be increased instability and where there are some 27,000 nuclear weapons? Certainly. But I don't think there's any sense of panic involved with that.
 It is an issue we want to address. We believe that we were given an opportunity as a result of the collapse of the coup because the forces in the Soviet Union that would have resisted this kind of package in the past have been discredited, are no longer in positions of authority.
 So we've got a problem, we've got an opportunity, and we think one way to address that is to provide the incentives that we are providing by virtue of our own unilateral actions to encourage the Soviets to do what they have indicated they want to do anyway, which is reduce the size of their stockpile. And General Shaposhnikov, my counterpart, has spoken to the issue, said he's prepared to pursue the elimination of tactical nuclear weapons. This builds on those kinds of sentiments.

HEADLINE: In California, a Big Battle Is Looming Over a Tiny Fish

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 28

 BODY:
The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed listing a tiny, nearly translucent fish as a threatened species, setting up what is expected to be another bruising environmental battle in the West.
The fish is the delta smelt, which grows to a length of only three inches and is found almost exclusively in the Upper Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta east of here, California's largest source of water. Scientists say its population has declined by 90 percent in the last 20 years, from 2.6 million to about 200,000. 
 In proposing on Friday that the delta smelt be given threatened-species status, the Fish and Wildlife Service rejected a recommendation from its field office in Sacramento that the fish be listed as endangered, which would have extended even greater protection. But a classification of only "threatened" could have enormous consequences for the water supply of millions of Californians.
The final decision on whether to list the minnow-like fish -- and, if so, what steps to take to protect it -- is not expected for at least a year, after a series of public hearings and Government review, said Gail Kobetich, a Fish and Wildlife biologist who has led a study of the issue. But the cry of agencies that depend on the delta's water is already being heard.
 
Pumping Appears the Problem
 With the help of huge pumps, the delta sends water to thousands of farms and 20 million urban dwellers throughout much of Northern California. To survive, the smelt requires a mixture of saltwater and fresh water, and scientists believe that the decline in its population is due largely to the pumping of too much fresh water from the delta's marshes, an activity that reduces the size of areas that the fish can use as spawning and nursery grounds. In addition, the pumps themselves may be killing large numbers of fish, Federal wildlife officials say.
As a result, it appears that the only way to save the species may be to curtail pumping, which could mean rationing the water that now flows freely from the delta. Andy McLeod, an official with California's Department of Resources, said the potential economic effect of such a reduction was unknown. But Jason Peltiar, manager of the Central Valley Project Water Association, which delivers water to three million urban residents and 20,000 farmers, said Federal protection of the delta smelt would be a "recipe for real disaster" in California water management.

HEADLINE: BUSH'S ARM PLAN;
Trust Without Verifying

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 28

 BODY:
With his new arms control initiative, President Bush has done more than bring the United States nuclear arsenal more in line with the new world realities. He has thrown out the book on arms control.
Without any negotiation with the Soviet Union, under Mr. Bush's plan, 1,300 ground-based American artillery shells and 850 short-range ballistic missile warheads will be withdrawn and destroyed. About 500 nuclear weapons will be removed from ships and submarines at sea. 
 Because of their large numbers, small size and widespread dispersal, these tactical nuclear weapons are considered more difficult to keep under tight control, and the Administration is hoping that its initiative will inspire the Soviet Union to eliminate its tactical arsenal, some of which could fall into the wrong hands as the country fragments.
 
By Example, Not Agreement
 But the Soviet Government was not even informed of Mr. Bush's initiative until the last minute. The Administration plan is to conduct arms control by example, not by agreement: to start withdrawing the weapons and encourage the Soviets to follow suit.
Nor will the removal of thousands of nuclear weapons be subject to the stringent verification measures that Administration officials have previously insisted upon and that were codified in treaties. No inspectors will visit Soviet and American ships to determine that tactical nuclear weapons have been removed or pry into warehouses to see if nuclear artillery shells are hidden there. Ronald Reagan's oft-repeated dictum about arms control agreements was "trust but verify." Mr. Bush's initiative appears to ignore the second half of the prescription.
During the cold war, such an approach to arms control would have been considered beyond the pale. The fear was that the Soviets would pocket any American concessions and never reciprocate.
 
Too Radical, Until Now
 But even as the cold war wound down, the idea of reducing arms without formal negotiations or elaborate verification was considered too radical by most Government officials.
In 1984, Kenneth Adelman, then director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, wrote an article urging a process of informal but reciprocal actions to reduce the superpowers' arsenals, a concept dubbed "arms control without agreements."
George Shultz, Mr. Reagan's Secretary of State, was said to be most unhappy with Mr. Adelman's effort, which he feared could undercut support for moving along the formal arms negotiations with the Russians. But Mr. Adelman is a close acquaintance of Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, a principal architect of the Bush Administration proposal, and the ideas voiced in the article echo through the new policy.
What has changed?
It is not that Pentagon officials question the validity of the old approach, which they say was appropriate to its time. Instead, they say that changes in the Soviet Union have made less structured arms control more desirable in many cases.
Under severe economic pressure, the Soviet Union has a motivation to cut its arms like never before. With its central authority on the wane and ethnic strife a common occurrence, the Soviet Government has powerful incentives to gather up and destroy its abundant stockpiles of tactical nuclear weapons. While the Government has control of its stockpiles today, the future poses some risks.
The Pentagon considers the problem too pressing to be dealt with by convening formal negotiations, with their time-consuming procedure of proposals and counterproposals.
Perhaps most important, American officials say, is that the new Soviet reforms mean that the United States need not insist on tough measures, that would have to be agreed on in detailed negotiations, to verify that tactical nuclear arms had in fact been withdrawn.
 
An Understanding
The informal arrangement that the Administration is encouraging is seen as an understanding between partners with a shared interest in preventing accidental or inadvertent war, not as a negotiation with a competitor whose penchant for cheating has to be checked though on-site inspection.
Pentagon officials also say that the changes in the political and social culture of the Soviet Union -- the increasingly independent press, outspoken leaders in the republics and a growing openness about military matters -- make it easier to track military developments and diminish the need for verification by inspectors.
The officials see this as especially true in the case of Soviet tactical nuclear weapons, because they do not have the range to threaten the American nuclear deterrent and are generally old systems, more dangerous to the Soviets themselves than anybody else.
But the United States still plans to carry out inspections of strategic weapons limits under the strategic arms reduction treaty signed this summer, which the White House plans to send to the Senate for approval shortly.
 
Too Much at Stake
 This is not to say that there is no longer a place for formal talks. The Soviet Union, as the Pentagon often points out, is the only nation with the capacity to destroy the United States. There is simply too much at stake in some strategic moves to make them unless they are understood by both sides and carefully scripted in advance. If land-based missiles that carry multiple warheads are to be eliminated, as President Bush proposes, it will be through negotiation. Most likely this would be done as an amendment, or side agreement, to the newly completed strategic arms reduction pact.
The Bush Administration also wants to engage the Soviets in talks on the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, to amend it to allow more than one site for ground-based interceptors, as well as a limited deployment of space-based interceptors. The aim would be to deploy an anti-missile system that would defend against an accidental launch, or small attack, without invalidating the Soviet nuclear deterrent.
Such a system would be a far cry from Mr. Reagan's vision of making nuclear weapons impotent and obsolete. But it would entail additional spending on the part of the United States and the cash-strapped Soviet Union. While the Administration hopes for Soviet concurrence it has pointedly not ruled out going it alone if Moscow balks at the idea of building new anti-missile defenses.
But even with these important qualifications, Mr. Cheney was not minimizing the importance of the new approach on eliminating ground-based tactical arms, removing tactical nuclear weapons from ships at sea and reducing the alert rates of strategic forces.
"We clearly, in terms of moving unilaterally, have taken a different approach than I would have advocated even a few months ago," Mr. Cheney said. "And that involves specifically unilateral acts that we hope the Soviets will reciprocate."
"I think the prospects now for the Soviets responding are far brighter than they've ever been before," he said, "and we think we can avoid the kind of long, drawn-out negotiations that have so often in the past resulted in delays actually in taking down systems while both sides waited to see what they could get for taking down those systems during the course of negotiations."

HEADLINE: Zaire Leader to Take Foes Into Coalition

DATELINE: KINSHASA, Zaire, Sept. 28 (AP)

 BODY:
President Mobutu Sese Seko and opposition leaders agreed today to form a coalition government after five days of rioting that led French and Belgian troops to evacuate foreigners.
It was the first time in the 26 years of Mr. Mobutu's rule that he had agreed to share power with the opposition in this Central African country. The collapse of the former Belgian colony's economy, brought on in part by widespread corruption, weakened his grip on power. 
 France, another former colonial power in Africa that maintains a major role on the continent, said it refused to provide aid unless Mr. Mobutu agreed to the new government.
 
Government of National Crisis
 More talks were scheduled for Sunday, when ministers were to be named for the so-called government of national crisis.
Paris began scaling back its military forces but indicated that it might leave troops in the country after the evacuation of Americans and other foreigners who wished to go. Hundreds continued to fly out today.
The meeting at Mr. Mobutu's marble presidential palace marked his first talks with the opposition since mutinous soldiers led bloody rioting on Monday and Tuesday in Kinshasa that spread to other parts of the country.
At least 60 people died in Kinshasa, but the real figure could be three times higher. At least 1,750 people were wounded, said the Paris-based relief agency Doctors Without Borders.
A French paratrooper was the only foreigner confirmed to have been killed.
French and Belgians held key points of Kinshasa today, and the city was mostly calm. Kinshasa's international airport, controlled by the European soldiers, reopened to civilian traffic on Friday.
During his five-hour meeting with the opposition, Mr. Mobutu, 66 years old, also agreed that a national conference on democratic reforms that broke up in bitterness earlier this month could reconvene on Tuesday.
 
New Prime Minister Expected
 It was expected that Etienne Tshisekedi, leader of the opposition group Union for Democracy and Social Progress, would be named Prime Minister on Sunday.
Mr. Tshisekedi, 58, was interior minister before Mr. Mobutu seized power in a military coup in 1965.
He refused the job of Prime Minister when Mr. Mobutu offered it in July, saying it held no real power. But today he said he would accept.
France and Belgium, aided by American military transport planes, have sent 1,750 soldiers to Zaire to evacuate foreign nationals. The French Ambassador, Henri Rethore, indicated for the first time today that France might leave a military detachment in the country for up to two weeks after foreigners were removed.
"It depends on the evolution of the situation," Mr. Rethore told reporters. "We are here for the short term. There will be a number of French soldiers maintained in the coming days, and our presence is going to depend on the process that is undertaken."
Nearly 8,000 expatriates, including hundreds of Americans, have been evacuated since the French and Belgian troops began arriving on Tuesday.
The French Foreign Ministry announced the shipment of 40 tons of rice, cooking oil and flour to the capital to ease food shortages.

HEADLINE: For Americans and Filipinos, Basics of Life Are at Stake in Fate of Navy Base

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SUBIC, the Philippines, Sept. 25

 BODY:
Their memories of the base are starkly different, but the American sailors who lived or took liberty at the Subic Bay Naval Station and the thousands of Filipinos who repaired the American warships and swept the Americans' floors agree that a way of life is in jeopardy.
"Subic is paradise," said Robert Buttrey, a ruddy-faced 49-year-old retired Navy Seabee from Framingham, Mass., who married a Filipino he met while on duty at Subic, settled his family near the large American naval base and now owns an off-base saloon that bears his nickname, Bubba. 
 "But if the base goes," he said, taking another gulp of pale Philippine beer that retired Navy men insist is the only protection from the effects of these long, steamy nights in the tropics, "well, then this will all become a ghost town."
A few blocks away, up a rain-soaked stairway to the converted second-floor discotheque that now serves as a union hall, the threat by the Philippine Government to oust the United States Navy from the base has, it seems, become the only topic of conversation among the more than 20,000 Filipino civilian workers employed at the base.
Roberto Flores, the president of the union, the Federation of Filipino Civilian Employees, was hired as a utility man by the base in 1964, at age 19, at the equivalent of 49 cents an hour.
He said he remembered the days when the Americans "didn't even treat us like human beings" -- disciplining or dismissing Filipino workers with insufficient cause, forbidding Filipinos to speak their native language, routinely breaking into the storage lockers ofFilipino employees on the pretense of searching for stolen goods.
"They could be very rude," Mr. Flores said of the Americans. "There were many abuses when I first arrived at the base."
 
Decline in Discrimination
 Yet in the 20 years since the introduction of collective bargaining at Subic, "things have become much better," he said, insisting that most of his union's members bore no lingering resentment over the harsh treatment of Filipinos decades ago.
"The admirals at the base will act when we bring them complaints of discrimination," he said. "We want the Americans to stay. These are some of the best jobs in the Philippines."
The union represents every type of civilian worker at the base, from mechanics and secretaries to the teams of Filipino janitors who, for most of the last three months, have been sweeping up the tons of volcanic ash dumped on the base in June by nearby Mount Pinatubo.
Virtually all of the Filipino workers will find themselves without jobs if Subic is shut down, a fate they would share with thousands of other Filipinos who were employed by the United States Air Force at Clark Air Base, which was abandoned after the ash buried its runways, 50 miles southwest of here.
 
Reprieve for Life Style
 Whatever their reasons -- for the Americans, trying to protect a military life style of almost legendary bounty and comfort; for the Filipinos, maintaining economic survival in an impoverished nation -- there is the oft-stated hope here that somehow the Subic Bay Naval Station, at 14,400-acres the largest American military base in Asia, will be allowed to remain open.
It appears that their wish will be granted, at least temporarily.
In what many of its members described as a long-postponed demonstration of sovereignty, the Philippine Senate voted last week to reject a new American lease on the base.
But President Corazon C. Aquino, a proponent of the base, effectively overruled the Senate when she withdrew a year-old eviction notice on Subic and called for a national referendum on its future.
 
2,000 Retired U.S. Seamen
 The possibility that the Navy will remain has produced some cheer in the neon-flooded bars and dance halls of Olongapo and Subic, cities that border the base and cater almost exclusively to the American military and to a community of retired American seamen that is said to number about 2,000.
Several beers closer to sunrise, a small group of the retired sailors was still gathered in an Olongapo bar called the Watering Hole, swapping stories about what had made Subic Bay, to their minds, the most desirable post anywhere in the United States Navy.
"It's been said that this is an adult Disneyland," said Martin Tubbs, a 50-year-old retired warrant officer from Houston who is the manager of the bar, which also serves as Branch 213 of the Fleet Reserve Association, an organization of mostly retired American sailors. He does not quibble with the Disney comparison.
"I first saw Subic in 1961, when I was a 20-year-old sailor, and I loved it," Mr. Tubbs recalled wistfully, remembering a time when Subic had a reputation as one of the wildest liberty ports in Asia, a reputation that grew to legend when American warships docked here during the Vietnam War.
"I retired two years ago from the Navy and went to Los Angeles," he said. "But after a while, I decided I had to come back here to live, because my friends were here and because the life is so good."
For generations of American sailors, he said, Subic had made possible a way of life that could never be duplicated on a Navy salary back home: Spacious houses with what are now $20-a-week maids; private white-sand beaches along the bay dotted with private cabanas and gently swaying palms; stables and horse trails close to the pristine shoreline; privileges at a well-manicured, professional-quality 18-hole golf course, and a seemingly endless supply of available women and cheap beer.
There are other American naval bases in Japan and on the Pacific islands of Guam and Okinawa; but they have fewer amenities, and many American sailors consider the living costs there prohibitively high.
"Subic is the only place I've ever been where the beer is cheaper off base than on," Mr. Tubbs said.
For married sailors and their families, the base has long offered fine schools and every sort of entertainment, including movie theaters and several Government-subsidized restaurants. There is a McDonald's and two outlets of Baskin Robbins Ice Cream, which are closed for now because of damage from the volcanic ash.
 
Men Love It, Women Hate It
 "Despite all the advantages, I still don't think the wives of American sailors ever looked on Subic as a good assignment," said John J. Stauffer, an industrial arts teacher at the base's George Dewey High School, named for the American admiral who defeated the Spanish fleet in Manila Bay in 1898.
"Subic's reputation has always been that the men love it and the women hate it," said Mr. Stauffer, who has been teaching at the base for 25 years, and who has seen many Navy marriages ruined when an American sailor became enchanted with one of the Filipinas employed as hostesses at the honky-tonk bars and dance clubs, with names like Love Disco and Hot Lips, that surround the base.
"I can think of maybe a dozen different families in which I first taught a sailor's American children and then, maybe 10 years later, I taught his second set of kids by a new Filipino wife," Mr. Stauffer said.
There are so many marriages between Filipinas and American sailors at Subic, as many as 15 a week, that the Navy sponsors what is known as the bride school, a series of seminars on American culture for the wives-to-be.
 
Intermarriage and Bias
 John Godard, a 34-year-old Navy operations specialist at the base who is married to a Filipina, said he thought the frequency of American-Filipino marriages had "helped prevent discrimination against Filipinos from becoming a big problem."
I think the Filipinos really like us, and we like them so much that we marry them," he said.
At the union hall, Domingo A. Jadloc, a 37-year-old Filipino who is a crane inspector on the base, said he had come to believe that after working at Subic for more than a decade that "there are two kinds of Americans, one type that causes problems for the Filipinos, another type that wants to solve the problems."
"There is still discrimination," he said, recalling a recent incident in which an American supervisor on the base called together Filipino employees and told them in so many words that "I am the boss, the Americans are the leaders, and the Filipinos are the followers."
Yet he said incidents of discrimination had become increasingly rare. "I have many good friends who are Americans," Mr. Jadloc said. "They come to my house, I go to theirs."
 
Top Pay From the Navy
 The United States Navy is a much-desired employer in the Philippines, where the per capita annual income is less than $700, making it one of the poorest nations in Southeast Asia.
At Subic Bay, the average salary for Filipino civilian workers is about 35 pesos an hour, or about $1.30, double or triple what most people earn in the cities that adjoin the base.
"Subic is our bread and water," said Mr. Jadloc, who supports a wife and four children on what is, by Philippine standards, a handsome salary of about $5,000 a year.
"If the base closes, I will have to find work outside my country, maybe in Australia or Canada," he said. "I would say 99.9 percent of the workers at the base want the Americans to stay. There are no other jobs like this in the Philippines for me."

HEADLINE: Bush's Arm Plan;
Cheney Orders Bombers Off Alert, Starting Sharp Nuclear Pullback

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 28

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney ordered the military today to put into effect President Bush's plan to eliminate about 2,400 short-range nuclear weapons on land and sea in Europe and Asia, a move that could save $20 billion over the next two decades.
Under the directive, Mr. Cheney also ordered that long-range bombers and some long-range missiles end their 24-hour alert, and that several nuclear missile programs be canceled. 
 The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Colin L. Powell, who spoke with Mr. Cheney at a joint news conference this morning, said the first step -- removing 40 long-range bombers fueled, equipped and armed with "several hundred" nuclear weapons off alert status -- would be done by the end of the day. [Excerpts, page 12.]
General Powell said it would take only 24 hours to reverse the order, if ever needed, as he and Mr. Cheney provided additional details on Mr. Bush's surprise announcement on Friday night in which he outlined the most one-sided nuclear arms cuts taken since the onset of Soviet-American nuclear rivalry in the postwar years.
A senior Pentagon official said the entire process of removing the tactical nuclear weapons -- storing some and destroying others -- could take between 18 months and three years to complete. While the military might ultimately save as much as $1.5 billion a year in weapons costs, procurement experts said the short-term expense of paying termination costs to military contractors could reach $500 million in the next two years.
 
U.S. Team to Brief Soviets
 The Administration's cuts reflect the quickly changing geopolitical landscape, with the fall of Soviet control in Eastern Europe and the weakening of the Soviet Union, the foe against which America's arsenal was always aimed.
In his speech Mr. Bush called on the Soviet Union to respond in kind by also getting rid of its short-range nuclear arms.
Indeed, after a conversation with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union on Friday, President Bush said today that he would send a team of American experts to the Soviet Union to review details of his plan. Administration officials did not disclose the team members or their backgrounds.
Mr. Cheney said the two main goals of the President's plan "makes the world's arsenal of nuclear weapons significantly smaller" and "gives the Soviets the incentive they need to shift their country away from the business of cranking out nuclear weapons and toward the work of building democracy."
"Given their collapsing economy, they really have no choice but to significantly cut back on their military capabilities," said Mr. Cheney.
 
Destroying 1,300 Shells
 The Administration plan drastically reduces the number of short-range nuclear weapons on land and at sea in Europe and Asia. The weapons, with ranges of 10 to 70 miles, were developed in the 1950's as a battlefield weapon to counter the numerical superiority of the Soviet ground forces.
Under Mr. Bush's plan, the United States would destroy 1,300 nuclear-tipped artillery shells and 850 Lance missiles, rockets with ranges of about 70 miles. About 1,700 of the 2,150 weapons are in Europe and will be sent home to be dismantled, Mr. Cheney said. The artillery shells include 155-millimeter shells and two types of eight-inch shells. The howitzer launchers will also be destroyed.
About 500 nuclear bombs and depth charges will be taken off ships and attack submarines, and about half will be destroyed once sent home, Mr. Cheney said. Among the weapons, the approximately 100 Tomahawk cruise missiles at sea will be removed and stockpiled for future use.
Several hundred older nuclear depth bombs for Navy anti-submarine planes will also be eliminated.
 
Bombers Off Alert
 The order also calls the nation's strategic bomber force -- 40 of the 280 planes are always on 24-hour readiness -- off alert. The fleet of B-52's and B-1B's are stationed at 12 Air Force bases. Maintenance crews will reclaim the planes, remove the weapons for storage and return the planes to a normal schedule, Mr. Cheney said.
Mr. Cheney's order set in motion several actions to cancel or speed the dismantling of an older long-range missile as well as several other strategic weapons being developed.
The 450 single-warhead Minuteman 2 missiles scheduled to be deactivated under the Start treaty, will be taken off alert status immediately. Mr. Cheney said the missiles would be dismantled once the treaty is ratified, probably sometime early next year, rather than when the full reductions of the pact take effect in seven years.
 
Savings Seen in 3 Years
 Mr. Cheney said that by canceling three strategic programs in development, the Pentagon would save as much as $20 billion over the expected life of the program.
The director of the Defense Budget Project, Gordon Adams, a nonpartisan research organization here, said that would amount to about $1 billion to $1.5 billion a year over 15 to 20 years. But he said the savings would represent less than 1 percent of the Pentagon's budget in those years.
Mr. Adams said any savings would not be achieved for two or three years, after the Pentagon paid military contractors $500 million estimated to be the termination costs.
Under Mr. Cheney's directive, the United States would cancel the following programs:
*The mobile portion of the MX missile system -- 50 missiles with 10 warheads each -- saving $6.8 billion over the life of the program. The missiles would remain in silos rather than be put on rail cars that could be dispersed in a nuclear attack.
*The mobile portion of the single-warhead Midgetman system, 300 truck-carried launchers, saving $11.2 billion.
*The short-range attack missile -- SRAM-2 -- which would be fired by bombers to blast holes in Soviet air defenses and attack other targets. A version of the missiles was to have deployed in Europe to build up American nuclear capabilities there. The Pentagon estimated savings from terminating the program at $2.2 billion.
 
New Strategic Command
 But the Bush Administation has not ruled out the possiblity of developing a new air-to-ground nuclear-tipped missile. Given public pressures now that is unlikely to happen, arms-control experts said.
Mr. Cheney also directed General Powell to create a new United States Strategic Command, which would assume operational control over strategic nuclear weapons now assigned separately to the Air Force and the Navy.
The new command, to be based in Omaha, would supplant the Strategic Air Command there now. The command of American nuclear forces would alternate between a four-star Navy admiral and Air Force general.
 
Talks on MX
 While not included in Mr. Cheney's order to the military chiefs today, President Bush's plan also calls for Washington and Moscow to enter talks aimed at eliminating ground-based long-range ballistic missiles.
Under such a proposal, negotiators would build off the recently signed strategic arms treaty, which reduces the long-range arsenals of both countries by about one-third, to reduce the number of warheads each missile could carry.
After the strategic arms treaty, the United States, for instance, would still retain about 2,000 warheads on 550 launchers. If talks were successful, Mr. Cheney said, the MX missiles with their 500 warheads would no longer be deployed, leaving 500 Minuteman 3 missiles with three warheads each. Going to a single-warhead missile would drop the total to 500 warheads on 500 missiles, he said.
The Pentagon would also seek technical cooperation with the Soviets on the safety and security of nuclear weapons -- a key concern since the failed coup. Tightened command and control procedures over the weapons, and environmentally sound methods of dismantling and destroying them, would also be discussed.
General Powell said that with the threat of a conventional Soviet attack on Europe gone, the unilateral reductions in tactical nuclear forces made sense.
 
Better Conventional Arms
 "We believe this is a very sound package that enhances the security of the United States," said General Powell, who met with Mr. Bush and the four service chiefs at the White House Friday morning to discuss the plan.
The increasingly lethal nature of United States conventional arms -- from the stealthy F-117 to precision-guided bombs -- has bolstered the argument in military circles that the short-range nuclear weapons were outdated.
"Increased capability associated with conventional weaponry in recent years has, to some extent, inclined us in the direction of getting rid of tactical nuclear weapons," said General Powell.
Although the United States has taken the first step in slashing its mobile and harder-to-control nuclear bombs and missiles, President Bush and his advisers today renewed their pledge to modernizing what remains of the nation's land, sea and air nuclear triad.
 
Avoiding Cuts by Congress
 If anything, arms-control specialists said, the Administration has created with its actions an environment that it hopes will ward off attempts in Congress to make deeper cuts in its two prized strategic programs, the Stealth bomber and the anti-missile defense system, "Star Wars."
Mr. Cheney reaffirmed support for the Administration's plan to open talks with the Soviets to allow five or six ground-based sites to position anti-missile missile launchers, and later develop space-based sensors. The existing anti-ballistic treaty bans sensors in space and permits only one ground launching site.

HEADLINE: Small-Town South Clings to Jewish History

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT GIBSON, Miss.

 BODY:
There's just one sour note in the small miracle that occurred here when Temple Gemiluth Chassed, the 100-year-old Moorish-Byzantine synagogue on Church Street, was saved from the wrecking ball and lovingly restored.
Port Gibson has no Jewish community left to worship there. 
 As Jews around the world celebrated their heritage over the recent holidays, one of the most unusual chapters in that history was winding down in small Southern towns like Port Gibson, once home to perhaps 60 Jewish families. In dozens of small towns like it, a hybrid culture of matzo ball gumbo and kosher grits flourished and then disappeared as young people left for the cities, never to return.
 
Years Too Late
 Efforts are now being made to salvage the artifacts and memories of the Dixie Diaspora in small towns from Pontotoc, Miss., to Donaldsonville, La., to Blytheville, Ark.
"We're trying to save it before it disppears, but we're already 20 or 30 years too late," said Macy B. Hart, who heads the two-year-old Museum of the Southern Jewish Experience in nearby Utica, Miss., and whose own parents are the only Jews in Winona, Miss.
"We have many communities that are down to one or three or five Jewish people left," he said, "and they have the weight of maybe 100 years of community on their shoulders.
"So what we're moved to do is to help those communities go from extant to extinct with dignity, so we don't lose it all."
Mr. Hart is used to puzzled stares from people at the thought of Jews in the small-town South. But Jews were among the earliest settlers in the region and were integral parts of its history.
Eli N. Evans, who grew up the son of a Jewish shopkeeper in Durham, N.C., when it was a small tobacco town and who later wrote "The Provincials: A Personal History of the Jews in the South" (Atheneum, 1973), said: "Jews were not aliens in the promised land. They were blood and bones, part of the story, and they've been part of the story all along."
There is no single story of Jewish immigration to the South. Jews came from across Europe with the earliest settlers in the 1700's, landing directly in Charleston, S.C., Savannah, Ga., or New Orleans, and from New York and other Northern cities after the great Jewish migrations of the 19th century.
But if there is a dominant theme it is the story of Jewish merchants -- first peddlers and then shop owners -- who helped create a merchant class in the rural South and then saw their communities wither and die as their children left.
"The story of the Jews in the South, at least a major part of it, is the story of fathers who built businesses for their sons who did not want them," Mr. Evans said.
That story played out in Port Gibson earlier than in the region as a whole, but its outlines are familiar.
The first Jews came to Port Gibson in the 1840's from German states and Alsace-Lorraine. They were itinerant peddlers, carrying their wares in 75-pound packs on their backs. Then, as Port Gibson began competing with Vicksburg and Natchez in both commerce and the glory of its antebellum homes, the Jewish community became a bulwark of the town's economy, and newspaper advertisements were filled with names like Bernheimer, Marx, Meyer, Cahn, Traxler and Ullman.
 
A Moorish Dome
 In 1859 congregation Gemiluth Chassed, a name that can be roughly translated as House of Kindness, was formed by 22 members, meeting at the Odd Fellows Hall and Masons' Lodge. In 1889, its leaders called for the building of a temple, saying, "Our Christian fellow-citizens often ask why the Israelites have no church."
By 1892 they had built a distinctive brick synagogue with stained glass windows and an incongruous Moorish dome. It was a centerpiece of a community life that was at once discreetly separate and distinctly Southern, like a Jewish ladies' Japanese lunch at which, according to a report in the local paper in 1902, Rosa Marx was awarded a beautiful gauze fan as the most popular young lady.
But Port Gibson's population, now about 2,400, peaked around the beginning of the century. Soon the Jewish children began leaving for Memphis or New Orleans or Baton Rouge, and stores began passing out of Jewish hands.
A building on Main Street still bears a sign reading H. Frishman-Red Goose Shoes, but the building is now occupied by Mississippi: Cultural Crossroads, a community center mostly serving the town's predominantly black youth.
Mr. Hart said the disappearance of the Jewish communities reflects both the economic decline of many Southern small towns and the traditional educational aspirations of many Jews.
 
Unlikely Saviors
 The last services were conducted in the synagogue in 1978, and it was scheduled to be demolished for a parking lot for the adjacent gas station in 1987 when it found saviors in Bill and Martha Lum, he a Methodist, she a Catholic. The two, who both grew up on cotton plantations, bought the synagogue and are restoring it. Its 100th anniversary will be marked by a celebration on Oct. 20.
"It's part of the heritage of this town, and we just couldn't stand to see it destroyed," Mr. Lum said. "The Jewish heritage is deep rooted here, and that's where we all come from, after all, back to Abraham."
In nearby Natchez, home of one of the grandest small-town synagogues, members of the dwindling Jewish community has turned the deed to their synagogue over to Mr. Hart's museum so it can be preserved when the community can no longer care for it.
Once 141 families, the community is down to 18 people, mostly elderly, with one school-age child.
"We joke and say the average age of our congregation is extinct," said Jerry Krouse, who drives his daughter, Keely, 100 miles each way to Sunday school in Baton Rouge each week.
 
Relics of an Era
 Much of the culture that is already gone can be seen at Mr. Hart's museum, which was built after receiving a $500,000 grant in 1986 from the Plough Foundation of Memphis. It is on the grounds of Union of American Hebrew Congregations' Henry S. Jacobs Camp, which serves children and adults in Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Alabama and western Tennessee.
Among its exhibits are Ner Tamids or eternal lights, from defunct synagogues in Port Gibson, Laurel, Miss., and El Dorado, Ark. There is a pulpit from a synagogue in Jackson, Miss., a majestic oak ark from a synagogue built in 1868 in Vicksburg and Torahs from Laurel, Port Gibson and Greenwood, Miss.
And there are photographs and artifacts that dramatize the passing of an era: the synagogue in Donaldsonville that is now an Ace Hardware store; the synagogue in Morgan City, La., that was later used as a Mormon church; the signs of Jewish business that were once fixtures of small-town squares throughout the South.
 
Jews Found Respect
 That disappearing culture is quite different from what outsiders might have expected. There was anti-Semitism in the South to be sure. The most infamous case was that of Leo Frank, an Atlanta Jew who was convicted of murder and lynched in 1915 for the killing of a young girl. He was posthumously pardoned in 1986 after evidence indicated he was innocent.
But many experts say the South was attractive to Jews because the religious fundamentalists there were respectful of Jews, whom they viewed as "the people of the Book," in contrast to attitudes in the urban North.
"I maintain the Leo Frank case was an aberration," said Louis Schmier, a history professor at Valdosta State College in Georgia who is writing a book about Jews in Georgia. "There was anti-Semitism, but the majority of the Christian population admired their Jewishness and almost demanded it of them."
He recalls a story from Unadilla, Ga., where city officials were upset that a local Jewish businessman kept his store open during the Jewish holidays.
"He was told by the Mayor the City Council was going to pass an ordinance demanding that he close because if he was going to be accorded the respect of being a Jew, he had to act like one," Professor Schmier said.
 
Assimilation vs. Distinctiveness
 More common than overt discrimination was a delicate dance between assimilation and distinctiveness. Mr. Evans remembers an affecting chapter of his grandmother's diary entitled, "The Loneliest Days Were Sundays" about the feeling of separateness that pervaded small-town life.
For many, the solution was intermarriage and the dissolution of Jewish identity. For others, like Mr. Hart, who well remembers the isolation of small-town Jews, the result was a fierce need to reclaim a Jewish identity.
Often, the contradictions are never quite resolved.
After meeting with the Lums at the synagogue, Mr. Hart had lunch with Celia Starnes, one of two descendants of the Jewish community left in town.
Mrs. Starnes is married to a Baptist but wears a gold necklace with her first name in Hebrew. She does not go to synagogue, but when Mr. Hart asked if she was observant she answered, "In my heart I am." She said the salvation of the temple was "the answer to all my prayers."
And though her children were not raised as Jews and the three oldest are practicing Baptists, she said she thought her youngest daughter, who lives in Jackson, was open to Judaism. At least she hopes so.
"I think she's Jewish by instinct," she said.

HEADLINE: New Goal for New York: Tourist-Friendly Image

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
Imagine a day when tourists arriving at New York airports might actually have a pleasant experience, even if they speak no English. The baggage cart might be free, instead of requiring a $1.50 deposit before anyone has even had a chance to get to a currency- exchange window.
There might be signs in the terminal in other languages giving foreign visitors a clue what to do next. They might not face a barrage of aggressive offers from often-illegal taxi drivers eager to take them for long rides into New York. And as they gaze out their taxi windows at the city's glorious skyline, they might not find themselves distracted by mounds of litter collecting on marginally grassy strips along the road. 
 Call them dreamers, but a group of the city's most prominent business executives, along with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, are determined to make that vision a reality. Tommorrow they will announce a new program called Gateway America, which is intended to make New York City, yes, a nicer place to visit.
The program comes not a moment too soon. Tourism is weak throughout the United States this year, and the New York region is suffering at least as much as other areas. Airport arrivals are down 11 percent compared with last year, and Broadway attendance is off by about the same percentage.
To make matters worse, other cities and states are responding with ambitious ad campaigns promoting their areas, and many of those campaigns are targeted at foreign visitors who have traditionally been one of New York's most important and most reliable markets.
"There is significant competition from other parts of the country," said the chairman of the group, Robert Nederlander, also the chairman of the Broadway-based Nederlander Organization and the managing general partner of the New York Yankees. "We have an advantage, and we should take care of that advantage."
The object is to improve visitors' first impressions of the New York region and to make it easier for them to avail themselves of cultural, entertainment and other opportunities. The motives are hardly altruistic. Stanley Brezenoff, executive director of the Port Authority, estimates that if the program brings 10 percent more tourists to the area, it could pump $1.5 billion into the economy at a time when that is sorely needed..
"Tourism is one of the principal engines of the economy in this region," he said.
 
Information Kiosks
 The goals of the Gateway America committee are ambitious. If its initiative is fully carried out, foreigners arriving at local airports will be able to go to information kiosks where friendly people speaking several languages will offer brochures detailing the week or month's cultural events. Interactive videos will give arriving passengers a further inkling of available activities.
Instead of getting hopelessly lost on buses or subways, visitors will be able to read transportation signs in several foreign languages. If they choose to take taxis, their drivers will have received training in the importance of being polite and hospitable. And their rides into the city will be much more pleasant: The sides of the roadways will be cleaned up, and possibly -- gasp -- even beautified.
Once they have settled in, the visitors will find that their hotels also have foreign-language brochures listing current events. And the hotel staffs will have received friendliness training. There will be more currency-exchange locations across the city, and they will be noted on maps.
If visitors get lost, police officers in tourist areas will be able to look up addresses and phone numbers in an updated guidebook that will be distributed through the police force. The police, too, will have been trained in the importance of assisting visitors.
It is a tall order for a group that has been allocated just $225,000 of seed money by the Port Authority. The hope is that the stature of those involved will get the effort off the ground.
Besides Mr. Nederlander, others on the executive board are Mr. Brezenoff; Howard Stringer, president of broadcast news at CBS; Lewis Rudin, president of the real-estate firm, Rudin Management, and Martin Segal, head of the New York International Festival of the Arts.
Without much financial backing, the leaders of this group expect to encourage others in business and government to make certain their goals are implemented. Mr. Brezenoff has committed his authority to making sure there are kiosks at airports and more signs in foreign languages. The police, hotels and taxi-driver groups can begin hospitality training without great expense, he said. And banks will want to introduce more currency-exchange locations in their own interests.
"There has to be an effort to get everybody in the businesses that touch travelers -- whether it's hotels, taxis, theaters or banks -- to be more aware that they have to go beyond what they normally do to make visitors feel more welcome," Mr. Rudin said.
 
No Goods to Declare
 Mr. Rudin helped found the original Gateway Improvement task force, which was established in 1983. Among the results of that task force was an improved customs and immigration area at Kennedy International Airport and the familiar red-green system through which international passengers arriving with no goods to declare can pass without inspection.
An area where significant financing is needed is in the cleaning up of highways from the airports. Mr. Rudin acknowledges that the city's budget is tight and that efforts to get corporations to adopt portions of the roadways have so far not met with great success.
Despite some obvious limitations, the new initiative is likely to be welcomed. "It's a good no-frills effort," said Mitchell Moss, a professor of urban planning at New York University's Wagner School of Public Service. "It will bring New York into the 20th century."

HEADLINE: As More Tiny Infants Live, Choices and Burden Grow

SERIES: Smallest Survivors: Dilemmas of Prematurity/First of three articles.

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
The baby in the plastic case lies swathed in a Mickey Mouse blanket whose cartoon characters dwarf him in size. One month after birth, he has already suffered major bleeding in his head, requiring brain surgery, and still needs a respirator to breathe. Born almost four months prematurely, weighing just over a pound, the baby is sustained by a battery of tubes and machines.
His skin is thin as parchment and his eyes are sealed shut, but he is clearly a human child. A minuscule blue and white stocking cap prevents heat loss through his head. 
 "Could you turn off the respirator on this baby?" asked Dr. Harry Dweck, director of neonatal intensive care at the Westchester County Medical Center in Valhalla, N.Y. "Could you? I couldn't. If his parents asked me to do it, I'd go to court."
 
Life at $2,000 a Day
 Intensive care for premature infants is now keeping alive more and more infants born very early in pregnancy. But the cost is immense -- more than $2,000 a day -- and the emotional burden on parents immeasurable. Many surviving infants who weigh less than 750 grams, about 1 pound, 10 ounces, at birth turn out to have physical or mental disabilities, but there is no reliable way at present to predict the outcome. For doctors and parents the treatment of these babies thus creates ever more difficult economic and ethical dilemmas.
Dr. Dweck says he has seen infants like his patient become normal children, although he admits the chances that the survivors will be normal are less than 1 in 4.
The remainder suffer brain damage. "Some are handicapped and are a great burden to their families and to society," Dr. Dweck said, a note of sadness in his voice. It is a price he considers worth paying, and he never pulls the plug if there is a remote chance that treatment will help.
Fifty miles away, at the neonatal intensive care unit at University Hospital of the State University of New York at Stony Brook, Dr. Leonard Kleinman adopts a more pragmatic approach. "If a baby survives a major head bleed, we'll tell the parents he is almost surely going to be damaged and he's suffering a great deal and we don't think we should do anything more," said Dr. Kleinman, the hospital's director of neonatal intensive care.
Although health care economists have recently focused their attention on intensive care for the elderly, in fact most hospitals spend far more treating the very very young. The stakes are higher, too, since a premature baby who survives intact gains a lifetime, while an infant who survives with terrible damage may require decades worth of high-cost care. To complicate matters, the most premature infants, the ones who can run up bills close to half a million dollars, are also the least likely to be helped.
Doctors and parents who must weigh these vexing options have found no uniform answer. So the baby who is kept in intensive care for months at one hospital might be allowed to die at birth elsewhere.
"It's a matter of style," said Dr. Alan Fleischman, director of neonatal intensive care at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, noting that some doctors feel they must treat 100 babies aggressively if there is a chance of saving 1. "I don't buy that: creating 1 normal child by creating 99 who are handicapped and disabled.
"We argue endlessly about which is worse: a healthy baby in heaven or a damaged baby on earth," he said. "I say neither is good, but we're going to make mistakes in both directions." Dr. Fleischman said he believed the major problem today was that babies who will not benefit from intensive care are overtreated, even when the parents do not want aggressive care.
 
The Costs
Care More Costly Than New Heart
 Premature infants stay in high-tech wombs for about the same length of time that they should have remained in their mother's: four months for the most premature, who are born at 24 weeks gestation and weigh in the neighborhood of 500 grams, or slightly over a pound. "Above 700 grams there is a clearly a great benefit to intensive care," Dr. Fleischman said. Below 700 grams, or about 1 pound, 8 ounces, things get murky. Many of the very low-birth-weight babies succumb to lung failure or severe bleeding in the brain, since these organs have not fully matured.
Dr. Michael Rie, an intensive care specialist at the University of Kentucky in Lexington, said, "The hundred highest users of Medicaid dollars in each state are preemies who end up for months on ventilators and end up with cerebral bleeds and extremely lousy outcomes."
For insurance reimbursement, the New York State Department of Health considers infants weighing below 750 grams to be the most expensive type of patient to care for, three times as costly as a person with serious burns and 20 percent more costly than even a heart transplant patient.
Almost 50 percent of babies born weighing from 500 to 750 grams, or 1 pound, 2 ounces to 1 pound, 10 ounces, will survive and, of these, the majority will have neurological damage. From 750 grams to 1,500 grams, 3 pounds, 5 ounces, about 85 percent will live and the great majority will have no impairment. Above 1,500 grams, which has historically defined the upper boundary of very low-birth-weight infants, babies have an excellent chance of emerging from intensive care fully intact.
In contrast, just 10 years ago, it was a rare child born under 1 pound, 8 ounces who even survived, and before the early 1970's, when neonatal intensive care units began operating, few children under 2 pounds survived. But as advances allow medicine to save more and more babies, the demand for neonatal intensive care has risen and existing units are bursting at the seams. Babies born prematurely to women who use crack or have had no prenatal care have swelled the demand.
As a result, most neonatal intensive care units have removed walls to squeeze in a few more beds, and hired nurses to work overtime. Most operate at more than 100 percent of their licensed capacity.
Dr. Dweck, whose intensive care unit serves five counties north of New York City, said he had to turn away 250 babies each year.
 
The Caretakers
For Some, Home Will Be Hospital
 While pediatricians say that babies in need ultimately find a hospital that can squeeze them in, the crunch has led some to call for more public financing and others for a more "rational" use of existing beds.
"Last week there was a 900-gram baby at a community hospital who we knew we could help, but we were horribly overcrowded," Dr. Kleinman said. "Meanwhile, we had a preemie with severe brain damage who hadn't moved in three weeks taking one of our beds. I'm not sure that's fair."
Some beds are occupied for months or years by the growing number of severely brain-damaged children or children on respirators who, saved from death in the intensive care unit, are too chronically ill to go home, or even move to a regular hospital bed.
A 1990 New York State Health Department report on neonatal services in New York City found that in the larger units an average of two beds were occupied by such children, sometimes for years.
Situations like these are leading people to question whether millions of dollars should be spent on intensive care to the tiniest infants, who are unlikely to live.
In Oregon, where the Legislature is developing a priority list of various medical treatments to guide Medicaid financing, intensive care services for infants under 500 grams ranked 708 of 709 treatments, meaning it would not be covered. Dr. Kleinman said he "generally agreed," although he worried that techniques for treating them would not improve if no one was allowed to try. But many are appalled by the thought. "If you were told that anyone over 75 years old with a stroke couldn't get care, how would that sound?" Dr. Dweck said. "That's how I feel about the 500 grammers."
He said he would resuscitate fully any baby who shows signs of life at delivery regardless of gestational age or weight. In contrast, Dr. Kleinman said he did not routinely try to save babies under the 500-gram mark, but permitted the doctors who worked for him to try if they thought the baby had a chance.
"We generally keep them warm and let them expire by themselves" he said. "These are not viable babies, and it's crazy to do anything more."
Others said they withdraw treatment but only once it becomes clear that their efforts would be futile. Decisions to withdraw care are usually made after consultations between doctors, nurses and parents, but if these parties disagree, the treatment usually continues. If the parents and the doctors remain at odds about the proper course of treatment, the baby is sometimes moved to another hospital.
 
Beyond Survival
Long-Term Ills And Impairment
 For doctors and parents, decisions on care of premature infants are inevitably tortured affairs, complicated by the impossibility of determining the ultimate fate of any given infant. While doctors know, for example, that about 40 percent of babies weighing 600 grams at birth, about 1 pound, 5 ounces, will apparently be normal at one year, they have few clues as to which babies will fall into which group. And no one knows if babies who have normal brain examinations at 1 year will be developmentally normal at 6 or 7.
"Moms are constantly asking me, 'Is my baby going to be O.K.,' and I have to say if you line up 100 babies here I can't tell you which will be doing well by kindergarten," Dr. Dweck said. "That's what makes it difficult for me to withdraw treatment in a willy-nilly fashion.
But others say that while this may be true at birth, once premature infants experience certain complications, their odds of leading normal lives become smaller and smaller. The most serious problem is bleeding in the the brain, which occurs in about 75 percent of babies under 1,000 grams, about 2 pounds, 3 ounces.
In many cases it will be mild and have no obvious long-term consequences, but specialists say that in about one-quarter of the cases the bleed will be severe, compressing important brain structures that in the short term leads to seizures and strokes and in the long term to permanent damage.
"In these cases the decision is not about death," Dr. Fleischman said. "It's about severe impairment. We know the child will be severely impaired, it's only the level that's hard to predict."
He said that in such cases he recommended that care be withdrawn, although he said he would continue at the parents' request.
The intensive care units for infants are technological marvels in miniature. At Westchester Medical Center, each tiny infant bed takes 13 electrical outlets and 3 gas lines, for oxygen and suctioning secretions from the baby's mouths and lungs. Laboratories now perform dozens of biochemical tests on a few drops of blood, tests that five years ago would have required a full vial -- a 20th of a premature baby's blood volume -- to complete.
New drugs released this year, called artificial surfactants, can improve the breathing capacity of the infant's normally stiff lungs. But some experts worry about overuse.
Studies on infants with respiratory distress syndrome have shown that the drug can decrease the length of time on a respirator for infants over 750 grams and can improve survival in babies from 500 to 750 grams. But, encouraged by the drug's manufacturers, many doctors are using the drug in babies who are well but are felt to be at risk of developing respiratory distress.
Even more worrisome to health care economists has been the proliferation of a hugely expensive artificial lung that sits outside the body, called ECMO, whose benefits for infants remain largely unproved. Also designed to rescue infants with severe breathing problems, it pumps blood out of the infant, saturates it with oxygen, and returns it to the body.
 
Ending Treatment
Of Morality And Legality
 Also driving doctors to aggressively save the tiny infants are fears. What if they withdraw treatment and the baby survives -- and is left even more damaged?
Dr. Dweck tells of a baby who was transferred to Westchester County Medical Center with trouble breathing and with signs of brain damage because of lack of oxygen. He had not moved for 10 days. "The parents and all four grandparents wanted the ventilator discontinued," Dr. Dweck said. "If I withdraw treatment and the baby lives, how much additional damage will I have done?"
And many worry about legal obligations in the wake of the Baby Doe cases of the mid-1980's when pediatricians were told they could be prosecuted under child abuse and neglect laws for withholding or withdrawing care from sick infants.
Although pediatricians like Dr. Fleischman insist that the law permits them to stop treating infants when treatment is clearly futile, many remain cautious. In a 1988 survey of neonatologists, half said they had performed treatments that they thought were not in a baby's best interest because of legal fears.
Dr. Fleischman said, "I am really concerned when I see a doctor who won't stop treatment when a baby is no longer benefiting."
But Dr. Rie said: "You have to go soft on pediatricians. Remember in the mid-80's there was 800 number to call if you thought a pediatrician was bumping off a kid."

HEADLINE: Washington Memo;
Win or Lose, Democrats Frustrated by Bush Veto

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 28

 BODY:
Congress is mounting three serious challenges to President Bush's streak of 22 successful vetoes, contesting him over unemployment benefits, civil rights and abortion counseling. But however those bills are settled, the results will not threaten the powerful White House strategy of saying no to Congressional Democrats first and negotiating later, if at all.
It is a strategy that breeds and thrives on partisanship in Congress, and one that often leads to no legislation at all. But at a time when there are few great problems that both Mr. Bush and the Democrats are committed to solving, that seems a small loss, one high-level Administration official said Friday. Congressional leaders see it differently, saying the lack of give and take results in domestic drift. 
 The three upcoming attempts to override vetoes are all on Congressional initiatives that the Bush Administration has treated as unnecessary, or worse.
 
Heavy on Politics
 The Administration has derided extending unemployment benefits for up to 20 weeks as needless in an economy that it says is improving. Both houses are expected to send the bill to the White House on Tuesday, and their votes will be laden with constituent politics, as well as national politics.
The civil rights bill, a measure to make it easier to sue in cases of alleged job discrimination, has much less political impetus behind it. The Administration does have a narrower bill of its own, but it is generally believed by lawmakers to prefer criticizing Congressional measures as likely to promote hiring quotas, a campaign issue for 1992, to getting a law enacted. The House passed the bill in June; the Senate is expected to take it up in two weeks.
The abortion counseling vote is a direct challenge to Administration policy. Both houses have voted to prohibit enforcement of an Administration regulation banning federally financed family planning clinics from telling pregnant women about abortion options. A House-Senate conference has not gotten down to work on aligning the bills.
 
Still a Powerful Tool
 History suggests that Mr. Bush's streak will be broken sometime. But even if the President loses one, the veto will not cease to be a powerful tool in his hands. Wielded with skill, it has helped keep the focus off domestic issues and on foreign policy, and it has frustrated Democrats in their continuing efforts to define themselves.
Republicans in Congress have gained almost as much as the Administration. The veto strategy has united them and given them purpose. In each house, Republicans have more votes than the one-third plus one needed to sustain a veto, but not enough more that they don't have to work at it.
Sometimes the threat of a veto has led to compromise on legislation that both sides found tolerable.
Mr. Bush likes to say that the veto power can bend Congress to his will. After telling an East Brunswick, N.J., fund-raising dinner on Tuesday that the Democratic legislative agenda amounted to "a bunch of garbage I will not sign," he added, "I'll continue to veto the bad stuff until we get good bills."
But persuading the Democrats to shift their position or modify a bill has been a relatively rare use of the veto. As Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House Republican whip, said Friday: "It's essentially a negative tool. It's a club, not a rapier."
If the Administration and the Republicans in either house count enough votes to sustain a veto, Mr. Gingrich said, they can "just say 'go away' " when Democrats push for action.
Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, views the veto just as seriously. He calls it "the most underestimated power in the American political system." He said Mr. Bush used the veto to "prevent others from dealing with the nation's problems, even though he himself offers no solutions to those problems."
Mr. Mitchell's description fits fairly well the Administration position on extending unemployment compensation for three million people who have been out of work at least half a year. Mr. Bush's budget director, Richard G. Darman, has repeatedly maintained that the recession is ending and that no bill is needed.
The Democrats probably have enough House Republicans with them for the two-thirds vote to override the compensation bill. In the Senate, 13 Republicans voted for the bill last Tuesday, but if Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader, can get four of them to switch, and he says he can, a veto will be sustained.
Neither of the other two issues is quite so central to the Democrats' identity as helping the unemployed. Indeed if the civil rights bill is enacted, it will be a case of the Republican initiative of Senator John C. Danforth of Missouri overcoming the "quota bill" contentions of the Administration.
When that bill comes up in about two weeks, Democrats hope to deliver all their 57 Senators, and Mr. Danforth hopes to find at least nine Republican allies. He has six publicly committed so far.
But that will not be the end of it, because the House vote in June for a tougher bill was less than a two-thirds majority. Mr. Gingrich said he was sure that if the Senate passed the bill with veto-proof strength Mr. Bush would return to arguing that the bill fosters racial quotas, the argument he used against the House bill but then muzzled until last week.
The abortion issue is even less partisan. Republicans have taken the lead against their President in both houses. Congress is turning increasingly to favor abortion rights, and this particular issue, with its overtones of free speech and medical ethics, is probably the toughest for the anti-abortion forces to win.
But the veto strategy affects far more than these three bills. It has dimmed the Democrats' self-image as the party that offers solutions.
Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House majority leader, acknowledged the problem. But he argued, "We were elected to do what we think is in the highest and best interests of the country, and not to tailor those votes because we can't see it through easily to a conclusion."
He continued: "In order to define the differences between the parties, we have to put on his desk what we think the country should do and if he vetoes, try to override."
But Mr. Gingrich said Mr. Bush's use of the veto "forces the Democrats to confront whether they want to be legislators or press-release artists," able to make a point but not to enact a law.
However the situation is labeled, making the point becomes increasingly important as the elections near. For example, Democrats plan to try to pass an income tax bill with a pro-middle class, anti-rich tilt early next year, even though they know it will be vetoed.
Representative Thomas J. Downey, the Long Island Democrat who has been the chief House sponsor of the extended unemployment benefits bill, even observed that if somehow Congress won all three upcoming veto fights, that might be a curse in disguise because the public would expect more of Congress than it would be able to deliver.
Thomas Mann, director of Governmental Studies at the Brookings Institution, observed that the Democrats may "probably be better off not overriding." In defeat, they can claim that Mr. Bush prevented a problem from being solved. In victory, the public gets to judge whether their solution has actually solved anything.
"Sometimes the worst thing you can do is get your bill passed," Mr. Mann said.

Opportunity Knocks in Europe

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
The stock market picked up momentum in the third quarter, as the average stock fund gained 6.1 percent through Thursday. Small stocks kept chugging along, rising 10.2 percent as a group, according to Lipper Analytical Services in Summit, N.J.
 Among specialty funds, the health-and-biotechnology group was the leader, rising 17.8 percent, with financial services funds (up 10.6 percent) and science-and-technology funds (up 9.6 percent) also performing well. 
Next were the funds that invest in European stocks; they were up 8.2 percent. This was a sharp turnaround from their negative showing in 1991's first half. But even with the big third-quarter gain, the 23 European funds have risen only 3.5 percent so far in 1991, compared with the average stock fund's gain of 21 percent.
 The fund managers say the poor showing is a natural reaction to the "Europhoria" in 1990's first half after the Berlin Wall crumbled. The burst of optimism in early 1990 came "full circle, to pessimism in early June" of 1991, as the costs of German unification became clear, said John R. Hickling, who manages the $314 million Fidelity Europe Fund. But investors' perceptions "have improved somewhat since then," he said.
 Moreover, the dollar has been strong relative to European currencies. So while markets abroad have performed well in local terms, the returns for United States investors have lagged. Further problems were the turmoil related to the Gulf crisis -- Europe is largely dependent on outside sources of energy -- and fears related to the unrest in the Soviet Union.
 The picture now looks much brighter. Managers of six of the largest European funds -- most of which posted third-quarter gains of 9 or 10 percent -- are uniformly optimistic. They say the prospects for European growth are excellent.
 For one thing, most European economies are nearing the bottom of recessionary phases and are poised for strong stock market rallies. For another, the markets represent good value in terms of price-to-earnings ratios, stock prices relative to book value and cash-flow measurements. Then there are the long-term themes: the development of Eastern Europe and the unification of the European Community.
 The European funds' lackluster performance in the last year "to my mind, is an opportunity," said Albert J. Alan, who manages the $600 million Merrill Lynch Eurofund. Glenn Wellman, manager of the $130 million Alliance New Europe Fund, offers a caveat. He said, "Because exchange rates and markets have been volatile, I would urge shareholders to take an intermediate-range view of growth prospects in Europe -- two to five years -- and ignore the short-term volatility there."
 John R. Legat, manager of the $1.4 billion GT Europe Growth Fund, predicts the growth rate in the former East Germany will be between 5 and 10 percent next year, and he expects other Eastern European economies to pick up in 1992 and 1993. Such growth would be "a positive for demand for goods and services that Western Europe can provide," he said. He particularly likes three German engineering and equipment manufacturers: Siemens, Linde and Mannesmann.
 Like other managers interviewed, Mr. Legat has a higher percentage of his fund's holdings in British stocks than in any other single nation. His British issues are heavy in defensive stocks to weather the recession. One favorite is Tiphook, a transportation and shipping container rental company.
 Mr. Hickling of Fidelity is pursuing European cyclical stocks, especially in Britain, to benefit from the improving economies there. Three favorite British retailers: Kingfisher, Dixons and Tesco.
 Mr. Wellman has 10 percent of the Alliance portfolio invested in business and trade-related services, to capitalize on the removal of European trade barriers by the end of 1992. He likes Ericsson, a Swedish telecommunications equipment manufacturer, and Racal and Cellnet, British telecommunications companies. Another large portion is committed to distribution and transportation -- notably Tripcovich, an Italian trucking company, and Frans Maas in the Netherlands.
 Mr. Alan's two biggest holdings are banking and insurance, which he says are interest-rate sensitive industries that will benefit from falling interest rates in Europe. He likes two French banks -- Credit Lyonnaise and BNP -- and AMEV, a Dutch insurer.
 William F. Wendler, vice president of Rowe Price-Fleming International, which manages the $103 million T. Rowe Price European Stock Fund, also likes interest-rate sensitive companies, particularly Eurotunnel, which is building the English Channel tunnel, and EuroDisney, which is building a theme park outside Paris. He also likes Hochtief, a German construction company.
 The largest holdings of the $71 million FSP European Portfolio, part of the Denver-based Invesco funds, include Astra, a Swedish pharmeceuticals company. The fund's manager, Steven A. Chamberlin, says Astra is showing strong earnings growth. He also likes stocks that stand to profit from the recovery in the United States economy, especially Ahold, a Dutch food retailer with United States production subsidiaries.

It's Time to Stop Poking Along at 55

BYLINE: By DONALD L. PEVSNER; Donald L. Pevsner is a Miami attorney, consumer advocate and columnist.

 BODY:
Driving 70 miles per hour on the national Interstate System of highways and 60 to 65 m.p.h. on rural Federal and state highways used to be legal and safe. Now armies of police lie in wait for motorists who do it, bringing fat revenues to the states and to insurance and radar-detector companies. But the economic rationale for the 55 m.p.h. limit no longer exists nor do valid safety grounds. It's time to raise the speed limit.
In 1973, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries created a temporary, artificial oil shortage worldwide. As people panicked on long gas lines, Congress ordered a maximum national speed limit of 55 miles per hour. Billions in Federal highway funds would be cut off to states that defied it. This "temporary" measure, billed as a fuel-efficiency move, became permanent in 1975. But it has produced mass civil disobedience, engendering contempt on the part of citizens that resembles nothing so much as their reaction to the Volstead Act and Prohibition. 
 An unholy trinity of special interests gets rich from the enforcement of this law.
States reap vast rewards. Indeed, enforcement reeks of being strictly revenue-driven. Driving 70 miles per hour in a 55 m.p.h. zone in Colorado will cost $64; in Florida, $112. In 1990, one state trooper, who likes to hide at the bottom of a hill on the Pennsylvania Turnpike in rural Westmoreland County, wrote $640,000 worth of speeding tickets.
Automobile insurance companies gouge policyholders when it comes to speeding violations. One nasty ploy against newly ticketed policyholders is to refuse to renew them at standard rates, often driving them into higher priced subsidiaries, surcharge schemes or state assigned-risk plans. The nation's two largest auto insurers, the State Farm Mutual Auto Insurance Company and the Allstate Insurance Company, have set up units to underwrite drivers who have received as little as one ticket in the preceding three years -- at rates about twice those charged by their "clean record" divisions. Other auto insurers take similarly Draconian measures.
Radar-detector manufacturers sell more than $300 million worth of units annually, while their corporate cousins sell costlier clocking devices to the police. In this "Star Wars" contest, the consumer is paying for both sides.
There are excellent reasons to get rid of the 55 m.p.h. limit. There is no oil shortage in the world today, nor does any responsible official predict one. Today's cars are twice as fuel-efficient as their counterparts in the 1970's. Furthermore, the highway safety argument does not hold for the Interstate System, which was designed for speeds of at least 70 m.p.h. in non-urban areas.
Last year, two respected Federal Highway Administration traffic-safety engineers, Samuel C. Tignor and Davey Warren, concluded that most speed zones were posted 15 m.p.h. below the maximum safe speed; that, on average, speed limits are set too low to be accepted as reasonable by most drivers, and that the posted speeds make violators out of motorists who drive reasonably and safely. Further, they said, increasing speed limits would not result in still-higher speeds; it would increase compliance, so enforcement could be targeted at the truly high-risk driver.
Interstate speed limits should return to 70 m.p.h., with lower exceptions in congested urban areas and in terrain provably unsafe at 70. Priority should be given to removing the 55 m.p.h. rural Interstate limit in eight Northeastern states; most others went to 65 m.p.h. after Congress revised the 1974 law in 1987. Non-urban Federal and state highways should have 60 to 65 m.p.h. limits, following the counsel of safety engineers instead of revenue-hungry politicians. Politicians supporting the status quo should be voted out.

HEADLINE: Homeowners Said to Face Rise in Costs To Clean Up Environment

BYLINE: By LEO H. CARNEY

 BODY:
HOMEOWNERS across New Jersey can expect the cost of sewer, water and garbage-disposal services to nearly triple on the average by 1994 because of regulations aimed at cleaning up the environment, a newly released state study says. As a result, the study concludes, municipalities may be forced to raise taxes or cut services.
Business groups hail the study, saying it lends support to their argument that business has borne a larger share of the cost of protecting the environment than have municipalities and property owners. Municipal organizations and consumer groups are less sanguine. The study, they say, is further evidence of the mounting tax burden on state residents. 
 "This study is dismal for us," said William Dressel, the chief lobbyist for the New Jersey State League of Municipalities. "It is the worst news at the worst possible time."
The findings of the study point up several of the crucial issues that will frame the environmental debate of the 1990's. To what extent will individuals be willing to alter habits to protect the environment, like forgoing cars in favor of mass transit? At what point does the electorate, already chafing under the burden of soaring education and auto insurance costs, begin to reject more stringent environment policies and the lawmakers who enact them?
The study is seen as important because Gov. Jim Florio has made a clean environment one of his administration's priorities. But the study was not being well received by those who had struggled with the administration over its $2.8 billion increase in state taxes to balance the state budget and over changes in school aid.
The study, which was commissioned in 1989 by what is now the State Department of Environmental Protection and Energy but made public only several weeks ago, says that environmental regulations on sewage treatment, water supplies and garbage disposal will have cost the average household $159 more each year between 1990 and 1994, a total of $795 more for the period. The average annual cost for those services will rise to $1,227 in 1994 from $432 in 1989.
The 158-page study was conducted by Policy Planning and Evaluation Inc., a consulting company in Herndon, Va.
 
Ban on Dumping Sludge in Ocean
 John W. Hazen, a legislative analyst for the state environmental and energy agency, said the costs mentioned in the study were the cumulative result of regulations for the required secondary treatment of sewage, as well as rules in a 1990 state law that banned the dumping of sewage sludge in the ocean as of last March.
Mr. Hazen said six major utility authorities in the northern part of the state had had to incur higher costs for sludge disposal by sending it to landfills out of state. Future regulations on the beneficial disposal of sludge, like composting, might some day bring those costs down, but Mr. Hazen could not say if that would be before 1994.
Other costly regulations, he said, are those being put into place to close 300 overburdened landfills and to assure monitoring to prevent future offsite contamination or illegal dumping. The state, he said, is establishing regional transfer stations for out-of-state garbage disposal, and the planning and construction of secure sanitary landfills in New Jersey are translating into higher costs for disposal.
Also, he said, regulations governing the closing of contaminated private and municipal wells, or on the overpumping of underground water supplies in areas like Ocean, Monmouth and Camden Counties, are causing water rates to increase as new sources are found to replace the old ones.
The study notes that other major environmental costs, for the control of auto and industry air emissions, for example, are not included.
Warning of "rate shock" for local officials and taxpayers, the study concludes that "some municipalities may have to increase taxes and/or reduce levels of municipal services over the long run" to pay for complying with the regulations.
Scott A. Weiner, Commissioner of the state environmental agency, said the cost evaluation of the study "underscores the seriousness of the types of policy and financial commitment decisions facing society, like who should be paying for environmental protection and what should be paid for."
Hal Bozarth, the executive director of the Chemical Industry Council of New Jersey, said the study was "one more arrow in our quiver" in the council's argument that individuals and municipalities that generate pollution must share the cost of controlling it.
 
'The Public Will Get a Taste'
 "We have been saying for some time that sooner or later, the public will get a taste of what environmental protection is all about, and this study is it," Mr. Bozarth said. "The responsibility for a cleaner environment does not just fall on industries like ours, but on communities and individuals."
Edward Lloyd, a lawyer for the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group, said, among other things, that the study should have emphasized conservation as a means of reducing the cost of water supplies, but that it had not. The study recommended the regionalization and privatization of sewer and water systems and garbage disposal, as well as an unprecedented campaign by the state environmental agency to achieve pollution prevention as a means of reducing future costs for these services.
Specifically, the study recommended steps like preserving more open space and wetlands, both of which help abate flooding and prevent pollution, thereby saving capital costs for systems like reservoirs and pollution controls.
The prevention of casual disposal of household toxic chemicals, including used oils and paints, was also recommended by the study as a means of reducing the cost of sewage treatment and the toxic cleanup of solid waste landfills. The study recommended developing a long-term plan of environmental priorities, taking into account the amount of state grants needed to put new regulations into effect, the retirement and issuance of debt and the existing debt burden on communities.
"Once a plan is prepared," the study said, "it would be possible to change priorities in a more enlightened manner."
 
$10 Billion in Improvements
 Improvements to sewer, water and garbage-disposal systems will cost almost $10 billion between 1990 and 1994, the study said. And whereas New Jersey residents were spending an average of 1.25 percent of their annual gross household incomes for sewer, water and garbage services in 1989, the study said, they will spend an average of almost 1.8 percent in each of the five years. Residents in communities of 50,000 or more people will spend 2.3 percent, up from 1.9 percent in 1989, the study said.
Mr. Dressel said the State League of Municipalities had recently concluded a hard-fought and successful battle to keep local property taxes down by arguing for a more equitable financing of state aid to public schools through the Quality Education Act.
"The cost of environmental regulation is as big if not bigger than the education issue," he said. "Local taxes are going to go sky-high."
Becky Taylor, a spokeswoman for the state environmental agency, said the study "had somewhat been on hold for a year or so" and was not released until just last month. Ms. Taylor said that the former Environmental Commissioner, Judith Yaskin, "took a look at this thing and was very unhappy that it only gave one side of the equation, environmental costs, and not the benefits of a cleaner environment."
Commissioner Weiner felt the same way, Ms. Taylor said, but "finally decided to release the study, even though he felt it might be a disservice to the public." She added, "That is why the Commissioner added the prologue to the study."
 
A Bureaucracy Bogged Down
 The study said the state environmental agency in 1989 was a bureaucracy bogged down by its own very costly and time-consuming permitting process, as well as a plethora of regulations that municipalities generally found out about only at the last moment and seldom had a chance to anticipate.
Mr. Weiner states in the prologue that the study was in response to national concerns about environmental costs, as well as "a growing number of appeals received from municipal officials throughout New Jersey for relief and assistance in meeting environmental mandates."
In an interview, the Commissioner said the departmental reorganization that he began upon taking office seven months ago was already bearing fruit in that it addressed some of the study's criticisms of his agency. Among the changes under way, Mr. Weiner said, was the appointment of assistant commissioners to more closely oversee and to revise the agency's policies on the permit process, enforcement and toxic cleanup.
Mr. Lloyd, who is also director of the Rutgers Environmental Law Clinic in Newark and a longtime observer of environmental agencies, said it was "too early to tell" if Mr. Weiner's reorganization of his department had produced a more responsible and efficient agency that could streamline its sluggish operations of the past.
 
'A Lot Has Changed'
 "But my concern now is whether the costs and the study are valid because they were made based on regulations of policies in place in 1989," Mr. Lloyd said. "A lot has changed since then in the solid waste area, for example, including a more effective recycling effort statewide and the state's change in policy from wanting to build many incinerators to building only a few on a regional basis."
Ms. Taylor said the state environmental agency could give "no realistic estimate" of whether the higher costs predicted in the study for 1990, the first year, had actually materialized.
"We would have to do a lot more work," she said. A second phase of the study, looking at the benefits of a cleaner environment, will be completed in about a year, she said.
Mr. Weiner declined to speculate on specific economic benefits of the cleaner environment, saying only that cleaner air, water and communities were more attractive to business and industry and to prospective developers.
Jim Sinclair, the first vice president of the Business and Industry Association of New Jersey, said businesses paid 40 percent of the taxes in the state and were not pleased that environmental costs and therefore property taxes would continue to rise. He said there was an atmosphere of overregulation in the state, one of the criticisms contained in the report.
 
Federal Cutbacks a Factor
 Dave Kehler, president of the Public Affairs Research Institute in Princeton, said the higher cost that municipalities were being asked to bear for environmental regulations would result from the sharp decline in Federal grants to states that had been common in the 1960's and 70's. These grants financed such things as the construction of sewage treatment plants, he said.
"State and local governments in the last decade have not responded well to these Federal cutbacks," Mr. Kehler said. "They thought that political pressure would reverse the federalism policies, but it did not. The states and municipalities did not have a plan B."
Mr. Kehler added, "It is important to realize that these costs represent a real issue, as opposed to a political one."

LOW LIFE
Lures and Snares of Old New York.
By Luc Sante.
Illustrated. 414 pp. New York:
Farrar, Straus & Giroux.
$27.50.  
 If the city's financial crisis is making New Yorkers long for the old days when policemen walked the beat, the El rattled up Third Avenue and a drink cost six cents, they should think again. According to Luc Sante's "Low Life: Lures and Snares of Old New York," the cop was on the take, vice lurked under the iron girders and the drink was probably a Mickey Finn.
Mr. Sante chronicles the city's seamy underside between 1840 and 1920, from the woeful physical condition of the tenements to their residents' various criminal activities -- drugs, prostitution and gambling each get a chapter -- to the city's largely cosmetic efforts to contain its worst excesses. Grinding poverty trapped new immigrants as they stepped off the boat. Life in the tenements was tawdry and brutal. Some families could not afford a room in a cellar and ended up in hellholes like the notorious Old Brewery, an abandoned factory in lower Manhattan where hundreds camped out without basic sanitation, light or air. Recreational pursuits ran to rat baiting and "dime museums," a tony moniker for permanent freak shows featuring tattooed men and risque tableaux.
Women's options were limited to piecework, sweatshops or prostitution, Mr. Sante writes, but men who did not want to mortgage their youth to the factories could ply any number of illegal trades. The Whyo gang, whose members roamed lower Manhattan in the decades after the Civil War, offered to blacken eyes for $4, break an arm or a leg for $19 or chew off ears for $15. Crooked gambling operations also flourished after the war, with hundreds of establishments springing up to cater to the seemingly bottomless cupidity of the marks. Patrons were often fleeced before they even reached the tables. Many of the gaming houses, saloons and sporting establishments routinely served drinks laced with chloral hydrate, then robbed the customers while they were under the influence.
Where amid this mayhem were the forces of law and order? When they weren't duking it out with one another -- the rival Municipal and Metropolitan police forces held an epic battle in 1857 that left 52 policemen injured -- they harvested protection from the local madams, streetwalkers, thieves and fences. Politicians were, if anything, more corrupt than the police force. When Tammany Hall ran Asa Bird Gardiner for District Attorney in 1897, the slogan of his successful campaign was "To hell with reform."
"Low Life" captures the rollicking atmosphere of city life during the period. In his first book, Mr. Sante, a freelance journalist, moves along swiftly, rarely bogging down in numbers, chronologies or social history. He quotes primary sources sparingly, at times sacrificing the flavor of the era. Instead, he favors anecdotes and character sketches like his portrait of John Allen, a former divinity student who decorated his house of ill repute with religious paraphernalia and held prayer meetings for his girls. At times this tour-guide approach clashes with the events, as in his description of the antiabolition riots of 1834, a vicious outbreak of racism that destroyed black churches and homes. Still, Mr. Sante reclaims an essential piece of the city's past, one that should reassure contemporary New Yorkers. This is far from the worst of times.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
'Harlot's Ghost' Is Revising Fiction's Role as Cheap Date

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN

 BODY:
In the pricing of American books, Hemingway has traditionally taken a back seat to historians, and a reader is likely to spend more for a fix-it book or a collection of inspirational ditties than for a book by Proust.
But when Norman Mailer's new novel "Harlot's Ghost" hit the bookstores last week with a price tag of $30, readers were put on notice that they may soon have to start paying what novels actually cost to produce. 
 The book is the first work of popular fiction to cross the $30 threshold, and it took a leap to get there. The closest-priced novels are selling for a full $5 less. The publisher, Random House, said it had no choice but to charge that much, because at nearly four pounds "Harlot's Ghost" weighs as much as a roast that could feed eight people, and at 1,328 pages it has more heft than the average King James Version.
"Even at this price, it's underpriced," said Bruce Harris, who is in charge of sales at Random House. "It costs a lot to produce a book this size. It had to be done."
If Random House gambled correctly and readers make the book a best seller, people in the industry say, other publishers will push up the prices of their novels, even ones that do not match the formidable dimensions of "Harlot's Ghost."
There does not seem to be a hard and fast reason why nonfiction has traditionally been priced higher than fiction. Publishers say that people buy fewer copies of nonfiction, so the production costs are ultimately higher, and that the audience for nonfiction has generally been more affluent than the fiction audience and thus more willing to spend money.
Until recent years, moreover, there was a long-held feeling within the industry that publishers are somehow morally obliged to keep novels within the financial reach of most readers -- even at the risk of losing money -- because literature is a "product" that cannot be copied and sold like knockoff suits for a cheaper price.
But publishers say they can no longer be oblivious to market realities. With the recession and with more and more publishing houses being bought up by multinational corporations that demand balanced budgets, publishers in the last few years have begun to think and act more like business people.
 
'An Underpriced Commodity'
 The $30 novel is not a statement or a gamble, they say. It is as realistic as a $10,000 economy car, a $7.50 movie ticket and a $2 ice cream cone.
"Books cost this much to make," said Barry Lippman, publisher at Macmillan Inc. "There's no other place a publisher recoups his money but in the cost of the book. And books are an underpriced commodity from a pure product point of view."
Mr. Lippman points to a study showing that the price of books had risen very little over the last decade, compared with the price of, say, an Ivy League education, a car, a movie or a house.
By his calculations, the average price of a house has risen 83 percent, to $140,000 in 1990, from $76,400 in 1980; the price of a Ford Thunderbird has gone up 157 percent, to $17,480 from $6,808, and movie prices have increased 114 percent, to $7.50 from $3.50. Meanwhile, according to Mr. Lippman's chart, hard-cover fiction has risen 64 percent, to $17.95 from $10.95.
 
Likelihood of Discounts
 Many readers who buy the new Mailer book will not even pay the full $30 list price, because the large chain bookstores generally sell books at a discount, particularly if a book either is a best seller or has big expectations.
A spokeswoman for the Barnes & Noble book chain said its stores would sell "Harlot's Ghost" at a 15 percent discount, or $25.50, and would double the discount if the book made The New York Times best seller list.
Random House did not come easily to its decision to price the book at a record $30. And despite mixed reviews, executives there are not publicly questioning their choice. They took a similar, much-discussed gamble with a nonfiction volume last year when they priced a book based on the PBS television series "The Civil War" by Ken Burns, at $50, far above the nonfiction standard. It became a best seller.
Setting the price for the Mailer book was one of the first big decisions for Harold Evans when he took over as publisher at Random House earlier this year. "There was a lot of cold feet about doing it," Mr. Evans recalled, "a feeling that a $30 novel would put people off."
 
'Unthinkable' Cutbacks
 So, the internal hand-wringing began. Could Mr. Mailer be persuaded to trim the manuscript? The idea was "unthinkable" to the book's editor, Jason Epstein, Mr. Evans said. Could the text be set in smaller type with tighter margins to cut the number of pages? "I thought it was a bad idea," Mr. Evans said. "It's really a beautiful book and very easy to read this way."
Mr. Evans casually polled booksellers about the price. Some winced, he said, but most said that the $30 novel was an inevitability and that of all contemporary authors, Mr. Mailer was the best one for the gamble.
"If ever there was a book that you would risk breaking the $30 price barrier with, this is it," said William S. Lofquist, a publishing analyst at the United States Department of Commerce. "You've got the huge size of the book; you have a great, very hot subject -- the C.I.A. -- and you have a dynamite author who's a name brand, like Colgate."
After running through and rejecting a host of ways to cut the production costs, Random House decided to leap over the $30 breach. "At the end of the day," Mr. Evans concluded, "Mailer is worth it."
 
200,000 Advance Orders
 Booksellers also seemed to think the risk was worth it. In all, they placed advance orders for 200,000 copies of the book.
Stuart Applebaum, a vice president at Bantam Doubleday Dell, said he still remembered the "hue and cry" when Delacorte priced James Clavell's novel "Noble House" at $19.95 in 1981. "People were saying then that this is going to destroy the hard-cover fiction industry to have a novel at such a high tariff," Mr. Applebaum said. "And the industry survived, and here we are with a $30 upper limit."
As pleasures go, reading a novel -- even one with a $30 price tag -- is still relatively cheap. A two-hour movie at $7.50 a ticket ends up costing about 6 cents a minute, while Mr. Mailer's book, read at a pace of about two minutes a page, runs about a penny a minute. And when measured by weight, "Harlot's Ghost" comes out at just under 50 cents an ounce, while the same amount of Beluga caviar fetches about $55.

HEADLINE: Tool Orders Rose 22% Last Month

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29

 BODY:
Orders for American-made machine tools rose 22 percent in August from the previous month, according to the monthly report of the Association for Manufacturing Technology. It was the third consecutive monthly increase, but orders remained below the level of a year earlier, the trade group said.
The report, to be released on Monday, found that machine tool orders rose to $235.7 million last month, from $193.3 million in July. But the September level was 15 percent lower than the September 1990 figure, when orders totaled $276.8 million. 
 The August increase was led by a jump in orders for metal-forming tools, which more than doubled from the July level. So far this year, machine tool orders have totaled $1.6 billion, down 17.3 percent from the comparable period last year.
 
Indicator of Growth
 Machine tools are precision machines used to manufacture metal products, ranging from cookware to weapons. Although the industry is relatively small, its activity is considered an important indicator of the strength of industrial production.
"We remain cautiously optimistic since orders are up for the third month in a row and cancellations are at their lowest level in over seven years," said Albert W. Moore, president of the industry association.
Mr. Moore said he was also encouraged by recent economic data.
"Capacity utilization rates have been inching upward, creating a climate for increased capital expenditures," he said.
The trade group, based in McLean, Va., said shipments of machine tools fell 14 percent in August, to $183.3 million, from $212.8 million in July, and dropped 21 percent from $231.4 million in August 1990.
The group said export orders totaled $31.4 million in August, a decrease from July's $43.1 million total but up substantially from the $16.7 million posted a year ago. Export shipments totaled $30.8 million in August, down from $40.5 million in July and $34.2 million a year earlier.
Orders for metal-forming tools were $109.30 million, more than double the July level of $47.7 million. They were $48.3 million a year earlier.
Domestic orders for forming tools were at $87.1 million, about three times the level of the previous month. Shipments for metal-forming tools slid to $46 million, from $63.4 million a month earlier and $75.6 million a year earlier.
Shipments of metal-cutting tools fell to $137.4 million, 8 percent below the July total. Orders for metal-cutting tools also fell in August, to $126.4 million, 13 percent below the previous month and 45 percent below a year earlier.
The trade group said the August backlog of orders was $1.36 billion, up from $1.31 billion. The August 1990 backlog was $1.61 billion

As Election Year Nears, Bush Counts on the Fed

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
President Bush held an economic summit conference of sorts last week, and the bond market rallied. The continued soft economy that prompted the conference may be good news for interest rates. But some credit market analysts say economic growth might not come as soon as Mr. Bush would like, with a Presidential election year drawing closer.
The meeting seemed to underscore what appears to be a working assumption at the White House: monetary policy will provide enough stimulus to produce real growth in the economy of 2 to 2.5 percent over the next 13 months. Yet the assumption that the Federal Reserve board can provide the cure, these analysts said, is a big gamble. 
 Problems generated in the 1980's, ranging from real estate to the "credit crunch" to the continuing shrinkage of the service sector, are "structural weaknesses that are not amenable to changes in monetary policy," said Norman Robertson, chief economist at the Mellon National Bank in Pittsburgh.
"And people are beginning to sense that what we are experiencing is not just a normal cyclical fluctuation," Mr. Robertson added. "I think we are facing a period of economic growth that will be much slower and much less steady than has been the norm since World War II."
 
Weak Outlook for a Voting Year
 With only one exception over the last two decades, the economy has been clipping along at about a 5 percent growth rate when voters went to the polls to vote for a President. The exception was 1980, when the economy contracted slightly.
That year, Ronald Reagan asked Americans if they were better off than they had been four years earlier, and the electorate responded by spurning Jimmy Carter and giving Mr. Reagan and his running mate, George Bush, a sweeping victory.
Thus, by election-year standards, 2 percent growth would be exceptionally modest. And given current conditions, "I would say Mr. Bush's chances are no better than 50-50" that such a level of growth will be achieved, said Joseph Carson, chief economist of Chemical Bank.
And those odds apply, Mr. Carson said, only if Washington provides some fiscal stimulus to the economy. With a budget deficit that could climb close to $400 billion during the fiscal year that begins tomorrow, however, most analysts are assuming that the hands of the President and the Congress are tied.
 
A 'Financial Straitjacket'
 Without some tax relief, Mr. Carson said, household incomes will remain strapped. "I don't know," he said, "if interest rates could fall low enough to get the household sector out of the financial straitjacket they are in."
Aside from lowering interest rates, Administration officials seem to believe that more pressure from the Fed and less stringent regulation will prod banks to pick up the pace of lending. That assumption is also flawed, some economists said.
"To the extent there is a credit crunch, I don't think it is being caused by excessive regulation," said Lawrence Chimerine, a senior adviser to Data Resources Inc., an economic forecasting firm in Lexington, Mass. "The fact is, banks just can't take risks," he said. "At this point, expecting regulators to turn things around is the same as expecting the Fed to turn things around."
 
Tight Bank Credit Continues
 Paul L. Kasriel, a vice president and monetary economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago, said regulators' demands that banks increase capital were necessary for the industry, but "it takes time" to meet those requirements.
In the meantime, "we are seeing some of the weakest, if not the weakest, credit creation by depository institutions since the early 1950's," Mr. Kasriel said. "It's a very troublesome situation," he added.
While many have their doubts, some economists said the Fed would be able to deliver the 2 to 2.5 percent growth that it and the Administration would like to see over the next year.
Since mid-1989, the Fed has eased monetary policy 13 times, and short-term interest rates have fallen by 47 percent, noted Robert Barbera, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers. "That is a little bit less than average" the amount the Fed has eased in past recessions, he added.
 
Fed Still Has Maneuvering Room
 "The Fed is still in the easing process," Mr. Barbera said, "and history suggests that in the next three to four months we will have a significant recovery," with above-average growth for two to three quarters.
"I don't think the President has anything to worry about on the economy," said Jerry L. Jordan, a senior vice president at First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles. "I think they have their 2 percent to 3 percent growth in the bag."
And yet, if most forecasts are correct, economic data that are expected this week are not likely to provide much solace to Mr. Bush or his lieutenants.
September employment data, expected from the Labor Department on Friday, will be the event most awaited by credit market participants.
Most economists are projecting that the unemployment rate rose in September by one-tenth of a percentage point, or more, from the 6.8 percent level of August, and that non-farm payroll employment rose by only 40,000 or 50,000. Although employment gains of any size are welcome, an increase in that range would not be synonymous with a rapidly recovering economy.
If payrolls did expand by 50,000 in September, the total number of new jobs added since April, when the recession is now thought to have bottomed, would amount to only 160,000, said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst for the Chase Manhattan Corporation.
In past recoveries, the rise in payroll employment over a similar period of time is around 500,000, Mr. Fine added.
"For a recovery, that is very, very weak," he said.

HEADLINE: Weak Dollar Magnifies Gains of Foreign Stock Exchanges

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN

 BODY:
World markets continued to move sideways in the third quarter. The Mexican, British and French exchanges led a sluggish pack, but the biggest gains came to those investors who made the best of a slipping dollar.
Of 24 world stock markets listed on the Financial Times index, only 8 rose by at least 1 percent measured in their own currencies. But with the dollar falling 7.8 percent against the mark and about 3.1 percent against the yen, 18 of the 24 rose in terms of the dollar. 
 Since their rally earlier this year, following the quick end to the Persian Gulf war and short-lived hopes for a strong economic recovery in the United States, the markets have been mostly lackluster. With central banks remaining generally tight-fisted, European markets edged up 2.9 percent for the quarter, compared with rises of 4.5 percent in the United States and 1.8 percent in Japan.
Mexico's topping the list hardly came as a surprise in a year in which the Bolsa de Valores, as Mexico City's bourse is known, has risen 111.6 percent. Hong Kong's exchange was a distant second with 33.3 percent growth for the year, followed by the exchanges in Sweden, Spain, Australia, Denmark and France. The stock markets in Britain, South Africa, Ireland and Switzerland have also risen more than 20 percent this year.
 
Gloom Turned to Confidence
 If anything was remarkable about Mexico's performance, it was that the Bolsa rose a bit more slowly -- 22.76 percent -- despite improving prospects for a North American free-trade agreement, the ruling party's victory in state and legislative elections on Aug. 18, and the successful sale of Mexico's biggest bank a week later. Its good long-term prospects aside, some analysts are growing uneasy about how Mexico will finish the year, given demand for money that has pushed overnight interest rates to about 30 percent.
In Britain, long months of gloom gave way to all-time highs in the stock market. The economy rebounded quickly after the Government, which must call national elections by June, cut interest rates sharply. With consumer spending and other confidence indicators up, the market rose 8.14 percent -- and 16.05 percent in dollar terms.
In France, expectations of a drop in the nation's high real interest rates and a sense that the economy has hit bottom helped to fuel a similar rise. And while the French Bourse jumped 7.37 percent when measured in francs, the gain was 15.55 percent when converted into dollars.
Across most of Europe, the attempted Soviet coup in August was scarcely visible in the markets as the quarter ended. "The effect of the coup was really like a summer storm," said Gavin R. Dobson, president of Murray Johnstone International in Chicago. "If you'd gone on vacation the Friday before and come back a week later, you'd have seen no net effect." Finland's market was perhaps the exception. It sits firmly at the bottom of the index's rankings for the year, tumbling 15.33 percent in the quarter .
 
Outside Europe, Mixed Results
 Beyond Europe, the news of the quarter was mixed. In Hong Kong, where huge airport and harbor projects are hinting at the dimensions of a new economic future under Chinese control, the stock market rose 6.83 percent, and 7.06 percent in dollar terms.
In Singapore, the market fell 5.1 percent, but less than 1 percent in dollar terms.
In the second quarter, South Africa's indexes reached or surpassed all-time highs; this quarter, the market did not move at all, except for an 8 percent rise in dollar terms.

HEADLINE: Small Stocks Did Best in Quarter, as Impatient Investors Looked for Growth

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
During a quarter in which the large stock exchanges advanced only modestly, the over-the-counter market showed robust growth.
"The over-the-counter market led the way," said Laszlo Birinyi, the head of Birinyi Associates, the Wall Street research firm. 
 He said the over-the-counter market gained more than 10 percent in the third quarter, compared with gains of about 4 percent for the other exchanges and indexes. The Dow Jones industrial average gained slightly less than 4 percent for the period.
 
Frustrated Investors
 With billions of dollars pouring into the stock market, investors are growing increasingly frustrated by the lackluster movement of Big Board stocks. "The spirit is willing, but the flesh is somewhat reluctant," Mr. Birinyi said.
He said investors had become spoiled by the prolonged bull market. "Now we are going back to eking out gains," he said. "The prevailing spirit here is frustration."
Hugh A. Johnson, the director of investment strategy for the First Albany Corporation in Albany, said, "The performance of the markets, with the exception of some of the small-capitalization issues, has been guarded, trendless and friendless.
"People are finding better value in the over-the-counter market," Mr. Johnson said.
Several experts said the strength of the over-the-counter stocks was unlikely to be a passing fancy. "When small-company stocks come to life," Mr. Johnson said, "and begin to outperform the market, that outperformance tends to last not months, not days, but years."
 
Years of Neglect
 Jack A. Sullivan, a principal with Van Kasper & Company , a San Francisco-based investment firm, noted that the strength in the over-the-counter market followed years of neglect. "The Nasdaq's terrific performance shows that there has finally been a recognition that some of the smaller, entrepreneurial companies in this country have really learned how to manage their businesses," he said.
He said investors were increasingly interested in ferreting out companies in which the chairman is the founder and largest shareholder. "That's the kind of company investors are paying for," he said.
Mr. Sullivan cited the Advanta Corporation, a financial-services company based in Horsham, Pa., as one company with high insider ownership and a strong growth rate. The company's stock rose 83 percent in the quarter, to $30.
The flip side of the enthusiasm for the smaller companies in the over-the-counter market is a growing impatience with the performance of the large-capitalization companies traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Many Big Board stocks are now considered too expensive, and investors are increasingly nervous that the companies will be unable to post earnings increases commensurate with the run-up in their stock prices earlier this year.
"There is intensifying concern that we will not get a strong enough recovery in the economy and earnings to valdidate those large-capitalization stock prices," said Mr. Johnson of First Albany.
 
'A Lot of Blow-ups'
 The concern is starting to show up in the brutal treatment accorded to stocks that disappoint investors.
"There were a lot of blowups this week, where individual stocks were taken out and shot," Mr. Sullivan said on Friday. He pointed to the fate of Community Psychiatric Centers of Laguna Hills, Calif. The company's stock plunged more than 27 percent on Friday when it reported third-quarter earnings of only a penny a share. The stock was the second-largest-percentage loser on the New York Stock Exchange during the quarter.
"At some point, there is an exhaustion of the willingness to wait for earnings," he said, pointing to the sharp drop of Community Psychiatric shares as a sign of "the beginning of the unwillingness to extend the hope."
Gene Seagle, the director of technical research for Gruntal & Company, said investors were easily flustered by earnings disappointments or bad economic statistics. "The bullishness is skin deep," he said. "You scratch that outside skin and you begin to see a little bear fuzz come through."
Still, Mr. Seagle said the market's ability to shrug off the failed coup in the Soviet Union and the Salomon Brothers Treasury-bidding scandal was a testament to the underlying strength in stocks.
 
4,137 Gains in Quarter
 Of 4,137 stocks tracked by Media General Services, 2,476 showed gains for the quarter, as of Friday, compared with 1,490 stocks that declined. Another 171 issues were unchanged for the quarter, which ends today. The Media General ranking is based on Friday's closing prices, and only includes stocks that were selling at $5 or more at the start of the quarter.
On the Big Board, 1,008 stocks were up for the period, while 533 lost ground. The issues of 55 companies were unchanged.
The biggest gainer on the Big Board was the Triton Energy Corporation in Dallas, which rose 127.6 percent, to $43.25. The shares continued to climb in excitement over the potential of a large Colombian oilfield discovered earlier this year.
Eljer Industries, a plumbing supplier based in Plano, Tex., was the Big Board's biggest loser. A proposed takeover by the Jacuzzi unit of Hanson P.L.C. of Britain fell apart in June after the company disclosed that it faced significant product-liability losses.
"The deal is dead," said Robert F. Costello, Jr., an analyst with Widmann, Siff & Company in Bryn Mawr, Pa. He said the company's product-liability problems were related to damage caused to buildings by leaky pipes made by Eljer.
 
Big Amex Gain
 A natural-gas discovery in Louisiana led to the largest increase on the American Stock Exchange. The stock of Plains Resources Inc. of Houston jumped 274 percent, to $19.63.
The shares of 261 companies rose during the third quarter on the American Stock Exchange, while 219 stocks were down and 14 were unchanged.
The Immune Response Corporation was one of the many biotechnology companies that fared well during the quarter. The company was the largest percentage gainer on the over-the-counter market, closing Friday at $32, up nearly 200 percent.
In over-the-counter trading, 1,207 stocks rose during the quarter, while 738 stocks fell and 102 were unchanged.

HEADLINE: In Paris Protest, Farmers Sing Blues

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Sept. 29

 BODY:
Angry over falling prices for their products and fearful that change in Europe will hurt them still more, the farmers of France marched in the tens of thousands through Paris today to dramatize their warning that the French countryside is slowly dying.
Many wooed Parisians with gifts of wine, sausage and cheese, while others wore regional costumes and played music from home to add color. 
 But the message of the 200,000 marchers was uniformly grim. "We need help -- that's the message," a ruddy-faced farmer from the Loire Valley said. "Rural France is in despair."
 
Many Near Bankrupcy
 The latest crisis, brought on by two years of drought and aggravated by a 25 percent drop in wholesale prices, has left thousands of cattle, sheep and dairy farmers close to bankruptcy.
And, as always in France, many of the marchers are looking to the Government for help.
But for the country's million farmers, the future alarms them the most. They are facing new competition from Eastern Europe, while the European Community is debating changes in its common agricultural policy that would sharply cut subsidies to French farmers.
So by organizing today's demonstration, which opposition leaders on the left and the right rushed to support, the farmers hoped to display a political strength that the Socialist leadership of President Francois Mitterrand dare not ignore just months before crucial local elections.
The Government's reaction to the march has stirred interest far beyond France, because on it may also hang the fate of the community's agricultural policy, community trade with the former East bloc and a new round of global trade-liberalization talks sponsored by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
 
France Has Most to Lose
 Until now, the French Government has stood by its farmers. This month, it infuriated its European partners by vetoing the entry of 550 tons of additional meat from Poland into community countries. As a result, a plan by the community to sign agreements to aid Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary was postponed.
Within the 12-nation community, France is not alone in opposing a big cutback in farm subsidies. But as Europe's largest food exporter, it has the most to lose and has resisted cuts most strongly. In France, it is argued, agriculture goes far beyond simple economics to embrace an entire way of life.
At the same time, without concessions by the community, there is no hope of completing the Uruguay round of trade talks under the international General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The talks broke down in December after the community, led by France, rejected sharply lower farm-price supports demanded by the United States and other food exporters.
But France is now under mounting international pressure to give way. European governments with smaller interests in agriculture question the effectiveness of community subsidies worth $50 billion a year. Many countries are also frustrated that a GATT accord to liberalize $1 trillion in trade is held up by the agricultural dispute.
 
Community Is Denounced
 Most farmers today, as they left hundreds of rural communities before dawn for the drive to Paris, recognized that much more was involved than a new petition for help from the Government. Many banners denounced the European Community.
"The discussions in Brussels are a true disaster for European farmers," said Raymond Lacombe, the head of the National Federation of Farming Unions. "One gets the impression that Europe is on its knees before the United States. It seems ready to give in on everything."
The strategy of the organizers of today's march, though, was not simply to protest but also to win the support of Parisians by underlining links between town and country and, most of all, by reminding them that the essence of France's "art of living" lies in its countryside.
Before farmers gathered to march between the Place de la Nation and the Place de la Bastille, with 10,000 policemen on hand to discourage troublemakers, many set up stalls in different neighborhoods to offer tastes of their products and to make their case directly with Parisians.
"What is France without its villages?" a farmer from the central region of Correze asked. "It is city neighborhoods and alienation. Why do the French like going to the countryside? Because that's where they find their roots."
 
Farmers' Ranks Decline
 Yet despite the prosperity of farmers in the north and west, the countryside has steadily been losing out to "progress" since World War II. In 1940, 40 percent of the French lived in rural areas; today only 7 percent do. In 1970, the country still had 2.4 million farmers; now there are a million and the estimate for the year 2000 is 700,000.
The steady depopulation of the countryside is only one sign of change. As has been the case elsewhere in Europe and in the United States, the character of many communities has also been transformed by tourists and weekend homes. And the children of farmers, seeing no hope for the future, head increasingly for the cities: today, two of three farmers are more than 45 years old.
If the changes being discussed in Brussels are approved, the crisis for small farmers will get worse because, without subsidies and price supports, many are likely to go out of business. Already, because of the drop in prices since 1988, many are unable to keep up loan payments.
And their anger is spilling over. Three weeks ago, to escape a farmers' protest, President Mitterrand called off a trip to a country town. Several Cabinet ministers have been pelted with tomatoes and eggs by farmers.
Lined up against the farmers, though, is the logic of modernizing a European agricultural policy that not only finances them to produce surplus food -- at present, there is a 900,000-ton beef "mountain," reflecting lack of demand -- but also obliges European consumers to pay more than world market prices.
But with opposition leaders like the former President, Valery Giscard d'Estaing; the former Prime Minister, Jacques Chirac, and the far-rightist leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen, all wanting to be seen with the marchers today, the Government seemed in no mood to confront the farming lobby.
The Agriculture Minister, Louis Mermaz, who has suggested that European stockpiles be used to feed the Soviet Union, said the demonstration would help French negotiators, who are trying to block a radical change in the community's agricultural policy.
"The rural world has expressed its intense desire to survive," he said.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
The Outlook For Rails Is Still Mixed

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NORTH PLATTE, Neb.

 BODY:
"As far as the recession, it's over for us," Pete P. Locke, the manager of terminal operations for the Union Pacific Railroad said as he looked over thousands of rail cars being sorted at the Bailey rail yard.
The railroad's traffic has risen 3.7 percent since January. In August, the increase slowed to 1.1 percent, but some goods surged. 
 Coal was up 11 percent; consumer goods like appliances, tires and plastic goods were up 11.3 percent, and containers and trailers carried on flat cars surged 19.2 percent.
At the yard here, about halfway between Omaha and Denver, cars full of grain, coal and other commodities and cars carrying truck trailers and ship containers were being rearranged into trains that would be sent on to various parts of the country.
Several other railroads, including the Santa Fe and the Illinois Central, have shared in the growth. But over all, the industry is still waiting for more sustained signs of a turnaround. Car loadings since January have been flat.
"It's very mixed," said Graeme Lidgerwood, the railroad analyst at the First Boston Corporation. "The industry has basically bottomed out, but we're not out of the woods yet."
Joel Price, an analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said it was too early to declare a recovery. "In all honesty, the third quarter does not tell me a thing," he said. Industrywide car loadings for the last 11 weeks, he said, were down 2.2 percent.
The recent announcement by the Soviet Union that it plans to buy a million metric tons of grain may cause a blip in the traffic figures soon, Mr. Price said, but he remains cautious.
"The auto business is below normal," he noted. "The coal business is down less than it has been. There is nothing there yet that gives you a clue."
Since the rail industry now closely tracks the trends in the overall economy, he said, it was a good indicator of the mixed signals that abound over all. And that uncertainty makes railroad stocks vulnerable.
The rail group has done better than the market this year, rising roughly 34 percent, compared with 17 percent for the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks.
Thus leading rail stocks have been favorites of investors.
[Conrail has risen from $40.25 at the beginning of this year to $71.375 at Friday's close in trading on the New York Stock Exchange; CSX rose from $31.75 to $51.50; Norfolk Southern from $41.75 to $53.875; Union Pacific from $70.63 to $92.375 and Burlington Northern from $28.75 to $35.25.]
"If the economy does not improve, if the Christmas season turns out be disappointing, then the stocks are somewhat vulnerable," Ms. Lidgerwood added.
But should the rebound in traffic spread to the other railroads, the industry stands to live up to investor expectations.
Almost every big railraod has reduced its operating costs considerably during the recession. Crew sizes have been cut, and altered work rules have enabled the railroads to use their workers more efficiently at rail yards and in maintenance crews.
The railroads have spent heavily on computers to improve their ability to control the flow of traffic and have adopted fiber-optic cables to improve communications. All are also pressing to change their management style, which in the past focused mostly on running a railroad. Now the primary goal is keeping customers happy.
The changes have not gone unnoticed by investors -- particulary large institutional managers who have loaded up heavily on rail stocks.
"There is a keen awareness in the marketplace that there is a lot of operating leverage when traffic improves," Ms. Lidgerwood explained.
And some developments that could help some railroads appear to be likely in the near future. The shipments of grain to the Soviet Union have not as yet begun in the big volumes that are expected to start soon. And the conversion of many East Coast and Southern utilities to low-sulfur coal, which is mined in the West, particulary the Powder River Basin in Wyoming, is expected to lead the surge in the movement of coal. The main railroads to benefit are expected to be the Union Pacific and Burlington Northern in the West and the Norfolk Southern and CSX in the East.
Thus even if the short-term economic trends do not deliver the anticipated profits, the long-term trends are favorable.
And some railroads -- like Union Pacific -- are benefiting now.
"Traffic has picked up drastically," Mr. Locke of Union Pacific said. "Grain is up. Stores are adding their Christmas goods."

HEADLINE: ESTIMATE ON GOLD WORSENS OUTLOOK FOR SOVIET UNION

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Sept. 29

 BODY:
In a development that adds more gloom to the Soviet Union's economic outlook, a key economic policy maker has announced that the nation's gold reserves are far smaller than the West believed.
As the Soviets prepare for a tough winter amid fears of widespread hunger, sharply lower reserves would mean the Government has a far smaller cushion to help make the payments on its $70 billion in foreign debt and to provide for emergency imports of food and other goods. 
 Grigory A. Yavlinsky, the architect of plans to move toward a market economy, said Friday that the Soviet Union had 240 metric tons in official gold reserves, worth about $3 billion. That is less than one-fifth of what many Western officials estimated.
 
Decades of Secrecy
 For decades, there has been official secrecy about the gold reserves, which the Kremlin regarded as a strategic asset. In disclosing figures, Mr. Yavlinsky may have hoped to increase pressure on the West to provide debt relief and food aid.
Many Western officials have hesitated to support vast economic aid to Moscow because they believe the nation has huge official gold reserves, worth perhaps as much as $25 billion.
The estimate of $3 billion in reserves is very much at the low end of private Western estimates, most of which have exceeded $10 billion. In Washington, a United States Treasury official who insisted on anonymity said the department could not confirm the accuracy of Mr. Yavlinsky's remarks.
 
No Decisions From U.S.
 The Treasury official said the United States was reviewing the Soviet Union's debt situation but that no decisions had been made.
Mr. Yavlinsky, in an interview broadcast on Soviet television, said Moscow had sold two-thirds of its gold reserves last year to help finance imports and pay interest on its debt. Some experts suggested that the Soviet Union had pledged gold reserves as collateral on loans, which could help explain why the price of gold did not shift strikingly last year, as it would have if so much gold had been sold.
The deepening Soviet economic crisis has been underscored by the grain harvest, which is falling below already pessimistic estimates, and by inflation, which is soaring.
Food supplies are declining at the same time that Government printing presses are working around the clock to print rubles -- a mixture that is fueling inflationary pressures. Fifty- and 100-ruble notes are being put back in circulation; former Prime Minister Valentin S. Pavlov, one of the coup plotters, had ordered them confiscated in a ham-handed effort to fight inflation. In addition, some Soviet officials say the Government will soon begin printing 500-ruble notes for the first time.
Central bank officials say the amount of money in circulation could surge to 240 billion rubles by January, up from 136 billion at the beginning of this year. Increasing the inflationary pressure, the monetary overhang -- the money people are forced to save because there are not enough goods to buy -- soared to 186 billion rubles on Sept. 1, up 40 percent from 132 billion last Janaury.
 
Unleashing Inflationary Forces
 All this is unleashing explosive inflationary forces. At present, inflation is estimated to be running at 100 to 250 percent, and some economists say it could soar to 1,000 percent, especially if the fraying trade ties between the republics worsen the supply situation.
The food situation has alarmed Soviet officials. They note that the wheat harvest is running far below last year's levels. The Government said 148.4 million metric tons were harvested by the fourth week of September, down 27 percent from 203.6 million tons at the comparable time last year.
Soviet officials say the disappointing harvest underlines the urgency of their appeal for $14.7 billion in emergency food aid for the winter.
"We shall not be able to survive the winter without some Western deliveries," Leonid Abalkin, a senior economic adviser to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, said Friday in a speech in New York.
After forecasting a grain harvest of 190 million tons, many Soviet officials now fear that this year's harvest, scheduled to end in mid-October, will fall below 170 million tons, down sharply from 230 million tons last year.
Many economists attribute the decline to overall government and economic disarray, as well as poor weather, and the increased difficulties in getting students and soldiers to participate in the harvest. In a nation where statistics cannot always be trusted, some experts suggest that farms are deliberately underreporting their harvest to make it easier for them to hoard grain or to sell it on the black market.
Compounding the food problem is the system of distributing goods, which is deteriorating rapidly in the wrangle over who has authority over what. One Moscow newspaper cited a K.G.B. document that said St. Petersburg was receiving three-fifths of the food it needed.
 
Excitement Giving Way to Gloom
 With each passing day, the excitement that resulted from the defeat of last month's coup is giving way to gloom over the economy. In Moscow and other cities, many stores are closed because there is nothing to stock their shelves. In stores that have goods to sell, huge lines fan out onto the sidewalk.
One factor behind inflation is that banks in the Soviet republics are freely issuing credits to money-losing companies to keep them in business and to meet their payrolls, which has forced the Soviet central bank to print billions of rubles to back those credits. As workers clamor for raises, the Government's budget deficit is expected to soar to close to 300 billion rubles, or 15 percent of the gross national product.
"Everyone from miners to teachers wants raises and bonuses," Mr. Abalkin said. "If we don't do it there will be a social explosion. We are printing money on three shifts, on weekends, and still don't have time to finish the work. We are even short of the special paper needed for printing money."
 
Price of Milk Up Sharply
 When milk is available in state stores, it sells for 60 kopecks a liter, a considerable sum in a nation where the average monthly wage for a government worker is about 300 rubles. In the private markets, milk sells for 3 rubles, or five times the rate at the state store. State food stores, where the nation's poor pensioners shop, are finding it increasingly hard to obtain supplies because farmers divert as much produce as possible to private distribution, which pays them far more.
The surge in inflation will make the conversion to a market economy far more difficult. As happened in Poland, the Soviet Government is likely to have to clamp down on the money supply and raise interest rates to stabilize inflation. But as happened in Poland, that could cause a jolting recession in an already desperate economy. Economic output plunged 12 percent in Poland in 1990, the year the post-Communist Government sought to bring triple-digit inflation under control.
Most economists predict Soviet industrial output will be down 15 to 20 percent this year from last year. There are numerous factors: government disarray, the initial moves to a market economy, the aging of the nation's capital stock, and the sharp drop in trade with Eastern Europe.
Many economists say the economic situation will grow worse because of trade frictions between the republics and a lack of economic coordination.
"I think that in December, national production will be 50 percent of what it was last December," said Anders Aslund, director of the Stockholm Institute of Soviet and East European Economies. "It's no longer so easy to get people to obey orders. One has to ask, for example, whether the railway system will continue functioning."

HEADLINE: BUSH'S ARMS PLAN;
In Moscow, Usual Reaction To Bush Arms Plan Is Muted

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Sept. 29

 BODY:
President Bush's sweeping arms initiative has played softly in the country that in principle stood most to gain from it, partly from old habit, partly from mixed feelings and partly from simple fatigue.
No newspapers were published today, though both the Russian republic and national television news programs carried reports on the development. The main news program declared the initiative to be the main event of the last week, while the Russian program, Vesti, said the American move "gives the Soviet Union a chance to get rid of its tactical weapons." 
 There were no further reactions from Soviet officials. On Saturday, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev declared the initiative "very positive," and other officials said they expected Moscow to reciprocate in kind.
A Tass commentary likewise suggested that the Soviet Union would be eager to match the American reductions. "It's no secret that leaders in the center and in the republics are seriously concerned over the presence of a huge nuclear arsenal, so the unilateral initiative of the head of the White House is most timely," wrote Gennadi Petrov, a foreign-affairs commentator for Tass.
 
Little Reaction in Streets
 There was little immediate reaction in the streets. But that was not entirely surprising among people long taught to let others worry about international affairs and besieged with enormous problems far closer to home.
Those who did comment often gave a sense of feeling that the importance of the American initiative lay less in reducing the American military threat, which in any case has ceased being a major concern, than in giving Soviet leaders an opening to withdraw the thousands of battlefield nuclear weapons scattered among the republics.
"At a moment when a Chechen might attack a Georgian and a Georgian might attack a Tatar, tactical arms can be very dangerous," said Yevgeny P. Petritsky, a reporter from the Moscow suburb of Elektrostal. Continuing reports of tensions in Tadzhikistan, Georgia, Moldavia and elsewhere across the nation seemed to underscore the point. But these troubling reports, coupled with growing concerns over food and fuel supplies as leaves turn golden and temperatures drop, seemed a far more immediate concern than some distant and increasingly theoretical threat.
 
Memorial for 3 Youths
 The main event in Moscow was an outdoor memorial service marking 40 days since the deaths of three youths killed during the coup. The bells and chants of the Russian Orthodox ceremony under gray, drizzly skies seemed also to mark another stage in the passing of the euphoria that came with the collapse of the coup.
Many people here seemed struck by their own lack of interest when a questioner asked them about it. Some attributed it to habit. As one Muscovite said, "We've been raised on the idea that somebody up there will come up with the right reaction, and Gorbachev did it already."
Others said that a progression of disarmament agreements had largely taken the novelty out of the process, and that nuclear war had long ceased to be a major fear.
"Since 1986, when Gorbachev first came out with a program of disarmament, the process has become habitual," said Sergei A. Zverev, an assistant to Grigory A. Yavlinsky, the senior Soviet economist.
He added: "I also remember an article in The New York Times three weeks ago in which somebody wondered whether Americans should take the Russians seriously any more, whether they were equal partners in the international arena. This move comes not from greater trust, but because the parity is broken, because we're not a serious factor."
Besides, Mr. Zverev said, he had just returned from standing two hours in line for butter.

HEADLINE: BUSH'S ARMS PLAN;
Bush's New Tack: An Offer to the Soviet Republics

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29

 BODY:
In addition to rewriting the rules of arms control with his landmark announcement on Friday, President Bush took a major step toward fundamentally altering the broader Soviet-American relationship as the political order in Moscow weakens in the wake of the Kremlin putsch.
In form at least, Mr. Bush's decision to eliminate most short-range nuclear weapons, take American bombers off alert status and offer to negotiate cuts in multiple-warhead missiles seemed to follow the traditional way of doing business: The American head of state made proposals to the Soviet Union, and the Soviet head of state, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, replied. 
 But it was the first time in such a major state-to-state initiative that Washington also dealt directly with the republics' leaders, especially Boris N. Yeltsin, President of the Russian federation.
Whatever Mr. Gorbachev decides to do about the Soviet Union's short-range nuclear weapons, the United States is hoping that some republic leaders will act on their own to destroy those arms stored on their territory.
 
Inviting Reciprocity
 And though the White House was trying to take advantage of whatever is left of Moscow's central authority, Mr. Bush chose to take unilateral steps and invite reciprocity specifically because he did not want to become engaged in negotiations with the weakened Soviet Government.
That was a major step toward taking the initiative in molding change in the Soviet Union. The question now is whether Mr. Bush can translate that boldness into other areas, including economic relations, where the biggest obstacle may not be a lack of vision but a lack of money.
Certainly, the President seemed to recognize in acting Friday that the political ground was eroding under his policy of propping up Mr. Gorbachev and the Moscow Government.
"It will be increasingly hard to deal with the center in this sort of head-of-state-to-head-of-state way and have it mean much," a senior American policy maker said today. "If you need any evidence to that effect, I would simply point out that we communicated with Boris Yeltsin right after we got the word to Gorbachev about the President's initiative."
 
Doubts on Gorbachev's Future
 As Mr. Bush gropes for safe passage through this volatile period in Soviet affairs, his advisers are increasingly convinced that time is running out forMr. Gorbachev, his friend and fellow summiteer. "If Gorbachev is smart, he'll use the arms control initiative to demonstrate how indispensable he is," the senior official. "But I still think that he would just be stalling for time."
The arms control proposal may temporarily relieve the pressure on Mr. Bush to show greater initiative in other aspects of Soviet-American relations.
Mr. Bush's senior advisers are already presenting the case that the President made a discrete move in a confined area, and that this was not a signal that he will abandon his cautious approach to direct economic assistance. "You cannot take what we did and apply it across the board," an official said.
But the President will have to confront the argument that if he can act so decisively in arms control, he could do the same thing when it comes to promoting economic and political reform in the Soviet Union.
"That needs a multiple effort from Tokyo to Brussels, said Robert Legvold, head of the Harriman Institute at Columbia University. "And for that to happen, the Americans have to lead because it's not going to be led by Bonn or by Tokyo." .
 
Arms Control Re-emerges
 The sudden re-emergence of arms control was striking after a week in which the visit to the United States by Leonid M. Kravchuk, the Ukrainian leader, seemed to symbolize how Soviet-American relations were moving to an economic footing.
But if Mr. Bush returned to familiar territory, he did so in an unconventional way and at a time when many Administration officials believe that they will not have much longer to capitalize on their relationship with the central authority in the Soviet Union.
"We tried to take advantage of the fact that at least temporarily, the coup simply wiped out the top echelon of the conservatives who were negative about arms control, negative about the relationship in general," a senior official said.
But he added: "Right now, they are going in the other direction. The centrifugal forces are predominant in the Soviet Union."
Mr. Bush's actions were a conscious attempt to manipulate Soviet internal affairs in an almost unprecedented way, by trying to influence the debate over who will have control of Soviet nuclear weapons. Washington hopes that the leaders of the republics where short-range nuclear weapons are stored -- Russia, the Ukraine, Byelorussia and Kazakhstan -- will now destroy those weapons on their own authority.
Mr. Legvold said: "If we had negotiated with the center on this, it would have been largely irrelevant and, even worse, counterproductive. You have to have the support of the Russian, Ukrainian and Kazakh leaders."
The President's attempt to capitalize on the weakened Soviet power structure is all the more striking because that weakness is at the heart of his reluctance to promise major economic assistance to the Soviet Union.
Mr. Bush argues that the United States cannot commit such aid while it is unclear who will receive it and what the relationships will be between the republics and what is now the central Government.
 
Two Different Fields
 A case can be made that economics and arms control are vastly different.
"Presidents have unusual power in the area of nuclear weapons, even beyond the general powers of foreign policy, since as commander-in-chief he can say things unilaterally and Congress would have a hard time saying no," said William G. Hyland, editor of the journal Foreign Affairs and a former White House national security aide in the Nixon and Ford Administrations.
But economic relations are not something a President can dictate. Mr. Bush has enormous influence, but he has been reluctant to use it to promote investment in the Soviet Union as it now stands, hoping that there would be at least some economic confederation with which the United States could do business.
A senior official said: "We're going to have to find ways to change our relationship with a structure that we can't define clearly, a diffusion of sovereignty."
Still, Mr. Legvold argued that Mr. Bush could apply the same boldness that he showed on Friday to economics, not by offering money but by doing essentially what he did with nuclear weapons -- taking unilateral steps that invite reciprocity.

HEADLINE: Ukraine Chief Faces Hurdles In Quest for U.S. Recognition

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
In a pointed exchange with American scholars the other day, President Leonid M. Kravchuk of the Soviet Ukraine resisted pleas that he quickly phase out the traditional Communist system of price controls.
"There would be a social explosion," he told his questioners, who urged him to abandon the controls and other vestiges of the Communist centralized economy in an effort to institute a free-market system in his republic. 
 William W. Hogan, a Harvard University expert on the Ukraine's economy, firmly disagreed. "They did it in Poland, and there was no social explosion," he said.
Mr. Kravchuk would not budge on the economic issue, and when the conversation turned to the topic of nuclear arms stationed on Ukrainian soil, he avoided giving a precise answer about the future of these arms. Saying he wanted the Ukraine to be a nuclear-free zone, he added that he opposed transfer of those weapons to Russian or other Soviet soil and declined to be specific about any plans he had to destroy them. Further, while claiming at least partial jurisdiction over these weapons, he said he would insist on taking part in any decision to use them.
 
Hurdle for Ex-Ideologist
 The meeting with the scholars at Harvard's Ukrainian Research Institute, part of a six-day tour by the Communist Party's longtime top ideologist, was one indication of the hurdles Mr. Kravchuk faces in seeking to gain diplomatic recognition for the Ukraine from the American Government and to persuade investors and others that he has shed his past, including more than 30 years as a Communist Party member who rose to the leadership of the republic's party.
The visit also highlighted the quandary President Bush faces as he considers whether to recognize the independence of the Ukraine and other breakaway Soviet republics.
Mr. Kravchuk hoped to nudge the Bush Administration away from its desire to support President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's central Government and also from its opposition to a splintering of the Soviet Union. But Administration officials said that while Mr. Bush had a productive meeting with Mr. Kravchuk on Wednesday, before Mr. Kravchuk went on to Boston, Chicago and New York, Washington will wait for the Ukrainian referendum on independence and the presidential election, both scheduled for Dec. 1, before it seriously considers diplomatic recognition.
Mr. Kravchuk is considered the leading presidential candidate, although support for at least one opposition candidate appears to be growing, one Administration analyst said.
 
A Tailored Message
 The Ukrainian leader renounced his long affiliation to the Communist Party, which he joined in 1958, only after the failed coup last month. His response to the coup appeared cautious, ambivalent or even supportive. He has since become a strong proponent of Ukrainian independence.
Mr. Kravchuk carefully tailored his message to American audiences. He pledged his support for liberty and human rights to a gathering of students at Harvard University, argued that the Ukraine needs unfettered free enterprise when he spoke to officials at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, promised Ukrainian-American scholars that they will be granted greater access to historical archives, and told a group of religious leaders in New York yesterday, after Mr. Bush made his broad nuclear initiative, that he wanted the Ukraine to become a nuclear-free zone.
"We're on the road to a free economy and a free life," he told a group of business leaders and prominent Ukrainian-Americans at a breakfast in Chicago Saturday. "The ideological differences that used to divide us no longer exist."
 
Security Precautions
 After the meeting, he visited a Ukrainian cultural center, where he was serenaded by schoolchildren. But when he drove through the large section of Chicago where many Ukrainians live, he took an unpublicized route because of fears of demonstrations.
In his meeting with President Bush at the White House on Wednesday, Mr. Kravchuk insisted that the United States would eventually have to recognize the Ukraine and the other breakaway republics. He said that while his country did not need food aid, it needed help in distributing and exporting what they produce.
His plea for technical aid to convert scores of arms factories into plants that can produce consumer goods appeared to strike a sympathetic chord at the White House.
At his appearances, Mr. Kravchuk took sometimes contradictory positions on nuclear weapons based in the Ukraine. At a luncheon at the National Press Club in Washington on Thursday, he said: "Control over nuclear weapons should be exerted from the center. However, the Ukraine should participate in this control because they are on its territory."
He said he wanted to make the republic a nuclear-free zone, and told an audience at Harvard on Friday -- before President Bush made his sweeping move on reducing short-range nuclear arms, partly because of concerns about control over those arms in the Soviet republics -- that he favored a rapid destruction of the weapons.
But in Chicago the next day, he said it would take seven years to destroy the 130 nuclear weapons in silos on Ukrainian soil, which he said are to be destroyed under the Start treaty. He said there were 46 other nuclear weapons on Ukrainian soil, without specifying whether they were short range or long range. Before the 46 remaining can be eliminated, he said, "We'll have to conclude another treaty."
 
Views on Independence
 "Deep in his heart, the President is ready to think of Ukraine as an independent state," Mr. Kravchuk said, recalling his 45-minute discussion with Mr. Bush in an interview in Chicago Friday night. "He's waiting for the referendum. He told me that."
Asked if any such commitment was made, a senior Administration official said: "The President said, 'Right now, certainly not.' "
Mr. Bush told Mr. Kravchuk that the United States would strengthen direct ties with the Ukraine by sending the Peace Corps and technical economic advisers in the coming month, Administration officials said.
Mr. Kravchuk has given priority to one-on-one meetings with executives of several corporations, including Monsanto and Coca-Cola, in which he has told them they would be better off investing in Kiev than Moscow.

HEADLINE: BUSH'S ARMS PLAN;
The Gun Uncocked At Bases

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KNOB NOSTER, Mo., Sept. 29

 BODY:
In an underground capsule on Whiteman Air Force Base, Lieut. George Farfour was on the alert Friday evening, as usual, near the knobs, switches and dials that could send nuclear missiles shooting from beneath the farm fields of western Missouri and toward the Soviet Union.
The cramped, submarinelike control room is also equipped with a television, and the 27-year-old missileer, as missile crew members are called, had it turned to President Bush's address. 
 As he listened to the announcement of nuclear cutbacks, his eyes grew wide. He turned to his partner in the capsule, Capt. Scott McCormick, who was taking his turn to sleep. "Sir," he said, jostling him awake, "I think there's something you should know about."
The official word came Saturday morning on a printer inside the capsule. The essence of the message: uncock the nuclear gun.
 
'Great Day for Missileers'
 "You could hear all this revelry," said Captain McCormick, referring to the intercom system that links five control capsules. "And someone said loudly, 'This is a great day for missileers.' "
For three decades, the nation's nuclear weapons have been geared to fire at a moment's notice. But after the President's orders to "stand down" from constant alert status, the crews programmed the controls on Saturday in a way that would make it impossible for them to launch the missiles without carrying out a complicated and time-consuming procedure. A crew member likened the action to "taking the keys out of the car's ignition."
Despite the removal of the alert status, the missile crews will continue to work 24-hour shifts in the control centers, monitoring the safety and condition of the missiles.
But their posture is relaxed, and at bases around the country, service personnel spent the weekend adhering to it. Nuclear-tipped bombs were removed from Air Force jets, and the planes were moved to hangars. Nuclear weapons were taken from submarines. Many of the nuclear bombs are to be destroyed.
When the weight of the news finally hit him, Captain McCormick said he felt a welter of emotions. "It made me think: 'This is what we've been here for. This is why we've been doing our jobs.' It made me hopeful to think about world peace."
 
Boredom and Terror
 Work inside the missile control capsules has been described as hours of boredom that could be broken by moments of sheer terror. And for those who have been trained to unleash nuclear weapons, always vigilant for "the unspeakable," as Lieutenant Farfour called it, no order could have brought more joy.
"Our job is to prepare for an action that we never want to take," said Lieutenant Farfour, who wore a blue jumpsuit with a patch that bears the symbol of the Strategic Air Command, a clenched fist gripping a lightning bolt and an olive branch. "There are usually very few ways to measure how well we do. It's hard to measure a deterrent. It's not like on the battlefield where you can see a victory. Well, for us, this is victory."
The new nuclear weapons posture will mean changes for the Strategic Air Command near Omaha, where Air Force officials issue directives from an underground center. Starting next year, the center will be called the Strategic Command, and will be run by both the Navy and the Air Force.
"The underground control center will continue to be a hub of activity around the clock," said Maj. Don Planalf, a spokesman for the Strategic Air Command. "But some of the changes are yet to be sorted out."
The changes are the latest significant move to relax the nation's nuclear weapons readiness. In 1968 the Government brought down the B-52 planes that had stayed constantly aloft since 1957, and put them on "alert" status. The airborne command center, which had been kept in the sky in case of military attack, was brought down last year.
 
Corn, Beans and Warheads
 At the Whiteman Air Force Base here, about 60 miles southeast of Kansas City, 15 underground capsules have served as control centers for 150 nuclear missiles buried in the surrounding countryside. Each control center is operated by two-member crews who work together in 24-hour shifts.
Above the control centers are small buildings that look like surbuban ranch houses. A basketball hoop stands next to some sites. The nuclear silos are under Federal land amid fields of corn and beans. Cyclone fences surround each missile site, with posted warnings to stay away.
For people who live in the region, the presence of the nuclear missiles has always raised some concern that it would be a prime target in a war. "Everyone always figured we'd get hit right away," said Chad Davis, who works at a service station near Warrensburg. "So this makes it a little safer. But now people are a little worried that they'll cut back on the base. That's the strongest part of our economy."
A fleet of B-2 bombers is scheduled to begin operation next year at Whiteman, where 3,400 men and women are stationed. And missile crew members say they are prepared for the possibility that alert status could return. "Our mission isn't over," said Captain McCormick. "Once we feared the British, then the French, then the Soviets. Times will change. But we're always going to have to be ready."
In training to be missile crew members, the officers are instructed to ponder the enormity of their actions, if they should be called upon to launch the nuclear weapons. They are instructed about the devastation that nuclear missiles would cause. And they are told to search their souls: "Is this something you really want to do?" they are asked directly.
"You have to know," said Lieutenant Farfour, "that when you launch, you're probably going to get hit yourself."
When his shift ended, he called his younger brother, James. "Did you see the President?" he asked. "Well, I was carrying out those orders."
And his brother replied, "I'm just glad that this is the order you got."

Scott McCormick were on duty in a missile capsule in Missouri when they received an order to take their fingers off the nuclear trigger. (David Hutson for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Governments Reach Second Settlement With Exxon in Valdez Spill

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: JUNEAU, Alaska, Sept. 29

 BODY:
A second settlement has been reached in the government lawsuits against the Exxon Corporation over the nation's largest oil spill, a spokesman for Gov. Walter J. Hickel said today.
Details of the settlement are being withheld until a formal announcement on Monday, said the spokesman, Eric Rehmann. 
 An earlier settlement, announced in March, fell apart when a Federal judge rejected a plea in the criminal charges against Exxon and the Alaska House voted down the entire agreement. Negotiations between Exxon, the state and the Federal Government resumed this month; the criminal trial is scheduled to start Oct. 7 in Federal District Court in Anchorage.
An Exxon spokesman in Texas, Bill Smith, declined to comment on the new settlement, and a Justice Department spokesman in Washington, Doug Krovisky, said he was unaware of any settlement or announcement.
 
A Spill and Its Sequels
 The criminal charges and civil suits arose from the March 1989 accident in which the tanker Exxon Valdez spilled nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil in Prince William Sound when she slammed into a reef. The oil killed many thousands of marine birds and mammals. It was devastating to the region's native villages, where most residents still live off the land and sea.
Under the previous settlement, Exxon and a subsidiary agreed to plead guilty to four misdemeanors and pay a record $100 million fine. Two felony pollution charges would have been dropped.
Exxon would have paid $900 million over 11 years to restore damaged natural resources. That money would have settled the state's civil claims against Exxon and any future claims by the Federal Government. But it would not have affected private lawsuits seeking a total of $59 billion in damages from the company.
The settlement would have been the largest of an environmental damage case in United States history. It would have provided immediate cash to continue the spill cleanup and would have avoided long and costly court battles.
Opponents argued that the criminal fine was inadequate considering Exxon's wealth and the damage its tanker caused, and that the settlement's true value would have been far less than $1 billion because of the effects of inflation over the 11-year payout period.
Pressure has been building on Exxon to settle the government litigation. In the past two weeks, fishermen, landowners, cannery workers, Alaska natives and other private interests agreed to drop their lawsuits against the state and Federal Government. That meant a united front of plaintiffs suing Exxon.
Lloyd Miller, an Anchorage lawyer who represents several native Alaskan corporations and villages in litigation against Exxon said he did not know the details of the settlement. But he said he thought its amount would be about the same, with a shift in the way it is allocated, so more money would go toward criminal fines and less the civil settlement.
"I think everybody is going to be concerned about the bottom line," he said. "There's still oil out there and they're real worried that there may not be enough money in the settlements to do the kind of monitoring and restoration that will need to be done for the next two decades. When all the lawyer stuff is put aside and all the posturing is put aside, you've got to have enough money to do the job because Exxon's not going to be doing it."
In exchange for dropping the lawsuits, the governments agreed to give the private plaintiffs access to their research on the spill's damage and Exxon's liability.
Joseph Hazelwood of Huntington, L.I., the ship's captain, was accused of drinking on shore before the tanker left Port Valdez, but he was acquitted of state charges that he operated the ship while intoxicated.

HEADLINE: BUSH'S ARMS PLAN;
Monetary Fund Warns Of Shortage in Savings

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund is increasingly concerned about a worldwide shortage of money for productive investments like building factories and says that unless industrial nations cut military spending and curtail trade subsidies, the world economy will suffer.
"The present tendency toward recovery could be affected," said a senior official, presenting a stronger and gloomier vision of the world economy than only a few months ago. "A number of investment projects would have to be abandoned." 
 The official, who spoke on behalf of the financial institution but insisted on anonymity, addressed reporters on Friday afternoon before President Bush's call on Friday evening for the sweeping elimination of entire classes of nuclear weapons now deployed or under development. The official spoke on condition that his remarks not be reported until this evening. An aide to the senior I.M.F. officials said his remarks were not linked to the President's.
On a separate subject, the official said that the monetary fund remains ready to offer special associate status to the Soviet Union as soon as it applies, an action that would allow the international financial institution to provide wide-ranging technical advice but not the large-scale financial assistance that Soviet authorities have sought. The Soviet Union has applied for full membership instead, which would allow it to borrow heavily.
 
Bush Wants No Cuts
 President Bush said in his speech on Friday that his measures were intended to improve security rather than to save money, and might actually cost money in the near term. "Given the ambitious plan I have already proposed to reduce U.S. defense spending by 25 percent, we cannot afford to make any unwise or unwarranted cuts in the defense budget I have submitted to Congress," he said.
The senior monetary fund official said that if the industrialized world does not increase its overall savings rate, preferably by shrinking military spending and as well as trade subsidies that now force many governments to borrow heavily, not only industrial countries but developing countries will suffer.
The official said that new spending policies in the developed world are especially important now because changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe coupled with peace in the Middle East have created an extraordinary opportunity for global prosperity. But too much money is being spent on military forces and protectionist trade practices instead of being invested to produce more resources, he added.
"If we want to make sure that these opportunities don't vanish, but are transformed into real improvements for people, then we will have to be active in convincing governments to go to better governance and to address these issues of unproductive spending," he said.
Michel Camdessus, the monetary fund's managing director, has delivered similar but less strongly worded warnings in recent speeches. If all the countries now spending a high percentage of their economic output on the military were to match the world average instead, annual worldwide savings of $140 billion would be generated, Mr. Camdessus told an audience in Geneva in July.
Protectionist agricultural policies cost the world another $299 billion in 1990, he said in the same speech.
 
Turnaround on Eastern Europe
 The monetary fund is an immensely powerful institution with 155 member nations. It requires certain fiscal and monetary policies of several dozen less developed countries that receive its loans, sets rules for the international monetary system and provides the economic statistics and forecasts used at the annual meetings of President Bush and leaders of six other industrial democracies.
Until now, the International Monetary Fund has tended to downplay the concerns of some economists that the opening up of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, coupled with the adoption of more free-market policies in developing countries, would lead to a global shortage of savings. The same senior official who addressed reporters on Friday discounted such worries in his last semiannual briefing in April.
The normal operation of international credit market will insure that savings do match investments in the coming years, the official said Friday. But the shortage of savings in the developed world means that this matching may take place at higher interest rates, he said, so that fewer investments will be made worldwide.
"We do believe this negative adjustment, through higher interest rates, can be avoided but not without efforts" to limit military and other unproductive spending, he said.
Richard F. Grimmett, a defense specialist at the Congressional Research Service, said worldwide military spending as a percentage of global economic output has already been falling from a peak of 5.7 percent in 1982 and 1983, when the war between Iran and Iraq was at its height. The end of that war and the decline of cold-war tensions had pushed this figure down to 5.0 percent by 1988, the most recent year for which complete and reliable figures are available, he said.
The world produced $20.64 trillion worth of goods and services in 1988 and spent $1.03 trillion on the military, Mr. Grimmett said, citing figures from the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.

HEADLINE: Athens Journal;
2,500 Years Old, and My, How the Child Has Grown

BYLINE: By MARLISE SIMONS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATHENS, Sept. 29

 BODY:
"Poor democracy," said Virginia Tsouderas with a sigh. "Is there any other word that has been so widely misused?"
As a member of the Greek Parliament she was raising a glass this weekend as Athens celebrated what is being called democracy's 2,500th anniversary. 
 With representatives from more than 40 democracies in attendance here at the cradle of the concept, music and declamations echoed over the very hills where Athenians of all classes began to argue as equals and learned to challenge their rulers in ways no land had ever seen before.
Declaring democracy to be robust, expanding and more topical than ever, the Greek President, Constantinos Karamanlis, said the notion was so laudable that "even totalitarian regimes -- people's republics, dictatorships -- oppress their people in the name of democracy."
The three days of festivities here that ended on Saturday were only the start of a chain of ceremonies, lectures and exhibits planned in many other countries, including the United States, over the next two years.
"Rule by the people" emerged in stages in Athens during the sixth century B.C., but the commemorations focus on the work of Cleisthenes, the Athenian who established the framework for a direct democracy that was to last more than 200 years. He was widely hailed this week as the man who defied his powerful fellow aristocrats and insured free speech, equality before the law and everyone's right to share power in the assembly of all citizens. Still, women and slaves in ancient Greece were not considered citizens.
 
The Details Don't Matter
 Behind the oratorical flourishes here, scholars continue to disagree about the exact moment of Cleisthenes's constitutional reforms. Those who hold to the year 508 B.C. say that the current celebrations have come a year too early. But some of Cleisthenes's followers, members of Parliament and other democratic envoys from around the world, seemed unconcerned about such details.
"Beautiful, oh how very beautiful," said Nancy Ellis, the sister of President Bush and leader of the United States delegation, Friday night as she walked along the Pnyx, the rocky platform where ancient Athenians used to hold their popular assemblies.
Others, too, seemed in awe as the nearby temples of the Acropolis were set aglow in golden floodlights, the full moon rose in a cloudless sky and the Speaker of the Greek Parliament began to address the crowd from the stone podium where, he recalled, Solon and Pericles had stood before him and set a new course for all of Western civilization.
This audience, though, was certainly better behaved than the ancient Athenians, a contemporary citizen noted, because the ancients in full assembly would argue and yell for hours and sometimes days on end. On this Friday night there was quiet as actors read ancient texts and documents that sprang from them, including the Magna Carta of England, the American Declaration of Independence and France's Declaration of the Rights of Man.
"There is no question that there is a direct connection between the American democracy and the most successful democracy of the ancient world," said Frank Frost, of California, a professor of ancient history. "Athenian democracy was well studied by the fathers of our own Constitution, who were much better read than our present-day politicians."
For the organizers, dealing with so many democrats has not been easy. "First of all, we had the problem of whom to invite," said Marios Rafael, the meeting coordinator. "How do you judge which is a democratic country? Even Qaddafi says he is a democrat, but if he comes, others do not."
Greece settled the matter by inviting the member countries of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and the members of the Council of Europe. As a result, the meeting brought together representatives from systems as old as the Magna Carta and as young as the August coup in Moscow. No House or Senate members from the United States attended. Many other parliaments sent their Speaker or president, some of whom arrived with retinues worthy of autocrats.
"I don't want to be unkind," Mr. Rafael said, "but a lot of delegations brought more people than we invited. It caused a lot of headaches."
There were frowns as the American delegation sped in limousines up the Pnyx Hill while the representatives of other countries were made to abandon their cars and climb. "Some democracies are more imperial than others," sniffed a delegate from Spain.
Not surprisingly, amid so many legislators there was talk of redefining and reshaping democracy and debate on questions like: how democratic is it, really, to intervene in another nation in the name of democracy?
One discussion over drinks in the presidential palace gardens concluded that one extreme, the direct democracy of the Athenians, was far too unwieldy for modern times, but that the other extreme, the United States, the world's largest representative democracy, had strayed too far because "its elections are now for sale."
Another group of representatives tried to draw a link between the ancient city-state and today's resurgent nationalism in many regions. The group, made up of Europeans, postulated that the days of the super-state may be numbered, even as it is being born in Europe. As more regions demand autonomy, the politicians suggested, the hour of the mini-state may be at hand.
 
The Food Has Improved
 On an earthier note, Greek members of Parliament at a buffet table decided that today's representatives ate better food than their predecessors, the Councilors of ancient Athens, who got free meals at the Prytanion, or the House of the Councilors.
"I think they ate lima beans and dried figs and things like that," said one member, reaching for salmon and beef slices.
"Right!" replied a colleague. "Remember Socrates at his trial, when he was asked what punishment he proposed for himself instead of the death sentence, said, 'Feed me at the Prytanion for the rest of my life.' "
The celebrations here have not proved to be a boost for the morale of Greeks, who are in the midst of an economic crisis and witnessing the corruption trial of former Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and four Cabinet ministers. Although the events have been duly reported in the press, they have been largely formal ones involving few citizens of this capital, which today suffers almost every disadvantage of an overgrown city and few of its benefits.
"Still, I want to be here," said Amanda Clarke, an American historian exploring Greece. "This is the place where people first struggled with the question of the rights of the individual versus the interests of the whole group. We are still haggling over this today. And Athens is a good place to think about this."

HEADLINE: BUSH'S ARMS PLAN;
Inside Churches, Few Cheers And Some Jeers on Arms Plan

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON

 BODY:
In Bonn, Moscow and Washington, President Bush's announcement of unilateral cuts in nuclear arms may be seen as momentous and historic. But at the Pilgrim Baptist Church in Chicago, where people scurried along dark corridors to choir rehearsal and to usher- board meetings, yesterday was just another Sunday, not the second chapter in the new world order.
Children in navy suits, crisp white dresses and gloves passed the collection plate, deacons announced a bake sale and midweek prayer service and the news that some nuclear weapons would soon be eliminated merited not a word from the guest preacher, the Rev. Yvonne Lee Wilson. Only when pressed did members even vaguely recall that President Bush had made some remarks about nuclear weapons. 
 Mr. Bush's proposal was seen by some of the 500 congregants at this all-black church on the South Side as just another pronouncement from an often-mistrusted President, not a turning point in history. And many worried that Mr. Bush's action was coming too late to rid the world completely of nuclear arms.
"They never should have made them in the first place," said James Edwards, a retired school custodian who is a church usher. "It's for God to destroy the earth, not man."
 
How to Spend the Savings
 Around the nation, as bright fall mornings dawned and people made their way to church services, concerns like homelessness and unemployment seemed greater preoccupations than the proposal, which was announced Friday night. Few preachers even mentioned the proposal and what it could mean. Many of their members were cautious about declaring the arms race over, citing uncertainty about how arms reductions would be verified, and whether other countries not party to the proposal -- Iraq, for example -- might upset the world all over again.
Still, if they allowed themselves to believe it might happen, some had specific proposals for how to spend the money that would be saved by shrinking the American nuclear arsenal.
"There'll be a huge savings that should be spent on housing all over urban America, where it's needed," said Adam Clayton Powell 4th, a former New York City Council candidate who was interviewed outside the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem.
"He could buy food for the homeless," said Victor Chalk, a homeless man and a member of the New Hope Baptist Church in Seattle's Central District, an area beset with gang violence, crime and high unemployment. "I've got people of all races helping me out. Do you think he would?"
Mr. Chalk's pastor, the Rev. Robert L. Jeffrey, focused on the arms reduction proposal in his sermon. Addressing himself to Mr. Bush, the minister shouted: "You are neglecting us. You are cutting bombs without cutting poverty. You are selling us on 'Star Wars' and the B-2 bomber, and you are neglecting the 34 million people on poverty in this country."
Others wanted to be sure the United States would properly manage its role in the new world order, whatever it turned out to be. "We have to be ready to move forward with peace," said Dr. James A. Forbes Jr., who spoke briefly of improved chances for global peace during his sermon at the Riverside Church in Manhattan.
Some thought arms reductions were the natural result of political changes in the Soviet Union. Antonio L. Argiz, a Miami resident who went to the 11 o'clock Mass at The Epiphany Church there yesterday, said he thought the President should have made the offer earlier. "He waited far into the scenario," Mr. Argiz said. "Now Russia has no country; there is no power base there."
Mr. Argiz predicted that fewer nuclear weapons would mean diminished global tension, but added: "Not all the problems of the world have been solved. There is still world hunger and turmoil in the Middle East, where anything can cause that situation to blow up."
Others felt the proposal itself held risks for American security. "I don't think we should be too far out front in getting rid of the things God has given us to protect ourselves," said Ivor Mae Barefield, a retired school psychologist who attends Pilgrim Baptist Church in Chicago. "We need some kind of backup."
Beatrice Evans, interviewed outside the Wieuca Road Baptist Church in Atlanta, had some of the same worries. "I'm still very suspicious about the motives of some countries," she said. "But we have ways of finding out what capabilities they have."
Her pastor, Dr. Paul A. Basden, spoke of a changed but hardly trouble-free world. "We can't be naive now and pretend all of the threats have been eliminated," he said. "But the U.S.S.R has been dissolved and I don't think the arms reduction is a hoax. We have good reason to celebrate."

HEADLINE: Zaire's Dictator Agrees to Share Power With Foe

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KINSHASA, Zaire, Sept. 29

 BODY:
President Mobutu Sese Seko, who has held absolute power in this impoverished Central African country for 26 years while amassing a personal fortune, today agreed to let an opposition leader form a new coalition government that could mark the end of his autocratic reign.
President Mobutu's agreement to share power was first announced Saturday night and confirmed when a deadlock in negotiations over the choice of a new prime minister was broken today. 
 The accord followed a week of looting and violence touched off by mutinous soldiers angered because they had not been paid. Discontent had been rising for months, however, as the country reeled from a severe economic crisis and as opposition leaders pressed to have Zaire join the democratic trend sweeping much of Africa.
 
Mobutu to Keep Title
 After 10 hours of talks today with opposition leaders, President Mobutu agreed to allow Etienne Tshisekedi, his fiercest adversary since 1980, to become Prime Minister and form what is being called a crisis government. Under this arrangement, General Mobutu would remain head of state with as-yet undefined but apparently diminished powers.
Five Mobutu loyalists would have posts in an 11-member coalition government under the accord, with the remaining posts going to the opposition.
The two sides are to meet again Monday for the third successive day to try to agree on Cabinet posts.
 Despite hope stirred by the developments, there appeared to be a strong prospect of further political chaos . Delegates to a democracy conference gathered outside the talks at Kinshasa's marble palace and vowed to kill any opposition leaders who allowed President Mobutu to remain in Government even as a figurehead.
The protesters blocked the entrance to the center where the talks were held and then swarmed around President Mobutu as he arrived. They shouted "dictator" and "thief" when he ventured into the crowd, wearing his trademark leopard-skin hat, and tried to explain the reasons for forming the coalition. Inside, the delegates did their best to ignore the turbulence, dining on smoked salmon and drinking Champagne for lunch.
The delegates were angered at being left out of the talks. They said the national conference, whose 3,000 delegates are scheduled to reconvene Tuesday in a continuing effort to chart a path to democracy, should instead manage the transition.
 
Talks Began Seven Weeks Ago
 The current political negotiating process started seven weeks ago, but because of a dispute over the selection of delegates, it bogged down. Opponents charged that President Mobutu filled the lists with his own supporters.
Only the major opposition parties are involved in talks on forming a new government. Many of the leaders of those parties have served under President Mobutu at one time but have since broken with him.
In an apparent effort to re-establish control over the military, President Mobutu announced the dismissal of his army Chief of Staff, Gen. Manzembe Mayibanga, and ordered a complete restructuring of the armed forces. The general was replaced by the current head of military intelligence, Gen. Mahele Liyeko, officials said.
Last Monday, about 3,000 Zairian paratroopers touched off widespread rioting and looting as they went on a rampage after the Government had failed to pay them for months. They closed Kinshasa's airport and Congo River port, looting stores and private housesmostly owned or rented by Zaire's wealthy expatriates.
As the pillaging and unrest spread, France and Belgium flew in hundreds of special troops to evacuate their citizens from the former Belgian colony.
The national radio station said today that 117 people had been killed and nearly 160 others injured in the wave of rioting that swept through this dilapidated city and elsewhere in the country. The streets were deserted at nightfall, with soldiers scattered along the roads enforcing a dawn-to-dusk curfew. Most stores and offices in the capital were shuttered, and the airport remained closed to commercial traffic.
 
Figurehead Status Possible
 Opposition figures and Western diplomats interviewed this weekend were reluctant to give a timetable for what many consider the inevitable downfall of President Mobutu. But several diplomats suggested that his fortunes had sunk so low that he might now be persuaded to remain in power as essentially a figurehead, presiding over a transitional government until elections are held.
"This is incredible -- Mobutu has committed political suicide," said Olivier Kasongo, an opposition leader who was among the hundreds who gathered this morning at the conference center where President Mobutu and opposition leaders held their talks.
A senior Western diplomat with extensive experience in Africa said: "It is not in our interest that Mobutu suddenly disappear. What may replace him is unclear, and meanwhile, the situation could prove chaotic."
Even if the differences between the President and the opposition can be bridged, it is not clear how the people of Zaire will react as they face an economic crisis of unprecedented proportions.
One sign of the continuing deterioration of the security situation here was the sudden and unexpected departure of the entire European staff of the Inter-Continental Hotel. Soon after the rioting began last week, troops from the presidential guard surrounded the hotel. Not long afterward, several hundred French, Belgian and other expatriates sought refuge there.
On Friday night, however, marauding soldiers from the presidential guard reportedly moved to the tree-lined streets near the hotel, using rifles or pistols to shoot out padlocks and smash down doors. Apparently fearing that the attacks might spread to the hotel, the foreign staff fled this afternoon.
In all of sub-Saharan Africa, Zaire has one of the worst reputations for official corruption and economic mismanagement. According to African and Western diplomats, as well as numerous scholars on Zaire, President Mobutu has used his position to make himself one of the world's richest men. Critics estimate his personal fortune at $4 billion.
Even his harshest critics, however, give him high marks for having woven together a nation out of nearly 250 often-feuding ethnic groups. He has achieved this through a mix of political acumen, personal appeal and strong-arm tactics.
 
Economic Policy Faulted
 But his economic leadership is held in far lower regard. In early 1990, the Government abandoned an economomic recovery program devised by the International Monetary Fund. At the same time, Government spending ballooned. The resulting budget deficit helped push annual inflation in Zaire to an estimated 900 percent to 1,000 percent, its highest level since 1960, the year of independence from Belgium.
Meanwhile, because of deficit spending and a sharp decrease in the availability of foreign exchange, the national currency, the zaire, has depreciated rapidly against the American dollar. In January 1990, the zairecq traded at about 300 to the dollar; the official exchange rate is now about 19,000 to the dollar.
Workers typically earn in a month the money needed to survive just one week, and many have second jobs. Many Zairians complain that they have no money to buy anything, and if they did, there is little in stores to buy.
When confronted with accusations of corruption and mismanagement, the 60-year-old leader has insisted that he is a victim of disinformation. He has also blamed external factors like weak commodity prices for the growing civil strife and the country's sharply deteriorating standard of living.
 
Hundreds of Millions From U.S.
 President Mobutu's Government has received hundreds of millions of dollars from the United States since he seized power in a 1965 military coup. The Central Intelligence Agency is said to haveworked closely with President Mobutu for years. Historians have written that American officials knew about, and some say even helped, his successful coup. The takeover followed five years of bitter factional fighting in the country among Marxists with Soviet ties, pro-Western moderate reformers, and a neo-colonial leadership in what was then Katanga province, in the nation's south.
In particular, Zaire's role as a conduit for arms for United States-backed rebels in Angola led by Jonas Savimbi virtually assured continuing support for the Mobutu leadership. At the same time, President Mobutu has maintained strong ties with Belgium while developing relations with France and South Africa.
But amid allegations of a massacre of 12 university students by security forces in May 1990, and possibly several times that number, the United States Congress voted in December to cut all military and economic aid to Zaire.
If President Mobutu should leave the political scene, the leading candidates to fill the vacuum are thought to be Mr. Tshisekedi, the head of the largest opposition group, the Union for Democracy and Social Process, and a former Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Nguza Karl-i-Bond. Both have been accused at various times of having been co-opted by President Mobutu; however, Mr. Nguza has also felt the President's wrath, serving years in prison when he fell from official grace.
In 1967, Mr. Tshisekedi was instrumental in writing a document that helped set up President Mobutu's one-party state, but in 1981, he was one of 13 members of Parliament who broke with the leader. They signed a letter accusing the Goverment of corruption, human rights abuses and the stifling of democracy.
Mr. Nguza has also had a checkered career. In the late 1970's after serving as prime minister, he became one of President Mobutu's severest critics and in 1980 was sentenced to death for treason. The sentence was later reduced to a long prison term. Mr. Nguza later testified before a United States Congressional committee investigating reports that President Mobutu had embezzled aid funds from the United States.
Nonetheless, in 1986 President Mobutu sent Mr. Nguza to Washington as Zaire's Ambassador to the United States.

Chart: "Zaire at a Glance"
 
LAND
Zaire occupies the major part of the Congo River basin and a small part of the Upper Nile Basin, covering 905-365 square miles. It is the third-largest country in Africa, after the Sudan and Algeria, and is about the size of the United States east of the Mississippi River.
 
POPULATION: 35.3 million
(1990 est.)
 
ECONOMY
Though it has huge mineral resources, including large copper deposits, Zaire has suffered the collapse of its infrastructure and economy with the Government unable to pay the salaries of civil servants and foreign creditors refusing additional aid.
 
HISTORY
King Leopold II of Belgium hired the English explorer Henry Stanley in 1878 to conquer a large area in Central Africa, and the newly created Congo Freee State became the King's personal property in 1885. In 1908, it was made a Belgian colony.
 
Belgium granted independence on June 30, 1960, but turmoil immediately followed, including a Belgian-backed uprising in Katanga province that led to United Nations intervention.
 
Hundreds of thousands of Zairians died in uprisings in the country's first five years. Including its first Prime Minister, Patrice Lumumba, who was slain in 1961 after his ouster the previous year. On Nov. 24, 1965, Gen. Joseph D. Mobutu was named President after a coup; he later changed his name to Mobutu Sese Seko. In 1977 and 1978 Zairian invaders from Angola were repulsed with Western suport.
 
President Mobutu, whose Government received substantial amounts of American aid, was accused of enriching himself while stripping the country of its wealth. He ruled virtually unchallenged until 1990, when demands for democracy forced him to agree to legalize opposition parties.

HEADLINE: Washington at Work;
Michigan Democrat Presides As Capital's Grand Inquisitor

BYLINE: By DAVID ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29

 BODY:
This year alone, Representative John D. Dingell's investigations helped force the resignation of the president of Stanford University and led a Nobel Prize-winning scientist to retract a research paper. The Congressman also uncovered mismanagement at the Food and Drug Administration and overbilling at Humana hospitals.
And that was just this year. Over the last decade, his hearings have led to criminal convictions of top Government officials and the resignation of many others and have exposed fraud and corruption in corporate boardrooms and Government agencies. 
 Critics say Mr. Dingell is more interested in burnishing his reputation as the most fearsome inquisitor on Capitol Hill by bringing powerful people to their knees than he is in getting laws enacted.
 
For or Against Him
 But he maintained in an interview last week that if prominent people were humiliated when they were caught with their hands in the cookie jar, it was not his fault. "We are always very careful," he said. "One of my great fears is that someone is going to say, 'Dingell, you're just another damn McCarthy.' I don't believe anyone has ever made that case."
Few people in official Washington are ambivalent about John Dingell, a 65-year-old Democrat from outside Detroit and the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee and its Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. Some, generally off the record, call him a mean-spirited, vindictive, power-hungry bully. Others say he is warm, generous and loyal as a person and a tireless and effective force for good government.
Perhaps those widely different views exist because Mr. Dingell himself often seems to view life through a binary lens. His colleagues and the others he deals with are friends or foes, honest or crooked, able or incompetent. Legislation is good or bad; positions are right or wrong.
Mr. Dingell acknowledges that he takes special pleasure in exposing wrongdoing and bringing down to size people who seem to him to act too big for their britches. But, he says, "They've been able to create some great wrongs before they ever got around to us."
 
Toilet Seats and Banking
 His inquiries led to the criminal conviction of, among others, Michael K. Deaver, one of President Ronald Reagan's top advisers. They have caught prominent figures like Adm. Hyman G. Rickover, the father of the nuclear Navy, in questionable deals. Among those forced from office was Anne Gorsuch Burford, the first head of the Environmental Protection Agency in the Reagan Administration.
Dingell investigations exposed rampant waste and fraud in Pentagon contracts, like the Air Force's $640 toilet seat and the kennel fees the military paid for the dog of a General Dynamics executive. They showed the generic drug industry to be riven with corruption and the Environmental Protection Agency in the early 1980's to be a tool of the industries it was regulating. Blood banks, bottled water and pacemakers are unquestionably safer now than they used to be because of Dingell exposes.
Beyond the investigations, he has almost unparalleled influence on legislation. Just last week, for example, Representative Dingell was instrumental in shaping the most important banking legislation in more than 50 years.
Congress has been his life. His father, John David Dingell Sr., was a New Deal Congressman, a strong proponent of Social Security and banking regulations, and John Jr. grew up in Washington. He was a Congressional page as a teen-ager, received his undergraduate and law degrees a few miles from the Capitol at Georgetown University and, after a brief stint as a county prosecutor in Detroit, he was elected to Congress in 1955 to fill the seat left open after his father died.
 
Champion of Auto Industry
 Few people in public life are so enigmatic. Outside his work, his passions are firearms and hunting on one hand, ballet and classical music on the other. Well over six feet tall and 200 pounds with enormous hands and a booming voice, he dominates every room he enters.
By his own account, Mr. Dingell is the automobile industry's chief spokesman in Congress. He has devoted himself to blocking automobile safety and fuel economy requirements and antipollution legislation.
"I am totally unapologetic about that," he said. "I represent half a million people whose lives are controlled by the good fortune or bad fortune of the auto industry. I was sent down here to look after the welfare of that district and the people I serve."
Otherwise, his politics fit no discernable pattern. His strong support for civil rights laws and vigorous opposition to gun control might not be expected from the representative of a district that is working class, industrial, almost entirely white and heavily Polish. (His grandfather changed the family name from Dzieglewicz, and Mr. Dingell repeatedly alludes to his Polish ancestry.)
 
Half the House's Bills
 Since he became chairman 10 years ago, Mr. Dingell has brought more and more fields under the umbrella of the Energy and Commerce Committee. He has jurisdiction now over not only energy and transportation but also the environment, health, telecommunications, insurance, the financial markets, consumer protection, broadcasting, food and drugs, biotechnology and countless other issues that are woven into the fabric of American life in the 1990's.
The committee handles nearly half the bills before the House each year.
Because of the breadth of his authority, some critics blame Mr. Dingell for the failure of Congress to address some of the main issues facing the nation. Indeed, the country has no national energy strategy. Nearly a decade after the break-up of the Bell system, no comprehensive telecommunications law has been passed. The committee has not faced up to soaring medical costs. The rules governing the financial markets are anachronistic. A clean air bill was enacted last year, but only after Mr. Dingell had bottled it up for 10 years.
Mr. Dingell thinks such criticism is unfair. Rather than scoring legislative goals, he says, he has been forced to play goalie and block Republican efforts to cut programs and dismantle Government regulations.
"For the last 10 years," he said, "we have had Administrations, Reagan and Bush both, that did not want legislation. Reagan did everything he did to repeal the Government. So a lot of my efforts have been defensive and not affirmative."
 
Toppling Titans
 And, for all his influence over legislation, it is as an investigator in the subcommittee he heads that Mr. Dingell has truly made his mark.
To critics who say he is unnecessarily personal and brutal in his questioning, Mr. Dingell says his main goal is not to humble people but to ferret out abuses. "Those who are doing things wrong enough to attract the attention of the committee are usually fairly important, prominent, well-to-do people," Mr. Dingell said.
Thus, this year he relentlessly pursued David Baltimore, who won the Nobel Prize for his research in molecular biology and is now president of Rockefeller University, until Dr. Baltimore finally had to concede that research might have been faked in a paper he co-wrote. And Mr. Dingell was not satisfied merely with exposing the way the nation's most famous universities overcharged the Government for research. He kept after the issue until Donald Kennedy announced he would resign as president of Stanford.
Dingell investigations have become such a fundamental part of the Washington scene that seminars are held to advise potential witnesses how to respond, and several lawyers here have built their practices around representing clients before his inquiries.
One of those lawyers said he thought Mr. Dingell sometimes abused his authority by "forcing people to sit there before the television cameras while they are savagely attacked." But the lawyer, like some others who appear regularly before the panel, acknowledged that Mr. Dingell was "always prepared and careful with the facts."
 
Inhibiting Science
 Many scientists are also highly critical of Mr. Dingell's style. Maxine F. Singer, director of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, a leading funder of scientific research, said Mr. Dingell's persistent attacks could discourage scientists from taking risks.
"If there is misconduct," Dr. Singer said, "it ought to be dealt with. But it's not much of a bargain to destroy individuals and discourage young people from taking leadership positions in science."
Mr. Dingell says: "We have never done anything to threaten an honest researcher. We have just asked was the work done or was the work not done, was the work falsified or not. Is that going to inhibit an honest person from going into science? I think not."
Witnesses who cross Mr. Dingell are not the only ones who have felt his wrath. So have colleagues who he feels have not dealt with him squarely. He has, for instance, prevented Representative James H. Scheuer of Queens, the second-ranking Democrat on the Commerce Committee, from becoming a subcommittee chairman because of an incident in the 1970's when, Mr. Dingell insists, Mr. Scheuer betrayed him by secretly seeking to scuttle legislation he had promised to support.
 
Daring to Disagree
 This year, Mr. Dingell is pushing for legislation that would place a nuclear waste dump in Nevada over the objection of that state's politicians. Other lawmakers say this is a retaliatory strike against Senator Richard H. Bryan, Democrat of Nevada, who is championing legislation that would force Detroit to make cars that get better gasoline mileage.
But Mr. Dingell's friends say he does not hold it against them when they disagree with him so long as they do not blindside him. One protege, Representative Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, said he told Mr. Dingell when he joined his committee that he could not back the chairman's opposition to the Clean Air Act. "He looked at me and said, 'Just don't hurt me any more than you have to,' " Mr. Wyden recalled.
Out in Michigan, the word is that Mr. Dingell will someday relinquish his Congressional seat so that his son Christopher, a lawyer, engineer and state senator, can have it, keeping the seat in the family for a third generation.
Someday, maybe, Mr. Dingell said, but no time soon. "There's an old Polish saying," he said. "Before you sell the bear's hide, you first have to shoot the bear."

After Buddy System, A Star Search Is Next

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Suddenly the Mets seem to be in the market for the kind of manager the Yankees always sought under George Steinbrenner: a man who not only can manage but who also is a personality, someone who could attract the attention of the fans, whose numbers dwindled at Shea Stadium this season.
Who is that man? The club's braintrust itself apparently doesn't know at this point, although the Mets are prepared to depart from past practice and go outside the organization for the man they hope can restore them to contending status. 
 Al Harazin, the new general manager, whose first task will be to name Bud Harrelson's successor, said yesterday that he preferred someone with major league managing experience, and plenty of those people exist -- all having been fired from previous jobs.
 
Dallas May Be Too Hot
 The man most widely mentioned in recent weeks has been Dallas Green, who has a dynamic personality and managerial experience with the Yankees and the Philadelphia Phillies. But the Mets' on-the-spot executives, Harazin and Gerry Hunsicker, would have to feel they had no other viable candidate before talking to Green.
"I think Al would be a little nervous about Dallas," an executive of another club said yesterday, pinpointing the problem.
Green, who also is a former general manager and club president, likes to have authority beyond his role as manager. Harazin and Hunsicker, being new to their jobs, could feel threatened by Green's presence.
Twenty-one coaches on major league teams have been major league managers. Most attractive among them, from a purely baseball standpoint, could be Rene Lachemann of Oakland and Hal Lanier of Philadelphia, although they are not noted for stirring up excitement.
 
Ex-Managers With Credentials
 Six former managers are unemployed after having been fired earlier this season. Another fired manager, Buck Rodgers, would have been a primary candidate for the Mets, but he was hired by the California Angels five weeks ago. Should the Mets have acted more quickly in their dismissal of Harrelson and snatched Rodgers, who had been available since Montreal fired him June 3? Probably, but they apparently knew that Rodgers preferred working in California.
Other former managers lurk elsewhere, some in front offices, some in scouting positions, some in the minor leagues.
Frank Robinson, in Baltimore's front office since the Orioles removed him as their manager in May, would make an attractive candidate. He is knowledgeable, he can be tough (which Harrelson wasn't when he needed to be), and he is a personality. But Frank Cashen, the departing general manager, finds him abrasive, and he will have input into the decision.
The Mets could find their manager in the minors, where Bill Virdon works as a roving outfeld instructor for Pittsburgh. Virdon has 13 years of major league managing experience, though none since 1984. He managed the Pirates, the Yankees, Houston and Montreal, and has always commanded his players' respect.
"He's tough, the kind of guy the Mets need," said an official of another club. Virdon, 60 years old, displayed his toughness last spring. It was his confrontation with Barry Bonds that led to a shouting encounter between Bonds and Jim Leyland, the Pirates' manager.
Pittsburgh's third-base coach, Gene Lamont, has been mentioned as a candidate for the Florida Marlins' managing job and could also be considered by the Mets. Lamont managed in the minors for eight years.
If the Mets don't find an experienced manager they like, they could consider major league coaches. Two who stand out are Don Baylor of Milwaukee and Davey Lopes of Texas.
They also could check the broadcasting booth. That's where the St. Louis Cardinals found Joe Torre last year, and look at how the Cardinals did this season.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Arrives in Japan To Foster Business Ties

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Monday, Sept. 30

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo signaled to Japanese officials this morning that he would use his visit here to promote economic cooperation with Japan. He also said "many Americans are unhappy" about the economic relationship between Japan and the United States.
"It is true that there is difficulty in the relationship," Mr. Cuomo told the Governor of Tokyo, Shunichi Suzuki, at a meeting this morning at the giant new office of the Tokyo government. He said American dissatisfaction stemmed from rising unemployment and other economic pressures and "that's something we need to address." 
 The Governor added that the United States had created many of its problems itself, to which Mr. Suzuki nodded in agreement.
The exchange highlighted the first of three-and-a-half days of meetings for Mr. Cuomo, who arrived Sunday night on a rare foray outside the United States to promote New York's economic ties to Japan.
 
Reconnaissance Aircraft
 Mr. Cuomo planned to press the Japanese Government to purchase reconnaissance aircraft made by the Grumman Corporation, the Long Island manufacturer, to replace a planned reduction in orders of Awacs, reconnaissance aircraft made by the Boeing Corporation.
Mr. Cuomo has scheduled sessions with the Foreign Minister, Taro Nakayama, and the Minister of International Trade and Industry, Eiichi Nakao. Later in the week he will meet with various business associations and some university students.
Mr. Cuomo's main comments during his trip are scheduled for Wednesday in a speech to American, but not Japanese, businessmen. He plans to talk to them about trade relations with Japan, which many experts expect to be a major issue in the coming Presidential campaign.
The Governor has said he has no intention of running for President, and shows irritation whenever anyone interprets his actions as laying the groundwork for a possible campaign.
Japanese officials, aware that he is a major national figure, say they want to learn his positions on issues affecting Japan -- for instance, whether he will endorse any of the tough bills in Congress sponsored by Democrats that would limit Japanese investments or exports in the United States.
These days it is not unusual for governors to come to Japan. Most states have offices here, and according to the American embassy, about 30 governors have visited Japan in the last two years to promote investments in, and exports from, their states.
 
It Must Be Cultivated
 Only a few governors have received much publicity in Japan, a testimony to what the Japanese take for granted -- that Japanese economic power is so great it must be cultivated.
Indeed, Japanese officials always point out the eagerness of the governors whenever American politicians cite opinion polls or regulations in Congress that might make it harder for the Japanese to invest in the United States.
"We are convinced Americans need Japanese investments more than is realized in Congress," said an official at Keidanren, the leading Japanese business-trade association, which the Governor will address this week. "That's why visits like Mr. Cuomo's are important."
A month ago, Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts led a large entourage of Cabinet members and advisers in several days of meetings with Japanese officials and businessmen.
 
Sponsors of the Trip
 Governor Cuomo's visit to Tokyo was prompted by an invitation from the Foreign Ministry, which is paying for Mr. Cuomo and his wife, Matilda, to stay four nights at the luxury-class Imperial Hotel, near the gleaming Ginza shopping area and the gardens surrounding the walled Imperial Palace.
The remaining cost of the trip is being shared by the Japan Chamber of Commerce of New York, a Japanese group, and the Upstate Manufacturers' Roundtable in New York. A spokesman for the Governor said the cost of Mr. and Mrs. Cuomo and five aides traveling to and staying in Japan was under $50,000.
Traveling with the Cuomos are: John Charlson, confidential assistant to the Governor; Vincent Tese, director of Economic Development; Harold Holzer, Mr. Tese's executive assistant; Junko Heverlick, director of the Governor's Office of Special Projects and Protocol, and Barry Spaulding, the director of the Office of Economic Development Far East office in Tokyo.

HEADLINE: Uproar in New Haven On Public Housing Role

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, Sept. 29

 BODY:
Real-estate for-sale signs line the streets of this worn-looking city, offering what some see as an opportunity but others see as a threat. The New Haven Housing Authority is shopping for bargains in the glut of condominiums and houses on the market.
Under pressure from Federal officials to replace public housing lost when the city demolished its notorious Elm Haven high-rises, the authority has decided that buying houses rather than building them is the fastest way to get started. 
 The house-hunting has raised a predictable uproar among homeowners. While nobody wants the high-rises back, many residents say they fear for the neighborhoods they have built and the life savings they have invested in their homes.
And by striking so close to home, the issue has rallied people around an issue of growing resonance in Connecticut's cities, where the state's poor and minority residents are concentrated: Let the suburbs start sharing the burden.
This month Mayor John C. Daniels was loudly cheered by homeowners when he asked the authority to put off a vote on buying 19 houses. "We are being asked to continue to bear alone a housing burden for the economically disadvantaged," he said.
"We cannot and will not allow decent housing to be denied to all of our residents," continued Mr. Daniels, who grew up in public housing next to Elm Haven. "Nor can we any longer accept the responsibility of housing the poor of the entire region alone."
On that night Mayor Daniels, the city's first black Mayor and a Democrat who won office campaigning for more affordable housing, was loudly applauded by white homeowners fighting to keep that housing out of their neighborhoods. Almost everyone, it seemed, could agree that the plan had been poorly thought out and then sprung upon an unsuspecting city.
The few dissenters were public-housing tenants and their advocates, who have filed a Federal lawsuit suit against the city, housing authority, and Department of Housing and Urban Development. In the suit, they are charging that public officials are responsible for the segregation and poor conditions that give public housing in cities across the country, large and small, its bad image. The suit is seeking a desegregation order for New Haven and its suburbs that goes far beyond the authority's Elm Haven plan.
Mr. Daniels was criticized by Glenn W. Falk, a New Haven Legal Assistance Association lawyer who filed the suit on behalf of Christian Community Action, a nonprofit group that works with the poor, and nine minority women seeking better housing.
"One would have expected more from a former resident of public housing and a Mayor committed to civil rights," Mr. Falk said.
 
'Repeatedly Delayed'
 The suit, similar to those filed in several other cities where blighted public housing has been razed, seeks to force New Haven to replace Elm Haven's 366 apartments.
The city is obligated by Federal law and an agreement with the Department of Housing and Urban Development to replace half of the units with new public housing scattered in neighborhoods without high minority populations. The suit charges that officials "have repeatedly delayed or abandoned construction or acquisition of scattered-site public housing because of white neighborhood opposition."
But the suit also suggests that Elm Haven's high-rises, standing just a few blocks from Yale University and downtown, were only the most visible product of a policy of segregation that made much of the city's public housing a dumping ground for poor blacks.
Sprawling projects, some of which look more like work camps than apartment complexes, are isolated along industrial rivers, behind main avenues, on dead-end roads at the city line. Mr. Falk charges that the deliberate selection of sites and assignment of tenants resulted in 10 of the projects being more than 90 percent black.
As a remedy, besides replacing the Elm Haven housing, his suit seeks "additional public-housing units outside areas of minority concentration, including outside the City of New Haven," and rent subsidies that public-housing tenants could use anywhere.
The subsidies, or Section 8 certificates, can be used across city and state lines, said Florence Roisman, a staff lawyer with the National Housing Law Project, but many jurisdictions have illegally limited their use because of political opposition.
Suits like New Haven's, she said, "are pushing housing authorities to implement rights that tenants have had as a matter of Federal law. These lawsuits are law enforcement."
 
Mistrust for Housing Authority
 Homeowners are a minority in New Haven, where two-thirds of the housing is rental, and a fourth -- 11,000 units -- is either public housing or subsidized. Many people mistrust the housing authority, calling it the city's largest slumlord. Even advocates of affordable housing say there are legitimate concerns about the agency's ability to screen tenants and maintain property.
"You just can't go in and tell people that this is what's going to happen next door to them," said Alderwoman Robin I. Kroogman, a Democrat who represents Fair Haven, a focus of opposition to the Elm Haven plan.
Other housing advocates say it is unfortunate that the issue of the suburbs has been raised as part of the Elm Haven controversy, because of that housing project's notoriety and because it is well known that New Haven agreed to replace that housing itself.
"There is no question that regional cooperation is necessary, but this is a difficult issue to pursue this goal around," said Brendan Sharkey, executive director of the South Central Regional Housing Compact, which promotes affordable housing in the area. "For three years I've been telling suburban communities that supporting affordable housing is not like putting Elm Haven high-rises on Main Street."
Even opponents of the authority's plan acknowledge that Elm Haven, realistically, is the city's responsibility. The goal of Alderwoman Elaine A. Braffman, for example, is to block the authority from bringing rental housing into neighborhoods of homeowners.
While the Elm Haven experience may give the city more reason to seek cooperation with its suburbs on future housing, some experts suggest it offers another example of the deep opposition to low-income housing that has made regional approaches almost impossible.
New Jersey was able to force towns to provide affordable housing, said Prof. Robert W. Burchell of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University, only because the state Supreme Court threatened to take local zoning control from towns that did not.
"New Jersey's courts were so tough," he said, "towns jumped on the Fair Housing Act bandwagon to get away from them."

HEADLINE: Past Deadline, Street Families Remain in Hotels

BYLINE: By THOMAS MORGAN

 BODY:
Four years ago, after a Federal official angered by a television report threatened to cut off millions in aid, the Government set today as a deadline for New York City to get homeless families out of welfare hotels.
Setting the deadline did many things, including spurring a huge reorganization of the city's programs for the homeless. But it did not end the city's reliance on the expensive, often squalid hotels. 
 Instead, today's deadline will pass with little fanfare as New York City -- only last year on the verge of meeting it -- admits defeat amid a homeless crisis that in sheer numbers is nearly as large as it was four years ago. More than 800 families still live in hotels.
Despite a flurry of moving thousands of families from hotels into city-owned apartments and housing projects in an effort to meet today's deadline, New York City officials cannot say when they will take families out of hotels or large dormitory family shelters, which advocates for the homeless call inadequate and inhumane.
 
U.S. Declines to Crack Down
 Nor will the Government take action against the city. Officials of the Department of Health and Human Services, arguing that the shelter system has improved, say they may allow Federal money to be used to pay for hotel rentals of longer than 30 days. And they are not about to cut off the nearly $150 million in Federal emergency housing aid -- the program the city was using in 1987 to keep homeless families in hotels almost indefinitely.
To advocates for the homeless, the apparent decision by the Government to let the city off the hook is a disappointment.
"It now seems that whether deadlines are set by the courts or the legislative branches of government, this adminstration has no fear of simply ignoring them," said Steve Banks, coordinating attorney of the Legal Aid Society's Homeless Family Rights project. "Without a deadline, the government isn't capable of acting."
City officials respond that their failure is not for lack of trying. "It's a state of emergency," said Jeffrey L. Carples, executive deputy commissioner of the Adult Services Administration of the city's Human Services Administration. "I disagree strongly with charges that we haven't taken deadlines seriously. It's easy for people to say that we've held up our hands and not paid attention to deadlines."
The officials say the current crisis is a product of the recession on top of a general housing crisis. They attribute that crisis to greatly reduced Federal spending for new housing for the poor in New York City, where one of every eight residents is on welfare. No new housing projects have been built here in nearly a decade. Gentrification has also reduced the number of apartments available to poor families.
In addition, they say, the return to pre-'87 levels of homeless in the system should not obscure improvements in the quality of services.
"What we offer families today is like night and day compared to the hell-holes of a couple of years ago," said Mr. Carples.
 
Supposed to Be Temporary
 The Federal official who was so outraged in 1987, Wayne A. Stanton, has left the Department of Health and Human Services in Washington. But the issues he raised remain strong among Federal officials, who are concerned about New York City's open-ended use of Federal dollars for what was conceived as temporary financial assistance for the homeless.
New York City receives the Federal money under a matching grant program, with the Federal Government paying 50 percent, New York State 25 percent and the city the rest. Over the last year, New York City has received nearly $330 million and depends on it almost totally to care for the homeless.
Under Federal guidelines, however, the money cannot be used to build permanent apartments for the homeless. Some of it can be used to provide day care, drug counseling and other social services to homeless families.
When Mr. Stanton proposed limiting the use of the money to 30 days, advocates for the homeless seized on the proposal as a way to force the city to remake its shelter system and to get families out of welfare hotels.
 
Once, Only 200 Families
 Toward the end of the Koch administration and especially during the first eight months of the Dinkins administration, New York City made significant progress in emptying the hotels by putting thousands of homeless families in city-owned apartments and in the city's housing projects. By June 1990, fewer than 200 families lived in hotels.
The shelter system was also reshaped. Back in 1987, it was a collection of dingy converted armories with rows of cots and no privacy, and crime- and drug-infested welfare hotels that were home to more than 3,000 families with young children. Toddlers played in hallways that were virtual firetraps, dealers dealt drugs openly under the watchful eyes of children and mothers offered themselves, or their children, as prostitutes to earn a quick dollar.
Now the system includes a variety of shelters, many of them brand new buildings, where some homeless families live in small, temporary apartments and have the services of social workers and day care.
And to address the underlying problem of a housing shortage, Mayor Koch pledged to create new or rehabilitated housing for 250,000 families over 10 years -- more than 5,000 buildings and 47,000 housing units.
Despite budget cuts, the renovation is still going on, and will soon be adding 1,900 apartments a year, city officials say. Nearly 10,000 temporary and permanent city-owned apartments have opened since Mayor Dinkins took office. But the hopeful early days of his administration, when the hotels were emptying out, now seem long ago.
Many families still sleep side by side in dormitory-style shelters, besides those living in welfare hotels. By June, it will be worse than ever, with 6,000 families living in homeless shelters, city officials predict.
City officials said that some overcrowding is a result of their own miscalculation. To empty the hotels and dormitory shelters quickly, the city gave priority in city housing projects to homeless people. As a result, city officials say, families who lived with relatives and friends in crowded apartments have been entering city shelters in the hopes of getting city apartments after a few months.
Others, mainly advocates for the homeless, counter that the hazards and instability of life in shelters are unattractive enough to deter all but those most desperately in need of shelter.
As the numbers in shelters rose again and the city turned again to hotels, advocates for the homeless sought to force the city to keep its earlier commitments by having the City Council pass laws to close down some of the dormitory shelters by today and by taking the city to court.
 
Anger That U.S. Won't Act
 Advocates now say they are frustrated and angry that the Federal Government will not penalize the city for using the hotels and that the city continues to ignore court orders. City officials have already admitted in court to 1,325 violations regarding shelters for pregnant women or women with small children.
 
'Adevocates Are Appalled'
 "This is something that Mayor Koch never would have gotten away with," said Mary Brosnahan, executive director of the Coalition for the Homeless. "Advocates are appalled by the fact that if indeed Mayor Dinkins had followed through on Koch's commitments to the Federal Government, the city would be out of hotels by now.
"The forms of deterrence to keep people from the shelters has proven to be an utter failure. The street homeless population that is continuously rising is linked to the city's continued use of armories for shelters, the sweeps of homeless people from Tompkins Square Park and Columbus Circle. It seems like nobody at City Hall gets the picture here."
Victor A. Kovner, the city's Corporation Counsel, said that by court order, the city has to provide emergency housing, not permanent apartments, to all who declare they are homeless. But the courts do not define who is homeless, he said. Eligibility is determined by the state with Federal approval.
City officials said last week that they were seeking to change the eligibility requirements to limit who can declare themselves homeless. By various city estimates, more than 100,000 families live in overcrowded conditions with relatives and friends.
 
Court-Ordered Generosity
 Unlike other states with more rigid eligibility rules, New York City is required under various court orders to provide emergency housing for families who say they are homeless, regardless of whether they qualify for welfare.
Last month, Mayor Dinkins appointed Andrew M. Cuomo, the Governor's son and the head of an agency that provides homeless housing, to recommend how the city can improve its shelter system. Advocates see the appointment as yet another admission of failure and as a stalling tactic.
"It's extraordinarily frustrating that an administration that came in with 'a shelter is not a home' as its watchword," said Mr. Banks, "is now seeking to evade legal requirements to provide lawful shelter and is now actually blaming the families themselves for the city's inability to appropriately manage the shelter system."

HEADLINE: Flight Attendants Toast Their Pan Am as It Flies Into the Sunset

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
Other Pan Am attendants were swapping business cards in the ladies' room Saturday night at El Morocco, but in the cavernous bar Susan Walstrom was remembering the happier times: Omar Sharif at her parties, Spiro T. Agnew conked out on her couch, gin bottles in her flight bag.
"I'm the wrong person to interview because it makes it sound too wild," Ms. Walstrom said of the life she might soon have to give up. After a moment, she added with a smile, "But it was." 
 She was but one of some 600 current and former flight attendants of Pan American World Airways who left their regulation-blue uniforms at home and trekked to New York this weekend in sequins, rhinestones and dancing shoes for one last crew party.
Though the reunion was thought up well before the bankrupt airline announced in August that it would be reorganizing as a much smaller Latin American carrier, guests at the party seized the chance, perhaps their last, to toast the airline that was.
"Pan Am is a family," said Anne Sweeney, a former flight attendant who has her own public relations firm. "A dysfunctional family, but a family. It breaks my heart that the airline could not have been saved in a bigger form."
Delta Air Lines is expected to hire only about 1,800 of Pan Am's roughly 4,500 flight attendants for the trans-Atlantic routes and Northeast shuttle that Delta is taking over. And since the new Pan Am will have room for another 1,750, those at the party understood that many of them will soon be "off the line," as they describe it.
"They haven't called me yet," said Ms. Walstrom, who, during her Pan Am tenure flew as a volunteer on rescue missions to Saigon, Tehran and Beirut but worries about Delta's stated preference for people with strong foreign language skills. "My French was awful," she sighed.
The line outside El Morroco on East 54th Street in Manhattan started to form at the unfashionably early hour of "1800 hours local," as the guests put it. On an evening in which attention was divided between networking and nostalgia, the guests watched a video compiled from old snapshots. They hummed along to old Pan Am jingles like, "You can't beat the experience, Pan Am."
The women joked about how confusing it became trying to remember when to take birth control pills while hopping back and forth over the international date line. And when someone accidentally tripped, Ms. Sweeney leapt into action. "Does someone need CPR?" she asked.
Everyone compared notes on his or her favorite passengers.
"Eleanor Roosevelt always wanted the same thing," recalled Joseph Kapel, a purser of 34 years who retired six years ago. "She would sit in economy and say, 'No autographs please.' Rose Kennedy always had three seats in the back, brought her own food and said, 'tell the girls not to bother me.' "
Other veterans recalled serving everyone from Miles Davis, who had just died, to Charles A. Lindbergh, who politely asked whether he might sit in the cockpit. It was quickly arranged.
Ms. Walstrom managed to befriend many of her celebrity passengers. She met Mr. Sharif when he was flying to Delhi to make a movie and Mr. Agnew shortly after he resigned from office. She asked the former Vice President if he was a thief.
"Well, what constitutes a thief?" she said he replied, wanting to know, for instance, if cheating on your income taxes counted.
Oddly, no one interviewed blamed Pan Am's latest management team led by Thomas G. Plaskett, its recently departed chief executive, for the airline's demise. They did blame Pan Am's former chairmen, C. Edward Acker and William T. Seawell, however, and the executives' wives for expensive tastes that the guests said far outlived financial well-being.
Judy Seawell, for instance, hired two of her favorite designers, Cacharel and Adolfo, to redo the flight attendants' uniforms. Next to the miniskirts that used to ride up the flight attendants' thighs whenever they reached for the overhead compartments, the Adolfo outfits were hated more than any other.
More predictably, there was the much fretting about the future.
"Any business you refer will be appreciated," said Sebastine Amedume-Beaumier, a part-time caterer, handing her business card to a co-worker in the ladies' room. The co-worker stuffed the card in her bra with the others.
 
'Used to Be a Special Treat'
 But mostly they talked about the glorious past, the days when Pan Am required a new flight attendant to have two years of college, speak a foreign language and wear a girdle. Air travel was still considered the height of chic, and it attracted a genteel crowd.
"Flying used to be a special treat," said Nancy Dodson, who recently hooked up with United. "Passengers got on airplanes all dressed up. Getting on an airplane now is as common as getting in your car or getting on a Greyhound bus."
Others who found work with Delta or United, which purchased Pan Am's routes to Heathrow earlier this year, spoke about the painful adjustment.
"To be on probation when you're 54 years old and have 30 years of experience is humiliating," said Janet Morgan, another recent United hire.
By comparison, Joseph Nation's transition was a success story.
After getting a master's degree in public policy while still a flight attendant, he went on to get a doctorate and is now running for a vacant Congressional seat from California.
"I will be the first flight attendant elected to Congress," Mr. Nation predicted, handing out campaign buttons.
Along with the litany of sacrifices that accompanied the hard and frequent travel, Mr. Nation remembered some benefits of his old job. As one of the few male flight attendants at Pan Am, he said, he found it relatively easy to find a wife.
"On my first flight, there were 14 crew members, 12 of whom were gorgeous girls," he said. "I said, 'I think I'm going to like this job.' "

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: MAGAZINE NOTES;
Jobs Outlook Mostly Grim For Industry

BYLINE: By Deirdre Carmody

 BODY:
WHEN Time Warner Inc. announced earlier this month that it would lay off 105 editorial employees at six magazines, on top of the 500 positions on the business side that it had recently eliminated, a collective shudder ran through the magazine world. Not because the news was unexpected. But because the industry's unhappy little secret had finally been voiced so loudly and so publicly.
In the last 18 months, hundreds of magazine employees have lost their jobs, mostly quietly and unannounced. Edward Koller, president of the Howard-Sloan-Koller Group, a national recruiting firm for magazine publishers, estimates that since Aug. 1 a minimum of 1,200 industry employees have either been dismissed or have left and not been replaced. He says he receives 500 resumes a week. 
 "My best assessment is that for the next 12 to 18 months, companies will continue to restructure and downsize," Mr. Koller said. "Twenty-five percent of those who have been put out of work will leave the business entirely."
Among those who have found themselves without jobs are some 250 employees of Family Media, which shut down in August; 200 people dismissed earlier this year by the Cahners Magazine Company, and untold numbers of employees of New England Living, California, SF, Angeles, Egg, Memories, Outweek and Museum & Arts DC, which have all ceased publication this year.
And those are only the announced job eliminations. It is virtually impossible to estimate the number of employees who have lost their jobs as a result of budget cuts. "The cuts are across the board -- business-to-business publicatons, trade magazines, everywhere," Mr. Koller said. "This is the worst downsizing I have ever seen and I don't believe it's over."
 
Tokyo on the Hudson
 Not everyone is cutting back. Susan Meadow, who has been publishing Spotlight, a life-style magazine, in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut since 1977, began thinking about the large numbers of Japanese senior executives who live in the region with their families. As a result, Japanese Lifestyle/USA, a Japanese-language magazine for this affluent group, will make its debut on Oct. 15.
It will be put out by a team of Japanese and American editors. An editorial board made up of representatives from the Japanese Consulate and the Japanese business community will act as advisers.
"It is geared to the Japanese woman who doesn't speak English and doesn't know our life style," Ms. Meadow said. "It will tell her where to play golf, how to shop in the mall, how to give a party for Halloween. No one has ever done this before."
Ms. Meadows said her target group would have a median income of $80,000, was ready to spend money and would probably spend three to five years in the United States. She said Meadow Publications, her family-owned business, would invest "close to $1 million" to start Japanese Lifestyle/USA.
The quarterly magazine will have an initial circulation of 50,000 and a cover price of $2.95.
So far, she said, 17 advertisers have signed up, including the Coach Leatherwear Company, Steinway & Sons, Grand Hyatt, Fendi and Citibank.
 
Ignoring Straight Talk
 On the other hand, advertisers, who want us all to be happy, declined to be associated with Straight Talk, a new magazine for teen-agers. The first issue is devoted to AIDS.
"We could not find anyone to advertise in our first issue," said Marcia Theodoredis, the publisher of the magazine.
The quarterly is published by Rodale Press, publisher of health and fitness magazines like Prevention and Men's Health, in cooperation with the National Education Association, the largest teachers' union in the country. The magazine, which came out this month, will speak to teen-agers about topics like self-esteem, substance abuse and relationships.
Last year, a test issue titled "Dealing with AIDS," was sponsored by the United Auto Workers-General Motors Human Resource Center and distributed to employees with teen-age chidren. Three printings of the test issue, totaling more than a million copies, were quickly grabbed.
So many requests continued to come into the Rodale offices that the company did a fourth printing, priced the magazine at 75 cents and sent it off to anyone who called.
"We had 2,300 inquiries with no promotion," Ms. Theodoredis said.
 
A 250-Year Subscription
 Attention, magazine buffs: It's the 250th anniversary of magazine publishing in America. The industry's movers and shakers in Magazineland will gather full force tomorrow at a reception at the New York Public Library to celebrate publication of "The American Magazine," a huge coffee-table book full of illustrations. Commissioned by the Magazine Publishers of America and American Society of Magazine Editors and published by Harry N. Abrams, the handsome 240-page book was put together by Amy Janello and Brennon Jones and costs $60.
The trivia alone is a magazine junkie's dream. For instance, just who did publish the first American magazine?
No, not Benjamin Franklin. He was beaten to the punch by none other than his own printer, Andrew Bradford, who brought out his American Magazine in January 1741, just three days before publication of Franklin's General Magazine.
