HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Yankees' Stottlemyre Appears Set to Return

BYLINE: By BUSTER OLNEY 

 BODY:
Mel Stottlemyre, treated for bone-marrow cancer during the past season, is leaning toward returning to the Yankees next season, according to friends of the pitching coach.
Stottlemyre, who turns 59 next week, left the team for a stem-cell transplant Sept. 11 and did not return to his duties full time for the rest of the regular season and the postseason. Stottlemyre said last month that he was not sure if he would return for the 2001 season, but in his time away from the team, he found that he missed baseball and missed being around the team. "I think he's feeling pretty good about coming back," said one friend. 
 Club officials are sorting through possible personnel changes. Glenallen Hill, the designated hitter who slugged 10 homers in 51 at-bats, will take a physical in the next 48 hours -- primarily to check the condition of his knees -- and if the Yankees are satisfied he is healthy, they are expected to exercise a $1.5 million option on Hill for the 2001 season.
The Yankees have begun negotiations to keep the relief pitcher Jeff Nelson but are exploring possible trades for more pitching depth in the event they cannot re-sign Nelson, who asked for a four-year, $16 million deal last spring. As expected, David Cone filed for free agency yesterday, along with the utility infielder Luis Sojo. Depending on developments with the rest of the team, the Yankees may eventually offer both players low-budget contracts; Cone could be back if the team's plans for acquiring more pitching fall through.
Club officials have touched base with representatives for a number of free agents, including pitchers Mike Hampton, Denny Neagle and Kevin Appier. But their most prominent target is Mike Mussina, the All-Star pitcher, and the Yankees are expected to meet with Mussina shortly -- perhaps within the next week -- and possibly use some of their veteran players to recruit the right-handed pitcher.
Mussina has a six-year, $72 million offer in hand from the Orioles, but the Baltimore owner, Peter Angelos, has said flatly that if the Yankees offer a six-year, $90 million deal to Mussina, then he would not match that proposal. The Yankees' preference is to add a star pitcher to a rotation that already includes Roger Clemens, Andy Pettitte and Orlando Hernandez, but if Mussina opts to play elsewhere, then outfielder Manny Ramirez would come into the picture. Ramirez reportedly is seeking a deal for between $18 million and $20 million per year, and his negotiations with the Cleveland Indians seemed stalled.
Indians General Manager John Hart spoke carefully about the talks yesterday in a conference call, but added that just as Ramirez will consider all his options on Saturday -- the first day free agents will be free to negotiate with other teams -- then Cleveland would look elsewhere as well.
The general perception of Ramirez -- on his own team and around baseball -- is that he wants to stay with the Indians. Hart sounded unsure. "They've made it very clear that this is going to be an economics-driven contract," said Hart, referring to Ramirez's representatives.
Chris Chambliss was fired as the hitting coach last week, and on Monday, Manager Joe Torre spoke with Mattingly and asked him if he would be interested in being interviewed for the job. Mattingly thanked Torre but reiterated that at this point in his life, he prefers to be at home with his children.
Stottlemyre, whose positive demeanor never changed even as he was going through the first stages of cancer treatment in the first four months of the season, said in late October that he felt good. Stottlemyre adhered to the advice of his doctors, but it was apparent during the World Series that he badly missed his work. Doctors warned him against sitting amid large groups of people because of the risk of infection, and so in the early innings of World Series Games 1 and 2, Stottlemyre watched on television in Torre's office and chatted with pitchers between innings.
Some members of the Yankees' organization believed that once Stottlemyre left the team in September, then he would never return on a full-time basis. But Stottlemyre has felt great, friends say, and his intention is to come back next year. Stottlemyre said last month that doctors saw no reason why he could not return to the Yankees if he wanted.

American Headstones Tugging at Egypt's Memory

BYLINE: By SUSAN SACHS 

DATELINE: CAIRO, Nov. 7

 BODY:
Behind a high stone wall, in twin graveyards shaded by the heavy branches of gnarled ficus and eucalyptus trees, lie the missionaries and mercenaries who were the first Americans in Egypt.
Their epitaphs read like poetry. Their stories, dating back 150 years, hint of romantic folly or grand adventure. Their lonely marble tombs, hidden from the bustle of the living city, draw few visitors besides the songbirds that hide in the green canopy. 
 Still, at a time of deep ambivalence here toward the West, the overgrown cemeteries stand as quaint testimonials to a forgotten era -- a time when an American in Egypt was a welcome curiosity and the United States was seen as a disinterested bit player in the colonial intrigues to dominate the Arab world.
"I like everything that is American," an Egyptian landowner once confided to Frederic Courtland Penfield, the United States diplomatic agent and consul general to Egypt in the 1880's, a compliment that Mr. Penfield duly recorded in his turn-of-the-century memoir. "In that country, all things are magnificent and marvelous."
It would be hard to find an Egyptian these days who holds such unequivocal admiration. The United States is an imperialistic, meddlesome and overbearing force in the region, according to the popular -- and to a great extent, the official -- view. The State Department, wary in the face of a surge of anti-American feeling in recent weeks, has warned Americans in Egypt and elsewhere in the Middle East to exercise caution as they travel or go about their daily lives.
How unimaginable such worries must have been back in the Victorian Age, when hard-bitten Civil War veterans sailed to Egypt to take up arms in the Khedive Ismail's army and Midwestern evangelists settled along the Nile to convert Egyptian Coptic Christians to Protestantism.
"To us, America was a new country and a new continent, another young nation that was helping us assume our independence from these dying British and French empires," said Samir Raafat, a Cairo historian and preservationist, putting himself in the place of a 19th-century Egyptian seeing Americans for the first time.
"At the time, America was the hope -- a people that was going to help liberate us from these old empires. Today, of course, we look at America the way we looked at the British Empire back then -- as an economic and military power that is out to rule the world and subjugate us to its own ways."
Mr. Raafat, an urbane student of those early ambassadors of the New World, paused in front of a marble obelisk during a stroll through the quiet Protestant cemetery the other day. "Erastus Sparrow Purdy Pasha," he read from the inscription on the dusty white column. "Born in the state of New York in 1838. Died in Cairo the 21st of June 1881."
Mr. Purdy was the archetype of the early American expatriates on the Nile, so well-regarded in Egypt that he appears to have been awarded the supreme Ottoman title of "pasha," although it is not clear whether it came during his lifetime or posthumously.
He was one of 50 veterans of the American Civil War, both Northerners and Southerners, who came to Cairo in the early 1870's at the invitation of Khedive Ismail, then the nation's ruler, to serve in the Egyptian Army.
It was a time of energetic exploits. Ismail was finishing the construction of the Suez Canal, a project that would drive his nation into such bottomless debt that he would be forced to turn Egypt over to British colonial rule. French construction companies fanned through the country. European explorers ventured into Africa.
Before his extravagance caught up with him, Ismail briefly tried to challenge them through his American employees. Mr. Purdy, not yet a pasha, and other Civil War veterans were dispatched to explore East Africa and to lay claim to parts of it for the khedive.
But his American soldiers brought Ismail no lasting acquisitions. "It didn't work," Mr. Raafat mused, kicking at the dead leaves that cover all the graves in the cemetery. "The British were not going to allow an upstart like Egypt to control the source of the Nile."
Around the same time, American Protestant missionaries were settling in the largely Coptic Christian cities of Upper Egypt, following in the footsteps of Catholic and Orthodox missionaries from European churches who had been proselytizing for centuries.
The graves of missionaries and their families dominate the oldest part of the American cemetery. The inscriptions tell the tales: born in Brooklyn, N.Y., died in Cairo; born in Ohio, died in Cairo; born in Stony Point, N.Y., died in Cairo.
Finally, at the end of a row of simple headstones just past a towering mango tree, sits a shadowed marble crypt carved in the shape of a scroll. The Rev. Andrew Watson, place of birth in the United States unknown, lies beneath it. Born in 1834. Died in Cairo in 1916. "For 55 years," his tombstone says, "a missionary of the Cross in the Valley of the Nile."
The American missionaries are now remembered, if at all, for the schools they built, which were considered at the time to be beacons of progressive thinking and openness, said Mr. Raafat. Foreigners are no longer permitted to try to convert Egyptians, and these days American aid to Egypt's schools is regularly criticized in the newspapers as improper "American Zionist influence."
"Back then, though, a lot of people found this American evangelical system as a way out of the dogma of their own churches," said Mr. Raafat. "American education was more liberal. It was co-educational. It was new and modern."
By the end of the century, Egypt and its tourist sites became a favored destination for wealthy Americans. In the decades that followed, transportation improved enough so that American families could bring back the bodies of their dead for burial at home.
A few contemporary graves dot the cemeteries. A group of Americans, inspired by Mr. Raafat's research, this week rededicated the tomb of Purdy Pasha, but the caretakers of the cemeteries, who are illiterate and cannot read either the English or Arabic inscriptions, know as little about the new arrivals as they do about the old.
"They bury their dead," said Soliman Abdallah Moawad, who tends the plots in the Protestant cemetery, "and never come back."

HEADLINE: Chief U.S. Mediator in Mideast Plans to Leave in January

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 7

 BODY:
On the eve of what may be the last attempt by the Clinton White House to revive peace talks between the Israelis and Palestinians, Dennis B. Ross, the leading American mediator for more than a decade, announced that he would leave at the end of this administration.
The plan for the departure of Mr. Ross, who has served under Presidents Reagan, Bush and Clinton, did not come as a complete surprise. But because of his background with Republican administrations, there had been speculation that he might stay on if Gov. George W. Bush became president. 
 In keeping with his low-key style, Mr. Ross, 51, did not make a formal announcement but mentioned his plans in answer to a question on Monday night at the Los Angeles World Affairs Council. And in keeping with his experience as a negotiator, Mr. Ross spoke of intent rather than making a definitive statement: "I intend to work through the end of this administration, but I don't intend to stay for the next one."
Mr. Ross said the stress on his family from 12 years of travel was the main reason for his decision.
Colleagues of Mr. Ross said, however, that it was fairly clear that after the recent collapse of the Clinton administration's peace efforts, a new president would seek new faces for Middle East diplomacy.
Mr. Ross has been at President Clinton's side at the two major Middle East diplomatic drives this year: the meeting in Geneva with President Hafez el-Assad of Syria, and the Camp David summit meeting in July. Neither produced the results Washington had hoped for, though the Camp David talks pushed consideration of the most tendentious issues further along than expected.
After those two setbacks and the violence of the last five weeks, Mr. Ross and his colleagues largely concluded that the comprehensive peace settlement they were seeking this year would take much longer.
Mr. Ross, who began in government in the Reagan administration as an expert on the Soviet Union, came into his own as a Middle East expert on the National Security Council from 1986 to 1988. He then served Secretary of State James A. Baker III as a close aide, working with him to convene the landmark talks in Madrid in 1991 that brought Israelis and Palestinians together.
President Bush recommended to Mr. Clinton that he keep Mr. Ross, and so Mr. Ross glided seamlessly to become the Clinton administration's special Middle East co-ordinator. He has won praise as indefatigible, though paying, perhaps, too much attention to the gritty details.
"Dennis is a great public servant who did more to push the process along than anyone could imagine," said Leslie H. Gelb, president of the Council on Foreign Relations. "But we got swept up by the negotiations, with not enough attention paid to the substructure on the ground, and what was in people's lives and people's heads."
More could have been done, for example, to reduce bitterness by encouraging Israeli-Palestinian-Jordanian economic projects, he said.
Mr. Ross will be closely involved in the last-chance Middle East effort by Mr. Clinton, which begins on Thursday when the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat is due at the White House. Prime Minister Ehud Barak follows on Sunday.
Mr. Clinton will be in a listening mode, aides insisted, trying to figure out whether the two leaders are interested in pursuing any kind of peace settlement -- major or minor -- before the end of his presidency.
Administration officials said the major mystery is Mr. Arafat, who has yet to make clear whether he is interested in negotiating even a limited deal while Mr. Clinton remains in the White House. In contrast, Mr. Barak is expected to argue that he joined forces with the rigorously Orthodox Shas Party in Israel -- rather than to continue pursuing a national unity government -- in order to try to negotiate, the officials said.

HEADLINE: Attack on Clean Air Act Falters in High Court Arguments

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 7

 BODY:
The most potent legal attack on the Clean Air Act in the statute's 30-year history, startlingly successful in a federal appeals court here 18 months ago, floundered visibly at the Supreme Court today.
In an intense two-hour argument, justice after justice expressed the view that whatever the burdens and uncertainties of life under the sweeping statute as it is currently interpreted, alternative approaches would not solve those problems and might well create new ones, for other federal regulatory laws as well as for the Clean Air Act. 
 The case brought two closely intertwined issues before the court. One was whether the law, as interpreted by the Environmental Protection Agency, provides so little guidance on how to set permissible levels of pollutants as to amount to an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the executive branch.
This question reached the Supreme Court as an appeal by the Clinton administration from a ruling in May 1999 by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
The appeals court invoked the long-discredited "nondelegation doctrine," which the Supreme Court had last used to strike down a federal statute in 1935, to invalidate standards for ozone and small airborne particles that the Environmental Protection Agency had issued in 1997.
The second issue, brought before the justices by the coalition of industry groups that had been successful at the appeals court, offered a way to preserve that victory while at the same time avoiding the constitutional earthquake that could result from striking down the clean air standards -- and, by implication, many other federal regulations -- as reflecting impermissible delegations of Congressional authority.
The industry group is arguing that a new interpretation of the Clean Air Act to require the agency to weigh the costs and benefits of each regulation would provide the statutory guidance the appeals court found lacking, thus avoiding the nondelegation analysis that was unlikely to attract a Supreme Court majority in any event.
"We're talking about a world of limited resources," Edward W. Warren, representing the American Trucking Associations, the United States Chamber of Commerce and other industry groups told the court. Without a cost-benefit requirement, he said, "the agency has the freedom to take us all the way down to de-industrialization, and that can't be."
The approach was creative, but the allies that Mr. Warren needed on the bench did not materialize. "I don't see how it helps your delegation problem to add 'the economy' to the ineffable pot of things the administrator is supposed to consider," Justice Antonin Scalia said. He added: "If you're going to stop a cough, is $1,000 too much? What does it cost to stop a cough -- $2,000? $3,000? It's just as indeterminate."
Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who before he joined the court had written approvingly of using cost-benefit analysis in administrative law, echoed Justice Scalia.
"I could ask the same question about picking out trucking routes or airline routes," he said, adding, "There's no scale in heaven, or anything other than judgment." Later in the argument, he told Mr. Warren that cost-benefit analysis was a "formal discipline" and added, "I don't see how you import cost-benefit analysis into the statute."
Mr. Warren replied that he was not suggesting "econometrics" but rather "a common sense way" of evaluating "competing considerations in a systematic way."
"That's all we're talking about," he said.
"It seems to me you're creating another morass," Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said at one point. What exactly did he want the agency to do, she asked.
"What every other health, safety, and environmental agency does," Mr. Warren replied, adding, "The norm is to do the kind of weighing and balancing I'm talking about."
Complicating this already complicated case is the fact that the District of Columbia Circuit, in a 1980 decision known as Lead Industries, interpreted the Clean Air Act to bar the kind of cost-benefit analysis for which Mr. Warren was arguing.
Although the Supreme Court declined at the time to review that decision, it remains binding as precedent on the appeals court, which is why the appeals court used nondelegation rather than statutory analysis to reach the result of invalidating the 1997 standards.
The industry coalition is asking the justices to disavow the appeals court's 1980 ruling. It derives its statutory argument from the language of the Clean Air Act, which requires the Environmental Protection Agency to set air quality standards at levels "requisite to protect the public health." Mr. Warren told the court that public health itself is a discipline that incorporates a cost-benefit analysis as it considers how to achieve the greatest public good with limited resources.
However, the justices appeared quite resistant to placing on "public health," which is not defined in the statute, the full weight of the industry's argument.
"In one sentence, what is your proposed standard?" Justice Sandra Day O'Connor asked Mr. Warren. She said, "I've listened to a lot of vague language from you, and I don't understand what you're saying."
Mr. Warren replied, "Public health contemplates the consideration of competing factors, including costs, in seeking to decrease population sickness and increase longevity." He added, "I don't know how you can live in a world of limited resources" without weighing costs and benefits.
"Well, we have lived with it for 20 years," Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist commented dryly.
The justices were attentive to Solicitor General Seth P. Waxman's two-pronged presentation. He argued that the Clean Air Act, properly interpreted, did not use cost considerations in the standard-setting process but that the statute gave enough guidance to the Environmental Protection Agency in other ways to avoid a delegation problem. The solicitor general relied on the same statutory phrase as Mr. Warren, "requisite to protect the public health," but to very different purposes.
"Requisite means sufficient but not more than necessary," he said. The heart of his argument was that in the Clean Air Act, Congress established a two-part regulatory process. In the standard-setting phase, he said, the agency was to use the latest scientific knowledge to protect the public from the effect of air pollution.
"Congress made a rational decision as to the most serious problem facing America in 1970, air pollution," Mr. Waxman said. He said Congress created an "expert agency" and gave it the mission: "Just tell us, based on your best judgment, what level would be safe to set for the whole country."
Consideration of costs and technical feasibility are supposed to come in at the second phase, he said, that of deciding how and on what schedule the standards should be put into effect. In the ensuing 30 years, Mr. Waxman said, Congress has "adjusted implementation in response to problems of cost and feasibility" but has never changed its instructions to the agency on how to set the actual standards.
If the agency prevails in Browner v. American Trucking Associations, No. 99-1257, that will not be the end of the case, or the end of judicial review for the new ozone and particle standards. The standards would still be open to challenge before the appeals court under the Administrative Procedure Act, a law that applies to nearly all federal regulations and that authorizes federal judges to invalidate agency action as "arbitrary and capricious."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 ELECTIONS: THE POLLING;
An Electorate Largely Split Reflects a Race So Very Tight

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER and JANET ELDER 

 BODY:
In the end, the portrait of the voters showed what a brutally competitive race it had been.
Vice President Al Gore carried the votes of women, Gov. George W. Bush carried the votes of men. 
 Mr. Bush edged Mr. Gore among white voters, while Mr. Gore carried roughly 9 of 10 black voters and nearly two-thirds of Hispanics.
Mr. Bush ran better among parents and gun owners. Mr. Gore ran better among gays and self-described moderates. And the two candidates split the votes of Catholics and people over 60, essentially fighting each other to a standstill among those segments of the electorate, according to interviews with voters leaving the polls around the country yesterday.
In some ways, it was a polarizing outcome, with few signs of the crossover voting that once framed American elections. Each of the two men won about 9 of 10 votes in his own party, and they split the independent vote.
Yet many voters ended the election campaign as many began: with lingering doubts about the candidates. Four in ten said they had cast their votes with reservations. And about half said they would be concerned, or even downright scared, at the prospect of a President Bush or a President Gore.
Voters were generally in a contented mood as they cast their ballots, but there were also signs of Clinton fatigue: in their negative judgment of the president's character and in the priority many put on straight talk and honesty.
When given a choice, a plurality of voters -- about a fourth -- rated honesty a more important consideration than experience or an understanding of the complex issues of the day, according to the voter polls. And those people tended to vote for Mr. Bush, who also had an edge among those who considered strong leadership most important.
But Mr. Gore had a big edge among those who considered experience and the mastery of complex issues most important. Mr. Bush was never able to shed the perception that he was not as well prepared as Mr. Gore for the responsibilities of the presidency, although he did manage to get 1 in 10 of the votes of people who judged him ill equipped.
The polls also suggested a profoundly ambivalent attitude toward the era just ending. People became more contented during the Clinton years: two-thirds of respondents said the country, enjoying a record economic boom, was going in the right direction over all. But 6 in 10 said it was on the wrong track morally.
Mr. Clinton's job approval rating stayed fairly high, but his personal unfavorability rating was equally high in the surveys, taken as voters were leaving polling places in 300 precincts across the country. Most voters said they would remember Mr. Clinton more for the scandals of his presidency than for any leadership he provided. Yet most also said a president's ability to manage the government was more important than his ability to provide moral leadership.
The ambivalence about the status quo may help explain the race's closeness, which was sustained in the voter surveys throughout the afternoon and early evening. Though Mr. Bush had an edge for several days leading up to the election, the later deciders largely voted for Mr. Gore, a development that helped explain the final surge the Democrats enjoyed in many polls.
But there were signs in the surveys taken at polling places yesterday that Mr. Bush had succeeded in changing the public agenda, to his advantage. When the campaign started, voters showed little enthusiasm for tax cuts. By the end, they put tax cuts near the top of their priorities for the budget surplus -- ahead of debt reduction, a goal that Democrats repeatedly warned could be undone by Mr. Bush's promise of a tax cut worth $1.3 trillion over 10 years.
At the same time, the surveys suggested that Mr. Gore had regained the edge on economic stewardship, and was running well on issues that Mr. Bush had tried to make his own, notably education and Social Security.
Mr. Bush's argument that government's role in public life needed to be reduced clearly resonated. Much of his campaign revolved around his proposals to inject private-market forces into entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare. That philosophy of restricting government was shared yesterday, at least in the abstract, by many voters; just over half said they agreed that government should be doing less.
Another sign that at least some voters were in a mood for a less activist government: when asked to choose between protecting the environment and fostering economic growth, people were evenly divided between the two.
When asked what the new president should do first, the number who said he should cut taxes was equal to the number who said he should improve education.
Voters often express a preference for the checks and balances of divided government, with one party controlling the White House and the other Capitol Hill. But they indicated yesterday that they were ready for a change. Perhaps in reaction to the brutal partisan warfare that characterized the last six years of Mr. Clinton's administration, capped by his impeachment, voters said they thought it would be better if the president and the Congressional majority were from the same party.
The polls yesterday found Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore splitting the support of the baby boomers and those who came of age during the Reagan years.
The polls also suggested that Mr. Bush's efforts to ease the fears of less conservative voters about his opposition to legalized abortion had paid off. Despite an intense campaign by abortion rights and family planning groups, which maintained that he was a staunch conservative whose court appointments could jeopardize a constitutional right to abortion, more than a quarter of the people who support legal abortion voted for him anyway.
Union households, on the other hand, stuck with Mr. Gore. Organized labor had mounted an immense get-out-the-vote campaign, and the surveys suggested that Mr. Gore was getting well over half the union vote.
Mr. Bush was running well among conservative Christians, and among voters who once considered themselves supporters of Senator John McCain, his main rival in the Republican primaries. More than half of McCain backers gave their support to Mr. Bush, as against more than a third to Mr. Gore.
The voter surveys were conducted by the Voter News Service, a consortium of the television networks and The Associated Press.
 
How the Polls Were Conducted
The Election Day polls were based on questionnaires completed by voters as they left voting stations across the United States and also in 15 individual states.
The polls were conducted by Voter News Service, a consortium formed by ABC News, CBS News, CNN, Fox News, NBC News and The Associated Press.
The national exit poll was based on questionnaires completed by 12,361 voters in 300 randomly selected precincts across the country. Individual state surveys of voters leaving the polls included 831 to 1,943 voters in 20 to 50 precincts within each of 14 states. In Oregon, where voting is done by mail, no precincts were open on Election Day; there the poll was done by telephone with 638 voters.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results from such polls should differ by only a few percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking to interview all voters who turned out in each constituency yesterday.
Results based on smaller subgroups have a larger potential sampling error. In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of voter opinion on Election Day, like the reluctance of some voters to take the time to fill out questionnaires, may introduce other sources of error into the poll.
Professor Helmut Norpoth of the State University of New York at Stony Brook assisted The Times in its polling analysis.

MICHIGAN
All year, Michigan voters kept the nation guessing, and the suspense continued late last night, as the presidential race and the fourth-most-expensive United States Senate campaign remained too tight to call. 
 Voters had their hands full keeping track of the mudslinging between Senator Spencer Abraham, a freshman Republican, and his scrappy opponent, Representative Debby Stabenow. They continually traded the lead in the polls. Mr. Abraham focused on his record, including blocking lower prison sentences for crack dealers. Ms. Stabenow, whose Congressional raise paid for whistles for Detroit schoolgirls after a series of attacks, ran as an education ally.
Of Michigan's 16 Congressional races, the most contentious was in the Eighth District, the seat vacated by Ms. Stabenow. There, Democrat Dianne Byrum, a hardware store owner turned state representative, was running neck and neck with Republican Mike Rogers. Democrats were trying hard to hold on to that seat to help guarantee them a a House majority.
Voters blocked a school voucher initiative.

Voters Weigh Initiatives On Spending For Transit

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
New Yorkers last night rejected what would have been the largest bond issue in state history, a plan intended to jump-start work on a Second Avenue subway but one which critics argued would have added to the state's already perilously high debt load.
On a similar transportation question on the New Jersey ballot, voters overwhelmingly approved a measure that will free up money for roads, bridges and transit by redirecting existing taxes to a dedicated transportation fund. 
 New York voters have turned down bond acts more often than they have approved them, with a traditional split between upstate voters, who generally dislike borrowing measures, and those in the New York City metropolitan region, who have tended to favor them.
That scenario played out again yesterday. Upstate voters rejected the measure more than two to one, while New York City voters supported it in equal measures. It won narrow approval among voters in the city's suburbs.
The measure was arguably the least visible bond act New York voters have ever been asked to approve. Many top elected officials -- including those whose conceived of the bonds as a compromise to pay for expensive transportation projects -- did not campaign vigorously for it. And even its ardent supporters had reservations about the amount of debt it would incur.
The two transportation measures -- each of which totaled about $3.8 billion -- were clear signals of the deepening struggle to find ways to pay for the vastly expensive upkeep of aging transportation networks that are integral to both state's economies.
In New Jersey, the measure dedicates hundreds of millions of dollars a year in sales taxes and taxes on wholesale petroleum products to state transportation projects over four years. Currently, those taxes are unrestricted and can be tapped for any program, depending on budget needs.
By dedicating the taxes to the transportation fund and providing it with a reliable revenue stream, the state can leverage even more money because it will have the ability to issue more transportation bonds.
In New York, the measure would have allowed the state to raise $3.8 billion through general obligation bonds with $1.6 billion going to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the city's mass transit systems. The measure would have allocated an additional $1.9 billion for the state highway program, with the remaining $300 million for upstate transit systems, bridges and for other purposes.
The bonds were seen as especially crucial for the M.T.A., which needs a reliable chunk of money for a $17.1 billion, five-year capital plan. The plan has been widely criticized because it relies on expensive refinancing of old debt and requires the agency to issue bonds for new debt on top of that.
The capital plan calls for upgrading the region's rail and bus system, including new subway cars and buses, rehabilitation of subway stations, the first work in a generation on a Second Avenue line and the start of work on a connection between the Long Island Rail Road and Grand Central Terminal.
Supporters characterized the bond act as the only realistic way to pay for badly needed transportation improvements. Last night, they criticized Gov. George E. Pataki, who controls the M.T.A., as not supporting the measure aggressively enough.
"The defeat of the bond is a defeat for Governor Pataki and his ambitious plans to improve transportation in New York," said Gene Russianoff, staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, a transit watchdog group.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 ELECTIONS: NEW JERSEY -- THE HOUSE;
New Jersey Voters Return Incumbents to Congress in Several Closely Watched Races

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

 BODY:
After a night of shifting leads, one of the most closely watched House races in New Jersey was too close to call, as former Representative Dick Zimmer was in a virtual tie with Representative Rush Holt, a first-term incumbent in the 12th District. Michael Ferguson, a political newcomer, won the open seat in the 7th.
It appeared that, as many Democrats had feared, Ralph Nader and the Green Party siphoned votes away from Mr. Holt. Mr. Holt was 56 votes ahead, but neither he nor Mr. Zimmer had conceded. Carl Mayer, a perennial political hopeful running as a Green this year, had nearly 5,500 that the Democrats are sure to say would otherwise have been theirs. 
 Mr. Zimmer did not claim victory or defeat when he joined a small band of supporters who waited through the evening. He said there had been some miscounts and other errors that made the race still too uncertain.
"I won't be declaring victory -- it is too close," Mr. Zimmer said at 12:30 a.m. "I have had a conversation with Rush Holt and we want to make sure of the numbers. I think we pulled it out, but we want to be sure."
Mr. Ferguson had an easier time of it, leading Maryanne Ms. Connelly throughout the night and claiming victory shortly after Ms. Connelly conceded at 12:30 a.m.
"Tonight is our night!" Mr. Ferguson shouted with glee to his cheering supporters.
Standing with his wife, Maureen, and two children, he spoke of his great-grandparents arriving in the country 100 years ago, and added: "They knew the streets were not paved with gold, but that they were full of opportunity. They would be proud, and perhaps surprised, to see their great-grandson standing here tonight."
The vote count in the 12th was Mr. Zimmer with 140,620, Mr. Holt with 139,889 and Mr. Mayer with 5,490.
The two races were winnable by both sides in the battle for control of the new House of Representatives, and the two parties' national organizations spent heavily in the contests. In the end, it appeared that Mr. Ferguson's sharp move from the conservative positions he had once espoused was enough to protect him against accusations of carpetbagging and election finance fraud from Ms. Connelly.
Ms. Connelly conceded at midnight. Her campaign manager, Sujata Tejwani, said Mr. Ferguson's personal fortune, much of it coming from his parents in a disputed gift, had overwhelmed the Democrat.
"We were out-communicated by quite a bit," Ms. Tejwani said.
While state returns showed a convincing majority of New Jersey voters choosing Vice President Al Gore for president, it was clear that farther down the ballot they were often splitting their votes, returning veteran Republicans and Democrats alike to Congress.
All the state's other incumbent congressmen were easily re-elected. In the Third District, Representative H. James Saxton easily turned aside a well-financed challenge from Susan Bass Levin, the mayor of Cherry Hill. Besides Mr. Saxton, the Republicans Frank A. LoBiondo, Chris Smith, Rodney Frelinghuysen and Marge Roukema were all returned.
Similarly, the Democrats Robert E. Andrews, Frank Pallone Jr., William J. Pascrell Jr. and Steven R. Rothman won re-election.
In the 12th, Mr. Zimmer, who had held the seat until 1996, evidently profited from being taken for the incumbent, his staff believed.
Ms. Connelly went to her campaign celebration at 11:30 last night and told her supporters that they were going to have to wait a little longer to learn the outcome. "Anyway," she said, "have we ever done anything the easy way?"
Ms. Connelly, 55, made her second try at winning the seat. Mr. Ferguson emphasized his youthfulness and his family-oriented platform of education issues, while Ms. Connelly stressed her roots in the community and her experience in local affairs.
The Republicans have felt that the 12th District should be theirs, because demographics and the district's history favor Republicans. But Mr. Holt, 52, had worked the district assiduously in his two years in Washington, stressing his concerns for quality-of-life issues like the environment, and his interest, as a physicist, in strengthening the district's big technical and research installations.
Even before the tickets were decided in the June primary, the fights for the 7th and the 12th Congressional Districts were under political microscopes in Trenton and in Washington, as politicians looked for clues to whether New Jersey Democrats would be able to break out of their urban and inner-suburb base and run strong in the state's political heartland, its suburbs.
Both districts fit the statewide pattern of moderate suburban Republicanism, the 12th even more than the 7th. The 12th stretches from the Delaware River in Hunterdon County nearly to the Atlantic, and its voters range from the wealthy, conservative horse country residents of Somerset, through the liberals in Princeton to the increasingly tax-phobic strivers in the mini-mansions of Ocean County to the east.
The Republicans have dominated the district far more than might be suggested by their lead in voter registration, 20 percent to 19 percent for the Democrats. Most 12th District voters supported Chuck Haytaian for the United States Senate in 1994 over Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, the incumbent, even though Mr. Haytaian, who was then Assembly speaker, had no strong ties to the area. The district voted for President Clinton in 1996, but went overwhelmingly Republican in state legislative races the next year.
Moreover, many Republicans believe the 12th District seat should have remained theirs in 1998 but for the conservative views of Michael Pappas, who replaced Mr. Zimmer, 56, when Mr. Zimmer lost his bid for the United States Senate in 1996. Mr. Pappas's views, including his opposition to abortion and gun control, were too far to the right for the voters there.
Mr. Holt had since maintained that his brand of Democratic politics, stressing fiscal restraint, education, economic stability, health care and women's issues, would control the middle ground in suburban New Jersey and leave no place for the Republicans.
But in a race that was often acrimonious -- a local cable outlet refused to carry one of Mr. Holt's attacks on Mr. Zimmer on the ground that it was untrue -- Mr. Zimmer worked the area well to the left of the easy target Mr. Pappas had presented. He softened the tax-cutting rhetoric that worked so well for him during the state's tax revolt 10 years ago, and focused on his record of fighting wasteful spending and balancing the federal budget and his support for higher standards in schools and protecting the environment.
And after Mr. Zimmer's years in Congress, his name was arguably better known than Mr. Holt's.
If the 12th is a Republican district that sometimes leans Democratic, the 7th District is one where the Democrats have more registered voters, 24 percent to 19 percent for the Republicans, but which nevertheless has voted strongly Republican in state legislative races for several elections.
Ms. Connelly ran a surprisingly strong race against Mr. Franks two years ago, and in June, after overcoming the party favorite in the primary, she was able to count on fairly high voter recognition.
Mr. Ferguson moved to the district only last winter after Mr. Franks announced he would be giving up the seat.
A retired AT&T nutritionist and human relations executive, Ms. Connelly made much of Mr. Ferguson's newcomer status in her campaign. Mr. Ferguson ran and lost in the adjoining Sixth District two years ago. He has never held elected office.

HEADLINE: Hillary Clinton's Victory

 BODY:
Completing an extraordinary metamorphosis from political neophyte to polished candidate, Hillary Rodham Clinton -- the first first lady ever to run for office -- defeated Representative Rick Lazio yesterday in a closely fought race for Daniel Patrick Moynihan's Senate seat from New York. If Mrs. Clinton brings to the Senate the intelligence and energy that she brought to her campaign, she should make a worthy successor to the estimable Mr. Moynihan, who is retiring after 24 honorable years of service.
Meanwhile Jon Corzine, a Democrat and a multimillionaire who spent nearly $60 million of his own money, will succeed Frank Lautenberg as senator from New Jersey. Mr. Corzine now holds the dubious distinction of having contributed the most personal money of all time to win a Senate seat. 
 Mrs. Clinton's victory is the more remarkable. She arrived in New York as an ambitious amateur, bruised by her husband's personal lapses, branded as a carpetbagger and burdened by the ethical legacies of her Arkansas and White House years. She was also largely untutored in New York's economic and social needs. But there was never any doubt about her intellectual capacity. She proved a quick study and, in time, a sure-footed campaigner.
It is true that she profited greatly from Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's decision to retire from the race for medical reasons, as well as Representative Lazio's late start, which put him at a disadvantage financially and in terms of name recognition. But Mr. Lazio, a Republican moderate who built a creditable record in the House on a variety of issues, proved a vigorous opponent. He wasted too much energy in a fruitless effort to portray himself as the only true New Yorker in the race, and discovered to his dismay that the anti-Hillary sentiment nationwide produced more money than votes. He never really found his voice, but he pushed Mrs. Clinton on the issues and undoubtedly furthered her political education in the process.
The only regrettable aspect of the campaign was that it lapsed near the end into name-calling, with Mr. Lazio trying to draw connections between Mrs. Clinton's fund-raising and terrorists who bombed the U.S.S. Cole, while Mrs. Clinton launched a harsh last-minute commercial that accused Mr. Lazio of trying to gut funding for breast cancer treatment. The ad, meant for the suburbs where Mrs. Clinton was not doing as well as expected, distorted Mr. Lazio's record on breast cancer.
Too much money dominated both the New York and New Jersey races, but the excesses in New Jersey were unprecedented. Mr. Corzine used his considerable fortune to swamp his underfinanced opponent, Representative Bob Franks, a hard-working but colorless moderate, with ads, donations to churches and political organizations and, more recently, "walking-around money" of $50 to $75 to hordes of political workers hired for the day. This page opposed Mr. Corzine for just that reason, but expects him to deliver on his promises to vote progressively and to work for campaign finance reform.
In addition to her distinction as the first first lady to run for office, Mrs. Clinton is also New York's first woman senator. For years she has been a vigorous proponent of reform in health, education and child care, but always as an unelected advocate. Her election gives her, for the first time, a legislative arena in which to champion her causes.

HEADLINE: Election Day Suspense

 BODY:
After a vote count that stretched into this morning, Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore were locked in one of the most closely contested presidential contests in decades. Mr. Bush's highly provisional lead arose in dramatic fashion, when Florida tilted back toward Mr. Bush's column after the networks had predicted that it would go to Mr. Gore. Then, after 3 a.m., Mr. Gore closed within a few hundred votes in Florida.
As these events attested, it was an election that overturned cliches about voter apathy. But it also reflected tension within the American public on whether to choose Mr. Bush's personality and promises of leadership over Mr. Gore's experience and knowledge of government. 
 The closeness of this first race of the new century recalled two historic elections of the 1960's, both involving Richard Nixon. He suffered a razor-thin loss to John F. Kennedy in 1960, and then scored a narrow victory over Hubert Humphrey in 1968. In 1960, in a contest decided by 113,000 votes, or one-half vote per precinct, Nixon did not concede victory to Kennedy until noon on the day after the election. In 1968, the television networks did not declare him the winner until 8 a.m. the next day.
The struggle for control of Congress in yesterday's election was also close. The Republicans have maintained an increasingly fragile majority for the past six years, and absentee ballots may play an important role in these elections. In California, for example, a state that may end up deciding the balance of power in the House of Representatives, voters requested a record 3.2 million absentee ballots, of which at least 2.7 million are expected to be returned. It may take until Friday to count them.
While the vote count remained uncertain far into the evening, the money count was easier to estimate. This campaign was far and away the most expensive in history. In the last few days alone, nearly $100 million has been spent in a widespread effort to propel the party faithful to the polls and change the minds of the undecided voters. As if the voters had not already heard enough from the candidates themselves, the two parties and their allies bombarded voters with millions of phone calls, tons of pamphlets, e-mail messages and door-to-door visits from thousands of volunteers. All told, this campaign will soak up an unprecedented $500 million in so-called soft money, and if Senator John McCain's recent prediction is right, about $1 billion will have been spent on television advertising.
Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush campaigned with extraordinary intensity and discipline. They offered a clearly delineated choice between personal appeal and suspicion of big government on Mr. Bush's side and experience and promises of aggressive attacks on social problems on Mr. Gore's. Their clash revealed a country almost evenly divided as to its preferences. Both aimed at the center of the political spectrum, but with significant differences. Mr. Bush spoke of privatizing part of Social Security, which may well have cost him support in Florida. Mr. Gore attacked Mr. Bush's tax cut, which hurt the vice president in the Sun Belt but attracted union voters in key battleground states like Michigan, Illinois and Pennsylvania.
Union workers and other mid-to-low-income voters were the keys to Mr. Gore's greater success in those three crucial states. Mr. Bush was clearly more popular in the South and West, where he piled up electoral numbers from a long list of smaller states. As the count tightened, there was one cheerful note for those weary of the impact of big-dollar politics. In the closest states the outcomes seemed to depend on such old-fashioned qualities as turnout, party loyalty and economic interests.
As daylight neared, the contest was so close that the networks backed off their projections and the candidates delayed plans for a concession statement on Mr. Gore's part and a victory statement from Mr. Bush. That brought to a prudent point a political suspense story that may not be resolved until recounts take place in Florida and other closely fought states.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 ELECTIONS: NEWS ANALYSIS;
Voters Remain Divided, to the Very End

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

 BODY:
After all the dollars and debates, after all the ads and adjectives, the country still found it immensely difficult to make up its mind.
And so the race for the presidency, which had seemed to teeter on a knife edge for the last few weeks of the campaign, teetered a bit more as the polls closed across the country. 
 The lead in the popular vote switched back and forth throughout the night, with Gov. George W. Bush holding a narrow lead over Vice President Al Gore as the count went into its final hours. The all-important battle for supremacy in the Electoral Ccollege came down to Florida, and early this morning, Gov. Jeb Bush seemed to have delivered a hair's-breadth victory to his brother in that fast-growing state, putting him over the top.
But Mr. Bush's margin dwindled and dwindled until only a handful of votes separated the two candidates, throwing the picture into confusion.
No overarching national themes emerged from the voting, but a few things were clear as the last ballots were tabulated, including these:
*Neither of the candidates, for all their exertions, ever closed his deal with the American public. Each candidate won overwhelming majorities among voters in their own parties, but independent voters -- the crucial quarter of the electorate that decides so many elections -- split evenly.
*In the final stages of the race, Mr. Bush faded. Among those who made up their minds in the last week, the surveys showed, slightly more than half went to Mr. Gore; among those who decided earlier, a bare majority ended up favoring Mr. Bush.
*Mr. Bush, who announced early on that he was a compassionate conservative, did a good job of rubbing the rough edges off his ideology, a better job than his rival. Voters were more likely to see Mr. Gore's positions as too liberal than to see Mr. Bush's views as too far to the right.
*To a degree difficult to quantify, President Clinton appeared to have been a drag on Mr. Gore's candidacy. Fully 60 percent of the voters interviewed from coast to coast, a startling figure, said they disliked Mr. Clinton as a person, whatever they thought of his policies. They said they will remember the president more for the scandals that plagued him than for anything else, and some of that seemed to brush off on Mr. Gore, whom voters found less honest and trustworthy than Mr. Bush.
Almost one voter in five said their vote had been cast to register opposition to Mr. Clinton.
Mr. Bush gained valuable support from the pivotal border states, running a strong campaign in Missouri, Kentucky and West Virginia. Mr. Gore put on a powerful showing in the hard-fought Great Lakes States.
Suburbanites, so avidly pursued by both nominees, split 50-50. The suburbs cast well over 40 percent of the total vote in yesterday's election.
Without the backing of labor Mr. Gore would have been in deep trouble. Mr. Bush took 60 percent of the vote in nonunion households nationwide. On the other hand, Mr. Bush was heavily dependent on the white religious right, gaining the votes of three of four people who so identified themselves.
A number of important questions remained unanswered last night, quite apart from the victor's identity.
*With neither nominee within reach of a big popular majority, and the polls suggesting a close electoral contest as well, how would the winner lead? As John F. Kennedy showed after winning in a squeaker in 1960, leaders can lead whatever their majorities, but it is hard for those who win narrowly to push broad legislative programs. Many Kennedy administration ideas came to fruition only after Lyndon B. Johnson's landslide victory in 1964.
*Is American politics entering a nonideological or an anti-ideological phase? Only six years ago, the Republicans swept into control of the House on a radical right-wing program. But they were able to enact relatively little of it, and in this election, Congressional and presidential candidates alike did their best to skitter toward the center.
*What does the country want? The candidates enunciated different views of government, with Mr. Gore espousing a more activist philosophy. When voters were asked which candidate shared their view of government, about a third said Mr. Gore, about a third said Mr. Bush, and the rest said both or neither. Yet in response to other questions, as they left the polls, voters said that they wanted less government and that they preferred economic growth to protecting the environment, another small-government view.
Mr. Bush received the votes of most people who disliked Mr. Clinton, who made their decisions on the basis of personality and who wanted across-the-board tax cuts. No surprises there. Mr. Gore won his backing among those who put the greatest emphasis on experience, grasp of the issues, targeted tax cuts and promises of health care reform. Mr. Bush had hoped that his promise of a radical overhaul of Medicare would prove popular.
Signs of confusion flowed through the voters' responses. In the surveys, almost two-thirds of the respondents said the country was on the right track as opposed to headed in the wrong direction. But in moral terms, close to 60 percent said the country was on the wrong track.
The political map and political convention were knocked askew by the results. Mr. Bush won in Florida, where his brother is governor, and Mr. Gore lost Mr. Clinton's home state, Arkansas, but his own, Tennessee. In Tennessee two-thirds of those polled said it made no difference in their voting decision that Mr. Gore was from their state.
No president has been elected without carrying his home state since Woodrow Wilson, a former governor of New Jersey, lost that state in the 1916 election.
Changing patterns of opinion formation were reflected in the survey. More than 60 percent of those questioned said they used the Internet on a regular basis, and almost 30 percent said they sought political information when they did so.
A slim majority of those who said they used the Internet cast their votes for Mr. Bush.
One big winner was the political polling trade. For weeks, as surveys disagreed with one another and showed large swings in some states, their methodology was questioned. But most of the final surveys, completed in many cases Sunday and Monday, came remarkably close to the actual votes, state by state.
The final CBS News survey, released on Election Day morning, showed Mr. Gore with a lead of one percentage point in the popular vote.

HEADLINE: Just Beyond Paris, a Bountiful Wilderness

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES 

DATELINE: ROMORANTIN-LANTHENAY, France

 BODY:
IT is in the central market at Orleans that you get the first, tantalizing whiff of the Sologne. Amid the stalls selling marble-white pyramids of goat cheese, enormous pumpkin slices and fresh vegetables from all over the Loire Valley, the more primitive foods of the hunter-gatherer can be seen. There are robust pheasants, looking asleep rather than dead, their rust-colored feathers fluttering when a passing shopper stirs up a breeze. Up and down the market, butchers slice fat slabs of boar terrine and throw furry hares and rabbits on their scales. Wicker baskets overflow with mushrooms: preposterously large cepes, ocher girolles, chubby pieds de mouton (hedgehog mushrooms) and jet-black trompettes de la mort, or black chanterelles.
Autumn is in full swing, and the forests of the Sologne are alive. You see it in the markets, in the catering shops and in the restaurants all over this compact, diamond-shaped region that begins just below Orleans and runs south to the Cher River. It's a peculiar French backwater, a kind of wooded island, dotted with thousands of ponds, that has little in common with the sunny, tourist-pleasing Loire Valley of rolling farmland, Rapunzel castles and choice vineyards. 
 Until the 19th century, it was a desperately poor region of swamps and wasteland. Napoleon III drained the swamps and planted pine forests, but even today towns are small, the population sparse, the local economy powered almost entirely by the moneyed hunters who pay top dollar for the right to hunt on private land.
In France, where for centuries the nobility jealously preserved the right to hunt, game still exudes a mysterious attraction. It has the feel of luxury, of rare privilege. Americans do not get terribly excited about the thought of a good Brunswick stew made with fresh squirrel. But France is different. A juicy cut of beef is a fine thing, but the taste of wild meat taps deep into ancestral memory. It may account in part for the aura of terror and mystery that French writers have always woven around the Sologne, making it sound like Gallic "Blair Witch" territory. Barely beyond the Paris suburbs, it is the wild frontier, a place where civilized Frenchmen can enjoy, in the most decorous possible way, a weekend's worth of barbarism -- punctuated, of course, by very fine meals.
"You see the traffic?" said Jean-Claude Chesneau, a butcher in Lamotte-Beuvron, pointing at the town's main street outside his door. "Come the weekend, you start seeing the Rolls-Royces and the Bentleys driving past. The Sologne depends entirely on hunting."
All over the region, from October to December, hunters clad in olive green descend on the local inns, carrying their disassembled rifles in neat tan cases that make them look like students on the way to a bassoon lesson. The shop windows are filled with duck-themed suspenders, neckties and highball glasses. Socks and shirts share shelf space with cans of Italian rifle grease and bags of Hog Wild, an American grain mixture that's scattered on the ground to attract wild boar. Hikers walk with a wary tread. Many a tempting forest path displays the warning sign: "Today is a hunting day. Flying bullets." The Sologne is almost certainly the only region in France with a museum of poaching.
In the United States, drivers know they're in hunting territory when the highway signs show a leaping deer. In the Sologne, the signs show boar, deer and stag, stacked one on top of the other. And it's not false advertising. "If you walk by the rivers and canals in the morning, you'll see boars and pheasants and roe deer," said Dominique Clement, the chef and owner of La Solognote, an inn in Brinon-sur-Sauldre. His wife, Andree, nodded. "Take a walk around here, and it's like a safari," she said. "No giraffes, but just about everything else."
I don't hunt. I eat. I am happy to let the hunters do my work for me, bagging pheasant, partridge, hare, roe deer, boar, mallard, marcassin (junior boar) and the tasty local rabbit known as lapin de garenne. They do an excellent job. By the time the smoke clears away each year, 40,000 sharpshooters have brought down a million and a half game birds and thousands of boar and deer.
The local chefs know what to do with the meat. The Sologne is a wonderland of game pates and terrines, of sausages and bacons, of powerfully flavored dishes thick with blood and heady with the aroma of freshly gathered mushrooms. The cuisine is not fancy. A mainstay of the bread and pastry shops is pate a la citrouille, which is nothing more than a thick layer of rough pumpkin puree, onion and chopped parsley smeared between two layers of puff pastry. (The town of Millancay holds an annual festival devoted entirely to the pumpkin.) The equally popular galette de pomme de terre is, if possible, even humbler, a potato dough rolled out like puff pastry and baked until, like a peasant with big dreams, it rises and swells.
At its best, the Sologne offers honest, clearly presented food that draws its strength from fresh local raw materials and the fecundity of the surrounding Loire Valley. The area has a sprinkling of Michelin stars, places like Bernard Robin in Bracieux and the Lion d'Or in Romorantin-Lanthenay, where the catch from field and stream gets a refined reinterpretation. But the temperament here is earthbound, as rooted in the soil as the region's magnificent cepes and girolles. It is sometimes easy to forget that the local eels are superb, or that pike swim in rivers like the Beuvron and the Sauldre.
La Solognote's menu is almost emblematic. Poached eggs with creamed cepes, rabbit gelee with onion compote, squab in a spicy bouillon, roast partridge with sauteed potatoes and girolles, roe deer fillets in pepper sauce, roasted mallard duck with spiced grapes -- the distance between the kitchen and the forest just outside the door could not have been shorter. The mallard was a revelation. Succulent and tender enough to cut with a fork, it readjusted my mental reference points for the word "gamy," which too often fails to suggest freshness as well as intensity of flavor. It's the quality that makes you understand instantly why humans are carnivores.
Mr. Clement, who has been at the stove for 38 years at La Solognote, makes few claims for his cooking. "The main thing is to push the ingredients to the fore," he said with a shrug. "You just want to make them taste the way they taste."
It was at La Solognote that I encountered the first of several versions of lievre a la royale, something I had always thought of as a precious throwback to an era when diners worried about gout rather than cholesterol. It's a dish one hesitates to describe too vividly. A hare is required, of course. The animal is stuffed with a mixture of foie gras, truffles and its own innards and surrounded by a thick blood and wine sauce. In the Sologne, the dish is as common as cheeseburgers. It made a surprise appearance as a pate at Jean Frizot's takeout shop in Lamotte-Beuvron, stuffed in the center with duck liver, and an even more surprising appearance at Bernard Robin, where the hare and liver, after being braised, were shaped into what looks like a flat devil's-food cake and surrounded with a plate-filling slick of sauce. It came to the table looking like a triple-chocolate dessert, only more filling.
I tried to inventory the game dishes in the region, stopping in front of any restaurant that looked promising and jotting down the menu highlights. It became a hopeless and even painful task, an ever-lengthening scroll of dishes that would never be enjoyed, like the civet of boar with Bourgeuil sauce at Le Mouton in La Ferte-Imbault, the venison fillets with quince and blackberry gelee at Dahu in Lamotte-Beuvron, or the chartreuse of pheasant coated in molten foie gras and pistachios at Le Colombier in Romorantin.
I could always take some comfort in the food I actually was able to eat, like the concentrated hare consomme with stuffed cabbages and sliced chestnuts at Lion d'Or, served with croutons smeared with hare pate.
I did not even try to make a list of pates and terrines. But I did eat more than a dozen of them, from chunky, gnarly boar terrines to fine-grained, brick-colored venison terrines to pale rabbit pates, the blondes of the bunch. Rarely did they disappoint. Some were crude -- unsightly meat loaves in tin-foil tubs, surrounded by congealed fat. I bought several of these at the shop of Laurent Courcelle in Lamotte-Beuvron. ("They'll keep for 10 days," the woman behind the counter assured me.) The next day I was back, begging for the recipe for his rabbit terrine.
Right down the street, Mr. Chesneau, the butcher, displayed handsome-looking terrines in large ceramic containers. His were excellent, too, especially a flamboyant, multilayered rabbit pate en croute. Minced mushrooms and pistachios alternated with big chunks of rabbit, then a thick stripe of rabbit mousse and a layer of duck liver. On top was a shingled roof of shaved almonds, sealed into place artistically with a glistening gelee.
Mr. Chesneau's couture pate was an anomaly. This was a shop, after all, with a hairy boar carcass hanging over the sidewalk, flanked by a string of shiny mallards straight from local ponds. It's a sight to give city slickers pause, but in the Sologne, customers know how to deal with a dead animal (although I'm not sure how you stuff a 250-pound boar into a Peugeot), and the average cook can make short work of a fat, furry rabbit.
At the small central market in Romorantin, the selection looks a little thin on Wednesdays. The fruits and vegetables are sparsely displayed, and customers shuffle up and down the aisles with no great enthusiasm. One stand, however, was causing a stir the day I was there. Reaching into a big bag, a vendor was pulling out pheasants, partridges, ducks and rabbits one after the other, stacking them on a counter decorated with a prime pheasant, its feathers still glossy. A crowd gathered.
The vendor had the look of a woman who knows she's offering the prime stuff, and sure enough, the game disappeared as fast as she could put it out. It was an inspiring sight: nature on its way to being transformed into culture, a hundred pates in the making, the cuisine of the Sologne being built from the ground up.

VELOUTE DE CHAMPIGNONS
Adapted from Lion d'Or, Romorantin-Lanthenay
Time: 2 hours
 
1 pound fresh cepe (porcini) mushrooms
1 pound fresh girolles (chanterelles)
1 pound black trumpet or oyster mushrooms
2 quarts chicken stock or canned chicken broth
1 2/3 cups heavy cream
3 large egg yolks

HEADLINE: The Tax That Gave Birth to a Small Industry

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

 BODY:
High taxes help destroy jobs, right?
Not always. Some European taxes have actually created a flourishing cottage industry. 
 In the late 1980's, the European Union started allowing European and non-European tourists and businesses to reclaim the value-added tax levied on some products and services -- an amount that could be as much as 25 percent of the money spent.
But few people -- to the delight, presumably, of European tax collectors -- bothered to claim the money.
By the mid-1990's, John H. Powell calculated that as much as $10 billion was being left in European coffers.So Mr. Powell, who had become familiar with the intricacies of the value-added tax while working at Walt Disney's business development office in Europe, started a company in Seattle that produced software that enabled companies to trace and reclaim that money.
Yet by the time he started his company, Corporate VAT Management, in 1995, he was far from alone. Dozens of companies had sprouted up for the same purpose, though with different methods, and others have since joined the pack.
In the Netherlands, Luuk Vredeveld, a business consultant, began in the 1980's to help trucking companies reclaim taxes paid on, say, fuel. Today his company, Retourtax, has clients in various industries in the United States, Japan and Canada.
In Ireland, Fexco Tax Reclaim helps tourists and corporate customers get refunds.
In France, a company called Optisoft brought out a software package called Softax to perform essentially the same task.
Europe has long favored the value-added tax, a complex system in which products and services are taxed at each stage from production to final sale. Though American legislators have shied away from it, the system has gained favor in other nations, like Canada, South Korea and most recently Australia.
Some refunds -- for purchases at an airport, for example -- are immediately available, with little paperwork and fuss.
But claiming some other refunds can be a daunting task, even for a hardened accountant. For example, business travel expenses that qualify differ by country. In Britain, where the VAT rate is 17.5 percent, eligible expenses include hotel rooms, meals (though not those for entertainment) and car rentals. In Germany, they include hotels, car rentals and meals for business entertainment.
To qualify for a refund, a business traveler must submit invoices within a certain period, which can vary by country, together with a reclaim document in the proper language. A claim for meals eaten in Denmark, for instance, must be submitted in Danish in Copenhagen.
But for many companies competing for this business, the procedure has become assembly-line simple. Clients send their invoices, which are sorted to see which qualify for refunds, and then those that qualify are forwarded to tax authorities with a refund request. Typically, a percentage of the refunded tax money -- anywhere from 7 to 20 percent -- is withheld as a fee.
Mr. Powell of Corporate VAT Management said many companies had failed to claim VAT's because of paperwork lapses or uncertainty over which expenses qualified.
Corporate VAT's latest software is designed to be applied to expense and credit card records to ferret out refundable amounts, then automatically list them and fill out the claim forms -- in the right language. He is working to persuade banks, credit card and car rental companies to use his software to program accounts to trace refundable value-added taxes. These companies could then reclaim the VAT and pass all or part of the savings to clients.
One bank that has signed on is U.S. Bancorp of Minneapolis, which this summer did blind tests of the software on expense records of some big corporate clients. Robert T. Abele, president of corporate payment systems at U.S. Bancorp, said it was urging top corporate clients to test the software. "They can get significant savings," he said. "And when we say significant, I'm talking tens of thousands of dollars."
U.S. Bancorp is also the largest issuer of Visa corporate and purchasing cards, and Mr. Abele said he believed credit card companies would embrace similar software since the use of a single corporate payment system could allow companies to automate VAT claims.
Many companies in the reclaiming business are distinctly lower technology, with much of the work done by hand. Barry O'Sullivan, marketing director at Fexco's headquarters in Kerry, Ireland, said his company's level of computerization was "a lot less than we'd like it to be."
And some in the business say software is only part of the trick.
Meridian VAT Reclaim, which set up shop in New York in 1990 and now has 30,000 clients, is the market leader in VAT refunding.
Deborah Ferolito, Meridian's president, acknowledged that software like Autovat may be "the right product for simple bread-and-butter activities." But she said many companies also require tax consultancy and legal advice. Meridian employs about 400 people in 42 offices worldwide. Last year, revenue totaled about $33 million, and roughly 40 percent of its business is now done with European companies seeking refunds elsewhere in Europe.
Ms. Ferolito says many customers are not aware of what is refundable, and in some cases, may even have paid value-added taxes erroneously.
"Some European companies, if they're not sure, they charge it," she said.
Calculations become even more complex, she said, when non-European companies set up shop in Europe and must register to pay and levy the tax.
As in most businesses, the drive for economies of scale is leading to consolidation. Last year, Fexco teamed with Apax Partners, the venture capitalists, to acquire the Global Refund Group, a VAT refund specialist in Sweden, from Cendant.
At the same time, Meridian was acquired for $190 million by the Profit Recovery Group International, an Atlanta company specializing in account auditing. Ms. Ferolito said Meridian brought its client base to the marriage, while Profit Recovery brought experience in recovering misspent money in other areas of corporate accounting, like telecommunications and shipping.

HEADLINE: M.I.T. Media Lab at 15: Big Ideas, Big Money

BYLINE: By LISA GUERNSEY 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
FOR 15 years, there has been one mantra at the Media Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology: "Demo or die."
Day after day at this famous and flashy laboratory, students and professors have demonstrated their research, impressing industry sponsors and guests with invisible sensors and wearable computers, offering a close-up look at some of the lab's most notable innovations, like programmable Legos and electronic ink. 
 The constant demonstrations may sound like unusual behavior for an academic institution, but that is how the Media Lab survives: embarking on pie-in-the-sky research while simultaneously convincing companies that its ideas are worth the cost of sponsorship, which runs in the hundreds of thousands of dollars for each company each year.
On one show-and-tell day last month, those dual roles, and the complicated issues they raise, were on display. The laboratory had invited more than a hundred potential sponsors to see its latest research, and throughout the day a gaggle of guests padded around the lab's five-story building, peering at projects and gleaning ideas from researchers who seemed eager to offer them.
But by late afternoon, as the visitors trickled into a meeting in the building's auditorium, the academic atmosphere gave way to businesslike reality. Walter Bender, a founding member of the lab and its newly appointed executive director, took the stage.
"The Media Lab is changing," he said, beginning to make his pitch. "We are not a start-up organization anymore." He said it was time for Media Lab 2.0., a bigger, broader and more influential organization than ever before.The lab, he said, had more revolutionary ideas to offer and more technology to produce. But, he added, it needed money -- at least $250,000 a year, to be precise, from every organization represented in the room.
The auditorium filled with an uncomfortable silence. Unasked questions hung in the air: What would that money deliver? Would it be worth the price? And how exactly does the lab keep up this juggling act, serving commercial needs while trying to serve nonprofit ideals?
Those questions are at the heart of simmering debates about the laboratory, where there has seldom been a shortage of controversy, or publicity, since it was founded in 1985. Some of the issues are longstanding ones, raised by researchers at other institutions who wonder whether the Media Lab's innovations have made any substantial impact.
But the latest uncertainties have emerged from within the lab itself. Just as the Media Lab has decided to expand, its professors, students and even a few sponsors are starting to wonder how it can remain an open arena for exchanging ideas in an age of start-up companies, competitive research and sudden riches for those who turn their innovations into products.
Many students, for example, harbor hopes of turning their own ideas into companies, reaping the financial benefits of initial public offerings. Debates rage over whether new innovations should be freely disseminated or patented in hopes of generating royalties. And several professors have decided to join or start technology companies while maintaining their roles as Media Lab faculty members, leading to potential conflicts of interest.
That last development seems to be most disturbing to Nicholas Negroponte, the laboratory co-founder who, within technology circles, is nothing short of a celebrity. When asked how he felt about professors who started companies, he did not hesitate. "I get a level of heartburn," he said. "It is a very agonizing situation."
Clearly, at 15, the Media Lab is struggling through some awkward changes. The question is, What kind of an adult is it going to become?
When the doors opened to its white-tiled building on M.I.T.'s east campus in 1985, the Media Lab was an oddity. As an experimental blending of art and technology, it was led by Mr. Negroponte, a charismatic and visionary maverick from the architecture school who had started building a team of multidisciplinary researchers more than five years before. At the core of their mission was an exploration of Mr. Negroponte's insistence that text, video and sound would someday merge in digital unity.
Fifteen years later, Mr. Negroponte's vision is largely considered to have been on target. His 1995 book on the subject, "Being Digital," has been translated into 40 languages and by many measures, his laboratory has achieved overwhelming success.
 
Vision Confronts Reality
Today nearly 160 companies (as well as a few nonprofit organizations) are sponsors of the center, which is the academic home of about 400 students, professors and research scientists. Each year, as many as 10,000 people are guided through its dimly lit and seemingly chaotic chambers, where bean bags and stuffed animals share space with video screens, circuit boards and radio transmitters.
Some sense of the laboratory's ideals was incorporated into its physical shell, the Wiesner Building, which was named after Jerome Wiesner, the former M.I.T. president who founded the center with Mr. Negroponte. The building was designed by the architect I. M. Pei, and its internal structure was intended to be a symbol of openness.
There are no long hallways with closed doors. Instead, huge open rooms full of movable furniture make up its core, and many spaces are ringed by offices with interior walls of glass. The glass was intended to stimulate as much sharing as possible among the many disciplines that converged there -- whether electrical engineering or music -- while also offering visitors a chance to see what was being developed.
That same openness was supposed to be reflected in the Media Lab's policies on fund-raising and intellectual property. While other academic laboratories have come under fire for being too quick to coddle commercial interests, the Media Lab has always proclaimed itself to be different.
Elsewhere, technology professors have been accused of accepting corporate grants for research that merely serves companies' short-term needs or that restricts how much of their work can be shared with colleagues, even those in their own departments.
The Media Lab, by contrast, signs very few contracts for what is called directed research, in which companies tell university researchers to develop technology that will achieve a specific outcome. Instead, the Media Lab tries to have it both ways: it attempts to keep its research open-ended and accessible, even though 90 percent of the lab's $35 million budget comes from its sponsors.
In return for the money, sponsors have access to any innovations that come out of the lab. They may visit at any time and get royalty-free licenses for any technology that is patented during their membership. The pool of patents prohibits any sponsor -- whether it is Kodak, Motorola or any of the other mammoth companies that have joined -- to have an edge over any other. Contracts for exclusive access to patents are considered taboo. (The laboratory does, however, sign contracts that exclude companies that are not sponsors from licenses to Media Lab patents for a few years.)
"It means that I don't have to hide anything from anybody," said Dr. Justine Cassell, an assistant professor who leads research into how human gestures and expressions can be deciphered by machines and incorporated into computer interfaces.
Dr. Cassell, however, is one of the Media Lab professors who have not started their own companies. Others have, and though they stress that their primary allegiance is to the lab, no one disputes that their dual roles are a touchy subject. A recent article in Technology Review, an M.I.T. magazine, exposed some of that internal hand-wringing, and its publication has created an even more guarded and distrustful climate.
Dr. Joe Jacobson, for example, is the professor who led the lab's research into electronic ink, which responds to changing electromagnetic fields to form words or images that can be read on paper. Three years ago, he and two of his former graduate students, J. D. Albert and Barrett Comiskey, started E Ink, a private company in Cambridge. Today, Dr. Jacobson sits on its board.
The company is not a sponsor of the Media Lab (M.I.T. rules prohibit professors from having more than a 5 percent stake in a sponsoring company), and it uses some technology that was developed by Dr. Jacobson before he arrived at M.I.T. So when the lab's sponsors ask to use electronic ink, they often find that it is not exactly free for them to use at will. Instead, Dr. Jacobson refers them to his company, which can sell them the product or invite them to become investors.
"There is very nice cross-fertilization in that regard," Dr. Jacobson said.
The E Ink case "is one we are trying to learn from," said Bruce Bullock, the lab's managing director and moderator of its intellectual property committee. He added, "E Ink was done at an early time when a lot of these problems were not understood." The laboratory is now looking closely at the work conducted by incoming professors, Mr. Bullock said, to "make sure that doesn't happen again."
Yet even working with companies that are sponsors can cause conflicts. Last year, when Dr. Alex Pentland, the lab's academic chief, helped with a sponsor's exhibition at a large technology conference in New York, he had to shift between his role as a professor and his role as adviser to the company, now known as Charmed Technologies. He was wearing a denim jacket that showcased a Media Lab innovation: embroidery sewn with conductive thread, some of which served as a functional keypad. But because that e-embroidery was developed years before the company became a sponsor, it was not something that Charmed was allowed to call its own.
To avoid the appearance that he was providing that technology to Charmed, Dr. Pentland asked to be excluded from news media photographs. (Today, he said, he is no longer an adviser to the company.)
"Faculty operate with several hats on," Dr. Pentland said. "It is up to the faculty members to maintain a separation." In addition, professors at M.I.T. and elsewhere are bound by rules restricting the number of days per week they may spend as consultants; at M.I.T., the limit is one day in five.
Problems of intellectual property also arise when students want to start companies. Last year, when the technology market was at its peak, graduate students with innovative ideas started to think seriously about leaving the laboratory. Inside the Media Lab they were required to divulge their ideas to sponsors, who might have been potential competitors. But some graduate students reasoned that if they left, they could pursue their research in private.
To prevent a loss of talented students, faculty members at the Media Lab began to talk about giving graduates the same rights to intellectual property as the lab's sponsors. Then they ran into a roadblock. Granting alumni royalty-free access to patents ran counter to the university's patent policy, under which professors and students typically pay M.I.T. -- either in royalties, licensing fees or equity -- to use any technology they created during their tenure. .
 
Changing Course
In some ways, that Wednesday gathering in October was the laboratory's attempt to move away from that money-driven and conflict-laden world. Many of the people who were shifting uncomfortably in their seats during the laboratory's marketing pitch were representatives of nonprofit organizations or from governmental offices in developing countries like Ghana and Costa Rica. This was the official unveiling of Digital Nations, an attempt to use technology to tackle some of the developing world's most vexing problems, like illiteracy, poor health and economic instability.
To disseminate and finance its work, the laboratory is asking governments and nonprofit organizations to become members, either by paying the annual fee out of their own pockets or by finding foundations and companies to become their patrons.
But in fact, this latest project may lead the Media Lab into even more uncharted territory regarding ownership rights and the free dissemination of ideas. Because the laboratory is not yet sure about how -- or whether -- to grant countries access to its patents, it is giving them only the privilege of visiting and working with its professors, consulting style.
What's more, the laboratory may find that it is asking for a sharing of ideas among countries that may have few traditions of academic freedom or long histories of conflict with one another.
"We're treading into some dangerous waters here," Dr. Pentland said, adding that the tension between commercial and academic interests "may look mild in comparison."
Meanwhile, the laboratory is charging ahead with a major expansion. A $100 million seven-story building has been planned to augment the laboratory's Cambridge operations. A second laboratory is being erected in Dublin, in what was once a Guinness brewery. Several professors at the laboratory have talked about establishing similar branches in Asia and Latin America.
To cope with the Media Lab's swelling size, Mr. Negroponte has appointed Mr. Bender, a senior scientist who led the organization's electronic publishing work, as executive director. Mr. Negroponte -- a tall, commanding presence who is known for his crisp striped dress shirts and his talents of persuasion -- has become senior director and is continuing what he has been doing for the past several years: touring the globe to give keynote addresses and raise money.
The responsibility for the laboratory's day-to-day operations now falls to Mr. Bender, a low-key and amiable scientist who wears sweaters and khakis and happens to be a longtime co-captain of the laboratory's softball team. Like Mr. Negroponte, he also hails from the architecture school and, like many in that profession, does not have a Ph.D. But he has been doing research and teaching all his life. His primary goal, he said, is to see the Media Lab's hands-on, interdisciplinary model spread to other places.
 
Making Its Mark
He may first have to defend the laboratory from perennial accusations that it is little more than a publicity machine. Several laboratories conduct similar research but attract far less media attention, and their founders have been known to contend, however subtly, that their innovations are more substantial than those that emerge from under Mr. Negroponte's umbrella.
"Ideas come very quickly, but can you reduce it to practice and is it going to make a difference?" asked Dr. Dan Siewiorek, director of the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. As an example, he described Carnegie Mellon research on robust wearable computers that are now being used by the U.S. Marine Corps..
Dr. Michael Dertouzos, the head of the M.I.T. Laboratory for Computer Science, said he credited the Media Lab, and Mr. Negroponte particularly, "with having seen, way back, the merger of media broadcasting and print." But Dr. Dertouzos also ticked off a list of new technology that had come out of his laboratory, such as Ethernet connections, computer time-sharing, spreadsheets and the core technology for an encryption system used widely on the Web.
"Our stuff is stuff that works," he said.
To be fair, the Media Lab has had its share of successful technological innovations, including safer air bags for automobiles. And one of the laboratory's first inventions was the technology behind Lego Mindstorms, programmable Legos that are considered one of the hottest toys of the decade.
A few companies have dropped their membership over the years, including Nike, Xerox and The New York Times Company.
But most sponsors say they find the laboratory's work worth the annual fee. For example, one of the newest sponsors, Saab Marine Electronics, has already decided to employ some of the laboratory's remote-sensing technology to determine precisely how much gasoline or oil is present in storage tanks without relying on gadgets that use moving parts or that could introduce contaminants.
Mr. Bender vigorously defends the laboratory's academic standards and professional reputation. All faculty members must meet the university's standards for tenure, he said, and graduate students as well as professors publish often in academic and professional journals.
When in 1996 the I.B.M. Systems Journal published an issue dedicated to research at the Media Lab, for example, it became the journal's most popular issue ever. At the beginning of November, the journal came out with yet another Media Lab extravaganza, containing 29 articles about research that included research on using hyperlinks in televisionbroadcasts and the creation of tiny computational devices.
 
The Challenges Ahead
Professors at the Media Lab also plead for perspective regarding its potential for conflicts of interest. If the Media Lab has hit its troubled teenage years, they say, it is merely a microcosm of a larger struggle being played out in universities everywhere. Forty years ago, research in science and technology was financed largely by the federal government, which was supposed to act in the public interest. Now as corporations fill more of that role, a question hangs over every project: whose interest is being served, the public's or the company's shareholders?
Add a culture of start-up companies to the mix, and academic ideals take an even harder pounding. "I had a student who once asked me to sign a nondisclosure form before I could grade her homework," said Dr. Randy Pausch, a professor of design and computer science at Carnegie Mellon.
Yet university laboratories do not seem to be shying away from corporate sponsorships and entrepreneurship. If anything, they are building more of these complicated relationships. Carnegie Mellon, which started a doctoral program this year in its Human-Computer Interaction Institute, is offering company-sponsored courses that have students design devices for those sponsors. And the Georgia Center for Advanced Telecommunications Technology at the Georgia Institute of Technology has dedicated the entire fourth floor of its building to assisting and sheltering new companies.
Mr. Negroponte has argued that the Media Lab's model of shared intellectual property is more likely to keep research open among professors, students and sponsors than exclusive agreements with companies. "Some are saying it's worn out its welcome," he said, referring to scientists at the laboratory who want to develop products outside the Media Lab. "I'm not so sure."
Few Media Lab professors are sure, either, of how the laboratory will weather the challenges it faces. But anyone visiting the Media Lab can at least get a look at its future physical presence. An architectural model of the new building, which is scheduled to open in 2004, sits in a glass display case on the Wiesner Building's lowest level. Like the current structure, it includes wide-open floors and staircases.
But on the outside, thin translucent shades -- something like venetian blinds -- hang against the building's surface. Are they supposed to be letting light in, or obscuring the view of what is inside? At this point, it is hard to tell.

HEADLINE: Coca Conflict in Colombia Snares the Innocent

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: SAN MIGUEL, Colombia, Nov. 6

 BODY:
The 16 cars were lined up in a row, their drivers pushed to the side of the road at gunpoint. Then the rebel leader waved his weapon and gave an order, "Get the gasoline, and start lighting."
Moments later, one vehicle after another was ablaze, with black plumes of smoke filling the blue sky. The Colombian guerrillas, AK-47's hanging from their shoulders, ran from exploding Toyota jeeps and old Ford trucks as the stunned owners watched silently. 
 The drivers had merely wanted to pick up some food and fuel in neighboring Ecuador and return to their homes. But in doing so they had flouted the most basic of laws here in Putumayo, a Vermont-sized province of coca-growing jungle and a crucial battleground in the country's civil conflict. The Marxist rebels have banned everyone from traveling Putumayo's rocky roads, strangling the local economy.
The upheaval underscores the challenge that President Andres Pastrana faces as he works with the American government in imposing a $7.5 billion plan to curtail the lucrative coca trade and weaken the rebels.
For all the financial and military aid that Washington is providing, much of the countryside in Putumayo is controlled by the rebels. Guerrillas patrol the smaller communities, and their roadblocks have resulted in dwindling food supplies in many communities.
Guerrilla checkpoints -- typically a handful of men standing by the side of the road with AK-47's and jugs of gasoline -- seem to pop up anywhere. Behind every turn a driver risks losing his car or worse.
"They just took it, and this is all I have, these keys," said Javier Pimiento, 22, who was only a few hundred yards inside Colombia from the bridge to Ecuador when he was ordered from his car. "I feel terrible. I can't even bring food home. They have a conflict going, but why get us involved?"
The rebels are unfazed by the fact that the villagers they profess to support have suffered in this latest of several vehicle burnings. They justified their actions by saying the drivers had been ferrying military provisions.
This sparsely populated corner of the country has become hotly contested because about half of Colombia's coca crop is grown here. With the province a major focus of the government's anti-drug plan, American-trained counterinsurgency battalions, working with the national police, will by next year take aim at the drug traffickers and laboratories that process coca leaves into the paste used to make cocaine.
But it won't be easy, the government concedes.
Col. Gabriel Diaz, commander of the Colombian military's 24th Brigade in Putumayo, said the burning of cars and trucks by the guerrillas was intended to make it more difficult for the government to attack the cocaine industry.
"They want the people to feel hunger," the colonel said, "and possibly provoke a protest and a confrontation with the government forces."
For their part, the rebels say the destruction is meant to send a message to the government in Bogota: rein in the paramilitary gunmen. Paramilitary forces have been battling the rebels in Putumayo in a series of ferocious skirmishes since September.
"We have to show them that we're a force," said a rebel leader who goes by the nom de guerre Olbani. "That we're capable of paralyzing the whole country."
He accused the Colombian forces of working with the notorious paramilitary gunmen of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, who are the main challengers to the rebels' control of the coca fields here. Human rights groups say the Self-Defense Forces are responsible for widespread massacres of villagers and have ties to rogue elements in the military, a charge the government has long denied.
The stranglehold has been especially hard on towns like Puerto Asis, La Dorada and La Hormiga, which the rebels say are hotbeds of paramilitary activity. Asserting that the government has not done enough, despite airlifts to ease the food shortages, officials from across Putumayo are planning to travel to Bogota in a convoy of cars, possibily on Sunday, as a sign of protest.
But many people have given up on living here. At least 1,100 refugees now live in Lago Agrio, Ecuador, all but 38 of them in the homes of relatives or friends, according to the relief organization that has coordinated shelter for them. An estimated 5,000 to 10,000 more have avoided the roadblocks by traversing Ecuador and re-entering Colombia through the western province of Narino, where many have roots.
Jose Pablo Pascal, who fled La Dorada on Saturday to join his wife and five children in Ecuador, is now sleeping on the concrete floor of a friend's kitchen, next to a sack of potatoes and the refrigerator.
"What terrorized us was the fear," Mr. Pascal, 42, said. "You didn't know if when you went to sleep that something wouldn't happen. You couldn't even sleep."
At a small house in Lago Agrio that is sheltering eight families, refugees said that they were afraid of being attacked by guerrillas or paramilitaries operating in their communities.
"We were in the middle of the conflict, and so we had to get out," said Roberto Rosero. "Where we were, we had guerrillas and then just over the bend were the paramilitaries, and they were fighting all the time."
Relief workers in Ecuador have been working to complete four other shelters, which together will be able to house 230 people.
"We think that the problem is just starting, and it's going to get worse," said Gribaldo Cueva, one of the workers. "With the combat between the guerrillas and the paramilitaries in the countryside, more people will be coming."
Both the rebels and paramilitaries appear firmly established and prepared to fight for months on end. In the countryside, guerrillas are such a presence that they have taken part in the meetings farmers have lately held with local officials to discuss coca eradication efforts. In towns like Puerto Asis and La Hormiga, meanwhile, residents quietly point out the paramilitary gunmen drinking at the local bar or enjoying a snow cone in the town plaza.
The government, though, does have a presence, and engagements between soldiers and rebels are not unusual. This year, 22 guerrillas have been killed by the military in combat in Putumayo and 16 others have been captured, said Colonel Diaz, reading from the latest battlefield reports. But he acknowledges that his forces cannot be everywhere.
On Sunday, just a day after the burning of the cars, government counterinsurgency troops could be seen patrolling on foot stretches of road that rebels had occupied the day before. Near the community of El Tigre, a patrol leader was asked why the military had not stopped the rebels from burning the cars.
"We couldn't get there fast enough," he said. "It's too far, and you can't take the road anyway because of the ambushes."

NORTH CAROLINA BUSH
Gov. George W. Bush won North Carolina, but so did the Democratic candidate for governor, Attorney General Mike Easley. And heavy spending by the two parties' national Congressional campaign committees seemed to have little effect in races where they were trying to shift House seats from one party to the other. 
 Mr. Easley defeated Richard Vinroot, the former mayor of Charlotte, to fill the seat of Gov. James B. Hunt Jr., a Democrat, who is leaving because of a term limit. Partly on the strength of name recognition in the eastern part of the state, his home territory, Mr. Easley had led in the race from the outset. He put together a traditional Democratic coalition in an economically and culturally diverse state, and interviews with voters showed that he did especially well among liberals, African-Americans and the less affluent. He ran on a platform that resembled Al Gore's in some ways, such as his emphasis on prescription drug benefits, but with a tilt to the center that resembled George Bush's strategy of avoiding ideological extremes -- and it worked for him.
In two House districts, though, Republican incumbents held off Democrats who had been trying, despite Mr. Bush's coattails, to take away their seats.
In the 11th District, the incumbent Republican, Charles H. Taylor, defeated Sam Neill, a Democratic lawyer running for elected office for the first time.
And in the Eighth District, the freshman Republican incumbent, Robin Hayes, defeated Mike Taylor, the Democratic challenger.
North Carolina also approved $3.1 billion in bonds for higher education. It was the biggest bond issue in the state's history.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Honest brokers separate policy from sausage for the White House.

BYLINE: By Alan B. Krueger; This column appears here every Thursday. Alan B. Krueger is the Bendheim Professor of Economics and Public Affairs at Princeton University and editor of The Journal of Economic Perspectives.

 BODY:
NO president has been as well versed in economics as Josiah Bartlet, the character played by Martin Sheen on "West Wing." Bartlet, a former economics professor and Nobel prize winner, rarely needs advice on economics from his staff. Nonfictional presidents, however, must rely on their advisers to make decisions. The way economic advice is organized can determine the success of a president's program. The National Economic Council provides a good model for future White Houses. 
 During the 1992 campaign, Bill Clinton announced that he would create a National Economic Council to elevate economic policy in the White House to the same status as national security and to coordinate advice from cabinet secretaries on issues ranging from public investment and deficit reduction to free trade. In 1997 he called the council "the single most significant organizational innovation that our administration has made in the White House."
George W. Bush promised to pay attention to expert advisers in his campaign. Mr. Bush's advisers suspect that if elected he will create a coordinating body similar in several respects to the National Economic Council because he likes to hear competing views before reaching a decision.
Al Gore is sure to maintain the National Economic Council if he should pull out a Florida victory.
Robert E. Rubin was the first director of the council. Under Mr. Rubin and his successors, Laura Tyson and Gene Sperling, the council coordinated domestic and international economic policy. The director and staff of about 30 met frequently with six departments -- Treasury, the Council of Economic Advisers, the Office of Management and Budget, Commerce, Labor and the trade representative. Legislative and communications aides were added to this group. Other departments were consulted when issues in their realms arose.
Unresolved issues were addressed at the cabinet level. Competing options for handling major policy issues were presented to the president for his decision.
Economic policy increasingly involves complex issues that cut across federal agencies. Climate change policy, for example, involved nine departments. A coherent policy requires coordination and cooperation across diverse agencies.
Mr. Rubin said two elements were essential for an organization like the National Economic Council to be effective. First, beginning with the transition, the president-elect and his chief of staff must insist that cabinet members work within the council's framework instead of running to the president to plead their case. Second, the council's director must be perceived as an honest broker who fairly represents relevant cabinet members' views before the president, without exploiting his proximity to the president to advocate his own agenda.
"The N.E.C. at its core is a commitment to trust a fair and transparent process," Mr. Sperling said. This process involves common-sense practices, like allowing cabinet secretaries to send dissenting memos along with the council's decision memo to the president or encouraging agencies to review a council memo to make sure their views are accurately represented.
Trust in the process reduces the likelihood that cabinet secretaries will leak damaging information to the news media. Leaks can undermine policy initiatives, poison relationships and create unnecessary volatility in financial markets.
Roger B. Porter, a former assistant to President George Bush for economic and domestic policy and now a professor at Harvard, stressed that regardless of who wins, it is important for the president-elect to appoint individuals to various positions who will work together as a team.
One measure of the council's success is the rarity of public disputes among President Clinton's economic advisers. In his new book, "The White House Staff," which should be required reading for any transition team, Bradley Patterson observes that "the key to effective cooperation was not so much institutional arrangements but personal trust and respect."
"The main accomplishment of the N.E.C. process," said former Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, "was the first budget, which launched the twin goals of reducing the deficit and shifting spending toward public investment in education, training, basic research and infrastructure." Its main disappointment: the failure to wrest coordination of the health care plan from Ira Magaziner.
Although longer lasting than its predecessors, the National Economic Council is not unique. Almost all presidents since Eisenhower have had a group that coordinated economic policy. President Gerald R. Ford described his Economic Policy Board, the closest cousin to the N.E.C., as "the most important institutional innovation of my administration."
But many presidents have relied on the Treasury secretary to coordinate economic policy. It is impossible for a cabinet secretary to be an honest broker and an advocate for his department. Budget policy was orchestrated almost exclusively by the O.M.B. in the Bush and Reagan administrations, with relatively little coordination or cooperation across departments.
Before the council was established, there was concern it would subordinate the Council of Economic Advisers, a small group of professional economists who provide technical analysis for the president.
Early on, however, the National Economic Council elevated the Council of Economic Advisers, freeing it to advocate efficient economic programs and ensuring that the president had its input. The influence of the Council of Economic Advisers waned over time but only partly as a result of the National Economic Council. The new administration could reverse this slide by reviving the Council of Economic Advisers' in-person weekly briefing of the president.
Why does it matter how the policy process is organized? Professor Porter gave three reasons. First, "the president needs and deserves a process that exposes him to all the views he should take into account, and the best views available in the government." Second, the process illuminates the interrelationship among various policies. Third, once a decision is made, the president needs a system to carry it out.
As President Bartlet acutely observed last season: "Decisions are made by those who show up." To be most effective, the White House must structure economic advice to the president so all relevant views are represented and vetted in a fair process. This is best accomplished if an honest broker close to the president is responsible for coordinating the economic policy process behind the scenes.

HEADLINE: Argentina, Wobbly, Clears a Borrowing Hurdle

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Nov. 8

 BODY:
Argentina's auction of $1.1 billion in treasury bills this week has put the government over a major short-term financial hurdle, but the borrowing costs -- at rates reaching 16 percent -- reflect growing worries that even heavier political and economic hurdles lie ahead.
Of all the countries in South America, only Ecuador now has a higher risk premium than Argentina reflected in its interest rates. Colombia and Venezuela, two nations with many political uncertainties, now have an easier time borrowing money. 
 Some financial analysts are going so far as to warn that Argentina, Latin America's biggest borrower, could be the next emerging-market nation to suffer a financial crisis, one that could hurt the economy of neighboring Brazil and others beyond. On Tuesday, Brazil's currency declined further despite improving economic performance there, as currency traders watched the Argentine bond auction with trepidation.
"Argentina is now the focus of the emerging markets," said Tulio Vera, manager and chief debt strategist at Merrill Lynch. He added that while "it is a bit of a relief" that Argentina did not put off the auction and successfully rolled over debt, albeit at the highest rates of the year, "the concerns are still there and the risks are still there."
A wide range of Argentine economists say there is virtually no chance that the country, which has South America's second-largest economy, will default on its $123 billion of foreign debt, suspend payments or be forced to remove its currency's trading-rate link to the United States dollar.
But jitters grew over the last week, after Standard & Poor's placed Argentina on a credit watch, and former President Raul Alfonsin, a leader of the governing Alianza coalition, wondered aloud how much better Argentina would be if it could invest $20 billion next year rather than have to use it to pay interest on its debts.
Interbank interest rates here have now reached the highest levels since the Mexico peso crisis in 1995.
James Barrineau, vice president for emerging markets research at Alliance Capital Management, remarked: "After an extended period of time of waiting for growth, there is market skepticism that the Argentine model -- an inflexible exchange rate, raising taxes to cut the deficit -- works. And if it doesn't, eventually the market will not finance a growing debt burden with no growth."
Argentina is in the depths of recession. The economy shrank by 3 percent in 1999, though this year most economists project growth around 1 percent. The government forecasts 4 percent growth in 2001, with help from exports, including a hoped-for increase in farm prices and expectations that the value of the euro will firm up and help trade with European countries.
There are some recent signs of improvement in Argentine supermarket sales, construction and manufacturing output, as well as increases in private-sector borrowing, that suggest to some that the worst economic news may be over.
But tax receipts this year have been disappointing, and an unresolved Senate bribery scandal has led in recent weeks to the resignation of the vice president, a shake-up of the cabinet, and persistent doubts about President Fernando de la Rua's continued ability to govern.
Of the $1.1 billion in treasury bills auctioned on Tuesday, $500 million were priced to yield 16 percent, up from 8.9 percent when similar debt instruments were auctioned in July. The value of the Argentine bonds at one point during the trading session were driven down on foreign markets to the lowest level since Brazil devalued its currency in January 1999.
Argentina must raise $19.5 billion to finance its debt obligations next year. That should not be a major problem, most economists say, as long as President de la Rua can manage to keep the governing coalition together and push through Congress a 2001 budget including $700 million in spending cuts to meet fiscal targets of the International Monetary Fund.
Two weeks ago, the government shifted policy, announcing a new fiscal plan, including measures to reduce taxes on corporate debt payments and on payroll taxes for high-technology companies. Even critics say the new plan could decrease production costs in private industry by 2 or 3 percent, helping to make Argentine products more competitive on world markets.
The view from Argentina tends to be more optimistic than the perspective expressed by bond traders and analysts abroad. Argentine economists in and out of the government point out that bank deposits remain steady, unlike the situation in past crises when capital flight led to financial breakdown and devaluation.
"There is a very exaggerated pessimism outside the country with respect to the true situation in Argentina," said Domingo Cavallo, a former economy minister who now leads a conservative political party in Congress. "There is no reason Argentina cannot meet its obligations."
Mr. Cavallo, who was the chief architect of the dollar peg and other free-market changes in the early 90's, has been drawing closer to the government. This is expected to help in gaining passage of the budget and bolstering confidence in international markets for Mr. de la Rua and his beleaguered economy minister, Jose Luis Machinea.
Mr. Cavallo told reporters this week that Argentina can regain the 7 percent annual growth rate it enjoyed in the early 90's by making adjustments in policy, like reducing regulations and corporate taxes much further than the government now proposes.
There is growing talk that Mr. Cavallo could join the government economic team in coming months, with the government then shifting away from its emphasis on austerity in favor of a supply-side boost of domestic demand through sharply lower taxes and regulation.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
A Bond Buyer's View Of the Close Election

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Bond traders are supposed to dislike uncertainty. Yet when they woke up the morning after Election Day still not knowing for sure who would occupy the White House next year, traders took the news in stride. As a result, interest rates and the dollar were little changed yesterday.
Why the minimal reaction? Because, traders said, for the last few weeks the bond market had been expecting Gov. George W. Bush of Texas to win the presidency. And the outcome, despite the narrowness of the race and the lingering doubt over the results in Florida, suggested to them that Mr. Bush was more likely than not to emerge victorious. 
 "The bond market is telling us today that there is a good shot that Bush is the guy," Thomas Connor, the head government trader at J. P. Morgan Securities, said.
Investors had sold bonds and pushed interest rates higher in recent weeks, analysts said, because Mr. Bush's promise of a $1.3 trillion tax cut was seen as a bigger threat to the projected government surpluses than Vice President Gore's budget proposals.
All during the campaign, Mr. Gore, with his promise to reserve more of the surplus to pay down the federal debt, was considered by traders to be somewhat better than Governor Bush for bonds. And if Mr. Gore does win the Florida recount and the presidency, there could be a rally in bonds.
But if Mr. Bush wins, the outlook in the bond market could then become cloudier as investors wait to see how a Republican Congress and the Republican president run Washington together for the first time since 1955.
There are several factors that limit any big move up in interest rates on a Bush victory, which is why traders and analysts do not expect interest rates to move much higher than their present levels for the time being. The yield on the Treasury's new 10-year note was at 5.84 percent in late trading yesterday, down from 5.86 percent on Tuesday but up from 5.62 percent Oct. 23.
Despite the difference between Republicans and Democrats on taxes and spending, the two parties have moved much closer on overall economic policy since Ronald Reagan won the presidency in 1980. In addition, the economy appears to be slowing from its brisk growth rate of the last several years, which should keep some downward pressure on interest rates. And no tax cuts or spending increases will be able to change that outlook immediately.
Lastly, the Federal Reserve is a formidable presence. Analysts do not expect any change that would divert the central bank from its mission of doing whatever is necessary to keep inflation in check.
The bond market, however, has been surprised before. During Bill Clinton's election race in 1992, the bond market sold off and long-term interest rates moved higher as it became clear that Mr. Clinton was going to defeat Mr. Bush's father.
But the new administration made clear quickly that its highest priority would be to reduce the deficit, a stance that pleased the bond market and set off a move that sent long-term interest rates in 1993 to their lowest levels in more than 25 years.
Now that interest rates are relatively low, if anything is likely to surprise the market over the next few months, analysts said, it would be evidence that Mr. Bush might be able actually to achieve much of the big tax cut he has proposed.
For investors in the bond market, further uncertainty rests on several crucial decisions Mr. Bush would have to make if he wins the White House. What kind of tax cut will he actually offer? Will he stick to the outline offered in his campaign, fearing the memories of his father's broken "read my lips" pledge?
For bond investors there is also a question of who the next Treasury secretary will be. The new president will also have two vacancies to fill on the Federal Reserve Board, which will send important signals about policy. And there is a question of what Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve will do. He is expected to stay on at least until his term as chairman ends in early 2004, but he will be 75 in March.
So despite the initial calm, there is still the possibility of significant volatility in the bond market. "And the uncertainty won't get resolved quickly," said Richard Berner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
Republican control of the White House and the Congress would rob investors of the gridlock, a divided government that made it difficult for either party to accomplish much, that many were hoping for. Wall Street, analysts mused in the weeks leading up to the election, preferred do-nothing to do-something.
While many analysts are saying that the very narrow margins of Republican control in the both the House and the Senate will keep Washington as close to gridlock as possible without a divided government, there is no assurance of that. Democrats may be willing to go along with substantial tax cuts, including a repeal of the so-called marriage penalty and a reduction, if not an elimination, of the estate tax. And Mr. Bush could be willing to give Democrats some of the spending increases they want in exchange for support. "It is not true that Bush wants his tax cut and the Democrats want fiscal rectitude," said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig & Company in Rye Brook, N.Y. "The Democrats simply have a different wish list."
In that case, Mr. Barbera said, Mr. Bush would be pursuing a budget that would stimulate the economy, even if the Federal Reserve might be seeking to slow growth. That is a combination bond investors would hate: the threat of new growth pushing inflation higher and the threat of the Fed's raising interest rates to keep growth and prices in check.
But if the economy has slowed enough to allow the Fed to shift its sights from curbing inflation to promoting growth again, then there will be little conflict.
Bond investors will also be waiting for a signal from a new Bush administration over its approach to buying back existing Treasury securities. The budget surplus, which is the reason for the buybacks, is projected to be $268 billion in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. That means the buybacks probably will continue, a positive for the bond market.
But the size of the surpluses in later years will depend on what Mr. Bush and a barely Republican Congress accomplish. Although some bond investors, like Mr. Connor of J. P. Morgan, expect them to disappear, it is still too early to handicap that prediction with any certainty.

 BODY:

MINNESOTA GORE
Vice President Al Gore was declared the winner of Minnesota's 10 electoral college votes by less than 3 percent in the wee hours of Wednesday morning. But what was surprising was that he had to fight for them at all in such a liberal state. 
 Ralph Nader ran strong here, winning more than 5 percent of the vote. But exit polls showed he did not tilt the election away from Gore; he took as many votes away from Texas Governor George W. Bush.
Rather, analysts said, Mr. Gore alienated a lot of recreational hunters by suggesting that all guns, not just handguns, should be registered.
"Word of mouth on the gun position moves very quickly, and that really hurt him," said David Lanegran, a professor of geography at Macalester College in St. Paul, who has written on the state's politics. "These are people in the suburbs who hunt, not guys in the backwoods. A lot of moderate Republicans, who might have gone for the good economy and all those normal issues, he had to struggle for.
"We're a schizophrenic state, we're liberal and conservative," Professor Lanegran added. "The great liberal leaders of the past were so charismatic, they pulled a lot of people," he said. "The liberal people today are not charismatic. Even Jesse Ventura, for all his foibles, has charisma."
Those who voted for Governor Ventura in 1998 backed Mr. Gore in greater numbers, polls showed. The state allows voters to register at the polls, a tactic that helped Mr. Ventura, and may have helped Mr. Gore. Turnout was estimated at a stunning 87 percent.
Democrats picked up a Senate seat and a House seat as well, but not without cost. Mark Dayton, an heir to the Dayton-Hudson department store fortune, spent about $11 million of his own money to beat Senator Rod Grams. Senator Grams, a Republican, had been an easy target, starting the race with unfavorable ratings almost as high as his favorable ratings. (Early on, Mr. Dayton told a newspaper he was running because he was recently divorced for the second time and wanted something to do.)
But ultimately, the state may be headed more in a Republican direction. Minnesota is expected to be redistricted, and in the State Legislature, which will decide the new boundaries, the voters gave Republicans control.

HEADLINE: Gore Takes Beijing, Not That It Counts

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 8

 BODY:
The Chaoyang District in this city is, of course, not the 51st state -- although with its ample sprinkling of Starbucks and McDonald's it bears at least a superficial resemblance to such a place.
So it was perhaps fitting that thousands of Chinese here donned red-white-and-blue campaign pins today and came out in record numbers to cast ballots for George W. Bush or Al Gore. And even as election officials in the United States grappled with a race that was too close to call, this mock election, sponsored by the American Embassy and American businesses, had unambiguous results: the votes went almost 2 to 1 for Mr. Gore. 
 "We're Gore supporters," said Ding Zhao, an 86-year-old retired engineer waving a Gore-Lieberman balloon, whose wife nonetheless sported a Bush-Cheney badge. "I think Clinton has been good to China, and I think Gore will continue that."
To mark each American presidential election over the past decade, the embassy and the local American Chamber of Commerce have sponsored an election night party, which -- with a 13-hour time difference -- takes place in the morning. This year it included the mock election, as well as a mock Uncle Sam whose pin declared, "Qing wen wo" (please ask me), and who was ready to dispense lessons about American democracy.
Past events have been poorly attended -- Chinese are often reluctant to be seen at embassy functions. But this year the party was clearly the hottest ticket in town. About 2,000 students, professors, business people, officials and others packed into a hotel ballroom stocked with Lays potato chips and Baskin Robbins ice cream -- and bedecked with posters, campaign leaflets, bunting and American flags.
With Chinese increasingly plugged into outside news via the Internet, and with China hoping soon to enter the World Trade Organization, many people in Beijing have become fixated on this faraway contest, even though most scholars here believe that the outcome will not drastically affect Chinese-American relations.
Those who cast their paper ballots today were opinionated and for the most part well informed. And, in a country whose citizens cannot elect their own leaders, the chance to debate politics and cast even a fake vote was clearly appealing.
"I think particularly young people have a very strong interest in East-West relations," said Wang Rujun, who works promoting China's special economic zones. Mr. Wang, in khakis and a windbreaker, stood undecided before the ballot box, but ultimately put his check beside Mr. Gore's name.
"I think that in the future we may have this kind of election here, too," he remarked.
Vice President Gore might have wished he was in Beijing today, as this was clearly Gore country; a cheer went up from the crowd as CNN announced that he had taken California. Not everyone who came to the party voted, but the final tally was: Mr. Gore, 762; Mr. Bush, 396; Ralph Nader, 23: Patrick J. Buchanan, 2.
The American Embassy and American businesses in China had faxed out thousands of invitations, but many people skipped class or work on this Wednesday morning to crash the party, after hearing about it from friends.
It was a typical campaign night scene, as the overflow crowd, a mix of tension and exuberance, bunched around televisions tuned to CNN for state tallies and commentary from Larry King.
"I voted for Gore today because I think he looks nice and Bush was not a good student -- a bad boy," said Georgie Yin, a journalist with a state newspaper. "Also, Gore has been vice president for eight years and has experience."
But, overhearing her comments, others piped up to disagree: "I like Bush because I think he's more realistic about U.S.-China relations," said Ma Zongshi, a senior researcher at a government research group, who was wearing a suit and a tan baseball cap. "I don't like his policy to get tough with China, but I don't think he'll ever send troops or anything like that."
But Mr. Ma forlornly predicted that America's prosperity would lead to a Gore victory, adding: "What is the expression you use? 'It's economics, stupid.' "
Many in the crowd said they had followed the election on the Internet and CNN, which is increasingly available in Beijing's upscale housing complexes. And while the crowd included a smattering of foreign policy experts who are paid to follow these things, it was more or less a cross section of young professional Beijingers who came because they were interested.
"I saw the last two debates on CNN," said Ma Zhong, an investment adviser in his 30's. "And I thought Gore did a better job."
He said he worried some about how the candidates would handle the delicate Taiwan issue. But, like most of the crowd, he said he did not take campaign statements too seriously. He predicted that the two candidates would maintain the policy of engagement, with American business interests taking precedence over partisan politics and ideology.
"Before they became president," Mr. Ma said, "both Bush -- the father -- and Clinton were very harsh toward China. But afterward they couldn't stay away."

HEADLINE: Brown U. Breaks Ground In Picking Black as Chief

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG 

 BODY:
Ruth J. Simmons, the president of Smith College and the youngest of 12 children of a Texas sharecropper, is expected to be appointed the new president of Brown University today.
In voting yesterday afternoon to name Dr. Simmons the 18th president since the university's founding in 1764, the 54 officers of the Brown Corporation will make academic history: she will be the first black president of an Ivy League institution. 
 Dr. Simmons will succeed E. Gordon Gee, who left Brown's Providence, R.I., campus abruptly nine months ago, after only two years in office, to become president of Vanderbilt University, in Tennessee.
In choosing Dr. Simmons, 54, the members of the corporation said that they were impressed not only by her biography -- she was raised poor in Houston, and later received a doctorate in romance languages from Harvard -- but by the example that she would set for the student body, said Stephen Robert, the chancellor of the university and chairman of the presidential search committee.
"They say nothing is felt until experienced," said Mr. Robert, who graduated from Brown in 1962 and is the former chairman of the Oppenheimer Company, the investment bank and money management firm. "She's experienced the other side of this life. She knows what higher education accomplished for her."
Judith McLaughlin, who leads a seminar for new college presidents at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, said Brown's selection of Dr. Simmons represented "a wonderful statement in higher education," considering that "people look to the Ivy League as places of excellence."
"At the same time that there have been debates over whether access and excellence can coexist," Ms. McLaughlin added, "Ruth Simmons shows in her person that they can."
While at Smith, a storied women's college in Western Massachusetts whose 2,500-student campus is dwarfed by the 7,300 students who attend undergraduate and graduate classes at Brown, Dr. Simmons sought to improve academic life in a number of areas. During her five-year tenure, the endowment nearly doubled, to $900 million from about $450 million. She also garnered national attention by establishing the first engineering program at a women's college, instituting a curriculum-wide focus on public speaking and providing a paid internship for every undergraduate.
But in an interview yesterday, Dr. Simmons said she also took pride in less flashy accomplishments of her tenure, like creating the post of provost and simplifying the lines of administrative communication.
"That's the kind of thing I like, the hidden things," she said. "It's like cleaning. Some people clean just enough so that what you see looks good. I clean so that you can move the chair out of the way and not find dust bunnies under it."
Dr. Simmons' analogy was especially poignant because her mother, whose formal education ended in the seventh grade and who died when her youngest daughter was 15, had worked as a domestic.
Since Mr. Gee's departure, Brown has been led by an interim president, Sheila E. Blumstein. Upon Dr. Simmons's arrival on July 1, Dr. Blumstein will return to teaching linguistics and cognitive science. A spokeswoman said that she did not know Dr. Simmons's new salary but that Mr. Gee had earned about $300,000.
Brown officials had hoped to keep Dr. Simmons's appointment a secret until today's vote was concluded, but the student newspaper, The Brown Daily Herald, broke the story yesterday. As word of the uncertainty in the United States presidential election spread on campus, it was tempered by welcome news: that the instability touched off by Mr. Gee's sudden exit was nearing an end.
"I think she got the job because she can do the job well," said Matthew Shechmeister, 20, a sophomore from Menlo Park, Calif., who is studying political science. "Brown was liberal enough that it was willing to take a look at her."
But Mark Scott, 21, a junior from Montreal, said Dr. Simmons' race would be an asset to a school with a reputation as being among the most liberal in the nation. "Someone will step up and notice a black woman as president of an Ivy League university," he said.
At Smith, where word of Dr. Simmons' departure next summer had barely reached the student body, Milka Dennis, president of the Class of 2004, reacted with sad disbelief.
"I would be really heartbroken," said Ms. Dennis, an economics major from Miami. "She spoke at Discovery Weekend, an information session for prospective applicants of color, and influenced me to come to Smith College. If Smith deserved a great president like her, they deserved great students like me."
Still, Rachel Leifer, the features editor of The Sophian, the Smith student newspaper, said she had grown weary of Dr. Simmons's railing against college students' "mall speak," specifically their overreliance on "like" and "um."
"I'm not that upset to see her go," Ms. Leifer said.
Before becoming the first black woman to lead Smith, in 1995, Dr. Simmons made several critical stops in her journey through the academy.
As a high school senior, she won a $1,000 scholarship to Dillard University in New Orleans, from which she graduated, summa cum laude, in 1967. After getting her masters and Ph.D. at Harvard, Dr. Simmons taught French at the University of New Orleans.
She later served in several capacities at Princeton University: as the acting director of the Afro-American studies program and as assistant dean and associate dean of the faculty. In the early 1990's, she worked as the provost of Spelman College.
Perhaps mindful that a faculty can make or break a president's tenure before it begins -- and that Mr. Gee had alienated some professors -- Dr. Simmons said her priorities at Brown would include improving "faculty resources," which she defined as leaves, salaries and research support.
And even though Brown's endowment has grown to $1.5 billion, nearly double that of Smith's, it pales among those of other Ivy League institutions. She said she worried that it was too small to accomplish what she wanted.
"I know that sounds like a billionaire complaining he's not as rich as Bill Gates," she said, laughing. "It's not a dire situation, by any stretch."

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY;
Executive Assesses Her Adventure At a Dot-Com

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN 

 BODY:
When Heidi G. Miller quit her job in February as the highest-ranking woman at Citigroup to join Priceline.com, the online travel agency, her move was heralded as a stunning signal that the new economy was eclipsing the old one.
Now that Ms. Miller has abruptly resigned from Priceline and is looking for work, her brief adventure in cyberspace is being cited as confirmation that the dot-coms are dead. But Ms. Miller says that she never was a true believer -- and, likewise, that she has not lost all faith, despite the turnabout that has slashed Priceline's share price by more than 90 percent and left her options on the company's stock virtually worthless. 
 "The general perception was the dot-coms were all golden and now they're all dirt," Ms. Miller, 47, said in an interview this week. And though neither assessment was accurate, she added, the shift in investor thinking has greatly impaired the growth prospects of Internet-based start-ups and wiped away much of their appeal to experienced executives like her.
Ms. Miller walked away from Priceline's headquarters in Norwalk, Conn., last week after the company -- still struggling to turn a profit -- decided to retrench and lay off 16 percent of its employees.
Others also bailed out: Maryann Keller, a longtime Wall Street automotive analyst, quit as president of Priceline's online car-buying service, and Bill Pike, a financial executive who had followed Ms. Miller from Citigroup, also resigned.
Shares of Priceline fell $1.03, to $3.25, a new low.
"A workout situation requires a different type of team and attitude," Ms. Miller said. "I didn't want to do that at this time in my career."
The collapse of Internet stocks since last spring has slowed a brain drain from established companies that had caused headhunters to work overtime and propelled pay packages heavenward. The value of Ms. Miller's Priceline options briefly shot up to more than $40 million last March, before crashing to earth.
Even in that context, Ms. Miller's hasty retreat resounded through executive suites, because "Heidi was and is an 'A' player," said Rick Savior, an executive recruiter who specializes in technology companies at the Directorship Search Group in Manhattan. Ms. Miller said she was fielding offers from a variety of organizations, including philanthropic groups.
Ms. Miller expressed no sorrow for investors who had bought Priceline's stock on her arrival, having interpreted her move as a buy recommendation from a savvy Wall Street veteran. "Investment decisions are different from career decisions," she said, adding that she was motivated not by the lucre of Internet stock options but by "personal decisions about what I wanted to learn."
And learn she did, about electronic commerce and about building a consumer brand, Ms. Miller said. but she also found that dot-com enterprises are not all that different from more traditional established corporations.
In particular, she said, she no longer believed that the new economy was any more hospitable to women executives than the old one.
Shortly after she left Citigroup, Ms. Miller said of her experience there: "I know I've had a very good run, but that doesn't excuse what I know to be real bias." At the time, she said she expected a start-up like Priceline would be a better place for women to flourish.
Now, she says, she "never bought that idea." Describing herself as a radical feminist, Ms. Miller explained, "I don't think young men are any less biased than old men are." In that regard, she said, "dot-coms are smaller versions of big corporations." So would she join another Internet-based company? "Only if I were totally in control," Ms. Miller said.
She declined to talk about decisions made by her superiors at Priceline with which she disagreed, saying only that there were "differences of opinion about what the right thing might be."
Brian Ek, a spokesman for Priceline, said company executives would have no comment about Ms. Miller's departure beyond what Daniel H. Schulman, the chief executive, said in a statement last week. In part, Mr. Schulman said, "We know she is supportive of the long-term direction the company is taking and wish her the best in her future endeavors."
A lack of authority was one of Ms. Miller's reasons for leaving Citigroup. A favored lieutenant of the Citigroup chairman. Sanford I. Weill, Ms. Miller, as the financial company's chief financial officer, apparently wielded influence and had a bright future. Last year, Fortune magazine ranked her as the second-most-powerful woman in corporate America, behind Carly Fiorina, the chief executive of Hewlett-Packard.
But she found her job on Wall Street constricting, and has said that she was frustrated in her desire to run a business at Citigroup. "I had a great run at Citi and Sandy did lots for me," Ms. Miller said. "But at the end of the day, only one person makes the decisions."
Mr. Weill has not called, she said, but James Dimon, a friend and former colleague who is chairman and chief executive of the Bank One Corporation in Chicago, has. Mr. Dimon urged her to call him before making her next move, she said, though she indicated she had no intention of uprooting from her home in Connecticut to join him in Chicago.
She also played down the chances that she would return to being a corporate chief financial officer, saying "been there, done that." Otherwise, her future is not clear, she said.
She dropped this year to No. 20 on Fortune's list of powerful women, and she said she was not in a hurry to shoot back up that chart despite a ribbing from her son about why she had slipped so far.
"Career paths are not linear," she said. "It's not about going from No. 2 to No. 1 on a list, and the score is not about how much money you have."
She clearly bristles at being labeled an "Internet loser," a tag Forbes magazine stuck on her recently. But she said she was not looking back in anger at her colleagues at Priceline or friends who advised her to go there, like Nancy Peretsman, an investment banker at Allen & Company, and William Ford, a venture capitalist at General Atlantic Partners. Ms. Peretsman, an investor in Priceline, introduced Ms. Miller to Priceline's founder, Jay Walker, at a holiday party in 1999.
"I'm certainly smart enough to have understood what I was getting into," she said. "I don't feel I made a big mistake."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Wall Street Wants a Winner

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
Unnerved slightly by the unresolved presidential election and concerned about a slowdown in profit growth for technology stocks, investors sent the American financial markets lower in tepid trading yesterday.
For much of the day, the unanswered question of whether Gov. George W. Bush or Vice President Al Gore would replace Bill Clinton in the White House did not seem to bother investors. 
 Stocks opened broadly higher, though the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index quickly turned sour after an analyst published a negative report on optical networking companies, some of the Nasdaq's most important stocks.
But stocks slid lower throughout the afternoon and closed down across the board. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 22.59 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,409.28, while the Nasdaq plunged 184.09 points, or 5.4 percent, to 3,231.70. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 45.12 points, to 10,907.06, a 0.4 percent drop. Treasury bonds and the dollar showed little change.
Investors still appear to believe that Mr. Bush will win, since cigarette and energy companies and drug makers, which are perceived as likely to benefit if Mr. Bush is elected, all rose. Philip Morris, the leading tobacco company, rose $1.75, to $36.75, while the drug maker Merck leaped $3.81, to $90.81.
But the closeness of Tuesday's vote has denied either Mr. Bush or Mr. Gore a mandate for their proposals, professional stock strategists and money managers said. After a day of uncertainty, Wall Street does not particularly care who wins, as long as the election is quickly resolved, they said.
"Markets hate uncertainty," said Fred Kobrick, chief executive of Kobrick Funds, which manages more than $1 billion. "This was a worry day; a lack of leadership; don't know where the market is going; may take forever to get a president."
In another sign of Wall Street's confusion, Microsoft, which investors believe would benefit from a Bush victory, rose as high as $72.38, a $1.88 rise, before giving up its gains on broader concerns about technology stocks. It closed the day at $69.44, down $1.06. Other technology companies fared much worse.
The chip maker Intel sagged $3.50, to $42.69, while the computer storage manufacturer EMC slid $7.50, to $90.
Optical networking equipment companies, which are among the most highly valued and volatile Nasdaq stocks, fell heavily in the face of a report from Bluestone Capital that warned of waning demand and called the stocks overpriced.
Cisco Systems fell $4.63, to $52.13, while Juniper Networks plunged $22.50, to $188.19.
The weakness in technology stocks was mainly unrelated to the election, said Byron Wien, strategist for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "There were still some excesses in the Nasdaq," Mr. Wien said. But he warned that the markets were likely to remain unsettled until Mr. Bush or Mr. Gore was declared the winner.
Once that happens, investors may return to stocks again, said Charles Pradilla, chief investment officer at SG Cowen. Like other analysts, Mr. Pradilla assumes that the close election means more gridlock in Washington, with neither big tax cuts nor big new spending programs on the horizon.
And with the United States in the midst of the longest economic expansion in its history, investors should be happy with a stalemate, he said. "This is the best of all possible results," Mr. Pradilla said. "The background economics remain superb, and if you want to keep those unmolested, this political outcome is the best that you could have."
Wall Street's conventional wisdom is that a Bush victory will provide a short-term boon for stocks, especially those of the drug makers, tobacco companies, health maintenance organizations, energy companies and military contractors.
Neil B. Sweig, an analyst at Ryan, Beck & Company, said drug stocks rose yesterday because investors continued to believe that Mr. Bush would win. But if Mr. Gore is declared the winner, "drug stocks will come crashing down," he said. "We're truly in a twilight zone."
A Bush victory might hurt bonds, because the big tax cut that Mr. Bush has proposed could eat up the federal government's surplus. Such a tax cut could also stimulate excessive economic growth and inflationary pressures, forcing the Federal Reserve's policy makers to raise short-term interest rates to slow the economy.
Financial stocks, which might suffer if rates rise, also dropped slightly, though it was unclear whether the drop was related to fears of a Bush tax cut or broader investor unease about the election. Chase Manhattan dropped $1.26, to $43.63, while Citigroup dropped $1.69, to $53.06.
Because stocks are unlikely to rise for very long if bond yields increase and prices fall, investor euphoria over a Bush victory may not last, said Hugh Johnson, chairman and president of First Albany Asset Management, which invests $630 million.
If Mr. Bush wins, "life is going to be made more difficult for the Federal Reserve," Mr. Johnson said.
On the other hand, bond investors may view a Gore victory as more positive for bonds, because Mr. Gore has proposed smaller tax cuts than Mr. Bush has.
But Mr. Gore has unnerved some investors, who are concerned he may be unfriendly to business. Mr. Gore proposed an expansion in Medicare prescription drug benefits that the pharmaceutical industry fears and has sharply attacked big oil companies. He is also part of an administration that has sued to force the breakup of Microsoft.
Now, neither candidate can claim much support for his proposals, Mr. Johnson said. "There's pretty clearly no mandate -- that's the understatement of the year," he said.
If Mr. Gore wins, he will have to work with Republican majorities in both the House and Senate to pass legislation, which will force sides to moderate their policies, Mr. Johnson said.
If Mr. Bush wins, the Republicans will control the presidency and the Congress for the first time since the 1953-1955 period.
But they will have tiny majorities in both houses of Congress, and Mr. Bush will have won despite receiving a minority of the popular vote. That hardly indicates overwhelming support for Mr. Bush's proposed tax cuts, said Jeff Applegate, chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers.
"The notion that Congress is going to pass a $1.3 trillion tax cut in the first three months of 2001 is just out the window," Mr. Applegate said. "Rather than a landslide, we got a mudslide -- a mudslide that effectively submerges the prospect of any significant change in U.S. fiscal policy."

HEADLINE: U.S. Plans a Lottery System To Cut La Guardia Flights

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
The Federal Aviation Administration said yesterday that it planned to reduce the number of flights at La Guardia Airport to relieve congestion until it could find a way to restructure airport fees nationwide to discourage gridlock during peak flying times.
At La Guardia, the rationing plan is expected to force the cancellation of more than 75 flights a day, some that are already in operation and others that airlines have sold tickets for and that are scheduled to begin over the next three months. 
 The F.A.A. and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the region's three largest airports, said they would not know which flights would be canceled for at least a month, until they begin to allocate takeoff and landing slots to airlines by lottery. A lottery has been used only rarely in the past to distribute precious landing slots at overcrowded airports.
Federal officials acknowledged that the cancellation of flights would be painful, especially as the holiday season was approaching, but they said that it was the only way to bring some temporary relief to the airport, until a more sweeping solution could be found.
"The F.A.A. recognized that if we did not act, this situation could only worsen," said Eliot Brenner, a spokesman for the agency. "The reality of flying into La Guardia today is that a number of flights are getting canceled anyway because of the time length of the delays. So the issue of whether or not there might be flights canceled is -- I don't want to say moot -- but not as important as it might seem."
Federal officials said the Port Authority, which in September announced a moratorium on any more flights being added at La Guardia, had recently proposed the idea of using a lottery to ration slots.
The F.A.A. agreed because of how rapidly conditions at La Guardia were worsening, contributing to delays at other airports across the country.
The quick rise in flights at La Guardia began about six months ago, the result of a federal law passed in March that partly lifted flight restrictions at the busy airport. That measure created more slots, mostly for smaller regional jets that fly to underserved cities.
Airlines rushed to grab the slots, the first new ones in decades because La Guardia's traffic had long been limited to about 600 daily flights under federal law. But the new flights began to swamp the airport.
As of last week, about 100 new daily flights -- meaning 200 takeoffs and landings -- had been added at the airport, which was already near maximum capacity. Airlines had filed requests to add as many as 300 total new daily flights, and were beginning to schedule and sell some of those.
But the plan announced yesterday would restrict the number of new flights to about 75. The lottery, which federal officials say they hope will be held at the end of this month in New York, would give priority to the newest airlines at La Guardia. It would also favor those carriers providing regional service, the kinds of airlines that were supposed to be helped by the federal legislation passed in March.
The officials stressed, however, that the lottery rationing plan would be only temporary, probably lasting until the middle of September 2001. After that, the F.A.A. said, it plans to begin a nationwide plan for changing the way airlines are charged for takeoff and landings.
The main idea being considered, known as congestion pricing, is a favorite of many economists and has been debated by the federal government and airports for years. In the late 1980's, Logan International Airport in Boston tried a version of it, imposing new landing fees to try to discourage private airplanes and small commercial airlines from using the airport during peak times. But the Reagan administration overruled that plan, saying that the fees illegally discriminated against the small planes and airlines.
The Port Authority, which has been contending with increasing delays at all three of its airports, has long been considering some form of congestion pricing. The idea would be to charge airlines more for landing during peak times or to use other fees that would give airlines incentives, for example, to schedule flights during less busy times or to use larger planes. Traditionally, airport landing fees have been based on a plane's weight, with higher costs for larger planes.
Airlines point out that higher fees during peak times would most likely be passed along to passengers.
The fact that federal officials now seem to be seriously considering what they call market-based ways to reduce the nation's growing air delays is a clear indication of the extent of the problems nationwide.
And the F.A.A. regards La Guardia as a kind of bellwether. During September, there were 9,000 flight delays at the airport, up from 3,108 in the same month a year before. The delays were so extensive, in fact, that they accounted for fully a quarter of all the flight delays in the country in September.
"These delays are translating into disrupted airline schedules, cancellations and frustrated air travelers across the U.S.," wrote Jane F. Garvey, the F.A.A. administrator, in a letter sent yesterday to Robert E. Boyle, the executive director of the Port Authority. Mr. Boyle characterized conditions at the airport as intolerable.
The airlines that serve La Guardia reacted cautiously yesterday after a two-hour meeting in which they were presented with the lottery rationing idea by officials from the Port Authority and the F.A.A.
In a prepared statement, Delta Airlines signaled gently that it questioned whether the F.A.A.'s plan violated the spirit, if not the letter, of the federal law that created more slots.
"We're studying the proposal to determine whether an approach that would significantly reduce operations achieves our mutual goals and preserves the mandate of the legislation to increase access and service from La Guardia to small, underserved markets," the airline said.
But F.A.A. officials emphasized yesterday that they were given power under the legislation to make changes if the amount of traffic created by the law began to overburden airports.

HEADLINE: U.S. Taking Mexico Phone Dispute to W.T.O.

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

 BODY:
Trade officials in Washington made good on a threat yesterday and decided to bring Mexico, the United States' second-largest trading partner, before the World Trade Organization and accuse it of failing to open the $12 billion Mexican telecommunications industry to competition.
The United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, announced that despite a brief thaw last month that lowered tensions between the two countries over the longstanding dispute, Washington would file a complaint against Mexico for hearing by a dispute-settlement panel of the W.T.O. "While some progress has been made," Ms. Barshefsky said in a statement, "Mexico's failure to take additional actions has left us no choice but to request a W.T.O. panel." 
 Jorge Nicolin, president of the Federal Telecommunications Commission in Mexico, said that the complaints made by Ms. Barshefsky's office were unfair and that Mexico would successfully defend its position before the W.T.O.
"They are pressing us because of the coming end of the administration," he said. When asked whether he was referring to the remaining time of President Ernesto Zedillo's government, which ends on Nov. 30, or of President Clinton's, Mr. Nicolin responded, "Both."
The cross-border feud over phone rates and the opening of the market has gone on most of this year, with each side accusing the other of not living up to international trade standards. In recent weeks, Mexican regulators issued rules instructing Telefonos de Mexico, the privatized company that dominates long-distance and local service, to lower its fees for connecting rivals' long-distance calls to its local network.
The regulators also tried to force Telmex to comply more fully with measures to allow competitors greater access to Mexico's telephone system, over which Telmex exercised a monopoly until 1997.
But soon after the new regulations were issued, Telmex filed legal challenges against them in the Mexican courts. In addition, United States officials say Mexico enforces telecommunications regulations reluctantly and allows Telmex to use its market strength to preserve its dominant position and deny competitors timely connections to its network.
Its two principal competitors in long-distance service, Alestra and Avantel, are partly owned by American telecommunications giants that have brought their complaints before the trade representative's office. They argued that the rates Telmex charged to connect long-distance calls to the local network were too high. They also contended that Telmex, asked to provide access, offered inferior lines and on occasion denied access altogether.
AT&T, which holds a 49 percent stake in Alestra, and WorldCom, a 45 percent partner in Avantel, have argued that Mexican regulators are allowing Telmex to obstruct competition and keep the bulk of the Mexican market to itself.
While no longer a state monopoly, Telmex has given up little ground to the newcomers since 1997, when competition was first allowed in long-distance service. It now controls 81 percent of long-distance customers and more than 95 percent in local service, where independent companies arrived just last year.
After a series of meetings and consultations, Mexico issued rules last month to force Telmex to open itself more fully to competition. After regulators also lowered connection rates to 1.26 cents a minute from 3.36 cents, American officials decided not to go ahead immediately with a complaint against Mexico begun in August, though they threatened to resume the process if clear progress was not being made. Ms. Barshefsky also wanted Mexico to address concerns about the high rates charged for phone calls between the United States and Mexico.
Telmex's legal challenges, along with government inaction on rates, led Washington to act, Ms. Barshefsky said.
After receiving the complaint, the W.T.O. will form a dispute settlement panel to hear the complaints. Mexican officials will then have a chance to respond to the charges before a ruling is issued.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 ELECTIONS: THE VOTERS;
After Months of Uncertainty, 3 Votes Go to Mrs. Clinton

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS 

 BODY:
Doug Taggart had decided midway through the first debate between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Rick A. Lazio that Mr. Lazio was not fit to fill the United States Senate seat being vacated by Daniel Patrick Moynihan. That was the easy part.
Then he had to fight with his conscience, as he put it, about whether Mrs. Clinton had "earned" his vote, the high standard that Mr. Taggart, a Wall Street executive, says he applies each time he enters a voting booth. 
 Mr. Taggart has withheld his vote before, most recently in the acidic 1992 Senate race between Robert Abrams and Alfonse M. D'Amato. And he was still considering doing just that yesterday when he closed the curtain at his polling place in the Westchester County community of Cortlandt Manor. He was still undecided, he said, as he pulled the other levers -- for president, Congress, the State Legislature and the judiciary.
Only after all his other votes were cast did Mr. Taggart swallow hard, mentally review "all the negatives against Lazio and the absolute hatred for Hillary by his supporters" and choose the first lady.
"I did not feel satisfied except in exercising my rights as a citizen of the greatest country on earth," he said. "I hope I don't feel like a fool a few months or years down the line."
Mr. Taggart was one of 11 undecided voters who began sharing their thoughts on the Senate race with The New York Times last December. As Election Day drew near, only three remained uncommitted. All three, in the end, voted for Mrs. Clinton because, they said, despite their many reservations about her, she waged a dogged campaign, spent more time than her opponent speaking about the issues and less time on the attack.
Bob Harrison, a social studies teacher from Amsterdam, N.Y., an Albany suburb, said he arrived at his polling place free of angst. He had been edging toward a vote for Mrs. Clinton since deciding that her interest in the upstate economy was more sustained than Mr. Lazio's.
"I was positive what I was doing," Mr. Harrison said. "She's senatorial in terms of her policy and ideas about the economy, health care and education. She's going to do what's best for New York."
In Saugerties, N.Y., Tom Smith, a customer service manager at Wal-Mart, also said it "felt right," when all was said and done, to pick Mrs. Clinton. "I didn't like the way Lazio presented himself," he said. "He was so busy attacking that what he was going to do never came forth."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 ELECTIONS: THE BALLOT INITIATIVES;
Changes in Drug Policy And Gun Laws Are Picked

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Nov. 8

 BODY:
Among the winners: drug policy reform, gun control, all-English education. Among the losers: school vouchers, gay rights, sprawl containment.
Such were the general outlines emerging today from votes on more than 200 state ballot initiatives around the country. 
 The initiatives addressed some of the knottier social issues facing the country, like doctor-assisted suicide -- which was narrowly voted down in Maine -- and universal health care coverage, which was also narrowly defeated, in Massachusetts.
Changes in state drug laws were approved in five states. California approved, by 3 to 2, a measure requiring people convicted of drug possession or use to get treatment rather than going to jail. The proposition calls for $120 million a year to be spent on treatment for the 36,000 people expected to qualify, but its supporters say it will save more than that in prison costs.
A measure in Massachusetts that would also have allowed some minor drug dealers to avoid jail was narrowly defeated after law enforcement officials warned that it was too easy on dealers. And in Alaska, voters overwhelmingly rejected a measure that would have made their state by far the most liberal in the nation when it came to marijuana. It would have legalized the use of marijuana for people age 18 and over, and granted retroactive amnesty to people who had been convicted of marijuana crimes in the past.
But those defeats were the exception on drug policy: In Nevada and Colorado, voters approved initiatives legalizing the medical use of marijuana, bringing the total of states with such laws to eight.
In addition, voters in Mendocino County in Northern California approved, 58 percent to 42 percent, a measure that would allow a resident to cultivate up to 25 marijuana plants and directing sheriffs to make the arrest of small-scale growers their lowest priority. The initiative does not overrule state and federal laws, so it is largely symbolic, but it does mark a first in local marijuana measures, which have previously focused mainly on decriminalizing possession.
Colorado and Oregon easily passed ballot initiatives to require background checks of buyers even at gun shows, where federal law does not require such investigations. They passed despite heavy spending by gun advocates and amounted to a popular rebuke to legislatures that had rejected such measures.
In Colorado, where the massacre at Columbine High School left 15 dead last year, the measure passed 70 percent to 30 percent, spurred on in part by the parent of a Columbine victim. And in Oregon, where 15-year-old Kipland P. Kinkel went on a shooting rampage in 1998, killing his parents and two others, it passed 61 to 39 percent.
Arizona voters passed an initiative that would replace bilingual education with one-year immersion classes meant to bring pupils up to speed in English. The measure was backed by a businessman who supported a similar measure in California two years ago, with similar success.
School voucher advocates had no such success. In California, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, Timothy Draper, spent millions pushing for a measure giving a $4,000 voucher to every schoolchild, but voters rejected it by a margin of 71 percent to 29 percent. A proposition in Michigan, which would have given vouchers worth about $3,300 only to pupils in bad school districts, went down to defeat by a margin of 69 percent to 31 percent.
Votes against gay rights in three states might not have been as bad a sign for their supporters as they looked, some advocates say.
In Maine, voters narrowly defeated a measure that would have made it illegal to discriminate against gays and lesbians in housing, employment and other spheres. Maine's legislature had passed such an anti-discrimination measure in 1997, but it was then narrowly repealed in a special referendum vote in 1998. This latest ballot initiative had been a chance for Mainers to rethink that repeal, but apparently too few people changed their minds.
Tony Giampetruzzi, the spokesman for advocates of the anti-discrimination measure, said the campaign had been hurt by shortfalls in fund-raising but also because "this time they had that little extra bit of ammunition regarding Vermont."
Vermont's decision this year to legalize marriagelike civil unions for gay couples also changed the context for two measures directly concerning gay marriage: the measures barring the recognition of gay marriage passed in both Nebraska and Nevada by the same margin, 70 percent to 30 percent.
But in a narrow victory for gay rights, Oregon voters apparently rejected a measure that would have banned any teaching in public schools that sanctioned homosexuality. According to unofficial returns, it went down 51 percent to 49 percent.
As for sprawl, proposals to require growth management plans for many communities each received support from only 30 percent of voters in Colorado and Arizona. Opponents had warned that caps on urban growth could mean limits on economic growth in general.
"We still consider the election a victory," said Elise Jones, a spokeswoman for the anti-sprawl campaign in Colorado. "We fundamentally changed the debate on growth in Colorado forever."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 ELECTIONS: THE VICTOR;
First Lady Emerges From Shadow And Begins to Cast Her Own

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER and DEAN E. MURPHY 

 BODY:
Hillary Rodham Clinton began the remarkable transition yesterday from a quarter-century of derivative power as a political spouse to a potent force in her own right. The world's most famous first lady and senator-elect held a love-fest of a news conference, said that her first bill would be to improve the upstate economy and fended off the inevitable question about whether she would seek the White House in 2004.
"No," she said briskly in otherwise relaxed remarks to reporters at the Grand Hyatt in Manhattan yesterday afternoon. "I'm going to serve my six years as the junior senator from New York." 
 Although there were few in New York who believed that a woman who routinely attracts a presidential-size flotilla of news media would ever really operate as "junior," Mrs. Clinton began turning her attention yesterday to the practicalities of hiring a Senate staff, perhaps as few as 25 people in Washington, that will face demands like no others on Capitol Hill. If Al Gore loses, Mrs. Clinton will be perhaps the most important Democrat in the country. She will lose that status if Mr. Gore wins, but then she will have more power in Washington.
"She's going to be under incredible scrutiny, and she's still a polarizing figure to some degree in the state," one of Mrs. Clinton's advisers said shortly after the first lady's victory speech on Tuesday night. "She needs knowledgeable people who really know the Hill, Washington and New York."
Mrs. Clinton also said that over the next two months she would try to balance her remaining time as first lady with the preoccupations of a senator-elect. Today, for example, Mrs. Clinton is to attend a White House dinner as the wife of the president. Tomorrow she is to be the senator-elect on a statewide fly-around, thanking New Yorkers for a 12-point margin of victory over Representative Rick A. Lazio that almost no one expected. Next week, Mrs. Clinton will again be first lady as she accompanies her husband on a trip to Vietnam.
At the same time, Mrs. Clinton extravagantly thanked the president, who had operated throughout the race as her chief political adviser, for his help.
"I would not have been standing there without the support and work of my husband," she said. "And I don't think as a New Democrat I would have been standing there without his leadership of the Democratic Party and our country. You've heard me say many times over, and I absolutely believe it, that his leadership made a tremendous difference in our nation."
The first lady also said that she would welcome less attention at the close of the most obsessively covered Senate race in history. "I don't expect this much attention after today," Mrs. Clinton said, looking out at a room so full of journalists and camera crews that many were standing outside the doors. "So I think I will have more of an opportunity to get down to the work of becoming a senator and becoming effective."
But many New York Democrats viewed Mrs. Clinton's words as nothing more than wishful thinking, and said that she and her sometimes rocky marriage would always be a staple of the supermarket tabloids. Hundreds of supporters at the first lady's election night celebration could not help noticing that Mrs. Clinton -- perhaps in an effort to underscore that the Senate victory was hers alone -- made no effort to pose next to her husband in the signature victory photograph with arms raised. Instead, she stood between the Clintons' daughter, Chelsea, and Senator Charles E. Schumer. But in a more private moment afterward, she took the hand of the president as the two left the stage.
Friends say that the first lady's acquisition of power as the president gives up his will require inevitable adjustments in the Clintons' marriage -- something that the first lady joked about last month. "He has said he is looking forward to being a member of the Senate spouses' club," Mrs. Clinton said in Queens on Oct. 26. "I am sure, given his organizational abilities and his energy, the spouses' club will never be the same."
Although the Senate campaign degenerated in its final weeks into a series of angry, partisan exchanges about Palestinian terrorists, campaign contributions and character, Mrs. Clinton said yesterday that she was ready to work with Republicans. She said she had already spoken on the phone with Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Republican from Utah, and also Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, her Senate opponent before he dropped out of the race, citing prostate cancer.
"He and I talked about what we could do in the remaining year of his term," Mrs. Clinton said in describing her conversation with the mayor, who will leave office on Dec. 31, 2001.
Mr. Giuliani, who for the last year and a half roared at the first lady as a carpetbagger whose candidacy made no sense in New York, was suddenly lamblike yesterday morning as he spoke of the new political colleague who was replacing the retiring Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
"I told her that I would do everything that I could as the mayor of New York City to work with her, for the good of the city and the state," Mr. Giuliani said in a news conference at City Hall.
Mr. Giuliani also congratulated Mrs. Clinton on her victory. "She is entitled, as I told her, to a great deal of credit," he said. "She ran a very, very strong, tough campaign, she worked very hard, and when you are in this business you can admire even people who are on the other side, and adversaries, when they have a very, very strong work ethic as she does."
One of Mrs. Clinton's first tasks in the next few months is to find a place to live in Washington after she leaves the White House. Although Mr. Schumer, who lives with his family in Brooklyn, has shared the same small house on Capitol Hill with two colleagues for two decades, friends said it was unlikely that the first lady would adopt a similar arrangement, largely because of the security requirements of also housing a former president. But in the short run, said Mrs. Clinton's White House press secretary, Lissa Muscatine, temporary arrangements would do.
"I don't think she's had time to focus on where she wants to live," Ms. Muscatine said. "If worse comes to worse, I'm sure she has plenty of friends who would let her sleep on their sofas for a few nights."
Friends also said they expected the Clintons to keep their $1.7 million, five-bedroom Dutch Colonial in Chappaqua as their primary residence, even though there have been reports in The New York Post, denied by Mrs. Clinton's campaign, that the couple is looking for an apartment in New York City.
As for the presidency, Mrs. Clinton's disclaimer has done little so far to tamp down speculation that she will be a candidate -- if not in 2004, then in 2008, or later.
"Of course she'll run," said Mr. Moynihan.

New York Officials to Issue Rules on Insurance Privacy
New York is taking the lead among other states as insurance regulators issue new rules on privacy now that banks, insurance companies and brokerage firms can be jointly owned.
New York will permit insurance companies to share financial details about a customer unless the customer specifically objects. Taking a tougher stance on health information, the state will not permit sharing unless a customer specifically grants permission. Both consumer advocates and insurers immediately raised objections. Page C7. 

Argentina Clears Financial Hurdle
Argentina's auction of $1.1 billion in treasury bills this week has put the government over a major short-term financial hurdle, but the borrowing costs -- at rates reaching 16 percent -- reflect growing worries that even higher political and economic hurdles lie ahead. Tax receipts this year have been disappointing, and a still-unresolved Senate bribery scandal has led in recent weeks to the resignation of the vice president, a shake-up of the cabinet and persistent doubts about President Fernando de la Rua's ability to govern. C7.
 
Creditors Pull the Plug on Daewoo
Creditors cut off the money that was keeping Daewoo Motor afloat, forcing it into bankruptcy. The move came after Daewoo's union refused to accept layoffs and pay cuts aimed at making it an attractive acquisition for General Motors. World Business, Section W.
 
U.S. to Bring Mexico Before W.T.O.
Trade officials made good on a threat and decided to bring Mexico -- the United States' second-largest trading partner -- before the World Trade Organization and accuse the nation of failing to open its $12 billion telecommunications industry to competition. C6.
 
Profit Off 10% at News Corporation
The News Corporation, which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch, said that its first-quarter profit fell 10 percent because of lower ratings at the Fox television network. C15.
 
New Index on Internet Sponsorships
A system to measure the effectiveness of Internet sponsorships as a brand-building tool for advertisers is being introduced this week. The index measures variables like product awareness and intends to address the concerns of marketers about Internet advertising as the medium comes under scrutiny as never before.

Interbrew to Offer Stock to Public
Interbrew said it would seek to raise as much as $2.8 billion by selling an initial public offering in December of about 21 percent of its shares. World Business, Section W.
 
Federated Posts Big Quarterly Loss
Federated Department Stores, the parent of Macy's and Bloomingdale's, reported a huge loss for the third quarter, brought about by sluggish sales and problems at its Fingerhut catalog business. Excluding the $795 million in charges taken in the third quarter for Fingerhut, Federated reported earnings that beat consensus estimates for the quarter, posting a profit of 26 cents a share, well above the 20 cents a share Wall Street had been expecting. Its shares fell 25 cents, to $34.19. C2.
 
A Model for Future White Houses
When it comes to economics, presidents must rely on their advisers to make informed decisions. The way economic advice is organized can determine the success of a president's program. The National Economic Council, formed by Bill Clinton in 1992, provides a good model. The idea was to elevate economic policy to the same status as national security and to coordinate advice from cabinet secretaries. Alan B. Krueger: Economic Scene. C2.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 ELECTIONS: POLITICAL MEMO;
Mrs. Clinton Found Right Mix in Fame and Upstate Focus

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
By the time the votes were counted, it was hard to see what Rick A. Lazio could have done to get out of the way. Hillary Rodham Clinton rode to victory on a wave created by a crack-the-whip, get-out-the-vote effort orchestrated by her friends at the labor unions, a swell in the number of registered Democrats in the state, and, perhaps most of all, the huge margin that Al Gore posted over George Bush in New York.
Mrs. Clinton won a contest that even some Democrats had once thought she would lose, by capitalizing on her celebrity, particularly by traveling to remote areas upstate where voters rarely saw a governor, much less a first lady. She identified herself with Democratic concerns in New York, from the economy upstate to health care downstate, in a way intended to erase lingering questions about her character. And in what might be the most instructive lesson of this campaign, particularly on the heels of Charles Schumer's Senate race in 1998, she demonstrated that upstate New York is not as safe a Republican region as had been assumed for so long. 
 Indeed, Mrs. Clinton defeated Mr. Lazio by 12 percentage points, a margin that surprised advisers to both candidates. But most revealing, she came within three points of Mr. Lazio upstate, an affirmation of her insistence on campaigning there so often. And turnout among black voters seems to have indeed increased as a result of the first lady's regular visits to black churches: blacks made up 11 percent of the electorate this year, compared with 9 percent in 1998, in a survey of voters leaving the polls on Election Day.
Still, in the end, all those forces seem to have had more to do with the magnitude of Mrs. Clinton's victory, as opposed to the victory itself. In truth, most of the polls taken from the moment Mr. Lazio got in the race last May, replacing Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, suggested that there was never really that much variation in this contest, until the end. He always scored between 40 and 45 percent; in the end, he attracted 43 percent of the vote.
One of Mr. Lazio's advisers said yesterday that Mrs. Clinton's character, which Republicans had thought would be the hook with which they could bring her down, instead served to obscure their efforts the two times they sought to turn more to issues, in particular Mr. Lazio's tax cut proposal.
Mr. Lazio's consultants sought yesterday to blame factors beyond their control for his loss in a race that had been followed by Republicans across the country.
"It was a huge Democratic landslide in a big Democratic state," said Mike Murphy, Mr. Lazio's campaign consultant, in explaining a loss whose size he acknowledged had startled Mr. Lazio's aides.
The candidate's campaign manager, Bill Dal Col, offered a similar argument in an interview yesterday, saying that he believed it was impossible to win the race once it became clear that Mr. Gore was going to win the state by 1.5 million votes.
"When the numbers are as big as they are, it's not right or wrong," Mr. Dal Col said. "The math gets impossible."
Still, a number of Republicans argued that the candidate and his staff had only made things more difficult in the way they approached the contest. And as campaign workers began clearing out Mr. Lazio's offices on Park Avenue, there were accounts of turmoil and discord surrounding the campaign and the state Republican Party that Mr. Lazio's associates said undercut the campaign at a number of turns.
There was open dissent, for example, between Mr. Lazio's campaign staff and state Republican Party officials. State Republicans said yesterday they had told Mr. Lazio over the summer that he was making a mistake in keeping such a low profile for so long. Mr. Lazio's aides said he used the time to raise money, but his absence allowed Mrs. Clinton to make inroads upstate and to begin raising questions about Mr. Lazio's record with a series of negative commercials.
State Republicans also complained that Mr. Lazio recruited help from outside the state to run his campaign.
For their part, Mr. Lazio's aides blamed William Powers, the state Republican chairman, for what they contended was one of the biggest mistakes of the campaign: orchestrating telephone advocacy calls that sought to link Mrs. Clinton to the terrorist attack on the destroyer Cole in Yemen. "It was the single biggest blunder -- and it was by the local know-it-all New Yorkers," said one of Mr. Lazio's advisers. "The biggest blunder of the race was the brainchild of the local guys."
Mr. Powers did not return a call seeking comment yesterday.
There was tension between Mr. Lazio and his own advisers as well. His aides pressed him to deliver a series of six policy speeches in an effort to rebut attempts by Mrs. Clinton to portray him as an intellectual lightweight. Mr. Lazio delivered just three of them, as the candidate and his aides could not come to agreement on the language and even some of the proposals in the speeches.
Mr. Lazio and Mr. Murphy argued several times over advertisements that Mr. Murphy wanted him to broadcast: on at least two occasions, Mr. Murphy began running advertisements, one on television and one on radio, over the objections of Mr. Lazio, according to one of the candidate's aides. When Mr. Lazio confronted him, Mr. Murphy argued the ads were a key to defeating Mrs. Clinton, the aides said.
As it turned out, Mr. Lazio was forced to withdraw one of the ads, which attacked Mrs. Clinton for support a treaty on global warming, after he was criticized by environmental groups. Mr. Murphy declined to comment.
Even in defeat, Mr. Lazio did appear to have some success, notably, in undermining her support among Jews, by questioning her allegiance to Israel. The survey of voters leaving the polls found that Mrs. Clinton won the support of just 53 percent of the state's Jewish voters, an anemic showing for a Democrat. Typically, a Democratic candidate in a statewide race draws at least 60 percent of the Jewish vote.
Mrs. Clinton's advisers said that they had considered her weak among Jews from the start. But they made the calculation, they said, that they could counter this with a strong showing upstate.
Finally, perhaps the most successful strategy employed by Mrs. Clinton's associates was their attempt to erase the objection that Mrs. Clinton was trying to run from a state where she had not lived. To that end, they decided more than a year ago to simply have her spend as much time in New York as possible.
On the very last day of his campaign, Mr. Lazio assailed her again on the subject, as had Mr. Giuliani before him. If nothing else, the margin of Mrs. Clinton's victory suggests that this course of attack had at most limited appeal.
Mr. Dal Col, in an interview, acknowledged yesterday that the campaign had made several missteps, from the Cole calls to Mr. Lazio's decision to walk across the stage at the candidates' first debate and demand that Mrs. Clinton sign a pledge to bar the use of soft money. Still, he said after reviewing the numbers, none of that mattered much in the end.
"If you add up all these mistakes, they don't equal this race," he said. "It might get you five points. It doesn't get you the race. There was nothing fatal."

CALIFORNIA UTILITY SEEKS TO CHARGE CUSTOMERS $3 BILLION

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Pacific Gas and Electric, California's largest electric utility, sued the state in federal court, seeking freedom to charge customers more than $3 billion for the company's losses in open-market power purchases earlier this year. The company argued in its filing that the state made it sell its power plants and capped the rates it could charge, leaving it no way to avoid losses when wholesale power prices surge. The company, a unit of the PG & E Corporation, and its largest rival, Southern California Edison, a unit of Edison International, have asked the state utility commission to let it pass along the costs, so far without result. The uncertainty of when the issue will be resolved led Fitch Inc., a debt-rating agency, to downgrade PG & E and Edison's credit ratings.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 ELECTIONS: CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES;
How Gore Stopped Short On His Way to Concede

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK and FRANK BRUNI 

 BODY:
When his limousine arrived at the War Memorial Plaza in Nashville, where a few thousand despondent, rain-soaked supporters awaited the concession, Vice President Al Gore assumed he had lost the election.
He had called Gov. George W. Bush at the Governor's Mansion in Austin, Tex., and extended his congratulations. He had written a short and gracious speech about moving the country forward and cooperating with the victor. 
 But several vans back in the motorcade, an aide's Skytel pager vibrated with a message to call Michael Whouley, a top Gore strategist who was monitoring Florida results at Gore headquarters. What Mr. Whouley had to say, the aide, Michael B. Feldman, recalled, was that the Florida secretary of state's Web page had winnowed Mr. Bush's advantage of 50,000 votes to 6,000, with precincts still to tally.
That changed everything.
About a half-hour later, at 2:30 a.m. Central time, Mr. Gore placed his second call of the evening to Mr. Bush.
From a holding room beneath the plaza, where he had gone to concede, Mr. Gore told his Republican rival that circumstances had changed in the last 45 minutes. The race, Mr. Gore said, was now too close to call, and there would be an automatic recount in Florida. He was going to wait it out.
"You mean to tell me, Mr. Vice President, you're retracting your concession?" Mr. Bush asked, his tone incredulous, one aide said. The Texas governor had already begun preparing his victory remarks.
"You don't have to be snippy about it," Mr. Gore responded, according to several of those who heard Mr. Gore's side of the conversation.
Mr. Bush told Mr. Gore that his brother Jeb, the governor of Florida, had just assured him that Florida was his, Gore aides said.
"Let me explain something," Mr. Gore said. "Your younger brother is not the ultimate authority on this."
The conversation drew quickly to a close. The election did not.
After two sleepless days of campaigning, after a gut-wrenching night in which they had been convinced that they had won and then devastated that they had not, Mr. Gore and his aides were back in the game.
"I don't think there's ever been a night like this one," William M. Daley, the Gore campaign chairman, told the crowd at the plaza around 3:05 a.m.
No one in the Bush campaign would disagree with that assessment. Less than two hours earlier, around 1:15 a.m., when the television networks had called the election for Mr. Bush, he assumed he was the president-elect.
 
Watching and Waiting
In the upstairs living room of the Governor's Mansion, where he had passed the endless hours with his wife, his parents and Jeb Bush, family members hugged one another tight.
In Nashville at that time, Mr. Gore and his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, were watching CNN with a large group of aides in a seventh-floor suite at the Loews Vanderbilt Plaza hotel. The room grew silent.
Donna Brazile, Mr. Gore's campaign manager, sent the vice president a message at 1:20 a.m. Central time on his Blackberry, an instant messaging pager: "Never surrender. It's not over yet."
But ultimately, most in the group concluded that the networks had to be right. "They were just so damn positive," said Mr. Gore's brother-in-law, Frank Hunger. "And they were talking about 50,000 votes, and we never dreamed they would be inaccurate."
Mr. Gore went to his ninth-floor suite to break the news to his wife, Tipper, and his children, some of whom were sleeping, and some of whom cried.
At both the hotel and the campaign headquarters across town, depression took the place of the happier, more hopeful emotions that held sway six hours earlier, before the roller coaster of election night 2000 began screaming down the rails.
Around 7 p.m. Tuesday, the television networks put Florida, Michigan and Pennsylvania in the Gore victory column. With one more key tossup state, the deal would be sealed.
Some top Gore advisers were feeling good enough that they took a break to eat dinner in the hotel's steakhouse, where they could not even watch television.
It was the opposite of what was going on in Austin.
 
Hopes Dashed and Restored
For Mr. Bush, his advisers and his friends, confidence had been reigning for days. He spent Monday in Tennessee, Mr. Gore's home state, and in Arkansas, President Clinton's home state, and carried himself with the swagger of a certain winner.
But around 7 p.m. Tuesday, their optimism began to falter.
Mr. Bush was in a private dining room at the Shoreline Grill, a restaurant adjacent to the Four Seasons hotel in Austin, eating a dinner of parmesan-crusted chicken with his parents, his wife, his daughters and all of his siblings.
The news about Florida flashed on a nearby television set, casting a pall over the meal.
Mr. Bush had once joked that it would be a chilly Thanksgiving for his younger brother Jeb, if Florida did not tip into the Bush column. And now it had tipped in the other direction.
Joe and Jan O'Neill, two close friends of the governor's who were dining in another section of the restaurant, said the brothers shared an emotional moment.
"I heard that Jeb hugged George, literally in tears," Mr. O'Neill said.
Mrs. O'Neill added that the Florida governor told his brother he was sorry, which Jeb Bush confirmed yesterday. Then he left the room.
The Texas governor, his wife and his parents also left, heading back to the Governor's Mansion. They had intended to watch the returns with a group of relatives, friends and senior advisers in two suites on the ninth floor of the Four Seasons.
But now, several of Mr. Bush's aides said, he wanted peace and quiet.
Several aides said Mr. Bush had always kept open the possibility of going home.
But Mrs. O'Neill said that his change of plans was "not only last-minute, it was spur of the moment."
On the ninth floor of the Four Seasons and at the campaign headquarters, people channeled their tenuous hopes along two tracks.
They wondered if Mr. Bush could win so many smaller states that he could reach the magic number of 270 electoral votes without Florida, and they plotted the possibilities.
"Sometimes you could hear a pin drop in the room," said a family friend at the Four Seasons, "like when New Mexico was called for Gore. We all had our own written lists of the states he needed. We had all done our own electoral calculations."
Several blocks away, Mr. Bush's chief strategist, Karl Rove, and one of his deputies, Matthew Dowd, had done the same thing.
"Karl had actually formulated a strategy where the linchpin was the extra vote in Maine," said Stuart Stevens, one of the campaign's media advisers, referring to that state's ability to split its four electoral votes.
At the same time, Mr. Rove, Mr. Dowd and other Bush aides focused on Florida, gleaning information from the Internet and panicked phone conversations, and growing more and more convinced that the outcome was unclear.
Mr. Rove called several television networks to tell them they had acted early and perhaps erroneously and needed to amend their predictions.
Not everyone at the headquarters was convinced.
"It's the kind of thing you always do in a campaign, you grasp for any ray of hope," said Mark McKinnon, the chief media adviser. "It seemed like a thin ray, but it was one of the only ones we had."
Mr. Bush clung to it, encouraged by advisers. Every few minutes they called him with the latest updates, the latest calculations.
And around 9 p.m., in yet another twist, the networks announced that they were putting Florida back into the undecided column. Ecstatic shrieks filled the streets in front of the State Capitol, the halls of the Four Seasons and the campaign headquarters. "What do you call the things you put on a heart-attack victim?" Mr. McKinnon asked. "It was like the campaign had gotten those electric paddles to its heart."
 
A Celebration Cut Short
But if the Bush campaign felt revived, the Gore campaign did not yet feel moribund. They were also doing the arithmetic, and they were also sopping up all the information they could. The direction all of this was headed was ambiguous for a good long while.
For hours, there seemed to be plenty of room for hope. Mr. Bush had developed a lead in Florida, but it began to shrink.
Near midnight, Mr. Gore huddled with his top aides to discuss what they should do and decided he should go to the plaza and tell his supporters that the result might not be known until Wednesday. Then they decided to hold off for just a bit.
And then, seemingly inexplicably, Mr. Bush's margin in Florida ballooned.
Both in the seventh floor suite and at the campaign's headquarters downtown, depression set in. In the expansive white "boiler room" there, where aides had monitored returns, campaign workers began to cry. "A shock rippled through," one aide said.
They had worked down to the last minute. Only hours earlier, top-level strategists like Sarah Bianchi, a leading policy adviser, and Gene Sperling, the president's national economic adviser, on loan from the White House, had been making last-minute get-out-the-vote calls to Democrats on the West Coast.
"I felt so deflated," said Mark D. Fabiani, Mr. Gore's deputy campaign manager for communications. "It had been an evening where you won and then lost and winning felt a lot better than losing. You had been up and down and swung around and then dumped out on your head."
It had all come down to Florida, and advisers at the Bush campaign headquarters huddled over computer screens, clicking from one Internet site to another.
They factored in the voting histories of the counties to be tallied and punched numbers into calculators, desperate for an accurate prediction. They called Republican officials in the state. The hours and minutes crept by.
Mr. Bush remained at the mansion, where aides said his brother Jeb also kept an eye on the Internet.
In front of the State Capitol, various speakers took the microphone to try to enlist Bush supporters in what amounted to public prayers.
"We want Florida!" shouted George P. Bush, Jeb's oldest son. "We want Florida!" But the crowd -- rain-soaked, shivering and weary -- had gone limp.
Then, it happened. Around 1:15 a.m., the enormous television screens they were watching flashed that Mr. Bush would win not only Florida, but also the presidency. The loudspeakers blared the song "Signed, Sealed, Delivered."
At the Four Seasons, they roared, then filed into the buses waiting to take them to the State Capitol, about 10 blocks away. At the headquarters, they sobbed, then marched toward the same destination.
And at the Governor's Mansion, Mr. Bush, Jeb Bush and their proud parents hugged one another tight.
Mr. McKinnon took a turn in front of the television cameras, telling Candy Crowley, a correspondent for CNN, "I'm going to go to bed tonight and have a stiff drink as quickly as I can get off your set."
But then he saw a another network correspondent waving frantically, trying to deliver a piece of news that would delay that drink.
The seesawing state of Florida was decided anew, and the waiting had just begun.

HEADLINE: Shock but No Longer Surprise Over Nursing Home Problems

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
The criminal indictment of five nurses at a Long Island nursing home on Monday was shocking in its details: the authorities charged that a 97-year-old woman had died after being fed through a tube attached to an enema bag.
But the incident, however egregious, was also simply the latest of many problems uncovered in the industry in recent years: staff shortages, financial difficulties and, often, poor quality of care in some nursing homes. 
 From 1998 to 1999, the number of citations for inadequate care issued by the State Department of Health against the state's 676 nursing homes increased 30 percent, and the number of the most serious violations has almost doubled in the last year.
Many of those problems, according to experts and government officials, may stem from financial problems afflicting many of the nursing homes. Under a federal law enacted in 1997, Medicare reimbursement for nursing homes declined significantly. Faced with new financial constraints, many publicly traded nursing home holding companies have since filed for bankruptcy, and others are complaining of serious hardship.
At the same time, under that 1997 law, nursing homes were given far greater latitude in how they spent what government money they did receive. Homes are now reimbursed not for the care of each resident, but rather for their estimated needs of each. (In New York State, the same system is used under Medicaid.)
Under that arrangement, nursing homes may to spend this money as they choose, and many, industry experts say, are using it for administrative costs, executive salaries and profits rather than on direct care, like badly needed staff increases. The quality of care in some homes may have eroded as a result, the experts said.
"The idea of giving facilities flexibility with how they spend the money was supposed to be counterbalanced by government oversight of care given to residents," said Cynthia Rudder, director of the Nursing Home Community Coalition of New York State, a public watchdog group. "But that system has not been effective. There has been no real oversight of care."
Perhaps because they serve a population that has limited political power and consists of the frailest and most infirm of residents, nursing homes have long been an area of health care rife with abuse.
But lately, economic and other factors have aggravated the problems, and New York is immune to none of them.
A report issued this summer by the Health Care Financing Administration found that 54 percent of the country's nursing homes provide less than the minimal two hours a day of nurse aid care for each patient, and New York's nursing homes have similar statistics. Nurse aid positions are hard to fill, as they are labor-intensive and stressful but tend to pay poorly and provide few benefits, Ms. Rudder said.
At times, New York's problems have stood out even in the troubled national picture. Congressional investigators found this year that New York was among a handful of states with widespread violations of health and safety standards in nursing homes. And about 17 percent of homes on Long Island gave care that harmed or had potential to harm residents, according to a study conducted by the Democratic staff of the House Committee on Government Reform.
Long Island in recent years appears to have emerged as a markedly troubled part of the state when it comes to nursing home care. On Monday, Eliot L. Spitzer, the state attorney general, charged five registered nurses at the Townhouse Extended Care Center in Uniondale with tampering with documents to mask conduct and treatment that resulted in the death of a 97-year-old woman and serious injury to two other women, according to the indictment.
In October, federal regulators cited the A. Holly Patterson Geriatric Center, one of the largest centers on Long Island, with severe deficiencies, charging that the home's failure to monitor patients properly resulted in the death of one patient and the endangerment of others. The citation, which could have resulted in a loss of federal and state money, was lifted later that month after the home corrected its problems.
Also in October, the State Department of Health found that the Workman's Circle Nursing Home in Co-op City in the Bronx was one of two nursing homes in the state with the most egregious problems. According to the state's report, 50 residents were confined to the basement for 12 hours a day while the center was renovated. The home has since submitted a plan of correction to the department and is out of immediate danger of losing financing.
And two years ago, state and federal officials accused New York City of providing inadequate care at Neponsit Health Care Center, which was run by the public hospitals corporation.
Some of the problems at homes in the city and on Long Island may be a consequence of less than vigorous monitoring by state officials. The local Health Department unit charged with investigations into complaints made against nursing homes on Long Island finds merit in only one percent of those that are submitted to it, a rate 8 times lower than the state average. New York City sustains about 5.4 percent of its complaints, state documents show. State officials say those numbers do not include physical abuse.
Last month, the State Health Department began making its monthly inspections of nursing homes available to the public through its Web site and press releases. "We want to ensure that nursing homes are aware that we take our responsibilities seriously," said John Signor, a department spokesman.
The department is hiring 100 new inspectors for health care facilities, including nursing homes. In recent years, the department has failed to spend all its money from the federal government to conduct inspections. "We want to be able to respond to complaints more quickly and con

Museums
 
"AMAZONS OF THE AVANT-GARDE," Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Jan. 7). A concise exercise, monographically arranged, this show focuses on six Russian women who painted around the time of the revolution. Several continued to work much later and do more than paint, but this is a tendentious affair, plausibly so. If only a couple of the women, Natalia Goncharova and Liubov Popova, were truly great painters, the exhibition still isn't a case of special pleading. The Russian avant-garde wouldn't have been what it was without them collectively. The story as it unfolds here seems, if anything, more remarkable, not less, for having as little to do with sex as it does and almost everything to do with painting. Many of the works have a surprising fortitude. Revolution. A brave new art world. The dream persists even though the form it takes keeps changing. Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $12; $8 for students and the elderly (Michael Kimmelman). 

 "GIORGIO ARMANI," Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Jan. 17). The Guggenheim has served up another plateau of urban history: a retrospective of the Milanese fashion designer Giorgio Armani. What it lacks in depth it makes up for with sparkle, and Robert Wilson's architectural transformation of the museum's rotunda may be the best yet. In an inverted version of a life class, instead of the undraped body, the show offers just the drapes. The mannequins have been pared down to the edges of the costumes, and they cluster in groups in the building's structural bays, spatial modules with the proportions of shop windows. Hours and admission: See above (Herbert Muschamp).
 
 * "THE EMBODIED IMAGE: CHINESE CALLIGRAPHY FROM THE JOHN B. ELLIOTT COLLECTION," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Jan. 7). In China the written word has traditionally been the highest art form and a source of political and emotional power. To see that power in action, check out this grandly scaled exhibition, which brings together two superb calligraphy collections -- from Princeton University and the Met -- in the most comprehensive survey yet seen in these parts. The dozens of scrolls covered with handwritten words collectively radiate a kind of conversational buzz and suggest a richly varied cast of personalities: fastidious court functionaries, impulsive social agitators, unworldly monks, visionary poets. Together they offer an ice-breaking introduction to an art that to anyone who doesn't know Chinese can seem unapproachable. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $5 for students 12 and older and the elderly (Holland Cotter).
 
 "AN ENGAGEMENT WITH FOLK ART: CYRIL I. NELSON'S GIFTS TO THE MUSEUM OF AMERICAN FOLK ART," 2 Lincoln Square, at West 66th Street, (212) 595-9533 (through Jan. 7). This show celebrates the largess of Mr. Nelson, a book editor and folk art collector who has given 113 objects to the museum with the promise of more. The works, from the late-18th to the mid-20th centuries, cover the traditional areas of folk art -- portraits, landscapes, sculptures, painted and decorated furniture -- but the focus is on American needlework: quilts, coverlets, blankets and the like. Among the quilt spectaculars is the "Samuel Steinberger Log Cabin Quilt, Courthouse Steps Variation," by a 19th-century immigrant. Painted furniture, too, shines in this show. The painting and sculpture pieces make a more modest impression, but over all, what's on view represents a refined, solid ensemble that is very visitable. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Free (Grace Glueck).
 
 "HIP-HOP NATION: ROOTS, RHYMES AND RAGE," Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Dec. 31). The complex cultural amalgam of music, poetry, break-dancing, art and fashion that is hip-hop poses a serious challenge to any art museum, but with the proper resources and curatorial expertise, it could have been done. Instead this show offers a partial outline of hip-hop history, conveyed by photographs, posters, magazine and album covers, memorabilia and monotonous expanses of clothes that make the show nearly indistinguishable from the gift shop. Garnished with graffiti art, it bypasses many other equally interesting connections to contemporary art. Because the show omits music videos, it manages to be virtually devoid of the sounds, words and moving bodies that are the essence of hip-hop. The results are a cross between a mall and a mausoleum. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of each month); Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $4; $2 for students and the elderly (Roberta Smith).
 
 "IN THE PRESENCE OF SPIRITS: AFRICAN ART FROM THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OF ETHNOLOGY IN LISBON," Museum for African Art, 593 Broadway, near Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 966-1313 (through Dec. 31). The more than 140 objects on view relate to the secular and the supernatural in African culture: masks, power figures, dolls, decorated stools and chairs, pipes, posts and other artifacts. Outstanding is a group of initiation masks made from wood and more fragile materials like feathers, fabrics and barkcloth fibers. Ranging from fierce to benign in expression, they are giddily imaginative. Impressive, too, is a selection of dolls from the Ambo people of southwestern Angola. The objects in the show were chosen for their high aesthetic value, and it doesn't disappoint. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2.50 for children, students and the elderly; free on Sundays (Glueck).
 
 LEE KRASNER, Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Jan. 7). Despite its restless energy and moments of formal power and elegance, Lee Krasner's career in this economical retrospective looks more like one of tantalizing frustration than real fulfillment. In the 1950's and early 60's, Krasner painted splattery, ambitious Abstract Expressionist works, but they look indebted to other artists, Pollock and de Kooning mainly. Where she looks most herself is in collage; a set of large collages on canvas from the early 50's have raw density or explosive buoyancy. Collages made in the 1970's using 40-year-old charcoal drawings have a beautiful Cubistic elegance; they are the best works of her career. Hours and admission: See above (Ken Johnson).
 
 "MOROCCO: JEWS AND ART IN A MUSLIM LAND," Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200 (through Feb. 11). When Arab Muslims arrived in Morocco, Jews had already been living there for centuries, and the two cultures formed a cooperative and uneasy bond. Their relationship is explored in this show, which offers a little bit of many things, mostly dating from the 19th and 20th centuries. In elaborate jewelry, shimmering textiles, liturgical objects and folk amulets, Jewish and Islamic ingredients often form a distinctive hybrid blend. A selection of European Orientalist paintings by Delacroix among others provides a firsthand outsider view of a once-vibrant interaction. Hours: Sundays through Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Tuesdays to 8 p.m. Admission: $8; $5.50 for students over 11 and the elderly (Cotter)
 
 "OPEN ENDS," Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400 (through Jan. 2). The third and final cycle of "MOMA 2000," the year-and-a-half-long millennium-marking rethinking of the Modern's permanent collection, is off and running. The dates covered are 1960 to the present, so there's some sense of how a bastion of modernism is dealing with a postmodern world. Pretty well, judging from recent acquisitions of work by Pipilotti Rist, Matthew Barney and Cai Guo-Qiang. The real interest is in smart theme shows that play with such contemporary fixations as childhood innocence and adult experience, and the blend of art, abjection and design. Hours: Saturdays through Tuesdays and Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8:15 p.m. Admission: $10; $6.50, students and the elderly (Cotter).
 
 "PIERRE ET GILLES," New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222 (through Jan. 7). No history of postmodern photography, fashion photography, celebrity portraiture, record album covers or the highbrow beefcake tradition would be complete without the work of the French photo team known as Pierre et Gilles, who have collaborated on over-the-top, tightly styled, hand-finished photographs since 1976 and become wildly famous in Europe in the process. In their first American museum retrospective, their work feels more than a little embalmed, existing behind a not-so-invisible shield of artistic conservatism. Certain images come to life as art objects -- most notably, one of a beautiful young sailor up to his chest in water with an iridescent night sky behind him -- but those are few. Hours: Wednesdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays through Saturdays, until 8 p.m. Admission: $6; $3 for students, artists and the elderly (Smith).
 
 "POWER AND DESIRE: SOUTH ASIAN PAINTINGS FROM THE SAN DIEGO MUSEUM OF ART, EDWIN BINNEY 3RD COLLECTION," Asia Society at Midtown, 502 Park Avenue, at 59th Street, (212) 517-2742 (through Jan. 7.) The album-size paintings known as Indian miniatures, produced for an elite clientele who demanded the finest workmanship, are rightly renowned for their suave forms and brilliant colors. They also embody the moral values, political ambitions and personal aspirations of the culture that produced them. All of these ingredients come into play in this show of 67 top-of-the-line examples from the 16th to 19th centuries. They add up to a kind of grand but intimate theater, equal parts farce, melodrama and mystery play, where men strut like gods, gods have the failings of men, and nature is a gorgeous curtain behind which infinity lies. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 5 p.m. Admission: $4; $2 for students and the elderly (Cotter).
 
 * BRIDGET RILEY, "Reconnaissance," Dia Center for the Arts, 548 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-5566 (through June 17). Once overly identified with Op Art, this British abstract painter never got her due in anti-Op New York, but a beautifully installed show of 40 paintings from 1961 to 1984 should change things. Concentrating on the early black-and-white paintings that made Ms. Riley famous, it presents stringently pure yet accessible works that have, at their best, extended the optical potential implicit in the work of Mondrian, Josef Albers and Ad Reinhardt. At their weakest, their meticulously calibrated patterns can be so aggressive that they virtually kidnap the eye, take it on a joy ride and leave it in a crumpled heap. Either way, the overall effect is of an artist of unusual dedication who has remained loyal to the original premises of her art and yet steadfastly refused to repeat herself. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $6; $3, students and the elderly (Smith).
 
 "ROMANTICISM AND THE SCHOOL OF NATURE: 19th-CENTURY DRAWINGS AND PAINTINGS FROM THE COLLECTION OF KAREN B. COHEN," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Jan. 21). European Romanticism was like adolescence: alternately ecstatic and bummed-out, self-obsessed and cosmically empathetic. You get an instant sense of its dynamic in this handsome show, which ranges from exquisite Constable cloud studies, to a handful of I-can't-believe-that's-here Courbets, to the largest group of paintings and drawings by Delacroix in private hands, many of them promised gifts to the Met. And nature, as a scientific fact, a mood-changing drug or a mystical vision, is at the center of it all. Hours and admission: See above (Cotter).
 
 * SCYTHIAN GOLD. "The Golden Deer of Eurasia: Scythian and Sarmatian Treasures From the Russian Steppes," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Feb. 4). "Gold of the Nomads: Scythian Treasures From Ancient Ukraine," Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Jan. 21). Certain kinds of art are box-office gold. Art made of gold is one of them, and there's a Fort Knox-size supply of the precious stuff in these two opulent exhibitions. The Brooklyn show is a survey-style glimpse at some exquisitely wrought 14-carat objects drawn from museums in Ukraine, where the Scythians put down roots in the first millennium B.C. The Met has drop-dead museological rarities from the State Hermitage Museum, but the focus here, which gives the proceedings a kind of treasure-hunt thrill, is on a cache of objects excavated fairly recently from tombs belonging to non-Scythian people whose identity is something of a mystery. Ideally, the two shows should be seen together: they offer a really substantial archaeological update on the last big Scythian showcase in these parts, the Met's smash-hot "In the Land of the Scythians" of 25 years ago. Hours and admission: See above (Cotter).
 
 * EDWARD STEICHEN, Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through Feb. 4). A big, thorough exhibition, maybe a little too big and glossy, of one of the great photographers in American history, a restless, benign, flawed genius. Steichen also painted, made films, designed textiles, organized aerial reconnaissance photography in two world wars and put together the most popular photography exhibition ever, "The Family of Man." We'll see how people respond to someone whose eclectic work can look, if anything, almost too elegant and self-regarding. Steichen ultimately seemed to reduce everything and everyone to props to demonstrate his own refined and stage-savvy sensibility. But what refinement. His best work has a finesse that borders on the erotic. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays and Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $8 for students and the elderly (Kimmelman).
 
 * "UNTITLED PASSAGES BY HENRI MICHAUX," Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166 (through Dec. 20). The books of the Belgian-born French poet and writer Henri Michaux are not exactly unknown on these shores, but his considerable achievement as a visual artist -- a self-taught one -- has yet to gain a solid foothold. This exhibition of more than 100 works on paper should change things. Spanning the late 1920's to the late 1970's, it includes examples of his finely textured "mescaline" drawings, his raucous inkscapes and his animated, often preening calligraphies. It reveals an artist profoundly influenced by Asian art who assiduously mined the fault line between language and sign, text and drawing, image and abstraction, manifesting the flow of human thought and energy in different, often hypnotic ways. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Free. A related show, "Henri Michaux: Works on Paper," is at Michael Werner, 4 East 77th Street, (212) 988-1623, through Nov. 25 (Smith).
 
Galleries: Uptown
 
JEAN ARP, "Line and Form," Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 1018 Madison Avenue, at 78th Street, (212) 744-7400 (through Nov. 18). Arp's art still looks fresh, sweet and humorously subversive, and it is well served by this 32-piece retrospective of drawings, paintings, reliefs and sculptures. Arp's two-dimensional works, like "Profile," an amoebic yellow head or puddle, are marvels of enigmatically suggestive economy. The smooth marble "Dream Flower With Lips," which looks like a female torso or an inverted cartoon leg, marries Grecian classicism and a wacky, polymorphous eroticism (Johnson).
 
 UGO MULAS, "Sequences," Leo Castelli Gallery, 59 East 79th Street, (212) 249-4470 (through Nov. 22). Roy Lichtenstein, Jasper Johns and Barnett Newman are the subjects of these informal but very intense shoots done in 1964 by the Italian photographer Ugo Mulas (1928-1973). The emphasis here is on the contact sheets that Mulas made of the artists at work, conveying in rapid-fire sequence the processes they went through to give material expression to their feelings. Apart from the action drama they convey, and the sense of exchange between the artist and photographer, the photographs evoke a poignant nostalgia for an art world that has long been subsumed by others (Glueck).
 
 W. EUGENE SMITH, Alan Klotz, 22 East 72nd Street, (212) 327-2211 (through Nov. 18). This is a fine small survey of images by the great photojournalist, who worked for Life and many other magazines and died in 1978. Smith's prints have a velvety richness and an unabashedly romantic humanity. The show includes war pictures shot in Japan, like the amazing "Soldier Finding a Baby;" near-visionary views of steelmaking in Pittsburgh; psychologically intense images from his famous series "The Country Doctor"; and meditative portraits of the jazz great Thelonious Monk (Johnson).
 
Galleries: 57th Street
 
"TRES COMPLEMENTAIRES," Mary Ryan Gallery, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 397-0669 (through Nov. 22). Time has dimmed the success story of two American artists, Maud Hunt Squire (1873-1954) and Ethel Mars (1876-1959), who expatriated themselves to France in 1906 and spent the rest of their lives there (except during World War I). This show, mounted in cooperation with the Susan Sheehan Gallery, is an attempt to re-establish their work, best represented by their early prints: Squire's color etchings and Mars's color woodblocks. In landscapes, portraits, domestic vignettes, street and cafe scenes, Mars's work is distinguished by its flat forms, bold simplicity of design and lively color. Squire's genre scenes rely more on drawing, done with a highly descriptive anecdotal line. Gravitating to Provincetown during World War I, the two made color woodblock prints that depicted local life, where Squire was in top form with simplified, heavily outline drawings of landscapes, figure and harbor scenes. After the war the two moved to the south of France, where they concentrated on drawing and painting, producing slight but charming scenes of beach and village life. But the early prints stand out (Glueck).
 
Galleries: Chelsea
 
SEONG CHUN AND DARO MONTAG, Caren Golden, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 727-8304 (through Nov. 25). Ms. Chun crochets thin strips of paper imprinted with writings by Mondrian into gridded compositions that look like deconstructed and slyly domesticated Mondrian paintings. Mr. Montag, a British photographer who does not use a camera, leaves pieces of organic matter -- kiwi slices in the works here -- on color negatives for a time. In the large prints made from these chemically altered negatives, haloed, radiating images in toxic colors glow out of deep black backgrounds (Johnson).
 
 SAM EASTERSON, Rare, 435 West 14th Street, (212) 645-5591 (through Nov. 25). Mr. Easterson went to the desert and attached small video cameras to live animals and plants -- an armadillo, a tarantula, a cactus -- to capture nonhuman points of view. The uneventful tapes are shown on monitors suspended over camera-equipped, stuffed animals surrounded by colored electrical cords arranged in topographical map patterns. Mr. Easterson is apparently serious, but his project looks like something made up by Monty Python (Johnson).
 
 ISA GENZKEN, AC Project Room, 453 West 17th Street, (212) 645-4970 (through Nov. 18). Ms. Genzken, a German sculptor who has been exhibiting since the mid-70's, presents an Arte Povera-style homage to New York City in the form of slapdash skyscraper models made of colored tape, sheets of colored plastic or Plexiglas and found things like a pizza box or oyster shells. A set of photographs of sleek office buildings offers a sharp contrast to the funky sculptural aesthetic (Johnson).
 
 ARTURO HERRERA, Brent Sikkema, 530 West 22nd Street, (212) 929-2262 (through Nov. 25). This delightfully versatile and imaginative artist presents an expansive, tangled forest-scape cut from a single 20-foot length of black felt; a large, cut, layered and painted paper collage that has the decorative elegance of Matisse and the funky buoyancy of Elizabeth Murray; small dense paintings made of solid plastic shaped like cartoon fragments; and, on the floor, a sky-colored geometric object made of corrugated cardboard called "Hurry Home, Blue" (Johnson).
 
 DAMIEN HIRST, Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, (212) 741-1111 (through Dec. 16). Welcome to the Damien Hirst Universe. It's a big shiny place with mathematical grid paper printed on the walls, pale pristine dot paintings and many large vitrine sculptures, including two outfitted as gynecological examining rooms and filled with water and fish. It shows the artist moving beyond the dead animals and putrefying flesh that catapulted him to fame while clarifying and enriching the grandiose themes of his art: life and death and their complex, sometimes oppressive relationship to science and commerce. It contains some undeniable duds, but if it doesn't win over those who have resisted the work of this notorious young British artist, it won't be for lack of trying (Smith).
 
 MASAMI TERAOKA, Pamela Auchincloss, 601 West 26th Street, (212) 727-2845 (through Nov. 22). First known for crisp Pop-style paintings that mixed traditional Japanese and contemporary Western imagery, Mr. Teraoka has lately been painting large-scale allegories attacking mass-media American sexual hypocrisy in a style loosely derived from Bosch. In these crowded scroll-like pictures, giant naked, variously abused woman are assailed by clerics, politicians and demons of all sizes. Paintings by Mr. Teraoka are also be on view at Jay Grimm, 505 West 28th Street, (212) 564-7662, through Dec. 2 (Johnson).
 
Galleries: SoHo
 
GUDRUN MERTES-FRADY, Rosenberg + Kaufman, 115 Wooster Street, (212) 431-4838 (through Nov. 18). The works of this veteran abstract painter, who moved from Germany to New York two decades ago, are academic but sumptuous. She drags, squeegees and scrapes paint this way and that, creating layered, blurred, checkered surfaces that are richly material yet vaguely illusory, like paintings by a less adventurous Gerhard Richter (Johnson).
 
 DAVID RABINOWITCH, Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0441 (through Nov. 18). Restricting his vocabulary to circles, ovals and straight lines, and his means to pencil, ink or colored pencil, this Constructivist-Minimalist sculptor produced this series of extremely spare drawings during the early 1970's. Called "Construction of Vision," they are resolutely abstract and quasi scientific. But the ellipses and angled lines, cleanly drawn with mechanical drafting tools, have a subtly playful animation (Johnson).
 
 JASON RHOADES, David Zwirner, 43 Greene Street, (212) 966-9074 (through Nov. 18). In one room of Mr. Rhoades's latest essay in sculptural extravagance stands a sort of giant Tinkertoy sawmill -- Sutter's Mill, birthplace of the California gold rush -- made of polished aluminum pipes and clamps. In another room is an identical but incomplete version. During the exhibition, an assistant will always be building or dismantling one or the other mill, acting out a Sisyphean loop of construction and deconstruction (Johnson).
 
Other Galleries
 
"PASTORAL POP!," Whitney Museum of American Art at Philip Morris, 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453 (through Dec. 15). Nature-inspired kitsch is the theme of this delirious seven-artist show. It includes Rob de Mar's comical landscape in the form of a spindly tree, Lisa Ruyter's psychedelic update of Seurat's "Grande Jatte," Alyson Shotz's grove of weird plant machines, Peter Gould's transformation of the guard station into a bucolic cartoon, Jason Middlebrook's Styrofoam stonewall planter, Katrin Asbury's miniature diorama in a planter and Rachel Feinstein's suspended Rococo-style pitcher exploding flowers like a pinata (Johnson).
 
 "PHOTASM," Hunter College Times Square Gallery, 450 West 41st Street, (212) 772-4991 (through Nov. 18). "Photasm" is a lively, unpredictable exhibition of photographs by 14 sculptors, organized by Peter Dudek. Highlights include Jeanne Silverthorne's tiny, magically intimate studio views; David Shaw's digital, rainbow-hued, geometric mindscapes; Rachel Harrison's crazily cobbled-together sculptures incorporating badly exposed photographs; images of quirky, computer-generated geometric objects by David Schafer; and Bryan Crockett's large, ghostly rayogram of his viscerally baroque balloon sculpture (Johnson).
 
Last Chance
 
FRANCES BARTH, Donahue/Sosinski, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 226-1111 (through tomorrow). Ms. Barth's medium-large semi-abstract pictures are an odd combination of muted Color Field painting and geological diagramming. Sketchy topographical signs, patterns and textures scatter across broad, stained areas of canvas, and are set off against narrower bands representing stratified cross-sections. The paintings have a curiously dry yet somehow romantic eccentricity (Johnson).
 
 "A BRUSH WITH NATURE: THE GERE COLLECTION OF LANDSCAPE OIL SKETCHES," Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700 (through Sunday). Most of the artists in this show -- English, French, Italian, German, Belgian and Scandinavian, from the 17th to the 19th centuries -- are barely known today. In their own age they did something quite offbeat: they left studios to paint outdoors, registering transient moments of light and atmosphere by sketching quickly in oil from nature. Until recently it was assumed that this plein-air approach, used to train hand and eye for more ambitious compositions, began with the Impressionists. These canvases today are sought-after prizes. The 68 on view here were assembled by a pioneering scholar and collector in the field, John Gere (1921-1995), former keeper of prints and drawings at the British Museum, and his wife, Charlotte. Mostly painted in Rome and the surrounding countryside, the works capture such painterly events as the seamed face of a rock, the rush of water through a valley, the play of sunlight on a ruin, the quirky architecture of a building or a wall. Tune your eye to small when you look at this show, and you'll find it a treasure. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 6 p.m. Admission: $7; $5 for students (over 10) and the elderly (Glueck).
 
 JAMES ESBER AND KATIA SANTIBANEZ, P.P.O.W., 476 Broome Street, (212) 941-8642 (through Nov. 11). Mr. Esber's paintings of distorted and fragmented cartoon characters look like collaborations by Peter Saul, Philip Guston and R. Crumb, but have their own creepy-comical sensibility. The best, made of colored modeling clay applied directly to the wall, have a weirdly vivid palpability. In Ms. Santibanez's neat, easel-size abstractions, color-coordinated grass made of strokes of gouache seems to grow from the seams of smooth, cool-white stripe, grid or nested square compositions, to quietly eye-buzzing effect (Johnson).
 
 ALEXIS ROCKMAN, Gorney Bravin + Lee, 534 West 26th Street, (212) 352-8372 (through Nov. 11). Inspired by a trip into South American jungles, Mr. Rockman's Pop-realist paintings depict a Northerner's lurid fantasies of tropical adventure and danger. One shows the artist himself gripped in the tentacles of a man-eating plant; another portrays him surrounded by parasites and dangerous fish. Something political about tourism is implied, but the satire is less biting than it should be, and the painting looks like overblown magazine illustration (Johnson).

HEADLINE: Hope for a Copper-Mining Renaissance in Zambia

BYLINE: By HENRI E. CAUVIN 

DATELINE: CHINGOLA, Zambia

 BODY:
Anglo American, the international mining giant based in South Africa, would be only too happy to see the world ignore its interests here in the northern tip of Zambia's Copper Belt. At least for now.
No one here, however, actually expects that to happen, and certainly not just seven months after the conglomerate completed a deal to buy back a big piece of what it lost when Zambia's mines were nationalized three decades ago. But the attempt by Anglo American, the world's largest mining company, to style itself as something less than a major player is an indication of just how much is at stake in the long-delayed privatization of Zambia's mines. 
 Zambia, once among the world's largest copper producers, was never able to parlay its metal riches into lasting prosperity. Today, the mines that were supposed to ensure that security are in shambles, neglected for years by the state mining company, Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines, known as ZCCM.
Losing about $1 million a day, the country's underperforming, overstaffed mines produced 270,000 metric tons of copper last year, and Zambia was the world's 11th-largest copper miner. That is down from more than 700,000 metric tons a year at their peak in the late 1960's, when Zambia was the third-largest copper miner, after the United States and the Soviet Union.
Demand worldwide for copper is solid. It is driven by continued growth in building construction and electronics production, especially of telecommunications equipment. According to the International Copper Study Group's latest report, released in October, the consumption of copper has been outpacing the supply since the second half of last year.
Zambia's volumes may never again reach the levels of its boom, said Willie R. Sweta, the country's mining director. But, he said, once the industry recovers, it should be able to mine more than twice as much as it did in 1999, the last full year of significant state control.
Now that the rich deposits rest squarely in private hands, so, in a sense, do the desperate hopes of this country, a place with profound economic troubles.
As much as they understand those hopes, however, the people who run Anglo's local subsidiary, Konkola Copper Mines, say they must focus on the expensive and complicated task of restoring the mines. Doing so, and forgoing the prominent role the mines have played in supporting the community is the only way to turn the operation around, said T.C.A. Wadeson, Konkola's chief executive.
So as Anglo re-establishes itself here, it is trying to walk softly, even as it wields a very big checkbook. It is spending tens of millions of dollars and making plans to spend even more in its effort to resurrect its chunk of the country's mines.
"We have endeavored to maintain a fairly low profile, which is easier said than done, because we are rather large in this industry," Mr. Wadeson acknowledged.
Here in Chingola, Konkola's newly acquired Nchanga operation, with its nearly 4,000-foot underground mine and sprawling 1,427-foot deep open air mine, has long been a crucial source of copper. For the next several years, it will remain the company's biggest producer.
At the mine's open pit, which is 2.6 miles long and nearly three-quarters of a mile across, work is again buzzing around the clock, now that the equipment is being repaired and the suppliers are being paid. As the setting sun slips beneath the horizon, building-sized dump trucks haul nearly 200 tons of rock at a time up the dusty hills out of the pit.
With its acquisitions, Konkola controls nearly two-thirds of copper production here. That puts it well ahead of the second-largest stakeholder, Mopani Copper Mines, a venture backed by First Quantum Minerals of Canada and Glencore International of Switzerland.
Anglo's history here stretches back several decades. It maintained a 27 percent stake in the state company, albeit without a management role.
The privatization of the mines was painstaking. The mines were put up for sale in 1996. The next year, a deal for several mines was in the works with a group of foreign mining houses, which chose to collaborate rather than compete with each other. But the mining houses, which offered $131 million, and the government, which held out for $500 million, could not close the gap, and the proposed deal eventually collapsed.
It would be many months and millions more dollars in losses before the sale of the mines was completed earlier this year. The largest stake went to Konkola, in which Anglo holds a 65 percent stake, for a net payment of $60 million. The next-largest stake went to Mopani for $43 million.
Anglo is paying $30 million up front, and beginning in 2006, it will pay an additional $60 million, spread over six years. But the initial $30 million payment is effectively canceled out by the $30 million that the government agreed to pay Anglo for the company's stake in ZCCM. Perhaps most critically, the state cut thousands of workers from the payrolls and assumed the reported $770 million in debt that ZCCM accumulated through years of low copper prices and flagging production.
Combined, the two deals will net the government barely $100 million, leaving the windfall from privatization far short of the government's original goal. Many people here have openly wondered how such a potentially precious asset ended up selling so cheaply and costing so many jobs. Some chastised the government, which has defended the deal and says it will benefit the country in the long term; others said Anglo had capitalized on the country's desperation.
Anglo expects to break even by the end of the year and to be turning a modest profit by this time next year. But Mr. Wadeson said it would be years before the company could expect the mines to begin showing sizable profits. And that would happen only after Anglo had spent enormous sums of money on repairing and replacing aging, neglected equipment and bringing in new, sophisticated machinery to exploit the untapped reserves it acquired about 15 miles north of here, in Chililabombwe.
"At this moment, we are producing copper at a cost rate greater than its selling price," he said. "We are dependent on shareholders to keep the company going."
"Anybody that suggests that Anglo got an absolute snip is misinformed," he said, using an expression meaning a very, good deal. "There are still significant risks."

HEADLINE: Beyond Manhattan: Help the Rest of New York

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "The Rising Cost of Luring People to New York" (news article, Nov. 4): the city needs to attract and keep not only top executives but also workers at every level. For most people in the middle, however, the struggle to keep or find housing in the city grows more and more daunting.
Virtually all of the Bronx, vast stretches of Brooklyn and Queens, and large sections of Manhattan have mistakenly been written off as places for working families. Only parts of Manhattan and a few other elite sections have benefited dramatically from the economic revival. 
 Giving outer-borough neighborhoods a fair share of police services, mass-transit improvements and renovated schools and parks would allow working families to live comfortably in their own city, while giving those who want to move here more options.

HEADLINE: Job Loss Under George Bush Almost Cost His Son a Job

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
IT'S still the economy, stupid. Specifically, it's jobs.
The close election, which George W. Bush apparently will win if Florida does not turn around -- is being widely viewed as an indication that after nearly 10 years of economic growth voters are no longer so concerned about the economy. Indeed, the states that did best during the last eight years voted Republican. 
 But an analysis of the votes shows that Al Gore's strength came predominantly from the states that suffered the most during Bush I, the administration of George Bush, the father of the current candidate. People who lose their jobs, it would appear, have long memories. Moreover, states that improved the most under the Clinton administration tended to favor Mr. Gore this time.
During the Bush administration, which featured a brief recession in 1990-91 followed by a slow recovery, 11 states lost jobs. Of those 11, only New Hampshire voted for the younger Bush in this election. And the Granite State, normally a reliable Republican bastion, went for Mr. Bush by fewer than 8,000 votes.
Nationally, employment rose by 2.4 percent from 1988 to 1992, the worst performance for any such period since Dwight D. Eisenhower's second administration and far below the gains recorded during the last eight years. The poor performance under Mr. Bush was concentrated regionally, in the Northeast and some Midwestern states plus California. Because the states that suffered included many of the larger ones, most states -- 34, in fact -- did better than the national average.
Of those 34, just six backed Mr. Gore this year: Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, New Mexico, Washington and Hawaii. Only in Hawaii and Washington did Mr. Gore get at least 50 percent of the vote. Florida was one of the states that did better than the national average, although it underperformed most states.
At first glance, it might appear that Mr. Gore got no credit for the job growth during the last eight years. Every one of the 10 states with the fastest growth in jobs during the Clinton administration -- Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Georgia, Texas, Oregon and New Hampshire -- voted for Mr. Bush. But most of those states were doing quite well before Bill Clinton and Al Gore were elected in 1992 and thus could easily have felt their growth was not related to the administration. While government policies may influence the overall economy, they are less likely to determine which states can profit the most.
A look at relative performance, however, indicates that votes do follow jobs. Of the 10 states where job growth rose the most during the last eight years, as compared with their performance in the Bush administration, 8 backed Mr. Gore. (The exceptions were New Hampshire and Arizona.) Of the 10 states where job performance declined the most, 8 voted for Mr. Bush. (The exceptions were Hawaii and Washington.)
Jobs obviously do not explain everything. It would take an electoral tidal wave for a Democrat to carry Kansas or a Republican to win Massachusetts, regardless of boom or bust in those states. But it is interesting to note that among three Midwestern states that were widely viewed as swing states this fall, Ohio had the smallest improvement in jobs performance under Mr. Clinton, while Pennsylvania did a little better and Michigan was the best of the three. Mr. Bush won Ohio, while Mr. Gore carried the other two.
Jobs do matter, as the new president will learn if too few of them are created during the next four years.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: CURRENCIES;
New Intervention Buoys Euro, And the Pound Also Rises

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The European Central Bank bought euros in the foreign-exchange market yesterday to support the weakened currency, the third such intervention in the last five trading days.
The euro gained more than half a cent against the dollar and rose as well against the Japanese yen after the central bank stepped into the market in early trading in New York. It settled at 86.68 cents compared with 85.58 cents late Wednesday. 
 The intervention briefly shook the market out of a torpor caused by the uncertainty over the United States presidential election.
"Clearly, they're trying to bring some stability to the euro and show that they're serious," said Jay Bryson, global economist at First Union National Bank in Charlotte, N.C. "If they keep coming in every few days, they'll show that they're willing to do what it takes to bring stability to the euro."
While the central's bank actions have kept the euro off its lows, they have not produced a sustained rebound. And some analysts said the euro-buying actions were losing their effectiveness with repetition. "The more frequently they do it, the less effective it's going to be," said John Rothfield, currency strategist at the Bank of America. "The market observes the price action that follows, and they get more comfortable in challenging the central banks."
The Europeans first intervened on Sept. 22, in a joint action with the central banks of Japan, Britain, Canada and the United States. They re-entered the market alone to buy euros last Friday and again on Monday.
Some analysts said that the three unilateral interventions indicate that the European Central Bank's aim is not to push the euro significantly higher, but simply to build a base and keep it from retesting record lows.
Marc Chandler, currency strategist with Mellon Bank, remarked, "E.C.B. officials have made it clear that the objective of the intervention was not to push the euro to some predetermined level against the dollar, but to underscore its belief that the single currency was undervalued."
In other trading yesterday, the dollar also retreated from seven-week highs against the British pound. In late New York trading, the pound settled at $1.4337, up from $1.4239 on Wednesday.
Earlier in the day, the Bank of England left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 6 percent for the ninth month. The decision had been expected after Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown said that his preliminary budget plan took a balanced approach to maintaining interest rate levels.

HEADLINE: Shares of Retailers Fall as Profits Turn Weak

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Shares of several prominent retailers fell yesterday after disappointing earnings results and a warning by Best Buy.
Gap Inc., hurt by sluggish sales in its Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic divisions, reported a 41 percent drop in third-quarter profit, but still met Wall Street expectations. 
 Kmart missed expectations, however, citing a wider-than-expected loss on its decision to reduce inventory. Lands' End also missed expectations, citing the dollar's strength overseas.
Best Buy, the nation's largest specialty chain, warned that third- and fourth-quarter earnings would fall well short of expectations, sending shares plunging 38 percent. The shares fell $19.88, to $32.50
Analysts said they believed that rising fuel prices, stock market volatility and declining consumer spending continued to take a toll on retailers, and they do not expect the problem to disappear anytime soon.
"The retail slowdown has become more widespread," said John Morris, an analyst at Gerard, Klauer Mattison. "It was first felt in the Midwest, but now you're seeing the party slow down on the East Coast."
Gap, based in San Francisco, said yesterday that it earned $186.3 million, or 21 cents a share, in the quarter ended Oct. 28, compared with $315 million, or 35 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier.
The results were in line with estimates, according to First Call/ Thomson Financial.
Revenue increased 12 percent, to $3.41 billion from $3.05 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year were down 8 percent.
Shares of Gap fell $1.50, to $24.75.
Efforts by Kmart, based in Troy, Mich., to liquidate unwanted inventory led to a third-quarter loss of $67 million, or 14 cents a share, worse than Wall Street's estimates of a loss of 10 cents a share, according to First Call.
The loss in the 13 weeks ended Oct. 25 was in contrast to earnings of $27 million, or 5 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.
Third-quarter sales totaled $8.2 billion, up 3 percent from $7.96 billion. Kmart said same-store sales for the quarter increased 1.4 percent.
Shares of Kmart fell 13 cents, to $5.81.
Lands' End reported higher sales but lower earnings in the third quarter, in part because of weak foreign currencies.
The retailer, based in Dodgeville, Wis., said net income for the quarter ended Oct. 27 was $4.4 million, or 15 cents a share, compared with $8.8 million, or 28 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier.
Analysts had expected the company to earn 20 cents a share, according to First Call.
Revenue rose 3 percent, to $336.4 million from $326 million.
The company reported 5 percent growth in both its core and specialty business segments. Corporate sales had double-digit growth.
But international business sales were down 11 percent, compared with figures in the period a year earlier, mostly because of the dollar's strength abroad.
Shares of Lands' End fell $2.18, to $24.03.
Best Buy, based in Minneapolis, said that a slowing economy was forcing it to hold more sales and was expected to trim earnings for the quarter ending Nov. 25 to about 27 cents a share, far below analysts' forecasts of 44 cents a share, according to First Call.
Earnings for the quarter ending March 3, 2001, will be about 90 cents a share, compared with expectations of $1.02 a share, the company said.

As Career Prospects Expand, Work Force Becomes Diverse

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG 

DATELINE: WEST WINDSOR, N.J.

 BODY:
Annette York's first body was heavier than she had ever imagined. She and a co-worker had just taken it, zipped up in white plastic, from the refrigerator of a Trenton hospital morgue. It was cold and felt like a sack of rocks.
Having spent most of her life working as a hairdresser, she was used to handling curlers, not cadavers. What would she say if the family was there, she thought. What if he smelled? 
 But Mrs. York, 42, a student in the funeral service program at Mercer County Community College, cracked a smile as she drove the body to the funeral home in a black station wagon. She liked working with her hands. She liked dealing with people. And maybe, just maybe, one day she would run her own funeral home.
"I really enjoyed doing it," she recalled of that first corpse removal, in 1996. "I don't know how to explain it. I just liked it. It gave me a feeling of satisfaction, much more so than I ever got from dealing with hair."
A few years ago, Mrs. York's dream of owning a funeral home might have seemed quaint, even quixotic. Sure, business was supposed to rise as the baby-boom generation aged. But the future of the industry seemed to belong to big corporations.
The Service Corporation International, the Loewen Group and others were buying up family-run funeral homes and consolidating them into chains that could benefit from economies of scale in everything from buying coffins to paying for advertisements.
But even as the corporations captured a fifth of the American market, earnings in the "death-care industry" failed to live up to expectations. Stock values plummeted. Service Corporation International's stock, which peaked at $47.13 in July 1998, closed on Nov. 9 at $2.56, a fall of 94 percent. Loewen's shares, which traded for as much as $43 before the company filed for bankruptcy protection in June 1999, closed at 27 cents.
"Competition for acquisitions led to overpayment," said Jennifer Childe, an equities analyst with Bear, Stearns. "That combined with negative publicity, an inability to raise prices and weakened death rates led to a deterioration of earnings."
All this has brightened the outlook for individually owned funeral homes. These days, students from widely varying backgrounds are enrolling in mortuary schools, which in turn have revamped curriculums to focus more on business-management skills.
Although the number of students entering the country's 52 accredited mortuary schools each year has remained at about 2,500 since the mid-1970's, their demographics are changing, said George Connick, executive director of the American Board of Funeral Service Education.
Less than a fifth come from families in the funeral business, he said, in contrast to half the students in the 1970's. Almost half the enrolled students last year were women, as opposed to 5 percent in 1971. And the average age is 25.
"The business has opened up," Mr. Connick said. "It's brought people into the field who have stronger academic backgrounds and stronger backgrounds in working with people. I think the quality of service will improve over time."
This new breed of student is choosing the profession at a time when jobs are abundant. Many people in the industry say that the 35,000 licensed directors now working will not be enough to meet the growing market. The number of deaths in the United States surpassed two million a year in 1983 and rose to 2.3 million in 1998, according to federal statistics. By 2020, the government forecasts the number of deaths will exceed three million, and peak at four million a year by 2040.
The growing demand for directors is reflected in recent salary surveys done by the National Funeral Directors Association. In 1996, a funeral director-embalmer's average annual salary was $32,000 to $33,500. Last year, the upper range increased to $37,000. Owner-managers of funeral homes made an average $48,000 to $57,000 in 1996. Last year, that was reported to be $53,000 to $72,000.
The Mercer County Community College program, founded in 1973, is a microcosm of what is happening in the industry. Only about half the full-time students come from families in the funeral business, said Robert Smith, director of the program. About a third are women. And many of them want to run their own home.
Mrs. York and two dozen other full-time students are enrolled in what, for most of them, is the third and final year of the funeral service program. Many of them have spouses and children and, looking to change careers, have spent two years completing 60 credits of preparatory courses at Mercer before being admitted to the funeral program.
Qualifications for a funeral director's license vary from state to state. New Jersey has relatively tough requirements. An applicant has to have an associate's degree in funeral service (meaning two years of college classes and a third year of funeral service classroom training), do a two-year internship and pass national and state exams. Most students start their internship while in their second or third year of classes.
Training for the profession has become more complex. Mortuary schools are concentrating more on the fundamentals of funeral home management partly because knowledge of the business is no longer necessarily being passed on within families.
"Curriculums have changed now so the programs are much more focused on the psychology of grief and on management skills," said John Horan, a funeral director who serves on the advisory board of the funeral service program at Arapaho Community College in Littleton, Colo. "I remember taking an accounting class when I was in mortuary science school where I felt better qualified to teach the class than the instructor."
From the beginning, Mrs. York knew it would be tough. Her husband and three children "were not too thrilled" with her career choice at first. It had been decades since she had cracked a textbook. She began taking preparatory courses in the summer of 1996. At that stage, science classes like anatomy and chemistry often weed out students.
But Mrs. York realized years ago, when both her parents died unexpectedly, that there had to be more to life than highlights and perms.
"Hair grows back and needs another cut," she said. "But when there's a death, that death stays with the family."
Many of Mrs. York's classmates also came to mortuary school looking for a more fulfilling career. Chris LaBree, 29, had worked for three years as a manager of CVS pharmacies in South Jersey. But he wanted to dispense the kind of pain relief that did not come in plastic bottles. He also wanted to work for himself.
"The minute I get a chance, I will own my own funeral home," he said. "You're your own boss. You're a slave to yourself."
Some of the classroom work covered what might be asked of the students on the board exams. On a recent afternoon, students taking the class called introduction to funeral service learned how much dirt should cover a coffin (at least four feet), the definition of cremation (dehydration of the body at 1,700 degrees Fahrenheit) and what to do after working on a corpse diagnosed with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a variant of mad cow disease (throw away the embalming instruments).
Other classes addressed the practicalities of business management. In funeral service law, for example, the students were taught a few basic rules for avoiding lawsuits: document everything; do not make promises you cannot keep; lock the doors of the funeral home.
The teacher, Deborah Tolboom, projected an equation onto a screen: "Mutilation + Malpractice = Mental Anguish + Money."
"Because of the nature of our business, anything we do could result in mental anguish for the family," she said. "We have to be very, very careful."
Ms. Tolboom has been teaching funeral law for two years. As many of her students had, she made a career switch. She went from being a registered nurse to working as a director at two funeral homes.
"I really hope that I can make a small impact on the future of this profession," she said. "Being female, being second career, I represent the new breed of funeral directors coming in."
Some of the students needed such role models. They said that although changes were taking place, they had run into old-school funeral directors stuck in their ways.
Mary Dempsey, 32, said that when she was looking for an internship, several male managers asked her a litany of questions: How old was she? Was she married? Did she plan to have children? If so, how many?
Mrs. York heard Ms. Dempsey tell this to a classroom visitor. She nodded. Mrs. York was the only student in the class who did not have an internship. She said she had applied to dozens of funeral homes in three counties and had been rejected by all.
Some potential employers asked her during the interview whether she was strong enough to lift a body, she said. At several homes that rejected her, she said, she later found out that they had hired men.
Because Mrs. York did not have an internship, she could not, by state law, take the embalming class this semester. "But I'm not giving up," she said. She was looking forward to taking restorative arts in the spring. Where her nimble fingers had once massaged scalps and trimmed bangs, they would soon be dressing cadavers and brightening their complexions.
Even a corpse has to look its best. Hair styles come and go, but death is forever.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
TV Host With a Sizable Confidence Factor

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY 

 BODY:
BILL O'REILLY describes himself as a poor prognosticator, a pundit more likely to pick the correct spread in a Jets game than to guess who might win a presidential race. So why is he boasting that he flat-out called Tuesday's (and Wednesday's and yesterday's) vote?
"I said early on that Bush is going to win by eight electoral votes," a tired-eyed Mr. O'Reilly said on Wednesday, as the Florida recount began. "If he wins Oregon and Florida, as I think he will, he'll be right at 278. Eight votes." 
 The math may or may not work out that way, but Mr. O'Reilly's confidence is unlikely to be shaken by anything as fickle as the closest political race in modern American history. Mr. O'Reilly, 51, the tough-talking commentator whose bully pulpit is a nightly program on the Fox News Channel called "The O'Reilly Factor," comes across as so confident that some viewers find him unbearably arrogant. Despite that, or perhaps because of it, Mr. O'Reilly is presiding over one of the fastest growing cable news programs.
During October, "The Factor," as Mr. O'Reilly calls it, ran a strong second in total viewership, according to the Nielsen ratings service, to Larry King, who has long reigned over the nightly cable talk show circuit. (In fact, Mr. O'Reilly's program was seen by a larger average percentage of houses that receive both CNN and Fox News.)
If that isn't enough to swell the head, Mr. O'Reilly is also the author of a best-selling book, bearing the same, slightly sinister-sounding title as the television show. All of which seems to have made this combative commentator slightly, well, humble. (But only slightly.)
"It's a miracle," he says, sounding almost sheepish.
Such a gee whiz description is not what his audience expects from Mr. O'Reilly, who has mastered a central occupational skill for a talk show host: concise answers to complex questions, delivered with swagger.
Take, for instance, the election -- who voted for whom, and why.
"A divided country, mostly along economic lines," he says plainly. "The median income in this country is something like $34,000 and if you break down the vote, most of the people below that vote for the Democrats and most above vote for Bush." Next question, please.
Mr. O'Reilly is blunt. "I ask very incisive, straight-to-the-point kind of questions," he said. "Not Jim Lehrer kind of questions."
For example, when George W. Bush appeared on his show in March, he took the governor to task for his record in Texas.
"I asked, 'If Jesus Christ is your favorite philosopher, what do you think he would think about you presiding over all these executions?' "
Mr. Bush would not speculate, said Mr. O'Reilly. But he added that he admired Mr. Bush for keeping his composure.
SUCH kind comments about a candidate who called himself a conservative have done little to dispel the impression, held by some, that Mr. O'Reilly's politics lean toward the Republican, though he denies that. "I'm an independent," he said. But Mr. O'Reilly seems to have little love for the Clintons; under his desk, for example, he keeps a "Hillary Clinton doormat," with the senator-elect's smiling face on it.
Still, with all the topics Mr. O'Reilly takes on -- class warfare, the media, the importance of good table manners -- he seems not entirely comfortable answering questions about his success. For instance, can this self-described "working class Irish-American" keep his blue-collar credentials now that the best-seller money is rolling in?
"Money doesn't mean anything to me," he said, sounding, for once, like a talk-show guest who knows the artful way to deflect a question.
Tall and gangly, with a Bill Bradley kind of build, Mr. O'Reilly, the son of an accountant and a homemaker, grew up in a middle-class family in Levittown, N.Y., playing football at his public school and painting houses for money during summer vacation. On family vacations, he says, the O'Reillys traveled by bus. He graduated from Marist College in Poughkeepsie, where he was the school's starting quarterback. (He keeps a framed letter M from his jersey on his office wall, alongside an autographed picture of Joe Namath.)
It was during a college year in London that his world view began to develop along "rich versus poor" lines, a position he still adheres to. "England is such a pronounced class society that you couldn't miss it," he says.
After a brief stint as a high school teacher, Mr. O'Reilly gravitated toward broadcast news. Over the next two decades, he worked at television stations "in all four time zones," eventually landing a job in 1989 as the host of the syndicated television program "Inside Edition."
In 1996, Mr. O'Reilly jumped to Fox, where he began to hone his skills as a kind of journalistic attack dog. Considering his reputation, why does he think people still want to come on his show?
"One, you come on to see if you can do it," he said. "And the second reason is that you're sincere in your beliefs. The point of the matter is if you believe in what you say you shouldn't have any fear to go on any program."
He considered that for a moment, then added with a smile, "I think had Al Gore come on 'The Factor' one time, he would have won."

HEADLINE: Rise in Producer Price Index Slowed to 0.4% Last Month

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9

 BODY:
Prices paid to manufacturers, farmers and other producers moderated in October, indicating that inflation remained in check.
The Producer Price Index rose 0.4 percent, after rising 0.9 percent in September. While the October gain was higher than forecasts, the core rate, which excludes food and energy costs, showed an unexpected decline of 0.1 percent. It was the third decline in the core rate since last November and followed a September increase of 0.3 percent. 
 The data largely confirm that inflationary pressures have been contained since the Federal Reserve raised interest rates six times between July 1999 and May. The only cloud has been a surge in energy prices, which have now settled down. Indeed, crude oil has been averaging $33 a barrel since October, down from $34 a barrel in September.
"Judging from where energy prices are now, the P.P.I. will fall outright next month," said Christopher Low, chief economist at First Tennessee Capital Markets in New York. "There's good news in the details that should satisfy the Fed."
Fed officials have indicated in recent speeches and interviews that the inflation risk has diminished and that higher energy and labor costs have not threatened the central bank's efforts to maintain low and stable prices.
Still, energy prices rose 1.4 percent in October after rising 3.7 percent in September, largely a result of a 5.2 percent increase in the cost of residential natural gas. Costs for gasoline and heating oil fell in October.
Food prices rose 0.8 percent in October, the second consecutive increase and the largest since a 1.1 percent rise in April. Egg prices accounted for much of the gain.
Passenger car prices fell 1.8 percent in October, the biggest decline in 10 years, after rising 1.4 percent in September, as automakers offered incentives to clear lots. Prices of light trucks fell 1.2 percent, the steepest decline in three years.
General Motors raised average incentives to about $2,200 in October and offered no-interest loans at Oldsmobile.
A separate report from the Labor Department today showed that first-time claims for state unemployment benefits jumped 35,000, to 344,000, the highest in almost two years. The increase was mostly a result of temporary dismissals by automakers, which closed factories to help reduce inventories.
Jobless claims have averaged about 313,000 a week the last three months and the four-week average for initial claims -- while higher last week at 317,250 -- barely exceeded that level, which suggests little change in the availability of workers.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Disliking Uncertainty, Traders Opt for Treasuries Over Shares

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices rose yesterday as stocks fell and the presidential election's outcome remained unsettled. "The markets want resolution, not fighting," said Peter Cordrey, who bought Treasuries yesterday for the $125 billion he helps manage at Prudential Asset Management in Newark. "People don't want this to drag out and be made into a constitutional crisis."
The most-active 10-year note rose 10/32, to a price of 99 18/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.81 percent from 5.84 percent. The 30-year bond rose 10/32, to 105 19/32, while its yield fell to 5.85 percent from 5.87 percent. 
 Treasuries rose throughout the day after an unexpected drop of 0.1 percent in producer prices, excluding food and energy, combined with news that jobless claims rose a more-than-predicted 344,000. This decline caused speculation that the Federal Reserve's next move might be to lower interest rates.
Government debt prices improved, however, after William M. Daley, Mr. Gore's campaign chairman, said the vice president would not concede even if the initial recount of Florida's vote showed Gov. George W. Bush winning the election. Investors are looking at stock declines and "making a run for Treasuries," said Brad Stone, a fixed-income analyst at Goldman, Sachs.
For the Treasury market, the election centered on which candidate would preserve more of the budget surplus, projected at $237 billion in the fiscal year ending on Sept. 30.
The vote left both the House and the Senate closer to evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats, making it less likely that the next president would be able to enact measures that would either erode the budget surplus or spur inflation.

Stocks Seesaw on Election News; Major Indexes Down Slightly

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
Investors went into shock but quickly recovered yesterday as they faced the possibility that the still-undecided presidential election might remain in limbo for days or weeks.
Stocks plunged in the early afternoon, after William M. Daley, the campaign chairman for Vice President Al Gore, said in a news conference that Mr. Gore might challenge the election results in Florida even if Gov. George W. Bush continued to lead after the state concluded its vote recount. 
 Barring reversals of the outcome in other states, Florida's 25 electoral votes will prove decisive in the most closely contested election in 40 years. Mr. Bush holds a slim lead in Florida with the recount nearly concluded. But Democrats complain that a badly designed ballot in Palm Beach County caused thousands of voters to have their ballots discarded when they meant to vote for Mr. Gore.
After Mr. Daley made his comments about 1:30 p.m., Eastern time, the Dow Jones industrial average lost more than 150 points in 15 minutes. At that point, the index stood at 10,618.49 and had fallen almost 3 percent for the day. Over the same period, the Nasdaq composite index slid 60 points, or almost 2 percent, to an intraday low of 3,087.06, barely above its low for the year.
But as the afternoon progressed, investors' fears subsided. By 4 p.m., the end of regular trading, the major indexes were off less than 1 percent. The Dow closed down 72.81 points at 10,834.25, the Nasdaq ended at 3,200.35, a loss of 31.35 points, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 9.14 points, to 1,400.14.
After Mr. Daley's comments, "people got a wee bit excited," said David Wyss, chief economist for Standard & Poor's. "The blunt fact is there aren't going to be tanks on the streets."
As long as both Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore agree to abide by the final results of Tuesday's election, the dispute is unlikely to cause a serious shock to the economy or the markets, said Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist for Deutsche Bank.
"This country is very level-headed, and at the end of the day we'll get this thing sorted out," Mr. Yardeni said.
But he added that stocks could be expected to remain unsettled until a winner was declared.
"Everybody's got some jitters waiting for this thing to be sorted out," Mr. Yardeni said. "There's some concern that the lawyers are going to take over and this thing is going to drag on for a while."
Investors are also worried that electoral uncertainty will be a drag on the already-slowing economy, said Robert Bacarella, co-manager of the $135 million Monetta Fund, which invests in small growth stocks.
Reflecting that nervousness, shares in consumer products companies like Coca-Cola and Kimberly-Clark rose yesterday as investors looked for companies more likely to post slow but steady growth in any economic or political environment. Coca-Cola gained $1.94, to $62.13, while Kimberly-Clark rose $1.63, to $66.13.
Many big technology stocks continued to suffer. Intel dropped $1.31, to $41.38, Sun Microsystems fell $2.69, to $97.63, and the EMC Corporation slid $4.75, to $85.25, though Microsoft gained $1.44, to $70.88.
"There's definitely a shift towards defensive stocks in the past six weeks," Mr. Bacarella said. "There's a general concern that the economy is slowing down, a shifting towards the foods and the drugs and the more predictable sectors."
Over the last month, Mr. Bacarella has increased the cash he holds in his fund from 5 percent to 25 percent. Although stocks have dropped during that time, he said he was not eager to start buying again. "We're just sitting, and I'm going to wait until I can see a definite bottom," he said. "I'm not going to be a hero."
Retailers and media companies, which are highly sensitive to economic growth, both had bad days. After warning that earnings for its December quarter would not meet analysts' estimates because of a slowdown in ad sales at its ABC network, Disney plunged $5.50, to $31.38, a 15 percent drop.
Other media companies also fell after a Merrill Lynch analyst, Jessica Reif, warned that the slowdown would not be confined to Disney. Viacom, which owns CBS, fell $4.19, to $53.38, while Fox Entertainment skidded $3.06, to $18, a 14.5 percent drop. Best Buy, a major retailer of consumer electronics, lost almost 40 percent of its value after warning that its earnings would fall short of expectations, closing at $32.50, a loss of $19.88.

HEADLINE: Japan Restates Economic Health

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, Nov. 10

 BODY:
Japan's government downgraded its official assessment of the economy slightly in a monthly report today, saying that it continues to move toward a self-sustaining recovery but improvements in the household sector are lagging.
Although slight, the downgrade was the first since September 1998. But a senior official of the Economic Planning Agency, which produces the report, denied it meant the economy was facing a downturn. 
 Haruhito Arai, director of the agency's domestic affairs, said: "We decided on a more cautious assessment. But that does not mean the economy is worsening. The recovery trend remains intact."
The agency said in its monthly report that "the economy has not emerged from a severe situation, with improvements in the household sector lagging, but overall a moderate improvement continues led by the corporate sector."
Mr. Arai said the agency wanted to draw a sharp contrast between the robust recovery in corporate spending and the lagging household sector, which includes personal consumption and employment conditions.
The agency left its assessment of personal consumption unchanged in the monthly report and upgraded the household income portion.
Core household spending, which excludes big-ticket items like automobiles, rose 0.9 percent in September from the previous month on a seasonally adjusted basis. But the gains in September failed to lift spending to positive territory for the July-to-September quarter.
Mr. Arai also cited a slowdown in exports and cautious corporate sentiment as factors for the downgrade in the overall assessment. "Exports to the United States and Europe are leveling off," he said.

Paramilitary Leader Is Killed in Israeli Attack
Helicopter gunships killed a Palestinian paramilitary commander and two bystanders in Israel's first planned slaying of a Palestinian militia leader in the most recent six weeks of violence. The killing of Hussein Obaiyat, a member of Yasir Arafat's Fatah organization, came as Mr. Arafat was preparing to meet President Clinton in Washington. A1 

After the meeting, the White House was notably muted in its assessment of prospects for tamping down the violence or moving back to the negotiating table. Mr. Arafat said he had told Mr. Clinton that he wanted to work toward peace, but he did not specify any particular steps. A10

Both Sides Battle as Bush Holds Slim Lead in Recount
Gov. George W. Bush clung to a slim majority in the Florida recount, which was incomplete. Vice President Al Gore's campaign vowed to back a court fight over questionable ballots in Palm Beach County after the tabulation was completed. Each side accused the other of politicizing the situation. Mr. Bush remained in Austin; Mr. Gore returned to Washington from Nashville. A1
 
The Florida secretary of state said 53 of the 67 counties had completed their recount, with Mr. Bush in the lead by 1,784 votes, by coincidence the same difference as in the original count. The Associated Press reported that its survey of 66 election offices found Mr. Bush in the lead by only 229 votes. A24
 
While Florida courts have the power to overturn elections and order new ones, they rarely do so, legal experts said, because of a reluctance to interfere in politics and a presumption that no election is without flaws. A1
 
Democratic campaign workers fanned out across Florida to collect accounts of improper procedures for use in eventual lawsuits. A30
 
Recounts were either under way or had become a prospect in four states besides Florida. New Mexico and Oregon were still completing their tallies. Mr. Gore was declared the winner in Wisconsin and Iowa, but by margins so slim that Republicans might seek recounts. A27
 
Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, said he was suggesting the possibility of postponing Congress's return until early December because of the distraction of the unresolved presidential race. A23

Original Sin

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
While no one still knows who won the election, I can tell you what the next cabinet should look like.
If George W. Bush is the winner, there is no doubt that his secretary of state should be Bill Clinton, his U.N. representative Joe Lieberman, his secretary of defense Sam Nunn and his secretary of the interior, unquestionably, Al Gore. The rest should be traditional Republicans. 
 If Al Gore is the winner, his secretary of state must be Colin Powell and his secretary of defense certainly Dick Cheney. Condi Rice would make a fine Gore U.N. representative, and you don't even have to ask who should be Mr. Gore's secretary of education -- George W. Bush. The rest should be traditional Democrats.
I'm serious -- sort of. When I was the Times correspondent in Jerusalem in the mid-1980's, I covered Israel's first non-wartime national unity government, which came about after Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Shamir tied in their election. They actually took turns ruling over four years. I never thought I would see that in America, but we may now need some version of national unity government.
A national unity government is deeper than mere bipartisanship. It is a government that reflects the fact that the electorate is so divided neither party has a mandate for its agenda and therefore must rule from the center, with a cabinet that looks like the electorate -- that is, with representatives from both parties.
Sadly, the next U.S. president, whoever he is, has been born in sin. There is no hope anymore for a virgin birth. Mr. Bush could reap a winner-take-all political harvest -- the House, the Senate and the White House -- without winning the popular vote and winning the Electoral College only because thousands of Gore voters in Palm Beach County had their ballots nullified or accidentally voted for Pat Buchanan. (Even Mr. Buchanan said yesterday that "most of these are probably not my votes.")
Mr. Bush can surely say, well, that's not my fault, and the election's over. Yet everyone will know that he did not win the popular vote or the Electoral College. And under those conditions the public would rebel -- I'm talking about mass protest not seen since the Vietnam War -- if Mr. Bush were to actually try to team up with conservative Republicans in Congress to ram through his agenda.
At the same time, Mr. Gore could mount a court challenge, but even if he wins, many Republican voters would feel they had been cheated by some legal ruse. And many others would feel uncomfortable with a judge's deciding the election. The G.O.P. Congress and Senate would rebel, and ensure that Mr. Gore's political life was miserable.
Either case is a prescription for malignant gridlock. The political analyst Kevin Phillips usefully points out there are two kinds of government gridlock: There is the gridlock the financial markets like -- benign gridlock -- in which the Republicans are blocked from implementing their most extreme tax cuts and Democrats their most excessive spending. And there is malignant gridlock, in which the parties are so at odds the government can't produce any coherent initiatives, at home or abroad.
We can't afford malignant gridlock for four years, and the world cannot afford malignant gridlock in America for four years. For everyone's sake, American democracy must be seen as being beyond manipulation. The stability of the world rests on that. That's why this unprecedented ending to a U.S. election calls for an unprecedented response -- some kind of national unity cabinet. George W. Bush boasted that he was the candidate who could actually bring people together. He may soon learn that such a unifying skill is no longer just a quaint virtue, but a necessity for governing. The same for Mr. Gore.
If both men understand that, there's hope that their presidency, though born in sin, can thrive. If they don't understand that, theirs, and ours, will be a bitter harvest.
P.S. My only hope is that no matter who wins, he will name Ralph Nader the first U.S. ambassador to North Korea. That way Ralph can spend his days with another egomaniacal narcissist, Dear Leader Kim Jong Il, and get a real taste of what a country that actually follows Mr. Nader's insane economic philosophy -- high protectionism, economic autarky, anti-markets, anti-globalization, anti-multinationals -- is like for the people who live there.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 ELECTION: PALM BEACH;
At the Epicenter of a Voting Dispute, a Chasm in the Streets

BYLINE: By DEXTER FILKINS 

DATELINE: WEST PALM BEACH, Fla., Nov. 9

 BODY:
As lawyers and election workers hovered gravely over disputed ballots inside Palm Beach County's government center, the scene outside dissolved into a debate over intelligence: one side ridiculed a candidate, the other side, the voters.
And so it went across the chasm of Olive Street, the usually quiet thoroughfare that cuts through downtown. 
 On one side of the road supporters of Vice President Al Gore gathered to demand a new vote across the entire county to undo the effects of the county's now-notorious ballots.
The Gore crowd chanted, "Re-vote! Re-vote!" and denounced Theresa LePore, the county supervisor of elections, who had approved the design of the ballots. The crowd swelled to several hundred by midday, when the Rev. Jesse Jackson stopped by to decry what he said was the denial of voting rights to many across Palm Beach County.
"There was a misalignment in the process," Mr. Jackson said. "If you drive your car down the road in a little car and your wheels are not aligned, you have a wreck. That was a wreck in West Palm."
But for many who came to demonstrate, the issue was less about the confusion of the ballots than about the presumed lack of intelligence on the part of Gov. George W. Bush. Many demonstrators waved signs that read, "Bush is too dumb to be president." Others talked of how the country's economy would slide if Mr. Bush entered the White House.
On the other side of Olive Street, the Republicans denounced those who complained about the ballots. They laughed at the Democratic demonstrators across the road and at those who had failed to figure out the ballot's instructions.
"I wasn't confused," several placards read.
Jack Rampriester, a mortgage broker from Boca Raton, said, "All you had to do was read the directions. Why is that only Democrats are complaining about the ballot language? Are they too dumb to read?"
Like many of those who marched and chanted outside the government center, Mr. Rampriester said he had decided to join the demonstration when he saw it on television at work. He and a friend, Pat Shanahan, put together a pair of homemade signs and jumped in their cars.
"Somebody had to come down here and tell the truth," Mr. Shanahan said. "The Democrats are talking a lot of nonsense. There wasn't anything wrong with those ballots."
Meanwhile, inside the government center, the woman everyone wanted to talk to -- Ms. LePore -- made her only public appearance at a press conference. And through her lawyer, Bruce Rogow, she declined a request for an interview.
Ms. LePore has been blamed for the ballot design that many say prevented them from selecting the candidate they wanted. She has said that she thought the design made the candidates' names easier to read.
"Hindsight is 20-20," The Palm Beach Post quoted Ms. LePore as saying, "But I'll never do it again."
While many people here said they respected Ms. LePore, some voters voiced their suspicions about the ballot design, spinning out theories of a conspiracy to throw the vote to Bush and the Republicans.
"She is the one who created this problem," said Edna Bookspan, who was playing bridge at the Fountains Condominium Complex, said of Ms. LePore, a Democrat. "I don't know why she did it, but I think ultimately Bush's people were behind it."

RUSSIA: SPY-TRIAL WITNESS RECANTS
A crucial early witness in the espionage case against the American businessman Edmond Pope has recanted his testimony in a letter to the court, Mr. Pope's lawyer said. But the lawyer said the court insists the witness, Anatoly Babkin, left, a professor at a Moscow technical institute, appear at the court in person. Mr. Babkin's letter reportedly says Russian counterintelligence agents forced him last summer to make false charges against Mr. Pope. Michael Wines (NYT) 

GERMANY: BACKING FOR PARTY BAN
The upper house of Parliament, which represents the country's 16 states, backed the government's drive to outlaw the far-right National Democratic Party. It voted 48-0 with 21 abstentions in favor of the ban, saying the party was seeking to undermine the constitutional democracy. The lower house is expected to support the ban next month, paving the way for the Constitutional Court to have the final say. Victor Homola (NYT)
 
GERMANY: GAY MARRIAGE BILL
A bill permitting gay marriages was passed by the lower house of Parliament, but it fell short of giving homosexual partners the same rights as traditional couples. The new law allows gay couples to register marriages officially, have the same tenant and inheritance rights as heterosexual couples and some joint parenting rights for children living in a gay couple's home. It does not, however, include original plans for equal tax and welfare benefits.

RUSSIA: NEW I.M.F. TALKS
Senior officials from the International Monetary Fund arrive in Moscow this weekend to draw up a new lending program for the Russian government, paving the way for Russia to begin talks with other creditors on billions of dollars in Soviet-era debt. The I.M.F. stopped releasing loan funds to Russia last summer. The government no longer needs new loans, but will use the agreement to start talks with the Paris Club of creditor governments on $42 billion in old debts. Sabrina Tavernise (NYT)
 
EUROPEAN UNION: MAD-COW TESTS
The European Commission pressed the 15 members of the European Union to carry out more tests for mad-cow disease after fresh discoveries of the disease in France.

SPAIN: BASQUE SUSPECTS HELD
In a series of overnight raids, the police arrested four suspected members of the Basque separatist group ETA and seized explosives and weapons.

Earlier this week the Madrid police rounded up a suspected six-member Basque group that was said to be planning attacks. Benjamin Jones (NYT)

ZIMBABWE: LAND PLAN VOIDED
The Supreme Court declared President Robert Mugabe's seizures of land from white farmers illegal and gave the government 48 hours to evict self-styled war veterans who have occupied the farms since February. Mr. Mugabe amended the Constitution this year to give him power to seize white-owned farms for blacks with no obligation to pay for the land if Britain, the former colonial power, did not provide the money.

SIERRA LEONE: CEASE-FIRE PACT
The government and the Revolutionary United Front have agreed to stop fighting after a meeting in Nigeria, the government said. It was the first cease-fire announcement since the rebel group broke a peace accord in May and took several hundred United Nations peacekeepers hostage. (Reuters)
 
SENEGAL: NEW DATE FOR VOTE
Senegal will hold a referendum on a proposed new constitution on Jan. 7, the government said. President Abdoulaye Wade originally called the vote for Nov. 27, but it was later postponed until Dec. 10 and then delayed again. Mr. Wade, elected last March, has promised to limit the powers of the president and strengthen the positions of the prime minister and the government, which would answer to Parliament. (Reuters)

HEADLINE: Silicon Alley's Revenues Fall, And More Layoffs Are Planned

BYLINE: By JAYSON BLAIR

 BODY:
The dot-com shakeout continued to reverberate through New York's Silicon Alley this week as several companies announced sharp revenue losses, and one said it would soon lay off more than 200 employees.
That company, 24/7 Media, an online advertising and technology company, said after the markets closed on Wednesday that it had missed analysts' expectations and that it would lay off a little more than 200 employees by the end of the year. 
 Another company, BigStar Entertainment, an Internet marketing company, said yesterday that its revenues dropped more than 45 percent in the third quarter of this year, although it did end the period with a narrowing net loss.
In the last few months, Silicon Alley's dot-coms have laid off more than 3,500 people. Dozens of companies, including the online delivery service Urbanfetch, Internet clothing store Boo.com and Urban Box Office Network, have closed or announced large layoffs since the beginning of September.
Economists believe the shakeout is unlikely to have any serious effect on New York's economy because Silicon Alley makes up only a small part of it. But government officials worry that if Internet companies' efforts to become leaner and more profitable are handled incorrectly, the industry's development could be stunted.
Analysts said that recent cutbacks reflect investors' caution about giving money to dot-coms and that companies feel compelled to cut expenses in the wake of disappointing third-quarter earnings reports.
Anna Copeland Wheatley, the editor in chief of AlleyCat News, a trade publication for New York's technology industry, said managers had become much more concerned about cutting the fat at their companies. Dot-com companies "are bringing in more senior managers who say that they need to tighten the belt and need to run much more lean," she said.

HEADLINE: How to Make the President Talk to the Local Pol

BYLINE: By Charles Fried; Charles Fried, a law professor at Harvard, is a former solicitor general.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
With Al Gore leading in the popular vote, but the presidential election still up in the air, many constitutional scholars have called for abolishing the Electoral College.
This would not necessarily be a good thing. The Electoral College is one of the political safeguards of federalism: those structural features of our constitutional system -- like the allocation of two senators to each state, whatever its size -- that of their own force and without court intervention assure that the states count as distinct political entities, not merely administrative units of one central government. 
 In every presidential election, the candidates are forced to persuade the voters state by state. They must address the particular concerns of voters as citizens of those states. They must work through local organizations, which are almost always related to the same state parties that elect governors and state representatives. Presidential candidates court governors for their endorsements, appear at rallies with local political figures, learn the names of state party officials. This process, which we see played out on the nightly news as the candidates move across the nation, is not just an exercise. To connect with local politicians and local crowds, the candidates must be briefed on local personalities and local issues. Skillful politicians will remember these acquaintances, and this knowledge of local concerns will stick with them when they get to the White House.
Indeed many successful politicians not only know how to play this game; they actually like it. They like knowing that the speaker of the House in Tennessee knows where all the bodies are buried and where the levers of local power are. Thus are formed networks of concern and of mutual interest and understanding. Our national politics takes on a texture into which the threads of particular state concerns and personalities are tightly woven.
It has ever been thus. But it need not be. We could become a more centralized state, like France. A constitutional amendment to elect the president by the plurality of the popular vote would redirect the candidates' attention to national audiences. National issues would drive out any attention to local concerns or personalities. National television would play a larger role than it does now. And this would lead to a further Starbucks-ification of our political life, where every locality and region would slowly homogenize with every other into one undifferentiated mass. Economic interests -- large business groups, unions and special interest groups whose focus was national, not local -- would play a still larger role in presidential politics.
Some might favor such a change, finding it more in tune with what may seem modern realities, but you can't get something for nothing. Many, I suspect, would regret the loss of the distinct texture of our American polity.
Some critics of the electoral system have pushed for states to adopt the Maine and Nebraska system of allocating the state's electoral votes in part by district, and thus more nearly in proportion to the popular vote in that state, instead of adhering to the winner-take-all system. This might seem to offer a way to avoid the hard choice: no constitutional amendment is necessary, and the chance of a divergence between the electoral and popular vote would become vanishingly small. We would not have to pay the price for the federalistic effect of the Electoral College, as we may do this year.
But as a divergence becomes unlikely, the distinct federalistic effect would also vanish. After all, if we were guaranteed that the Electoral College -- that is, the state-by-state system of electing the president -- would never diverge from the popular vote, then it would be only the popular vote that counted.
If we want states to play a part in federal campaigns, we must be prepared occasionally to accept a divergence between the electoral and popular votes.

HEADLINE: Hoping Web Success Strikes Twice

BYLINE: By ROBERT S. BOYNTON

 BODY:
Denis Dutton, a cherubic 56-year-old philosophy professor, has spent most of his professional career writing books on the theory of aesthetics and teaching Plato in New Zealand. But recently he has turned into a minor media celebrity, a cyberpublishing prophet who is invited to speak at e-book conferences from Los Angeles to New York.
In barely two years, a Web site he created, Arts & Letters Daily, has become required reading for the global intelligentsia. A witty compilation of the best essays and reviews in philosophy, literature and politics, it has developed a cult following, especially among writers who compete to have their articles listed and editors who mine it for ideas. 
 Now he is hoping to replicate his success by selling sophisticated, quality nonfiction through his online publishing venture, Cybereditions. "With the Internet there is a place for specialized, low-demand books, the kinds of books that never made economic sense for traditional publishers," he explained in an interview during an e-book conference in New York this week. Essentially Arts & Letters Daily and Cybereditions are like intelligent search engines, digging up the best material from dozens of places -- hard-to-find articles in the first case and out-of-print books in the latter -- and making them available electronically.
Although Mr. Dutton put Cybereditions online just four months ago, he conceived of it in 1997 to rescue scholarly and serious nonfiction writing from oblivion. Paradoxically, Arts & Letters Daily was originally intended as no more than a way to advertise Cybereditions. Its address is:
www.cybereditions.com/aldaily
 "Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine the site would become so popular," he said. Without ever having advertised, it attracts 760,000 hits a month by 92,000 different readers. On a typical day you might find a review of a book about the Marquis de Sade in The Independent (of London), an essay on Jacques Derrida's religious faith in Christianity Today and a quirky piece about cell phones from Technology Review.
"We get several thousands of hits every time he posts one of our articles," said The New Criterion's managing editor, Roger Kimball. "It is very widely read in academic and journalistic circles, and I know of writers in Great Britain and Australia who check it every single day." In November 1999, Lingua Franca magazine bought the Arts & Letters Web site, which had also entertained offers from Slate online magazine and The Chronicle of Higher Education.
Cybereditions is meant to appeal to a similarly highbrow audience. Guided by a board of distinguished academic advisers, it offers a select list of previously out-of-print books with new introductions, supplementary chapters, updated bibliographies and responses to critics. "That's why we registered the Web domain name booksthatbiteback.com," Mr. Dutton told the conference audience, although that Web address is not yet in use.
Even discounting the hype surrounding e-books, there is little doubt that Internet-related technology is beginning to revolutionize the publishing industry. This fall virtually every major publisher either started an e-book division or formed an alliance to produce digital versions of its printed products. The success that mega-authors like Stephen King have had transmitting e-books directly to readers has led longtime editors like Jason Epstein, former Random House editorial director, to predict the eventual demise of the large publishing conglomerates.
Meanwhile, the nonprofit Gutenberg Project offers digital versions of classic texts whose copyrights are in the public domain. And a few academic publishers have begun putting scholarly journals and monographs on line.
But nobody, Mr. Dutton was quick to remind the audience, is trying to do precisely what Cybereditions is. "Everybody in the e-book business is talking about Stephen King, airport novels or technical manuals," he said. "But what has been virtually ignored -- thank God -- is updated, serious nonfiction. We happen to think there is a real market for it."
Beyond making neglected classics available, Mr. Dutton is undermining some of Western culture's most cherished assumptions about books. Traditionally it takes years to write, edit and produce a book, which, once it leaves the printer, is unlikely to be altered further. Only a few titles have enough sales to warrant further editions, and when they do, there is often a long lag before corrections and additions appear. Cybereditions, on the other hand, will let authors add new material to a book in a flash, in much the way a newspaper updates a story from edition to edition.
Just as photography undermined the singularity of painted portraits, so online book publishing complicates the notion of a book as a fixed, enduring object. "Books will become more like computer programs that are revised 1.0, 1.01, 1.02, and then perhaps a 2.0 version if the changes to the text are big enough," Mr. Dutton said. "A book can be produced in a huge first printing and then be subject to what in the author's view are very unfair reviews. With a Cybereditions book it is possible for the author to immediately add material which might clarify or rebut criticisms."
At the moment Cybereditions offers fewer than a dozen books. So the project, like the e-book revolution itself, is still in its infancy and might very well go the way of Betamax. Still, Mr. Dutton said, he plans to acquire 1,000 more over the next two years. Among the first titles Cybereditions will be offering are Frederick Crews's "Skeptical Engagements," Brian Boyd's "Nabokov's Ada: The Place of Consciousness," Jonathan Yardley's memoir "Our Kind of People" and Mark Turner's "Death Is the Mother of Beauty." Noam Chomsky's "Cartesian Linguistics" and Ihab Hassan's "The Postmodern Turn," a philosophical classic to which the author is adding two new chapters, are also in the works.
Prof. Steven Pinker at M.I.T., one of Mr. Dutton's advisers, predicts that Cybereditions will find an audience among readers and writers alike. "Not only is he providing copies of hard-to-find books," he said, "but he's also offering the equivalent of a 'director's cut,' with bonus tracks thrown in, to mix a metaphor. That can only make a book more valuable.".
Mr. Dutton may have been born to be a publisher. He grew up in Los Angeles, where his parents were book dealers. (His brothers still own the two Dutton's, a family store.) After college he did a two-year Peace Corps stint in India, training the residents to grow mushrooms in air-conditioned underground caves. (The industry never took off.) Next he studied philosophy with Sidney Hook at New York University and completed his degree at the University of California at Santa Barbara.
He taught at the University of Michigan for a decade before moving to Christchurch, New Zealand, to teach at the University of Canterbury. In 1973 he founded the journal Philosophy and Literature, whose annual Bad Writing contest rewards the academic who has most egregiously mangled the English language.
Mr. Dutton is an accomplished pianist (his favorite composer is Scarlatti, whose sonatas he plays from memory), and also plays the sitar (he learned in India), occasionally performing in Indian restaurants.
Associates say that Mr. Dutton seems to have the ideal combination, integrity and chutzpah, to be an intellectual cyberpublisher. "Denis has the instincts of an entrepreneur, but the values of a scholar," said Mr. Crews, who was unaware that his 1986 "Skeptical Engagements" was out of print until Mr. Dutton contacted him.
Cyberedition's backers are betting that profitability and scholarship are compatible goals. Susan E. Woodward, an investment banker who was the chief economist of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and her husband, Robert E. Hall, an economics professor at Stanford University and a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution there, are investors. Ms. Woodward and Mr. Dutton met after she was quoted in a Fortune magazine article describing Arts & Letters Daily as her favorite Web site. When she learned that it was part of a larger book publishing project, she offered to invest and is now Cyberedition's chief financial officer.
Mr. Hall, who filed a much-cited study with the court on behalf of Napster, the MP3 music-file sharing service, was largely responsible for Cybereditions' decision not to encrypt its books.
"Traditional producers believe that enforcing their copyright means making sure everybody pays a high price for content, but that isn't necessarily the best way to exploit your rights," Mr. Hall said. "Tolerating a certain amount of leakage pays off. Given the serious nature of the books Cybereditions carries, the guy who illegally copies one is probably a low-value guy who wouldn't have bought it anyway. But letting him see the book increases the chances he might turn to Cybereditions when he is looking for something he does place a high value on."
Most Cybereditions titles cost $12.95 for an immediate download in either HTML or PDF formats, and will soon be available in print-on-demand editions. Mr. Dutton offers authors a royalty of 25 to 40 percent for the first 1,000 copies sold, compared with a range of 7 to 15 percent for traditional hardcover royalties. He calculates that Cybereditions will profit from any book that sells 120 copies or more.
For all his project's technological allure, Mr. Dutton's intellectual credo is notably old-fashioned. "We sometimes overemphasize the drama of the e-book revolution," he said.
"What publishing needs is good books, and the Internet is a terrific way to present the highest quality nonfiction to a moderate-size market in an economic way," he added. "But this is really a return to the cultural values that we had in the 40's and 50's. When the Internet makes the whole of the world's library available at any time of the day or night on one computer, now that will be a real advance in the history of publishing."

HEADLINE: BUSH AND ADVISERS, CONFIDENT OF A VICTORY IN RECOUNT, URGE GORE NOT TO STAND IN WAY;
Democrats Split Over Possibility Of Court Battle

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE and ALISON MITCHELL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 10

 BODY:
The Gore campaign's threat of a court fight over the presidential balloting in Florida set off a backstage debate in the Democratic Party today between party leaders who are rallying behind the vice president and others, including longtime Gore loyalists, who warn that such a fight could damage the party and the democratic process.
In a range of interviews, most Democrats said that, at least for now, they were fully supportive of Vice President Al Gore's decision to follow through with the recount of the vote in Florida, and some were passionately behind Mr. Gore. 
 Yet a smaller number contended that if Gov. George W. Bush was still ahead after the final count of absentee ballots late next week, Mr. Gore should back down and not prolong the battle. These Democrats said they feared that Mr. Gore's aggressive strategy could make them look like sore losers and hinder the party's drive to capture control of the House and Senate in the midterm elections.
Gore campaign officials, nervous that the misgivings of some Democrats could undermine their effort, urged Democrats to unite behind the vice president -- and prevent open defections. They delivered talking points to Democratic state chairmen and to members of Congress. And they planned to dispatch party leaders -- and probably Mr. Gore himself -- to meet with Congressional Democrats, possibly as early as this weekend.
Mr. Gore; his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman; and his campaign chairman, William M. Daley, have already begun calling potentially wayward Democrats in Congress, seeking their support and counsel.
"Obviously," said Mark Fabiani, Mr. Gore's deputy campaign manager, "this is a situation where consensus is very important, and everyone needs to understand what's at stake here and what we're fighting for and how we're fighting for it."
The Congressional Democrat who has been most vociferous in raising questions about the Gore strategy is Senator Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey, who heads the party's drive to help Democratic Senate contenders.
Far beyond Washington, other Democrats have raised questions as well.
"I think you have to worry about destroying our citizens' confidence in our system," said Casper R. Taylor, the Democratic House speaker in Maryland, who has been in public office for 25 years. "One of the things we've had going for us throughout our history is a fundamental belief in and respect for the American system. We damn near lost it in the Civil War, and we spilled one hell of a lot of blood to avoid losing it. And that's a lesson we should reflect on."
Many leading Democrats were just as outspoken in their defense of the Gore campaign. They said they saw no need to avoid court.
"I don't understand why it's a controversy," said Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts. "Inauguration Day is more than two months away. This doesn't interfere with anything."
Referring to suggestions that many voters in Palm Beach mistakenly voted for Patrick J. Buchanan when they intended to vote for Mr. Gore, Mr. Frank added, "Why would you not clean this up?"
He wondered sarcastically whether Mr. Bush wanted to "become president because of the involuntary existence of a group known as Jews for Buchanan."
The two Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill fell into step with the Gore campaign, playing down the possibility of a court challenge but leaving the door to one open.
"Obviously there are diverse opinions," said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader. "I would say the overwhelming consensus appears to be the vice president needs to exhaust the remedies available to him to hold open the possibility of a court settlement. That shouldn't be rejected outright before we know the facts. Most of us are interested in finality but not at the expense of fairness."
Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House minority leader, who held a conference call on Thursday with House Democrats to assess the election results, said: "My sense is that people are patient. They think this is really close, and Florida is the obvious decider of this race."
Mr. Gephardt said he thought it would be a mistake to rule out going to court.
"They want an accurate count, then they'll see where they are," he said. "If the court has got to be used for some reason for some valid purpose, that's another issue."
"Patience is a virtue," Mr. Gephardt said in an interview. But he also had to admit that he was watching a cooking channel at home on Veterans Day rather than the round-the-clock news coverage because "I just couldn't take it anymore."
Other Democrats are not so patient. An important fund-raiser for Mr. Gore questioned the vice president's strategy, saying, "At some point, you have to acknowledge that life is unfair and move on."
He and other Gore loyalists expressed concern that Mr. Gore and his top advisers risked putting the vice president in the worst possible position: he will have abandoned the posture of a statesman while also losing the election -- and that that could diminish his future viability as a candidate.
Mr. Torricelli put it this way: "There needs to be some understanding of the bounds of conduct. The proper bounds of this is that this should be settled with the counting of the ballots or there will be collateral attacks, it will lead to legal filings in state after state, and no one will succeed and the American people will have short patience."
H. Carl McCall, the New York State comptroller, while standing by Mr. Gore, suggested that he, too, had reservations about possible lawsuits from the vice president's campaign. If Mr. Gore is still behind after the recount, he said, he was not sure what the next step should be.
"There were clearly irregularities," Mr. McCall said, "but he could be perceived as unnecessarily prolonging this and creating instability. That's a very tough decision -- and only one the vice president can make."
And Joe Carmichael, the Democratic chairman in Missouri, said: "I'm a lawyer. We can play things out for an eternity. Obviously, that doesn't have to happen here."
It was clear that Gore lieutenants were exasperated about restive Democrats. Campaign officials said they scolded Democrats, including Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana, who publicly warned the campaign not to push too hard on the challenge.
"Bill Daley has been on the phone nonstop," Mr. Daschle said, adding that Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman had "talked to people including me. It's pretty clear they are attempting to stay in close touch with the leadership and the membership."
Mr. Fabiani dismissed Mr. Torricelli's remarks. "Torricelli has been critical of the Gore campaign for many months," he said. "Nothing he says bothers us or particularly surprises us."
Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska telephoned a reporter to clarify that he was fully behind Mr. Gore after a campaign official suggested to him that this article would include comments from critical Democrats. "I heard you're writing a story, 'Congressional Support Is Collapsing,' " Mr. Kerrey said. "I think they should keep pushing it to the point they can say we fairly evaluated this thing."
Even Democrats who think Mr. Gore should cut short his appeals said they felt deeply for him. "It's unbearable," Mr. Taylor said. "It's a human tragedy."
Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York said the problem was that any course the Democrats took was fraught with risks. "There can be danger if it keeps going beyond next week," Mr. Schumer said. "But all the evidence shows there could be danger in not having it go beyond next week."
At least one Democrat, Dick Harpootlian, chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party, argued that the Gore campaign should make its case even more energetically.
"Al Gore ought to get in there and fight for the majority of people in this country that voted for him," Mr. Harpootlian said. "I'm a litigator. I'd be a lot more aggressive than they have been in terms of litigating these issues."

Palestinian's Assassination May Signal New Chapter
Thousands of Muslims gathered in Bethlehem to mourn Hussein Obaiyat, a military leader in Yasir Arafat's Fatah organization who was killed on Thursday by Israeli helicopter gunships. Israeli generals made clear that more such killings could follow. Some Palestinian officials said they no longer felt bound by truce agreements, and paramilitary leaders promised revenge. A6
 
Yasir Arafat implored the Security Council to dispatch a roving, 2,000-member multinational force that could insert itself into the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. A6 

Testimony in Lockerbie Trial
Prosecutors tried to establish an alibi for Mohamed Abo Talb, a witness against the two Libyans on trial for the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988. The defense plans to suggest that it was Mr. Talb who destroyed the jumbo jet, killing 270 people. Mr. Talb has been jailed since 1989 for the bombing of an airline office. A7
 
Elections in Bosnia
General elections today will tell whether Muslims, Croats and Serbs reject the nationalist parties that have dominated their three communities. The voting is being closely watched by the Western officials who are running the country and are struggling to knit it together after years of war and ethnic killings. A5
 
Regionalism in Canada
Polls indicate that the conservative Canadian Alliance party could win enough votes on Nov. 27 to wipe out most Liberal parliamentary seats in the four western provinces. The Liberals, the only party with a real claim to a national standing, could emerge as a regional party of the east, and the Alliance could emerge as Canada's western party. A4
 
Argentina Looking for Debt Aid
Argentina, Latin America's biggest borrower, said it expected to receive support from international lenders to help revive its stagnant economy. But President Fernando de la Rua provided no details. Analysts have said such support may amount to an additional credit line of $10 billion or more from the I.M.F. and other lenders to help Argentina pay its debts. A8

Holding Slim Florida Lead, Bush Works on Transition
Gov. George W. Bush and his advisers said they were moving forward with preparations for a new administration and beseeched Vice President Al Gore not to stand in their way, cautioning that legal challenges to the election could yield wrangling without end. The latest results showed Mr. Gore with a lead in the nationwide popular vote of 218,441 votes. But in Florida, whose 25 electoral votes hold the key to the outcome, Mr. Bush led by 327 votes, according to the latest unofficial tally. There are still absentee ballots in Florida to be counted.

The Republicans signaled that if the Democrats prolonged the fight over Florida, they would ask for recounts in states Mr. Gore narrowly won. A15
 
Democratic lawyers say any decision on challenging the Florida vote in court will await a more detailed manual recount of ballots in three Florida counties that Democrats hope will give Mr. Gore a victory outright. That work is to begin today. A1

HEADLINE: In Upstate Victory Tour, Mrs. Clinton Says Electoral College Should Go

BYLINE: By DEAN E. MURPHY

DATELINE: ALBANY, Nov. 10

 BODY:
Senator-elect Hillary Rodham Clinton, who arrived here this morning from the White House for a victory tour of upstate New York, called for the abolition of the Electoral College. She pledged to be a co-sponsor of legislation that would provide for the direct election of the president and vice president.
Mrs. Clinton visited six cities upstate to thank supporters and to emphasize, if only symbolically, her plans to make the region's economic turnaround a cornerstone of her tenure in the Senate. But by weighing in immediately and forcefully on one of the country's most contentious issues, she also signaled that she does not intend to shrink from the prominent national role she has played in the past eight years as first lady. 
 "I have thought about this for a long time," Mrs. Clinton said at a rally in an airport hangar in Syracuse. "I've always thought we had outlived the need for an Electoral College, and now that I am going to the Senate, I am going to try to do what I can to make clear that the popular vote, the will of the people, should be followed."
Earlier, in a stop at the airport here in the state capital, Mrs. Clinton appeared with Representative Michael R. McNulty, who is a sponsor of a joint resolution in the House that calls for a constitutional amendment to eliminate the Electoral College. Mr. McNulty, a Democrat who represents the Albany and Schenectady regions, said that when he spoke with Mrs. Clinton before the rally, she pledged to push for passage of the resolution in the Senate.
When Mrs. Clinton was asked about the Electoral College after her speech in Albany, she pointed to Mr. McNulty and said he was "ahead of the curve" on the problems with that system. She said she wanted "to be on the side of the democratic process working," and so would support the effort to establish direct presidential elections.
"We are a very different country than we were 200 years ago," Mrs. Clinton said. "We have mass communications, we have mobility through transportation means to knit our country together that was not conceived of at the time of the founders' proposals about how we elect our presidents. I believe strongly that in a democracy we should respect the will of the people."
Her staff said the theme of Mrs. Clinton's tour was twofold: to let campaign workers and volunteers upstate know how much she appreciated their work and to set a cooperative tone, across party lines, for working on upstate issues in her new job.
By most measures, she succeeded on the first matter, thanking people by first names, hugging her campaign chief in Onondaga County, Cathy Calhoun, and using almost every compliment imaginable to describe the work of her volunteers from Watertown to Ithaca.
In Buffalo, she hooted in glee when, working the rope line, she came across Chito Olivencia, president of Nosotros, a Latino group in Buffalo that had endorsed her. In Ithaca, Democratic Party officials uncorked two dozen bottles of champagne in a white hangar, otherwise reeking of jet fuel, to toast her victory.
"She is our hope in upstate New York," said Kathy Sehnert, one of about 150 volunteers and other supporters who waited two hours for Mrs. Clinton at the Syracuse airport. "She made that promise, and we believe her."
Mrs. Clinton also talked about bipartisanship, even "nonpartisanship" in Albany, in taking on the many problems in upstate New York, most of them economic. "I had a very cordial conversation with the governor," she said. "We are going to be getting together and sit down to look at ways that we can work on moving forward on an agenda that benefits New York."
In Buffalo, she said her door would be open to everybody who was willing to help bring jobs and economic prosperity to the area, regardless of politics. "I intend to work in a bipartisan way," she said in an open-air hangar.
But by speaking publicly on a divisive aspect of the contested presidential election, Mrs. Clinton, who will remain first lady for more than two months, placed herself at the center of a political maelstrom that has bitterly divided Democrats and Republicans. Her remarks are likely to draw ire from her critics, especially those who believe that the White House should remain above the partisan fray on such an important constitutional issue.
Asked in Rochester if her husband shared her views on the Electoral College, she replied, "I don't know."
After Mrs. Clinton finished speaking in Syracuse and left through a side door, Mr. McNulty was denounced by a man in the crowd who accused him of unnecessarily politicizing the contested presidential race by raising the electoral issue. Mr. McNulty, echoing comments by Mrs. Clinton, said he hoped the new attention to the Electoral College would finally lead to its replacement by direct voting. He also noted that the legislation he and Mrs. Clinton had talked about would have no effect on the outcome of Tuesday's election.
During her stop in Rochester, Mrs. Clinton said her remarks about the Electoral College were not motivated by the dispute between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, but had rather evolved over time. "For years I thought it was an anachronism," she said. "It is like many other issues that you think about and you develop an opinion about, but it doesn't rise to the top of any agenda because there are other more pressing issues, like the upstate economy."
Mrs. Clinton sidestepped a question about whether she would support a legal challenge to the Florida vote should Mr. Gore lose. But she made it clear that she believed he should be the next president.
Mrs. Clinton shared the stage in Rochester with Representative Louise M. Slaughter, whose district includes the city and most of suburban Monroe County, and Judith Hope, chairwoman of the state Democratic Party. If the intention of Mrs. Clinton was to play down the partisan aspects of her victory, the two women at her side did not always help. Ms. Hope spoke of how Mrs. Clinton had managed to unite the Democratic Party for the first time in many years, and Ms. Slaughter described the state Republican Party as being in "total disarray" and predicted that it would face "bad times."
Mrs. Clinton tried to cast her views on the Electoral College as unrelated to party politics. "There is no escaping," she said, "that we are now in a situation where I think most Americans of either party would have to admit we should try to create a national consensus to do away with the Electoral College so that everybody knows that his or her vote will count."

HEADLINE: Mexico Plans to Double Number of Phone Lines

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 10

 BODY:
The incoming government wants to make telephones a basic service like electricity, doubling the number of phone lines within five years, President-elect Vicente Fox's top telecommunications adviser said.
In an interview on Thursday, the adviser, Emilio Goicoechea, a lawmaker who is secretary of the telecommunications committee in the lower house of Congress, said the Fox administration planned to foster investment with reforms to the federal telecommunications law. 
 Part of the vision is to make the Internet, as well as telephones, a basic service and to turn post offices nationwide into complete communications centers with public computers, he said.
Mr. Fox's team and legislators from his conservative National Action Party are also studying the creation of a fund for universal telephone service, to stimulate investment in poor areas where companies are reluctant to spend money now because of limited profits, Mr. Goicoechea said.
The Mexican economy is booming and the country is rapidly becoming more industrialized, but outside the urban areas, telecommunications development lags.
With only 11 telephone lines per 100 people, Mexico has the lowest proportion of lines among Latin America's big economies.
In some rural states like Chiapas in the south there are only 3 lines per 100 people, less than in very poor countries like neighboring Guatemala.
"We are talking about doubling the current infrastructure in five years," Mr. Goicoechea said, "going to 25 lines per 100. A benchmark cost per line is about $1,000. Multiply that by 13 million lines, and that gives you $13 billion" in investment needed.
"Even with penetration of 25 percent, we'd still be below the international benchmark," he said.
Industry analysts and insiders often blame Mexico's relatively slow growth in phone lines on a lack of competition because of the market dominance of the former state-owned monopoly Telefonos de Mexico, or Telmex, privatized 10 years ago.
Telmex, one of the biggest companies in Latin America with $10 billion in revenues last year, and one of the most popular foreign issues traded on the New York Stock Exchange, is Mexico's biggest local, long-distance and cellular phone company, as well as the biggest Internet services provider.
Critics of Mexico's telecommunications situation also say the regulatory agency, the Federal Telecommunications Commission, does not have enough teeth. Its efforts to curb Telmex's dominance are bogged down in court.
Mr. Goicoechea said reforms to the telecommunications law would foster competition and give confidence to investors. United States investors like AT&T and MCI WorldCom, both part owners of big long-distance companies here, have complained that unfair practices by Telmex have made it impossible for them to make a profit in Mexico.

Bayer to Stop Requiring Applications for Blood Drug
Under pressure from people with hemophilia, Bayer said that it would stop requiring patients to apply to a special corporate program for its new drug, Kogenate FS, which is in short supply, and would instead begin distributing it through normal channels.
In September, Bayer angered many hemophiliacs and their doctors by introducing the program, which requires patients to fill out an application. Under the plan, only those patients that the company approved would receive the new drug. At that time, executives said that Bayer did not want extra inventory of the drug held at pharmacies when it was in short supply. But patients and doctors said the program would only worsen the frequent shortages, and they said that they feared that Bayer might select only the patients with the best insurance -- a contention that Bayer denied.

Shopping Without Lines or Wires
E-commerce is already ho-hum this Christmas, and shopping malls are still perceived by many as parking traps.

Affymetrix Loses in Patent Case
A federal jury ruled that Affymetrix had infringed a patent held by a British company covering so-called gene chips, which are used for the rapid analysis of genes. Affymetrix is the leading provider of such chips, but the market is perceived to be so attractive that many competitors are emerging, and the decision could potentially make it easier for others to enter the market. But Affymetrix said the decision would have little effect on its business. Affymetrix's shares fell $7.06, or more than 8 percent, to $78.63. C14.

Japan Slightly Downgrades Official Economic Outlook

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 10

 BODY:
A budding recovery in Japan's economy is faltering, according to the latest government report, raising concern about whether the economy can generate enough steam to recover without more help from the government.
A report released late Thursday by the Economic Planning Agency lowered its appraisal of economic conditions for the first time in two years, saying weakness in major export markets threatened to derail the faint recovery currently under way. 
 The agency stressed that it was not saying the economy was poised to fall into recession. "We have not changed our assessment that a moderate recovery continues," Taichi Sakaiya, the agency's chief, told reporters. "We just have a sense of caution, which is more psychological rather than backed up by hard data." Last year, the economy rolled ahead in the first and second quarters on the back of record supplemental budgets, only to choke in the second half of the year when government spending dwindled.
Now it seems the economy is on the verge of repeating that pattern, although the backtracking is not expected to be as severe as last year, when the economy dipped into a recession in the second half.
Mr. Sakaiya said dwindling exports pointed to a deceleration of demand in the United States and Europe and were a reason for the agency's gloomier assessment, as well as persistently weak consumer spending. "We need to be fairly concerned about what happens overseas," he said. "It looks like the good times are coming to an end, and we need to be wary of that."
But the agency also released statistics on machinery orders by Japanese companies that some economists said suggested that business investment would continue to propel the economy forward, as it had almost single-handedly for the last several months. The report projected orders for the six months, indicating that domestic demand would offset faltering overseas demand.
The seemingly contradictory messages from the agency highlighted yet again the difficulty interpreting the economy's statistical signals. "The downgrade in their assessment suggests they are arguably marginally less optimistic," said Richard Jerram, an economist at ING Barings in Tokyo. "They are not becoming pessimistic, which is an important distinction."
Less upbeat economists construed the announcement as confirmation that the recovery was still precarious. "No, the economy is not going to slide into a recession in the latter half of the year like it did last year," said Ronald Bevacqua, senior economist at Commerz Securities in Tokyo. "But instead of growing 2 percent this year, it'll probably trundle along at more like 1 percent, which is nothing to write home about."
Consumption, which accounts for some 60 percent of economic activity, continued to slide in the quarter, which ended Sept. 30, according to the Management and Coordination Agency report that contributed to the government's more somber economic assessment.
"The failures of life insurers and the weaker stock market have definitely had an impact on consumer confidence," said Hiromichi Shirakawa, chief economist at UBS Warburg in Tokyo.
But some say the data the government relied on is contradicted by other statistics. "We see a rapid improvement in the labor markets, wages and consumer confidence, and the government doesn't seem able to explain the discrepancy," Mr. Jerram said.
Similarly, economists disagree on how significantly exports have contributed to the recovery. Mr. Jerram noted that net exports, the difference between exports and imports, has been flat for much of the year and thus largely irrelevant to the economy. "By highlighting export growth, the government is supporting the common misperception that this is an export-led recovery, and it's not," he said.
Mr. Bevacqua, on the other hand, said that while exports have not added much to the economy, much of the expected business investment is tied to strong external demand for Japanese products.
"The concern is that a lot of capital expenditures have been made because of strong external demand, and, perhaps more importantly, companies have been able to afford to make increased capital expenditures because of their export earnings," he said.

HEADLINE: Etienne Aigner, 95; Designer of Shoes With a Preppy Look

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
Etienne Aigner, a Hungarian-born belt maker and designer whose line of cordovan accessories with a distinctive omega-shaped logo helped define the preppy look of the 1960's and 70's, died in New York on Sunday, three days before what would have been his 96th birthday. He had homes in New York, Paris and Cannes.
Mr. Aigner (eh-NYAY), who was born in Ersekujvar, Hungary, in 1904, began working with leather while still a teenager, becoming a bookbinder to support himself. He had a lifelong affinity for working with his hands, said his sister, Betty Zentall. 
 Along with his older brother, he moved to Paris in the 1930's and continued binding books until after World War II began. Although he had converted from Judaism to Catholicism in 1938 when he married a Frenchwoman, Mr. Aigner found himself in danger and sought protection by joining forces in 1943 with a group of Resistance fighters in the Massif Central region in France, Mrs. Zentall said.
He returned to Paris after the war ended and started turning out handmade handbags and belts, attracting the notice of major fashion houses like Dior, Jacques Fath and Molyneux, which bought his designs and copied them, his sister said.
In 1950, he moved to New York, where his business prospects seemed better. He began working for a handbag manufacturer but did not take easily to mass production. Eventually, he struck out on his own. Using a corner of his bedroom in Washington Heights as a workroom, he starting making belts, finding that it was more economical to stick with a single color -- a deep red that became the Aigner signature.
Within a few years, high-end department stores were displaying his bags and belts, and orders were coming in from all over the country. By 1967, when he sold his interest in Etienne Aigner to a company called Villager, the product line included classic pumps and other accessories.
"It was a Nantucket lady kind of look, made of this indestructible leather that would wear and wear," said Paul Wilmot, a fashion publicist.
In 1969, Villager was acquired by Jonathan Logan, the dress manufacturer, and the Etienne Aigner brand grew substantially, said Richard J. Schwartz, the former chairman of Jonathan Logan, which was sold in 1984. "He had developed a wonderful look that we exploited," Mr. Schwartz said.
Mr. Aigner retained the European rights to his name after selling his American business. He continued to work occasionally as a consultant abroad and pursued other creative interests, like painting and cabinetmaking, Mrs. Zentall said.
In addition to his sister, he is survived by his wife, Suzanne; a daughter, Patricia Bonnet; two grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Nasdaq Takes Plunge of 5% on Dell News

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Stock prices tumbled again yesterday, falling for the third consecutive day amid questions about the outcome of the presidential election. But it appears that normal investor concerns, including the fear of sharply slowing earnings growth, are still fueling most of the selling.
Bond prices were mixed but did not indicate that investors were running there for cover. The dollar edged up against the euro and the Japanese yen. 
 Still, the Nasdaq composite index plunged 5.4 percent to its lowest level since Nov. 3, 1999. The technology-heavy index is now down 25.6 percent for the year and threatening to put in its worst performance since 1974. The index finished the week off 12.2 percent, its third worst weekly performance ever. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 2.1 percent, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 2.4 percent.
Dell Computer set off the selling with its announcement that sales growth is slowing. Also falling were Compaq, I.B.M., Microsoft, Intel, Cisco Systems and Hewlett-Packard. On the other hand, drug stocks, which are expected to fare better under a Bush presidency than a Gore presidency, were among the stocks that rallied.
"The technology stocks would be down anyway," said John Manley, senior equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. Thomas M. Galvin, chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, agreed. "The majority of the concerns are on the earnings front," he said.
But the presidential uncertainty is not a positive backdrop for an already troubled market, making it easier to sell on bad news. "It magnifies the negativity of the fundamental information flow," said Douglas R. Cliggott, United States equity strategist at J. P. Morgan Securities.
There were no major developments in the battle over Florida, whose 25 electoral votes are the key to victory. Mr. Bush led by 327 votes, according to the latest unofficial tally of votes that were recounted over the last few days. Officials plan to recount by hand ballots in several counties starting today.
At the end of the day, the Nasdaq was down 171.36 points, to 3,028.99. Its previous low was 3,074.68 on Oct. 12. The S.& P. 500 dropped 34.16 points, to 1,365.98. The Dow fell 231.30 points, to 10,602.95. The S.& P. 500 is still above its yearly low, set on Oct. 12. The Dow is still well above 10,000 after falling below it last month.
In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 5.78 percent from 5.81 percent on Thursday as its price, which moves in the opposite direction, rose 6/32 , to 9924/32 . The 30-year bond fell 7/32 , to 10512/32 , while its yield rose to 5.87 percent from 5.85 percent.
Neither Mr. Manley nor Mr. Galvin said they thought the technology sector would recover any time soon. "The Dell news is not good news," Mr. Manley said. "I don't think the technology numbers will get better for a while."
And while presidential uncertainty may not yet be a crucial concern for investors, there are still other issues to worry about. The Middle East is still explosive. Oil prices are still above $30 a barrel and members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, who are meeting this weekend, are now talking about curbing production to keep the price from falling in the event global economic growth slows down.
Worst of all, the American economy is slowing, a fact that many investors ignored for a long time as they hoped for continued double-digit growth in corporate profits. But as the effect of the slowdown on earnings became more apparent in September, technology and other stocks have been tumbling. "We started the year with 20-percent-plus earnings per share growth," Mr. Cliggott said, "and quickly we are heading to single-digit growth."
And now some analysts are more worried that the slowdown will turn into a hard landing for the economy that might even bring on a recession. With the stock market heading for its worst year in at least a decade, some analysts are thinking that consumers will curb their spending, making a hard landing more likely.
Mr. Galvin said that there was a tug of war going on among equity fund managers. On one side are those who say the slowdown will be modest, meaning that the economy can grow about 3 percent next year while profits climb about 10 percent. But on the other side are money managers who say the economy will slow even more, bringing corporate profit growth closer to zero next year.
"People have too many questions and too few answers," he said.
Federal Reserve policy makers will meet on Wednesday to decide whether to move interest rates. With signs that the economy is slowing, no one is expecting an increase. But neither are analysts expecting the central bank to cut rates. The Fed's rate on overnight loans between banks is 6.5 percent after six increases since June 1999.
Dell Computer announced on Thursday that its third-quarter earnings doubled, but that its growth rate in sales would slow to about 20 percent next year. It was the third time this year that Dell has cut back its sales-growth target. Dell's stock dropped $5.38 yesterday, to $23.
Dell's problems reflect those of many of the other technology companies that have fallen in the selloff that began in September. Technology companies trading at very high valuations meant that the companies had to continue to produce increases in the growth rates of sales and earnings. Now, even though sales remain strong, the slowdown in the growth rate is enough to ignite a selloff.
Nortel Networks, the Canadian maker of telecommunications equipment, started a slightly bigger daily Nasdaq selloff before the election when it said on Oct. 25 that its third- quarter sales, although very strong, rose less than expected. The Nasdaq fell 5.6 percent that day, its biggest daily decline since May.
Calculating the effect of the presidential election uncertainty is difficult. Mr. Manley said that the uncertainty did have an effect but only as "a flavor enhancer." He also said that because of the way the race was being finished, the traditional honeymoon for the new president was unlikely, no matter the outcome. And that means whatever lift stocks may have received from that will be lost. But he thinks the two "are fairly minor negatives."
At the same time, he argues that with either Mr. Gore or Mr. Bush as president, the new administration will not be able to accomplish much, including a health care overhaul or large tax cuts. And that is close to the kind of gridlock that the nation has had over the last six years and that many Wall Street analysts say is the best for both stocks and the economy.
But that does not mean that dragging out the final decision of who is the next president will not eventually become a serious negative for stocks.

HEADLINE: Making Economic Lifeline of a Wartime Trail

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

DATELINE: SON TRACH, Vietnam

 BODY:
Sometimes when the road builders set off their blasting caps here along the old Ho Chi Minh Trail, one of the bulldozer operators gives an involuntary, comical little duck of the head, as if someone were dropping bombs nearby.
"Then I realize I don't need to be afraid," said the operator, Nguyen The Du, 53. "I tell myself: 'Don't worry. The war is over.' " 
 Sometimes when monsoon rains wash out the newly carved road here in Vietnam's remote western mountains and the workers huddle under tarpaulins, Mr. Du is overcome by a sudden wave of loneliness.
"I remember how we sat around talking, just the way we're sitting now, and it was always in our minds that at any moment, one of us could be dead," he said. "Somebody's face comes back to me suddenly as if he had just disappeared, the way he disappeared back then."
Mr. Du is one of Vietnam's heroes, a survivor of six years as a youth volunteer on the Ho Chi Minh Trail, one of the most dangerous places to be for a Communist fighter during the Vietnam War.
He is back here again today, near what used to be the demilitarized zone between the North and the South, part of a hugely ambitious new effort to carve a real 1,000-mile highway through the mountains along the route of the former trail.
When he worked here before, filling bomb craters as fast as they were made, the trail was a shifting network of jungle paths along both sides of the Laotian border. The workers here like to say it was that trail that defeated the American military, transporting men and equipment from North to South despite some of the heaviest nonstop bombing of the war.
The new project is perhaps as characteristic of today's Vietnam -- as President Clinton prepares to visit the country next week -- as that stubborn, ingenious effort was of the Communists' spectacular wartime success. It is cumbersome, expensive, controversial and, say its critics, wrongheaded.
It diverts scarce resources into a monumental project that is more in tune with the past than the future, the opponents say, benefiting entrenched interests and offering questionable benefits. Vietnam already has a north-south highway and a parallel rail line, though both are in bad repair.
In this way, the project represents a continuing tug of war among Vietnam's leaders -- over how much and how fast to open up to the world's new global economy, and how much to preserve of the centralized, steel-mill and cement-plant approach that characterized its Communist models, Russia and China.
"The Ho Chi Minh Highway is a symbol of not understanding how to invest in the modern world," said Tom Vallely, a Harvard-based expert on Vietnam's economy and a persistent critic of the project.
"You could use the same resources to improve the educational system, the telecommunications system, the Internet system, which are essential to the modernization of Vietnam," he said. "This highway represents the old economy. The Internet is the real road. I think the big question for them is, do they want to go for the old-economy road or the new-economy road."
Mr. Vallely suggested that with a five-year Communist Party Congress due early next year, the project amounted to a political giveaway to some of the cumbersome state-owned enterprises -- like the overpriced cement monopoly -- that stand to lose if market reformers gain the upper hand.
He said he doubted that international donors would put money into the highway.
The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, two of Vietam's leading donors, say they have not been asked to help although they have assisted other road projects, for instance repairing the current north-south route, Highway 1.
Vietnamese leaders say the four-year, $680 million project will give a badly needed lift to its transportation system and will help develop the Central Highlands. And they are using it as a propaganda rallying point, evoking heroic wartime images as they call for a mass mobilization of labor.
But the project has also become the focus of unusual opposition within the country. Its cost and its threat to nature preserves and endangered wildlife are causing concern, as is its potential disruption of the traditional way of life of the hill-tribe minorities that populate the mountains.
In a rare sign of opposition, The Saigon Times reported in 1997: "Most deputies of Ho Chi Minh City, Haiphong and Quang Ninh expressed their concern over the feasibility. Some even voiced their doubts about the economic efficiency of this proposed artery route." They reportedly suggested that the existing highway and railroad be upgraded.
Planners say the project will involve 60 million working days, and one proposed way to find workers, apparently modified this month in the face of bad publicity, has been particularly controversial: mobilizing unpaid labor on a grand Communist scale reminiscent of Soviet and Chinese projects.
Vietnam itself has a history of mass labor projects for irrigation, flood control and national defense. Some 300,000 volunteers like Mr. Du worked on the original Ho Chi Minh Trail.
This time, according to the official press, as many as a million people living along the route would be drafted to contribute 10 days each of free labor, or would pay a fee to be exempted.
"A far-reaching movement must be begun to carry on the great mettle of the nation with which we will march toward a new peak," said Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet three years ago, employing the grandiose language of Communist exhortation. "This will be a great construction site with the work of millions of people."
But he was apparently aware of the darker images he might be invoking, and asserted that no intellectuals or professionals would be drafted to wield picks and shovels.
Still, Vietnam is changing. Private enterprise is growing; there is no longer a war to unify the people, and the idea of volunteer labor is highly unpopular. With the project just getting under way this fall, the government appeared to back off the plan, saying workers would be paid a minimum of about $1 a day.
"There is no forced labor involved in this project," said Bui Viet Bao, an official of the Ministry of Labor. "They are all people who want to find work."
That is not implausible, in one of the poorest nations in the world, where per-capita income averages $370 a year -- even less in these remote mountain areas -- and where rural unemployment can reach 30 percent.
So the project is proceeding, with plans for more than 300 bridges and six high-speed lanes at some points. And despite proposed alternatives, it has not been diverted away from national parks.
Opponents say it will cut through or pass close to 10 environmentally protected areas, including Vietnam's first national park, in the north, and the Phong Nha nature preserve here in Quang Binh Province. Environmentalists say logging and plantation-building have cost Vietnam one-third of its forest cover in just the past 15 years.
The government deflects the criticism, arguing that the current north-south road is narrow, prone to flooding and inadequate, and that the new highway will link isolated communities in the highlands.
And with foreign goods and ways of life invading Vietnam as it opens to the outside world, the project evokes some of the Communist Party's strongest images of past heroism. "The new road is at the heart of the Vietnamese people," said Duong Tuan Minh, the project's deputy general director.
Past and present overlapped the other day as Mr. Du, the bulldozer operator, sat over a bowl of pungent noodle soup in a tin-roofed shack by the side of the construction site.
Unexpectedly, a small television set behind him began broadcasting black-and-white documentary film of wartime youth volunteers like himself, rushing to fill bomb craters on the trail.
Mr. Du looked at the screen and seemed a little distracted.
"Things are quite different now," he said. "Back then, we were part of a huge thing, a national duty. We worked beyond our capacity. Nothing could stop us. Back then we didn't care about dying. We just worked as hard as we could. Now it's different, but I still do the best I can."

HEADLINE: COUNTING THE VOTE;
Excerpts From Bush's Remarks About Election

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from remarks yesterday by Gov. George W. Bush in Austin, Tex., and a Bush representative, James A. Baker III in Tallahassee, Fla., as recorded by The New York Times.
 
Comments by Mr. Bush
This is Secretary Cheney, Larry Lindsey, my chief economic adviser; Condi Rice, national security adviser; Andy Card you know; and Clay Johnson. 
 There was a count on election night and there's been a recount in Florida, and I understand there's still votes to be counted, but I'm in the process of planning, in a responsible way, a potential administration. There's been a series of ongoing meetings that the secretary and I have had on a variety of subjects so that should the verdict that has been announced thus far be confirmed, we'll be ready. And I think that's what the country needs to know, that this administration will be ready to assume office and be prepared to lead.
Larry in particular is going to talk about the markets. And Condi is going to bring us up to date on a lot of matters; there's issues in Israel right now that I'm looking forward to hearing about. And these meetings will go on for a while, and then tomorrow the secretary and I are going to be up at the ranch, and we'll have more meetings. And any questions you have about what's happening in Florida, we'd ask you to refer those to James Baker. Secretary Baker is in charge of the process. He's doing a very good job down there, so I would ask that any questions you have about the politics of Florida, Mr. Baker can handle those questions.
 
 Q. Governor, generally, though, do you think it's time for Al Gore to give up?
 A. You know, Frank, I think each candidate and each team is going to have to do what they think is best, in the best interests of the country. And I think in the best interests of the country, it's in our country's best interests that we plan in a responsible way a possible administration. And there have been two votes, and we're pleased with the results of the two votes.
 Q. Governor, since you seem so sure that you will win, have you given thought to resigning early as governor of Texas to give your full attention --
 A. Well, I am mindful that there are still votes to be counted, Tom, and we're -- each -- I believe, as does Secretary Cheney, that the responsible course of action is to prepare and that's what we're doing here in Austin, Tex. We're taking our time; we're in a very low-key manner preparing for a possible administration. And -- but there's still votes outstanding. And I understand there's still votes outstanding.
 Q. Traditionally, Governor, though, when you're in the transition period you get the cooperation of the outgoing administration. Are you making any contact with the outgoing administration?
 A. I think that's a little early, Frank. Right now there's still votes to be counted.
 Q. Governor, what do you say to people who, if you take office, think you will be illegitimately taking office? What would you say to those people?
 A. Repeat the question, please.
 Q. For people outside, you've seen the protesters, who say it won't be a legitimate presidency because of how close it was. What do you say to those people?
 A. I would say we have a Constitution and that's -- this is -- and I'll live by the Constitution. We've had two vote counts already, and I'm pleased with what's happened. And I'm sure there's going to be some people disappointed that their man didn't get in, but there's also going to be a lot of people very happy. But our job will be to unite the country, and I'm confident that a Bush-Cheney administration will be able to do so in a dignified way, in a way that would --
 Q. You talked about bipartisanship, about being divided or nondivided; what would be your first step to extend an olive branch to them?
 A. I think we've got to make -- just get the election behind us and then we'll be glad to explain what our strategy would be. Right now we're obviously planning in a way that I think Americans will find responsible, a responsible way. I think it's up to us to prepare the groundwork for an administration that will be ready to function on Day 1. . . .
 Q. Was Nov. 17 when the tabulation of all the absentee ballots -- is that the cutoff date? Is that when you will figure that the election is over and these court challenges and all that can go to wherever?
 A. I think, again, I'd refer you to Secretary Baker there in Florida.
 Q. Do you have any concerns about your ability to govern given that Gore won the popular vote?
 A. I think they're still counting the popular vote. And no, I don't at all. I'm looking forward to bringing this nation together. I've had a record of being somebody who can unite and reach across the partisan divide to get positive things done.
 
Comments by Mr. Baker
 The vote here in Florida was very close, but when it was counted Governor Bush was the winner. Now, three days later, the vote in Florida has been recounted. Over two-thirds of the state election supervisors overseeing that recount are Democrats. At the end of this recount, Governor Bush is still the winner, subject only to counting the overseas ballots, which traditionally have favored the Republican candidates. No evidence of vote fraud, either in the original vote or in the recount has been presented.
Now, the Gore campaign is calling for yet another recount in selective and predominantly Democratic counties where there were large unexplained vote swings in their favor in the recount. It appears that the Gore campaign is attempting to unduly prolong the country's national presidential election through endless challenges to the results of the vote here in Florida. Furthermore, the more often ballots are recounted, especially by hand, the more likely it is that human errors, like lost ballots and other risks, will be introduced. This frustrates the very reason why we have moved from hand counting to machine counting.
Let me say a word specifically about the Palm Beach ballot. There's a rule of law to be followed in all elections. The State of Florida has established legal procedures to design, approve, publish and if need be to protest ballots before the election. The ballot was designed by a Democratic elections supervisor. She approved it. The Democratic Party did not question it before the election. This butterfly-type ballot was used in recent elections in the same county and under the same rules, and again the Democrats did not complain. The overwhelming majority of voters who used the ballot in this election understood it and they cast valid votes.

HEADLINE: COUNTING THE VOTE: FLORIDA'S DIVERSITY;
Vote Spices Up Bubbling Ethnic Stew

BYLINE: By DANA CANEDY

DATELINE: MIAMI, Nov. 10

 BODY:
At a coffee shop in Little Havana, at a cab company in Liberty City and in between games of canasta at a retirement community in Delray Beach, black, Jewish and Hispanic voters who rarely agree on much agreed on at least one thing today: the racial and ethnic undertones of the election chaos show just how fractured this highly diverse part of the country can be.
In South Florida, where diversity is as much a part of the landscape as the white-sand beaches and the sun-kissed resorts, many racial and ethnic minorities acknowledged that their communities were too often isolated by perspectives as much as precincts. 
 Blacks and Haitian-Americans say they often feel marginalized. Many Cuban-Americans, especially since the Elian Gonzalez custody saga, say they are misunderstood. And some Jewish retirees see all the talk about race and ethnicity as overstated.
In some ways, the reaction to the election turmoil, many say, is the latest reminder of these divisions. Cuban-Americans say they feel on the sidelines of the battle over whether there should be a re-vote to decide whether Gov. George W. Bush or Vice President Al Gore won Florida.
But the dispute has at least temporarily created an alliance between Jews and blacks in South Florida.
"The Jews want something similar to the blacks," said Al Hooks, a cab driver and part-owner of Society Cab in Liberty City, a low-income, predominately black community. Both groups, he believes, desperately want to elect Al Gore president. Many, he said, are angry about what they see as an unfair election process in this part of the state.
Dozens of elderly Jewish voters in Palm Beach County said confusing ballots had caused them to mistakenly vote for Patrick J. Buchanan, the Reform Party candidate, who is perceived by some as anti-Semitic.
Many blacks, meanwhile, said tactics at some polling places had been intended to keep them from voting. It may take a court to sort out the all the contentions, but Mr. Hooks's mind is made up.
He said common ground had been found between Jews who believe they lost out on a chance to elect the first Jewish vice president, Mr. Gore's running mate, Joseph I. Lieberman, and blacks who say they may have lost an opportunity to keep a Democrat in the White House.
"I think it will make us closer," said Mr. Hooks, 60, who is black and voted for Mr. Gore.
Arnold Clark, an unemployed black man from Liberty City, said he tried to vote but was turned away because of a felony robbery conviction in 1986, even though he said he had gotten clemency papers and displayed a voter registration card. He said he hoped the election chaos would serve to unite people.
"We should fight together because the system can't work unless we all come together," Mr. Clark said. "Blacks, Hispanics and Jews have all been persecuted, and we should be trying to get a mutual understanding."
A voter who is Jewish, meanwhile, said race and ethnicity were not the point at all.
"It has nothing to do with black or white or green or Cuban," said Natalie Cantor, a 71-year-old resident of the Lakes of Delray retirement community in Delray Beach. "It has to do with the future."
But adversity brings people closer together, Ms. Cantor said. Besides, she said, "The African-Americans are better educated than in my day, and water rises to its own level whether you're black or white or whatever."
Tiffany Roker, a 26-year-old mother and security guard at a hotel in South Beach, said that she was filled with pride when she was so many faces -- black, brown and white -- at New Birth Baptist Church in North Miami on Wednesday, where the Rev. Jesse Jackson spoke about the election problems. Ms. Rocker, who is black, has long believed that white people try to control blacks and Hispanics "take so many jobs."
But at that church on Wednesday, at least for one night, she felt something else. "It was the only time I'd seen so many blacks and Jews come together," Ms. Roker shaking her head, as if she still did not quite believe it.
The post-election rallies may be a source of unity for some South Florida minorities, but "there are certain things that still divide blacks and Jews," said George Wilson an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Miami. "This one issue is not likely to carry over into other spheres of social and economic life," Mr. Wilson said.
Ms. Rocker and others say they are not at all certain just how far the tender thread of unity will stretch. And some say it is altogether invisible to them.
"It seems that blacks and Jews and Hispanics will never agree on anything," said Marisel Fernandez, a 23-year-old fashion design student who lives in Little Havana. If voter fraud was committed it should certainly be investigated, she said. But if blacks feel they lack the support to help bring an investigation about, it is their own fault, she believes.
"African-Americans alienate themselves," she said. "They hold rallies in their own churches, in their own neighborhoods and only with their own people. They don't invite anyone else to join them in their cause."
Professor Wilson said: "The majority of Cubans are going to adopt the Republican standpoint. African-Americans are going to echo the sentiments of the would-be Gore administration. That's going to be another source of division and tension in this community for weeks and months to come."
Manuel Reyes says he that is tired of the finger pointing and that all of Florida suffers when the state does not embrace its diversity.
"After the Elian issue, everyone has a bad opinion about Florida," Mr. Reyes said as he drank Cuban coffee outside a coffee shop in Little Havana. "Now it only gets worse."
Karen Mitchell, 39, a computer technology student from Deerfield Beach who is white and not Hispanic, said one did not have to be minority to see that the election fallout had been racially divisive. And she echoed Mr. Reyes in saying that all Floridians were hurt by it.
"It is providing entertainment for the rest of the world," Ms. Mitchell said. "It is like a South Florida soap opera."

HEADLINE: Thinkers on the Left Get A Hearing Everywhere but at Home;
Europeans, Wary of Globalization, Embrace American Economists Who Heed Social Needs

BYLINE: By ALEXANDER STILLE

 BODY:
James Tobin, a Nobel Prize winner who served as an economic adviser to the Kennedy administration in 1961 and '62, has lived in quiet retirement for more than a decade in New Haven. Yet thousands of French demonstrators are likely to invoke him as their intellectual champion next month during protests at the coming summit meeting of the European Union. They are members of a new organization formed expressly to promote the so-called "Tobin tax," a tax on foreign currency and international financial transactions that came within six votes of being adopted by the European Parliament this year.
In Britain, the Labor Party is contemplating a proposal to give $14,000 to every 18-year-old to invest either in his education or in a house -- a modified version of an idea proposed by Bruce Ackerman, a law professor at Yale University, in his book "The Stakeholder Society." 
 Meanwhile, "The Access Society," the latest book of Jeremy Rifkin, an outspoken American critic of genetically modified food and what he calls the new "hypercapitalism," is the No. 1 seller in Italy and No. 3 in Germany, even though it failed to make national best-seller lists in the United States.
The three men are examples of a curious trend: the popularity in Europe of left-of-center American economists and thinkers who are largely ignored at home.
With a mixture of puzzlement and amusement in his voice, Mr. Tobin said, "There are probably more members of Attac in France than people who know my name in the United States." He was referring to the Association for the Taxation of Financial Transactions for the Aid of Citizens, an organization -- now 27,000 members strong in France -- created to promote his tax proposal.
In the view of some American conservatives, Europe is simply behind the times, picking up ideas that have been discarded in the United States, in an effort to save the old European welfare state. "It's retrograde and reactionary mushy-headed liberalism," said Rudiger Dornbush, a professor of economics at M.I.T. "Europe tries to defend the status quo against the better sense of the free-market revolution." The European Wall Street Journal recently compared the resurgence of the Tobin tax in Europe to a vampire that keeps rising from the dead.
But others, like Bernard Cassen, the president of Attac, argue that Europe is in the vanguard of an effort to ensure that the current economic boom of globalization serves social ends. "Globalization was supposed to be the answer to everything," he said, "and what we see is growing inequality of wealth between nations and within nations, reduction of health and social benefits, greater job insecurity."
Europe is searching for alternatives to what it calls winner-takes-all capitalism, often referred to as the American model, and Mr. Cassen believes there is enormous symbolic value in linking a prominent American economist like Mr. Tobin to the growing movement to redirect the boom of globalization toward social ends. It shows that the movement is not anti-American, he said, and it gives what might otherwise appear like pie-in-the sky idealism grounding in the very specific proposals of a world-class economist.
To David Spector, a French economist teaching at M.I.T., one reason for American progressives' popularity is that they function as "American dissidents" serving France's critique of a phenomenon that is widely perceived as American in its origins. Thus, being able to cite American critics of globalization and contemporary American capitalism -- among them, besides Mr. Rifkin, the economists Lester C. Thurow, James K. Galbraith and Robert B. Reich -- is, for the European left today, a bit like the anti-Communists of the 1970's quoting Russian dissidents like Andrei D. Sakharov and Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn.
Mr. Rifkin agrees. "Generally," he said, "what they hear from us is: 'If you don't get with the program -- efficient markets 24 hours a day, 7 days a week -- you are going to get steamrollered. They are worried about being left behind economically, but they are also worried about keeping the quality of life in Europe, which in many ways is better than ours. For them to hear -- from other Americans -- that it's all right for them to be suspicious of the American model is very welcome."
Even more significant from an American perspective is that after taking the European tour, some of these ideas are finally getting a hearing in their birthplace. Mr. Rifkin said that after the protest against genetically modified food became big in Europe, major American companies like McDonald's and Archer Daniel Midland changed their policies. Similarly, he said, Washington was pressured to respond to the European campaign to forgive third-world debt, and objections from the European Community forced significant modifications in the proposed merger of America Online and Time Warner. "Europe is not the mouse that roared," Mr. Rifkin said, "it's become the elephant that roared."
Next month, on a hectic schedule of European appointments, Mr. Rifkin will be meeting with the leadership of the French parliament. Mr. Rifkin's 1995 book, "The End of Work," with a 20-page introduction from the former French prime minister Michel Rocard, pushed the idea of a 35-hour work week, which is now French law. Italy's prime minister, Massimo D'Alema, dedicated most of an hourlong press conference to Mr. Rifkin's 1998 book, "The Biotech Century," when it came out in Italy last year.
Another reason American progressives are playing such a conspicuous role in Europe's efforts to come up with a "third way" between socialism and American-style capitalism, said Mr. Ackerman of Yale, is that they are not Marxists. The European left has been traditionally dominated by Marxism, and as it seeks to create an alternative kind of capitalism, it looks to left-of-center American economists have been working within the capitalist paradigm for their entire careers. "I think something we all have in common is that we accept the basic structure of capitalism while trying for a more democratic and egalitarian form of capitalism," Mr. Ackerman said.
The idea behind Mr. Ackerman's notion of giving every 18-year-old $80,000 is to create a contemporary version of the 19th-century homesteading notion of 40 acres and a mule. This, he reasons, would promote equality not by increasing government services but by making everyone a potential capitalist.
"There are a lot of people interested in a kind of realistic utopianism," said Mr. Ackerman, who recently returned from a conference in Germany at which he delivered the keynote address.
His ideas, he said, have attracted expressions of interest from politicians in such countries such as France, England, Germany and Brazil but nothing of significance from American politicians.
All the same, he maintains, his idea of giving people an $80,000 stake to invest is in certain ways not that conceptionally different from Gov. George W. Bush's proposal to allow young people to create investment accounts with their Social Security contributions, what Mr. Bush referred to in his campaign as "prosperity with a purpose." Mr. Ackerman said that in Alaska, each year, every citizen gets about $1,900 from oil revenues -- "and it's a Republican idea."
Mr. Tobin, who originally proposed the so-called Tobin tax in 1972 as a means of reining in unproductive currency speculation, has mixed feelings about his sudden burst of popularity abroad. "My name gets associated with some proposals that I never actually made," he said. "I was trying to stabilize the international monetary system and penalize speculation, since most foreign exchange transactions are reversed within the week if not within the day. Of course, the revenue it generates can be put to good purposes, and I have no problem with that, but I'm not against globalization. I'm a free trader."
Some $1.3 trillion changes hands each day in foreign currency transactions. The suggested Tobin tax of 0.25 percent would raise about $250 billion a year -- more than five times the current level of all international aid. But the idea is almost impossible for any single country to adopt on its own because currency traders would simply shift operations elsewhere. The French treasury minister, Laurent Fabius, a Socialist, rejected a proposed Tobin tax in August.
But Mr. Cassen argues that the plan will work only if all of Europe adopts it. "We see Europe as a Tobin zone," he said.
Mr. Dornbush said he considered the tax a bad idea but acknowledged that it does have a chance in the European Parliament: "They are the rear-guard of the future, the home of government intervenionism. They will tax anything that moves."
While the Tobin tax is unlikely to make headway here, there is evidence of a feedback loop between Europe and United States. Although Jeffrey D. Sachs, a professor of economics at Harvard, doesn't see Europe as in the vanguard, he said his own recent experience as chief economist to Jubilee 2,000, the movement to forgive third-world debt, confirmed the general notion that Europe is acting as a kind of testing ground for ideas that have then caught on in the United States.
"The thing that I found," he said, "is that something that is of only the most esoteric interest here -- forgiving third-world debt -- is a matter of everyday discourse in Europe. It became a genuine mass movement with huge demonstrations and became part of mass culture, showing up in movies and songs and then caught on here. The message came from Europe, but then it transferred to church groups and other groups here who then called and petitioned Congress."
Subsequently, Congress and President Clinton agreed to cancel some $435 million in debt, a measure signed by Mr. Clinton this week.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/South Amboy, N.J.;
A Blue-Collar Town Making a Comeback

BYLINE: By JERRY CHESLOW

 BODY:
WHEN the 5:05 a.m. New Jersey Transit train rumbles through South Amboy, N.J., on its way to Penn Station in New York, it rattles the windows of the five apartments above the Landmark Tavern and Cafe. "We don't charge our tenants for the wake-up call," the tavern owner, Robert Heiser, said. Just five feet from the tracks, the building is a symbol of the 1.8-square-mile city's bustling past and its ongoing revitalization.
Built in the late 19th century, the Landmark houses a collection of local memorabilia. A cigar store Indian graces its doorway, and the walls hold an 1883 Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen poster, photos of the city's old coal docks on Raritan Bay, a "Welcome Home" sign that greeted servicemen returning from World War II and a brass plaque that graced the front of a now-shuttered Jersey Central Power and Light generating plant. 
 Outside the bar, the city's restoration efforts are evident. Worn concrete sidewalks have been replaced with bricklike paving stones that are punctuated by Victorian-style street lights, both financed by a $2 million grant from the New Jersey Department of Transportation. A score of storefronts, including the Landmark, have new 19-century-type facades, most paid for by a six-year, $318,000 grant from the United States Department Housing and Urban Development and matching money from property owners.
"Six years ago, 65 percent of our stores were vacant, and a turnaround seemed all but impossible," Mayor John T. O'Leary said. "Now that we are cleaning up and redoing the downtown, 80 percent of the stores are occupied. We're gaining ground, but we're not yet where we want to be."
Among the new businesses to take their places among the two turn-of-the-century pharmacies, the bakery and the hardware store are an all-Irish boutique, the Broadway Diner and Harbor Lights Restaurant (steak and seafood). The mayor says he is trying to attract boutiques, service businesses and offices that can withstand the competition from the three malls within a 10 mile radius: Woodbridge Center to the north, Menlo Park to the west and Brunswick Square to the south.
The population mix has not changed much since the beginning of the 20th century, when Irish and Polish immigrants came to work on the three railroads that crisscrossed the city. Children still play stickball and basketball in streets, and newcomers are cautioned not to say anything derogatory about any resident because everyone is related to everyone else.
For its size, South Amboy has an inordinate number of liquor licenses -- 22 -- but this reflects a continuing decline from 1981, when the Rand McNally "Places Rated Almanac" listed the city as having 37 taverns -- the most per capita in the country, one for every 218 residents.
"We are a solidly blue-collar town," Mr. Heiser said. "But things are changing. Younger people support the revitalization efforts, and newcomers are starting to move in. Ten years ago, you'd never see a customer come in here with a book. Now they come in with laptop computers. And when the new housing is complete, we're expecting an accelerated rate of positive change."
Like the downtown, most of South Amboy's housing was built before 1920, when census figures showed a population of 7,898, about its current size. There are 3,500 single-family houses and 321 two-family homes. The houses consist mainly of older colonials and duplexes, with a few Victorians, bilevels and Cape Cods. Although neighborhoods have mixed housing styles and values, some of the largest houses -- including a number of fieldstone and stucco homes -- can be found on Pine Avenue and some the smallest brick and clapboard duplexes are on First and Second streets.
ACCORDING to the Middlesex County Office of Economic Development, housing prices range from $90,000 to $200,000. Currently, 18 houses are listed for sale on the Multiple Listing Service. They range from $89,900 for a fixer-upper near the shoreline to $172,000 for a bilevel on Bordentown Avenue near Broadway. Two-family homes are listed for $119,000 to $210,000.
Two-bedroom apartments in two-family homes or above stores along Broadway rent for an average of $850 a month, according to Arthur A. Gross, a broker-appraiser with Stern & Dragoset Inc., a realty company in neighboring Woodbridge. One-bedroom units rent for $650 to $700.
Joseph Harrigan, broker-owner of J. J. Harrigan & Company Realtors in Sayreville, said that his customers are often second and third generation South Amboy residents and that about one-fourth of the homes coming on the market receive multiple offers and sell near the asking price.
"It's a good, safe town and, compared to other towns nearby, it's affordable, which makes South Amboy a hot market," he said. "And the redevelopment of the town is already giving the market a boost."
Two years ago, the city received its first major new housing in 40 years, with the construction of Shore Gate, a four-story, 114-apartment condominium building for people age 55 and older, overlooking Raritan Bay, just off O'Leary Boulevard, a new road named for the mayor. The units -- all two bedrooms -- sell for $125,000 to $150,000 according to Tony Danza of North Haledon, N.J., who developed the property.
South Amboy began in the mid-17th century as a Dutch military settlement to protect New Amsterdam (now Manhattan) from the British. Among the earliest settlers was the Bloodgood family, ancestors of Robert Bloodgood, the current superintendent of schools, who grew up in the city. During the Revolutionary War, a local tavern owned by a Tory named John Rattoone catered to soldiers from both sides and was the venue for the transfer of notes between the turncoat Continental general Benedict Arnold and the British.
The city began taking shape in 1831, with the arrival of the Camden and Amboy Railroad, which was later taken over by the Pennsylvania Railroad. By the turn of the century, the Raritan River and the Central New Jersey Railroads had also arrived, and South Amboy was transformed into a transportation and industrial powerhouse. Its Eastern Coal Docks on Raritan Bay transferred Pennsylvania coal and other goods from trains to barges for distribution all along the East Coast. It also had cigar, paint, terra cotta and textile plants that provided thousands of jobs.
By the early 1970's, most of the factories had closed, and in 1982 South Amboy lost more jobs when the coal docks shut down. As if to seal the town's fate, the Army Corps of Engineers all but destroyed the city's shipping capability by dredging the Raritan Bay channel and dumping the silt along the South Amboy coastline, creating an additional 66 acres of land.
Now, this 66-acre landfill site is one of the cornerstones of the city's redevelopment, which is to include enhanced train service, a high-speed ferry to Manhattan, 1,000 new homes and three million square feet of office space. Because of its strategic location just across from Manhattan and less than 10 miles from the Garden State Parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike, South Amboy has been designated by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman as one of five New Jersey "transit villages," making it eligible for increased state aid. New Jersey Transit has committed to spend $18.2 million in the next three years to build a five-block-long elevated train platform. Congress has awarded the city $14.2 million for road improvements, including an access road across the landfill to the bay, which will allow for construction of the ferry terminal.
THE landfill is also the focus of municipal and private development. A complex built five years ago on O'Leary Boulevard includes the high school, public library and youth center. Next to Shore Gate, developers have just broken ground on a 114-unit town house complex and are soon expected to start a 73-unit single-family development.
In addition, Middlesex County has just completed the 136-acre Raritan Bay Waterfront Park. Although most of the park is in neighboring Sayreville, the entrance and the gazebo are in South Amboy. The park, which is the city's largest recreational site, contains two multipurpose fields, a lighted baseball field, a football stadium, a soccer field, beach front and a wildlife preserve. The county and the city are discussing the incorporation of an additional 22-acre parcel of city-owned land into the park.
The new development will be felt in the 1,200-student South Amboy Public School System, which consists of the 720-student South Amboy Elementary School for prekindergarten through sixth grade and the new 480-student South Amboy High School for grades 7 through 12. The average class size in the two schools is 20, which is one student less than the state average. Computers are introduced in prekindergarten, with every classroom throughout the system having at least one terminal.
"Our educational philosophy is that it takes a village to raise a child and that healthy schools help keep the community healthy," Mr. Bloodgood said. "Being a small system allows us to get to know all of the families. We have five social workers, who reach out to families when there are problems, and five counselors, who work with the children. The aim is to ensure that every child arrives at school ready to learn."
At the high school level, 20 hours of community service are required annually for students in grades 10 to 12. Advanced Placement courses are offered in biology, social studies, English and mathematics. Of last year's 54 student graduating class, 72 percent went on to higher education. On College Board tests, South Amboy's students had an average combined verbal and mathematics score of 851, which is 158 points below the state average.
Even without the expected influx of children because of the new construction, Mr. Bloodgood said, the system is growing by 50 children annually. Over the next five years, a new school, called an early childhood center, will be built to house prekindergarten through third grade. When that school is complete, Mr. Bloodgood said, the number of children per class is expected to drop to 18 from 20.
"We are trying to make the most of our growth to ensure that our citizens have a better town," the mayor said. "Our small train station is already receiving 1,800 train passengers per day and has just 200 parking spaces in the downtown. Southern New Jersey is developing rapidly, and we are already the state's third busiest station. The tide of commuters is coming in, and we can either be strangled by it or develop as a result of it."

BOOM TOWN: Twice, South Amboy was nearly destroyed by military-related explosions. The first, on Oct. 4, 1918, flattened the sprawling T. A. Gillespie plant, which produced 32,000 shells daily for the Allies in World War I. Seventy people were killed and the entire town was evacuated during the three days of blasts that followed the initial explosion. Again, on May 19, 1950, when South Amboy's waterfront was being used for the transfer of explosives from trains to ships, an explosion rocked the town. Some 420 tons of land mines and dynamite bound for the Far East went off, killing 31 workers, who were then known as "powder monkeys" because they handled explosives. Every window in the town was blown out, houses were flattened and mines were strewn over the nearby countryside. Mayor John T. O'Leary said the 1950 explosion marked the beginning of South Amboy's decline, from which the town is just beginning to recover.

Rollout

BYLINE: By William Safire

 BODY:
'Early in its foreign rollout," reported Daily Variety, a movie titled "X-Men" hauled in $3.4 million over an opening weekend.
A restored version of the Rolling Stones' concert film "Gimme Shelter," issued on its 30th anniversary, "will begin a nationwide rollout in a few markets," according to a Reuters dispatch from Los Angeles. 
 The Asian Wall Street Journal spread the word throughout the Far East: " 'The Broken Hearts Club' will have a slow U.S. rollout beginning in major cities."
What is this movie marketing term that has so captivated the merchants of dreams in Hollywood? Where did it begin, and what did it come to mean?
"Roll out!" as every Army veteran of World War II grimly remembers, was the unwelcome barracks call that pierced the blessed stillness of the morning. Accompanied by the admonition to "grab yer socks," the phrase has a literal meaning of "roll out of bed." It was often followed by a sardonic "rise and shine," a metaphoric allusion to the sun, and a few minutes later by "fall out on the company street!" -- an order to assemble outside, in front of the barracks.
The transitional metaphor to its use in Hollywood probably came from the aircraft or automotive industries, as vehicles rolled out of hangars or off assembly lines. Ira Konigsberg, author of "The Complete Film Dictionary," suggests a more ancient origin. "The point of the term is to suggest the growing appearance of the film much like the expansion of a carpet when it is rolled out."
How is a rollout different from a release? "A typical Hollywood release is a wide release to a national public all at once," says Konigsberg, "because of the reliance on national television advertising. Rollouts are for independent, foreign or more specialized Hollywood films that need to build interest by word-of-mouth or simply must earn the right to proceed to larger audiences."
A rollout, then, like its synonym "platforming," is a process of release, taking place in stages. This useful term for gradual release or step-by-step development was picked up by marketers in other fields. The magazine Martha Stewart Living led to Martha Stewart Weddings, which gave birth to Martha Stewart Baby, and Ms. Stewart told Advertising Age last month, "There probably will be a rollout from there."
Political usage in the recent campaign, however, vitiated the nice distinction between the simultaneous general release and the calibrated rollout. "One prominent Republican strategist said that the rollout of Mr. Cheney had been disappointing," wrote Eric Schmitt of The Times in August. "Gore's handlers are plotting yet another rollout of their candidate," wrote Howard Fineman in Newsweek a month later.
This sense suggests only "introduction," and frays the carpet's specific edge. But politics likes to seize on with-it words and fuzz up their meanings.
 
Laydown Dates
 The book-publishing industry has its own new term for a variation of a release date: laydown. "This review copy is being sent to you," Knopf Publicity notifies me, "with the understanding that you will not run your review before Tuesday, July 18 -- which is the National Laydown Date for bookstores all across the country. (Official Publication Date is July 25.)"
A vision came to me of the National Laydown Date, a date that would live in the annals of relaxation. Hammocks would be handed out, busy intersections closed for pedestrians to stretch out and take a nap, yoga teachers enlisted for supervision of supine and prone meditators, all putting out of their slackened and refreshed minds the dread prospect of the inevitable National Standup Date.
Belay that dream: a laydown date is the day that a book officially goes on sale. It is used especially when the publisher wants to restrict any sale or revelation of the news in a book before it leaks. The publication date is a week or month after that, giving reviewers time to noodle the book around and buyers the feeling that they are getting the jump on their neighbors. Laydown without the date means "distribution": Publishers Weekly (where's the apostrophe?) wrote recently about a Beatles book that "hits the stores with a worldwide laydown of 1.5 million copies."
The reclining noun has a sinister use among arms merchants (an obliterating strike is a nuclear laydown) and can also be found in the lexicon of graphic artists, construction workers and railroaders. But its most prevalent use is in gambling, as the adjective in a laydown hand.
In poker, it's the "showdown," when all hands are laid open for all players to determine the winner. In bridge, a laydown hand is a winning hand placed face up on the table all at once, rather than being played out. This bridge meaning has been extended to a general "sure thing." A Boston economist told The Times, "The Fed has more reason to tighten than not -- but it's not a laydown."
Some of us who respect reasonable embargoes resist marketing manipulation. Let's say I go to a bookstore, the bookseller sells me a book and I spot a news story in it. Would I feel free to use it in a column no matter what its laydown date or publication date? You bet I would; that's a laydown.
 
Between Prexies
 Here's a word that pops up every four or eight years: interregnum.
The Latin means "between reigns." The interregnum, or interregencie, originally meant the interval that a throne or position of leadership was vacant, as between the death or removal of one sovereign and the accession of the next. This invited trouble, as in the Cromwell era. William Blackstone, in his 1765 "Commentaries," held that in England "the king is made a corporation to prevent in general the possibility of an interregnum or vacancy of the throne."
The word now means "an intermission in the order of succession" and, more generally, "a breach of continuity." Specifically, in the United States, it means "the period between the election of a new president and his inauguration." But it is not limited to political power: the breakfast-table autocrat Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote, "Between the last dandelion and violet . . . and the first spring blossom . . . there is a frozen interregnum in the vegetable world."
The word, lest we forget, is spelled with two r's. It received a special play during the transition from Jimmy Carter to Ronald Reagan, which wags called the interreaganum.

HEADLINE: FILM;
A Thanksgiving Feast With a Rainbow of Flavors

BYLINE: By B. RUBY RICH; B. Ruby Rich is the author of "Chick Flicks" and senior correspondent for "Independent View" on KQED-TV in San Francisco.

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
AT a time when most Americans have seemingly given up on this country's e pluribus unum promise, the British filmmaker Gurinder Chadha brings an unjaundiced eye to the tribulations and victories of a multiracial immigrant nation. Her new film "What's Cooking?" succeeds by means of a simple ruse: it substitutes a roasting pan for the proverbial melting pot.
And not just any roasting pan. In Ms. Chadha's big-hearted fable of big-city family life, the occasion is Thanksgiving and the focus is a rainbow of Los Angeles families, each with its own special crisis simmering along with the holiday feast and resolving by dessert. 
 Charm is Ms. Chadha's strong suit. "All my films are about celebration," Ms. Chadha said on a recent visit to San Francisco. "I wanted to make a film that could celebrate the diversity of Americans today. The American films I'd seen that actually dealt with race were almost always about problems and conflicts. We wanted to move away from that and show how the differences between cultures can actually underscore similarities."
Ms. Chadha is hardly the first to carry a camera to the Thanksgiving feast; Jodie Foster ("Home for the Holidays") and Bart Freundlich ("The Myth of Fingerprints"), among recent examples, beat her to it. But what she has done is set some new places at the table. The families in "What's Cooking?" are African-American, Jewish, Latino and Vietnamese. Each one is playing out a different drama of generational dissonance, sexual identity and emotional turmoil. And each one modifies the Thanksgiving menu to include tamales, chiles, rice or kugel. It doesn't hurt the charm factor that the families' ranks are filled by the likes of Joan Chen, Alfre Woodard, Mercedes Ruehl, Maury Chaykin, Lainie Kazan, Kyra Sedgwick and Julianna Margulies.
"What's Cooking?" (opening Friday) unites its characters with a seasoned optimism that could be held by someone only as diasporically diversified as Ms. Chadha herself. Kenyan-born, London-raised and Punjabi, when asked her own ethnicity, Ms. Chadha spent her university years studying third world economics.
She has worked as a journalist at BBC radio and in television news. Then she entered a British Film Institute New Directors program for people with no film training and made a controversial documentary, "I'm British, But --" and began a new career.
Nick James, editor in chief of the British Film Institute Sight and Sound magazine, said Ms. Chadha's first film was "really significant, with impeccable timing."
"Here was someone saying: 'I'm not Indian, I'm British,' " he added. "And then redefining what British meant."
Ms. Chadha had her first immersion in American culture in 1993, when the success of her first dramatic feature, "Bhaji on the Beach," propelled her onto the film festival circuit. One of a wave of British films exploring immigrant culture and first-generation culture clashes, "Bhaji on the Beach" tracked the adventures of a van of Indian women on a day trip to Blackpool, the seaside resort that symbolizes British kitsch. "Bhaji" used humor to sugarcoat serious issues (domestic abuse, interracial romance), and its glimpse of a different Britain won Ms. Chadha new admirers.
"I just loved it so much that I wrote her a fan letter," said the Hollywood director Jon Landis, who had never forgotten his own experience filming "An American Werewolf in London" in 1981. "In London at that time, when you called for extras, you got white people. I said, 'I really need people of color; I'm shooting in London!' And they said, 'We don't have any.' " When Mr. Landis did manage to get Chinese and Pakistani faces into his movie, it was such a big deal that British reviews "took pains to note that my film was set in a multiracial London -- as though there were any other kind." With "Bhaji," he finally saw on screen the Britain he had seen in the streets.
Another fan, Paul Mayeda Berges, booked "Bhaji" as the opening night film for the 1994 San Francisco Asian-American Film Festival and invited its director to attend. Soon after he resigned from the festival, he and Ms. Chadha were married and began writing screenplays together. Not only was Mr. Berges a co-writer on "What's Cooking?" but he also inadvertently provided its theme when he first invited Ms. Chadha home to Los Angeles for his very modern family's multifaceted Thanksgivings.
"I always have three Thanksgivings in America," she said. "One takes place early in the afternoon with Paul's father and stepmother and his half-siblings. Then we do dinner with his mother and Japanese grandparents. And then, on the weekend, we do it all over again with his mother and all her women friends who don't have their own nuclear families and we have a sort of extended and invented family dinner."
DURING a series of conversations that began last winter at the Sundance Film Festival, where "What's Cooking?" had its world premiere on opening night, it became clear that the central theme of "What's Cooking?" is the centrifugal force of family. "I'd never met people who were so estranged from family until I came to the United States," Ms. Chadha said, remembering her college years with visits home every two weeks.
Still close to her family and tied more than ever to her widowed mother in London, Ms. Chadha divides her time between the Camden neighborhood of London and Redondo Beach, Calif. She is preparing to return to London to shoot "Bend It Like Beckham," a girls' soccer film set in her mother's West London neighborhood. Three other films are in the works, including one that would mix up cultures again by taking to the screen Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni's novel "The Mistress of Spices," about an Indian herb vendor in Oakland, Calif., who psychically meddles in her customers' lives.
In the end, Ms. Chadha may be perfectly suited to Los Angeles filmmaking. "I tried to make a very traditional American movie with a 'What a Wonderful Life' sensibility," she said. "If I can say that about a film full of black people, family melodrama and comedy."
While her tastes are sufficiently mainstream -- she considers "Car Wash" one of her all-time favorites -- her roots may run even deeper here. When she was reworking her script for "What's Cooking?" at the filmmaking lab at the Sundance Film Institute, Ms. Chadha said she had trouble convincing the director Frank Pierson, one of the lab's stalwarts, that she could pull it off.
"Then he saw 'Bhaji' and changed his mind," Ms. Chadra said with pleasure. ' "Oh, now I know what you're doing.' he said. 'Thornton Wilder. You're making 'Our Town.' "

HEADLINE: 'MODEL OPERAS';
Longing for Ideals

 BODY:

To the Editor:
I read with fascination "Why This Nostalgia for Fruits of Chaos?" Oct. 29 by Sheila Melvin and Jindong Cai, on the popular revival of Cultural Revolution operas in China, but the article missed an opportunity to fully answer the question posed by its headline. It is simplistic to assume that middle-aged people flock to these operas because it is the music on which they were raised, "much the way middle-aged Americans listen to the rock music of their youth or sneak a peek at a 'Brady Bunch' rerun." In fact, despite memories of chaos and bitter suffering, many middle-aged Chinese also think back with longing on a time when they were living for ideas instead of money. The deep alienation that has come with China's blinding rate of modernization exacerbates these feelings. Cities such as Beijing and Shanghai have been torn down and rebuilt in the space of a few short years, sweeping traditional values away with the rubble and leaving anomie as well as ambition behind. 
 While researching China's Cultural Revolution revival restaurants, I had a chance to explore these contradictory attitudes. As Yu Changjiang, a lecturer in anthropology at Beijing University, told me, "Regardless of the politics, for young people at the time, the Cultural Revolution was something very exciting. It was very radical, very idealistic. Now everything is quantified in terms of time and money." Perhaps no one summed it up better than Li Zhi Tian, a successful magazine editor who explained why he liked eating "crude tea and bland rice" in the revival restaurants. "I guess I'm like a lot of people," he said between calls on his cell phone. "I'm looking for satisfaction in the past that I'm not getting in the present."

HEADLINE: In the Region/Westchester;
County's Office Market Is Exceptionally Strong

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD

 BODY:
THE amount of available space in Westchester's office market has hit historic lows so far this year, with leasing up more than 40 percent and very few large blocks of space remaining. Yet with all the good news, some brokers see harbingers of trouble for the county in the not-so-distant future.
Westchester's office vacancy rates have improved significantly in the last five years. In the first quarter of this year, the amount of available space dropped to 12.5 percent, compared with 17.6 percent at the end of 1999, according to the White Plains office of CB Richard Ellis, the commercial broker. The rate continued to go down until it reached 11 percent in the third quarter, which is a historic low for the county. At the end of 1995, by contrast, the vacancy rate was 23.2 percent. 
 According to Insignia/ESG, the brokerage and services company, more than 2.6 million square feet of space has been leased in the county so far this year, up 44 percent from the corresponding period a year ago and nearly equal to the 2.8 million square feet leased for all of 1999.
"Westchester has benefited by the fact that there's just not a lot of available space in surrounding markets," said Frank Tomasulo, a first vice president at CB Richard Ellis. "With space extremely tight in Manhattan and rents hitting $70 per square foot there, Westchester seems like a very attractive option." The average asking rent in Westchester County in the third quarter was a little more than $26 a square foot.
The county's fortunes have also been aided by the continued growth of local companies, many of them high-technology concerns, said Dean J. Shapiro, an executive director at Insignia/ESG in Stamford, Conn. "There have also been several relocations within the county," he added, "and no major increases in supply. But the frenzy we felt at the beginning of the year, I don't feel anymore."
One major concern, Mr. Shapiro said, is the expected relocation of Texaco once the federal government approves the company's acquisition by the Chevron Corporation, which has its headquarters in San Francisco. Texaco now occupies about 650,000 square feet at its current headquarters at 2000 Westchester Avenue, White Plains. "Such a large return of space to the market will certainly be felt in the vacancy rates," Mr. Shapiro said. "And it would take a while to see how that building could be successfully remarketed."
John Goodkind, executive managing director of Newmark in Greenwich, Conn., thinks it will be 18 to 24 months before the fate of the Texaco property and its effect on the market are determined. "Nobody can expect some big user from Manhattan to come in and take up the amount of space," Mr. Goodkind said. "The building will probably need some kind of architectural overhaul in order to attract smaller tenants."
LIKE other brokers, Mr. Goodkind also expressed worry about a slowdown in the world of the so-called dot-com companies and the impact this could have on Westchester's market. "The activity in the dot-com world has really slowed down," Mr. Goodkind said. "There was a frenzy in that market over the last 24 months, which is reflected in the office vacancy rates now, but the frenzy is over. Now it's back to business."
Despite the slowdown that has been detected recently, Westchester's office market has been buoyed for several quarters by "new economy" companies. Of the 10 largest lease transactions in three months that ended on Sept. 30, six involved telecommunication or e-commerce companies or related concerns, according to Insignia/ESG.
Nortel Networks Inc., a maker of telecommunications equipment, renewed a lease for 57,458 square feet at 200 Summit Lake Drive, Valhalla; Monstermoving.com, a relocation services provider, signed a lease for 45,270 square feet at 50 Main Street in White Plains; OnMoney.com, an online personal finance Web site, took 40,000 square feet at 287 Bowman Avenue, Purchase; and FrameWork, a software developer, leased 24,720 square feet at 303 South Broadway in Tarrytown.
By far the biggest lease in the third quarter involved industrial space and as such was not included in the office vacancy rates. Qwest Communications International Inc., a telecommunications company, agreed to lease a 435,000-square-foot former Saks Fifth Avenue distribution center in Yonkers and also to build 90,000 square feet of additional space.
"Lots of these companies have incubated in the county," Mr. Shapiro said, "and now that they've grown, they're taking more space." An example is Savvy Networks USA, which provides Web site support services. It started two years ago in 1,500 square feet in Larchmont and now has options on a total of 17,000 square feet in Tarrytown. "We're now occupying 7,500 square feet," said Christopher Furey, chief operating officer, "and we'll move into more space as our needs warrant."
Several brokers have pointed out, however, that the financing that was once available to new economy companies seems to be drying up. "We just tried to place one of these companies in a building in Briarcliff," Mr. Goodkind said, "but it fell through because the company's financials were too weak. Once, the sky was the limit, but now building owners are afraid to get burnt."
While the county has certainly benefited from the growth of technology companies, it is not dependent on them, according to Mr. Tomasulo. "That's really the good news for Westchester in the last several years," he said. "The tenant base is now diverse enough that a downturn in one market will not have cataclysmic effects on the whole market."
MR. TOMASULO also pointed to other positive factors in the market, in particular the turnaround of several of the county's most problematic buildings, most significantly 360 Hamilton Avenue in White Plains, a former I.B.M. property that was vacant for a decade and is now more than 85 percent occupied.
"The fact that a building that had been essentially written off can be turned around and attract high-quality tenants says a lot about the health of Westchester's market," Mr. Tomasulo said. "In that case the owner was willing to put in the dollars and it paid off." The building is owned by the Reckson Associates Realty Corporation.
Another success story, Mr. Tomasulo said, is the Parker Corporate Center at 1311 Mamaroneck Avenue in White Plains, which was abandoned by I.B.M. two years ago and is now completely occupied. "The only properties that haven't succeeded in this market," Mr. Tomasulo said, "are ones where the owners haven't made a commitment and are waiting for the big tenant to swoop down and take a large block of space."
Both 360 Hamilton and the Parker Corporate Center were once occupied by a single user, I.B.M., and have been converted into multitenant use. Robert S. Skolnick, executive vice president of the Jack Parker Corporation, said: "The strategy paid off better than any of us expected. We never signed a tenant larger than 50,000 square feet. Now we don't have a single-tenant risk -- that if they leave, the building is vacant."
The real losers in this market, Mr. Tomasulo said, "are the owners who sit around hoping to sign up a 100,000 square foot tenant. They're still waiting. That's not Westchester's market anymore. It's now much more geared to the smaller to midsize company, and no one company or even business dominates."

HEADLINE: Bitten by, and Enjoying, the Gardening Bug

BYLINE: By ELISABETH GINSBURG

 BODY:
THE gardening bug is an insidious disease. Once stricken, some victims feel a compulsion to spend all their free time digging in the dirt and all their money buying plants and seeds. Others go even further and transform their working lives by entering the horticultural field.
John Holm, a former professional chef, is in the midst of such a career transformation. Born in Norway to a family that owned a restaurant, he was trained as a cook from an early age. Mr. Holm eventually emigrated to the United States and found work at Manhattan restaurants like La Grenouille and Restaurant 44. He also taught cooking at the French Culinary Institute and helped found a successful prepared-food business. 
 While a chef, Mr. Holm began tending a container garden on the terrace of his Brooklyn Heights apartment. Eventually he moved to a 2.5-acre lot in Bedford and began growing things on a larger scale. He applied to the New York Botanical Garden's School of Professional Horticulture, a two-year program that combines course work with hands-on training in the botanical garden itself. He expects to graduate in 2002 and start his own residential landscape design business.
Training that combines horticulture's intellectual and practical sides makes perfect sense to Mr. Holm, who has a high tolerance for the unglamorous and unpaid work in the botanical garden. "Because of my background in cooking," he saidf, "I am used to working hard and getting dirty." But "I feel a passion for this that I never did for cooking," he added. "I went into cooking because of my family. This I did for myself."
Five years ago, Mary Squires was a corporate attorney living on Long Island. Then she and her husband moved to Upper Saddle River, N.J. After finding out what it cost to hire landscapers, she decided to design her new property herself -- even though she had little experience with plants. "I started researching before I put anything in the ground," she said. Her interest increased, and after she had become a regular at her local retail nursery, a clerk suggested she take some horticulture courses at Bergen County College.
She began her studies with two courses, including Plant, Soil and Science, one of the toughest classes in the two-year degree program. Eventually she became immersed in horticulture education and went to school full time. She received a certificate in landscaping and ornamental horticulture (with honors), and went on to earn an associate's degree in applied science.
With her degrees in hand, Ms. Squires hung out her shingle as a plant consultant, installing and maintaining gardens, doing soil tests and educating her clients about integrated pest management (environment-friendly methods of dealing with garden pests).
Ms. Squires specializes in interior "plantscaping," helping her clients with selection and placement of indoor plants. On each job she uses a light meter to gauge the amount of light in specific indoor locations, so people avoid dark corners full of dying plants. This educated approach is something new for Ms. Squires. "In my past life," she said, "I would just buy a plant and water it."
Ms. Squires still does a limited amount of legal work, "just to keep my hand in." In addition to running her own business, she hopes to gain greenhouse management experience by working part time for a local nursery within the next year.
Ms. Squires has no regrets about trading case management for pest management. "The time that I spend in gardens is infinitely more rewarding than the most demanding legal case," she said.
Kathleen Nelson of Gaylordsville, Conn., spends her spring, summer and fall days growing and selling perennials, a home-based business that she began when she made a midlife career change two decades ago. Busy outdoors during the growing season, she spends the winter writing copy for her plant catalog, doing bookkeeping and planning for the coming season.
Ms. Nelson grew up in "the swamps of northern Minnesota," collecting plants in the abundant wetlands. After obtaining a master's degree in zoology, she taught biology at Manhattan Community College. "I loved teaching," she said.
But in the mid-1970's, layoffs within the City University system left Ms. Nelson unemployed. A new job at the University of Bridgeport brought an unexpected bonus -- a husband. Ms. Nelson left teaching and entered professional horticulture at the age of 41, when she had her first child.
"The first couple of years, I didn't know what I was doing," she said. Her science background helped her learn quickly, and trial and error enabled her to make the decision to focus on retail rather than wholesale customers. Her business grew, bolstered by the surge in public interest in perennial plants around the time she started in the 1980's.
Ms. Nelson specializes in shade plants, noninvasive grasses and deer-resistant species, which also feature prominently in her landscape designs for a small number of clients.
As her business has flourished, Ms. Nelson's environmental concerns have grown. A stint on a local wetlands commission changed her focus to promoting native plants. Though natives are enjoying something of a renaissance, the she thinks they need more exposure.
Ms. Nelson's child is now a college junior, and the second career continues to evolve. Though she gives occasional lectures, she said that a return to the classroom would be "emotionally draining." Running her small nursery, said Ms. Nelson, is the perfect combination of physical and intellectual activity.
That combination also appeals to Laura Leach, who made the switch to horticulture after 15 years as a sales, marketing and development executive. Like Mr. Holm, the Hastings, N.Y., resident is now a student in the New York Botanical Garden's horticulture school.
Ms. Leach, who was born in England, has a love of gardening that she inherited from her mother and grandmother. In high school she considered a horticultural career, but chose other options.
After leaving school, Ms. Leach re-encountered horticulture when she took a marketing job with Britain's National Trust, which oversees many historic structures and gardens. Later she worked as the director of development for the Welsh National Opera.
As with Ms. Nelson, marriage helped propel Ms. Leach into a new life. Several years ago, she and her husband emigrated to California, where she began part-time horticultural studies. The following year the couple moved to the East Coast. She had discovered the botanical garden's program on the Internet, and chose it because it provided "the opportunity to work alongside the best horticulturists." She praises the program's diversity. "Today I am preparing seeds for a seed exchange; yesterday I was climbing an oak tree to prune it," she said.
When she graduates in the spring of 2002, Ms. Leach may work as an administrator for a horticultural institution. She also plans to continue her education in landscape design. But she is also keeping her options open. "I am looking at where my skills are," she added.
Ms. Leach had advice for those considering a similar career change. "It's important to have some practical experience in the field first," she said, noting that the botanical garden program requires such hands-on work as a prerequisite for admission.
And, while a horticultural career may ultimately provide those who choose it with time to stop and smell the roses, she advised anyone approaching the field to be "realistic, not romantic."

Transforming a Plant From Hydrox to High Tech

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE

DATELINE: SAYREVILLE

 BODY:
IN a sense, the plan is to switch from bites to bytes, from cookies (edible) to cookies (electronic).
From the outside, the million-square-foot former bakery and manufacturing plant doesn't look much different than it did when Keebler, and before that Sunshine Biscuits, used it to make Hydrox cookies and Cheez-It crackers. But inside, the ovens and conveyor belts have been stripped away, as have miles of piping, as part of the building's more than $50 million transformation into the Garden State Technology Center. 
 The renovation of the old bakery, made up of several interconnecting buildings, is nearly complete. And the $15 million in high-tech infrastructure to support its new use -- including access to nearby fiber-optics and electrical power to run computers and other telecommunications equipment -- will be in place by the end of the first quarter of next year, said Sidney Borenstein, a partner at Sayreville, L.L.C, the technology center's developer.
Mr. Borenstein, who is also the president of a development company in Brooklyn that bears his name, said that the plant is "a good candidate for a high-tech center." He said that the fiber-optics, the electrical power, the building's 15-foot-high clear ceilings, and its floors, which are capable of supporting more than 250 pounds per square foot, would make it appealing to the new-economy tenants -- the Web-hosting, e-commerce and Internet-related companies -- he hoped to attract.
In addition, he said, of the plant's million square feet, 750,000 are on one floor with wide spacing between columns.
Sayreville L.L.C., a group of New York City developers and investors, bought the 48-acre site last May. The plant is at Bordentown Avenue and Jernee Mills Road in the southwest corner of the 17-square mile Middlesex County community.
The seller was a New York investor, Joshua Gutman, who had acquired the property in 1999 from the Keebler Foods Company of Elmhurst, Ill. (Keebler has since been acquired by Kellogg.)
Keebler bought Sunshine Biscuits in 1996 and decided to consolidate its manufacturing operations; the Sayreville plant, from which the sweet smell of cookies had wafted for more than 20 years, was closed last September.
The plant's closing resulted in the loss of some 500 jobs. Keebler was the latest in a long series of manufacturers in Sayreville, among them DuPont and National Lead, that have pared down operations, gone out of business or left this former industrial stronghold, weakening its economic base and shifting the tax burden to its 17,000 residents.
MAYOR KENNEDY O'BRIEN said that the redevelopment of the old cookie factory was the start of his community's evolution from "a manufacturing- to a high-technology-driven town." The Garden State Technology Center, he said, "says Sayreville is an ideal place for high technology" and provides "a stamp of credibility" for other investors to follow.
Mr. Borenstein said that he and his partners were using their own money to finance the project, their second such conversion. The first was a 300,000-square-foot formerly abandoned industrial building on Noble Street in Philadelphia that they took over 18 months ago and that he said is now 70 percent leased to high-technology companies.
The Garden State Technology Center is one of a spate of projects in New Jersey intended to recycle industrial space into cyber-oriented space.
While most have been in cities in northern New Jersey, among them Newark and Jersey City, the Sayreville redevelopment is one of a few in the middle of the state, including ones in Carteret and North Brunswick, that may indicate the start of a shift to suburban areas from urban centers, commercial brokers said.
The conversion activity is being spurred by several factors. Old industrial buildings generally offer the sturdy floors and high ceilings new-economy tenants need to accommodate the heavy equipment and the abundant electrical power necessary to run their business. The buildings also have access to fiber-optic cables because they often are near the rail lines where the cables were long ago installed.
Property owners also see such conversions as a way to broaden their tenant base and increase their annual rental income well above the typical $6 a square foot that older industrial buildings command for use as distribution centers.
The state awarded $2 million last month in grants to counties, economic development groups and municipalities, including Sayreville, to plan and promote cyber districts within their borders to help attract high-tech companies and spur redevelopment. Thirty grants were awarded under the initiative, which is administered by New Jersey's Department of Community Affairs and the New Jersey Redevelopment Authority.
Mayor Kennedy said that Sayreville was given a $50,000 grant to study the possibility of establishing a cyber district in a 900-acre former industrial area that includes the old National Lead site, in a different part of the community from the Garden State Technology Center.
In the last 18 months high-tech tenants have leased about 2.5 million square feet of space at eight New Jersey projects, among them ones in Newark, Jersey City and Weehawken, according to Insignia/ESG of New Jersey, a commercial brokerage based in Saddle Brook. Those projects are among the 22 completed or planned in the state, totaling 9.3 million square feet, of which 4.4 million square feet are available, according to Cushman & Wakefield, another commercial brokerage.
SEAN P. BRADY, a senior director at Cushman & Wakefield's East Rutherford office, said that demand for this kind of space had leveled off from the robust levels of 1999 as companies limited expansion plans because of the drop in the Nasdaq and a lack of available capital. But Mr. Brady said that the demand was still strong and that from now to December 2001 tenants would be in the market for 2 million to 2.5 million square feet of such space.
While annual asking rents have fluctuated over the last year they now range from $16 to $28 a square foot, depending on location and access to fiber, he said. And, he said, they can go as high as $40 a square foot in certain urban locations, like Newark.
Mr. Brady said that not all the projects being planned would move forward, because they are not in wished-for locations and do not provide tenants easy access to fiber-optic links and sufficient electrical power. He would not indicate which sites those might be.
The developers of the Garden State Technology Center said they were betting that their project would attract attention even though it is not in a major city. Andrew B. Zezas, a managing director at Insignia/ESG who is the leasing agent for the project, said its location was an asset because Sayreville is accessible to several major highways, including the Garden State Parkway and Routes 9 and 18. More important, Mr. Zezas and Mr. Borenstein said, is that AT&T's optical-fiber backbone is along the Conrail train tracks that run behind the property.
In addition, they said, the building will be connected through multiple fiber-optic rings to major telecommunication hubs in New York City, Newark and Philadelphia, as well as to trans-Atlantic links in New Jersey. As a result tenants will also be able to access multiple long-distance telecommunications carriers, they said.
The project, they added, also is near several power plants, will have its own electrical substation and be wired for electrical power to provide 100 watts per square foot. (A typical office building provides 5 to 6 watts per square foot.) The building also sits on 48 acres, leaving enough land to install backup generators.
The key concept, Mr. Zezas said, is that "the amount of power and telecommunications connectivity coming to the property" is equal to that found in buildings in northern New Jersey but will be available for rents lower than in those buildings.
Annual rents at Garden State Technology Center are $20 a square foot, he said. The idea, he said, is to try first to attract tenants expanding in or relocating to New Jersey that need from 100,000 to 500,000 square feet, before dividing the building into smaller blocks of space.
"Five such users have already expressed interest in the property," Mr. Zezas said, adding that the project will lease because "it is where power-hungry tenants can get their fill."

HEADLINE: Not the Bronx, but in Its Spirit

BYLINE: By LESLIE KANDELL

 BODY:
THE following concert program is rated PG 13: it contains 17 brawny guys with bare arms, pummeling oil drums in violent rhythms, with pickaxes. Although there is no profanity (unless it's in French) one cannot ignore the yelling, or the smashing oil cans. Earplugs are available to the audience at no charge.
Here, here, what's all this? A variant palliative for aggression? A dream evening for the hearing-challenged? Intrepid listeners will have a chance to find out Tuesday when Les Tambours du Bronx, an unusual drumming group from France, muscles into the Garde Arts Center in New London on its first North American tour. 
 To the extent that the culture of hip-hop is about rebellion, this event is a species of hip-hop -- that is, the antithesis of the classical music concert form. If there is an expected appropriate attire, the drummers of Les Tambours don't wear it. As to performing on valuable heirloom instruments: they don't play standard instruments at all, and regularly destroy what they do play on. Quiet, a concert hall norm, is a joke. Even the Bronx reference is a joke.
The men, who no longer have to hold day jobs, come from the outskirts of Nevers, an industrial town in central France known for repairing trains, and also as the resting place of Bernadette of Lourdes, whose body is preserved under a glass bubble, reportedly as fresh as ever. Before Les Tambours was founded in 1987, its members were friends who met to drink at a place in Nevers called the Broadway Bar. Some were students, some had jobs, some were unemployed, but none were musicians. Their little jest, as their evenings at the Broadway Bar ended, was that they were going back home to the Bronx.
According to the group's leader, Ludovic Le Mapihan (known as Map), they got their shot at performing during the city's annual festival of movie shorts.
"We wanted to make a small performance, but we were not sure what," said Map. (The telephone conversation is translated from an ad hoc mixture of French and English, representing a genuine dual effort.) "We had no money, but because Nevers is a city for train repairs, 55-gallon barrels were easy to find free, in gardens."
They performed 20 minutes at the festival, got all fired up, and decided to go to any nearby festival, invited or not. "We played in the street," said Map. "Presenters liked us and we began to be invited."
True to its perverse form, the all-male group, now aged 25 to 42, named its first commercial recording "Silence." It's anything but, though the label name, Naive, is more like it. The rhythms are clean, repetitive in the marching band sense, and seductive but acceptable, probably, to even to the most mannered listener. "Bombast and unity" said one reviewer. Not bad.
Nothing about their performance is gentrified. Some numbers have added clapping or whistling, while in others, oil barrel clangor is augmented by groans, howls and snorts. The recording's final number, "Etouffez la Ventoline" (a title chosen for rhythm rather than meaning) has unintelligible words that might be broadcast over a railroad station loudspeaker.
Comparing Les Tambours with Japan's Kodo Drummers, Map acknowledged the similar visceral effect, and then said something like, "Our rhythm is very basic. It goes directly to your body. Our instruments are different in the way we play. We smash very loud. When we finish the show, the instrument is destroyed. You can use both sides of the drum, so, two shows maximum."
The destruction factor is handled through copious supplies: "A big truck follows us, with 400 barrels from France, and 4,000 sticks," he said. "You cannot find the barrels outside of France -- not even in Italy or Germany. They're very thin. With thicker metal, you can hurt yourself." After trying different materials for their pickax mallets, they settled on beechwood, strong enough to survive a concert or two.
Since the drummers can't practice separately, they get together in what Map described as a hangar in the countryside. "We are not musicians," he said. "We play and move our arms a special way. We look for new members in the way we would look for a friend, not a drummer."
In European performances, there is some interaction with the audience, which Map was not sure was happening on this tour. "We try to talk to the audience," he said, "but our English is not so good. We explain and ask what they think. We know they won't sleep."
"Les Tambours du Bronx," Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. at Garde Arts Center, 325 State Street, New London. 7:30 p.m. Information: (860) 444-6766.

Signs of Slight Cooling in the Feverish Office Market

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
IS the hot market for office space in Manhattan, which has sent rents soaring, sometimes to record levels, beginning to cool off just a bit? There are hints of it in reports on market activity now being published by major brokerage companies in the city.
Just about everyone agrees that market fundamentals are strong and that rents are continuing to rise, despite uncertainties regarding dot-com and other Internet related start-up companies. But some industry professionals also note that a lot of trophy buildings are being listed for sale, suggesting that some investors think the value of their properties is close enough to the peak that it is time to cash out. 
 One report, by Williams Real Estate, noted that for the first time in six quarters, the amount of office space in all classes available for lease in the Midtown South area had increased, rather than decreased. The increase was small, about 300,000 square feet, which raised the availability rate to 4.4 percent from 4 percent, but it did represent the reversal of a trend. Williams defines Midtown South as the area between Seventh and 40th Streets, river to river.
Another indication of a slowing market was the net amount of space leased in the quarter. Although the overall availability in all of Manhattan decreased to 4.8 percent from 5.1 percent, according to the Williams report, only 1.3 million square feet were absorbed from the market, compared with 5 million square feet in the second quarter and 10.5 million since the beginning of the year.
"A little fissure in the marketplace," is the way Robert L. Freedman, vice chairman of Williams, described the situation. He said it was a positive development because it would restrain bidding wars for available space and allow more companies to remain in Manhattan.
Mr. Freedman said the pace of leasing in the first half of the year was unsustainable, no matter how good the underlying economy. "The rate of growth in the future can be expected to be at a more modest rate than in the past several quarters."
A similar report by Julien J. Studley, a company that represents tenants, noted that the overall vacancy rate remains "extraordinarily low" and that new space is not likely to be added to the market for at least three or four years. "New York City may be the home of the soft landing, if a landing is in the cards," the company concluded.
"We are in a period of digestion, and that is probably a good thing," said Mitchell S. Steir, vice chairman of the Studley firm. He said demand had been artificially inflated by Internet and new media companies, which were in such a scramble to find space for their rapidly growing operations that they almost did not care about the price.
"Now we are seeing an easing of the artificial demand on the part of the dot-coms," he said, as companies have closed down or terminated employees. But he noted that these technology companies had had a major impact on the office market. "Rents are up 25 to 30 percent in the past year," he said.
Mary Ann Tighe, vice chairman of Insignia/ESG, the brokerage and services company, said space vacated by technology companies was being quickly reoccupied by other companies. "In the last quarter the dot-coms threw 640,000 square feet of space back onto the market," she said. "But 320,000 square feet of it is already spoken for," she added. "The space gets snapped up almost as fast as it becomes available."
"The absorption rate has slowed and some supply has come on the market, but there is no sense that we are about to fall off the edge of the world," said Anthony E. Malkin, the president of W&M Properties, an owner and developer of real estate. "These are 5,000, 10,000, 25,000 square foot blocks of space that are coming back and that is healthy," he said. "The market needs this space," he added. "There is no reason to worry when the vacancy rate is 4 or 5 percent."
Allan B. Rothschild, managing director of the New York office of CB Richard Ellis, the brokerage and services company, said: "Our view is that the market in Midtown South will be able to withstand the problems of the dot-coms. We think there will be a leveling of the rental rate instead of 10 to 20 percent a month increases." He said any weakness in demand would probably be located in what he termed "fringe areas," notably those west of Eighth Avenue.
Janice Stanton, the managing director for investment research for Cushman & Wakefield, the brokerage and services company, said, "There has been a little bit of a pullback on the part of tech tenants, but there has been a pickup in demand by financial and publishing tenants."
She said one reason the absorption rate had fallen was that there is very little space available to be occupied. "You can't absorb space if there is nothing to absorb," she said.
The Williams report noted that rents in newer buildings in Midtown continued to rise in the third quarter, while those in older properties largely leveled out. The asking rents in buildings completed after 1968 rose 7.9 percent to an average of $71.53 per square foot, while those built between 1946 and 1968 increased just 1.9 percent to an average of $68.69 per square foot. Rents in buildings built before World War II went up only 0.7 percent, to an average of $58.45 per square foot.
Overall availability in the Downtown market, which is everything south of Seventh Street, decreased to 5.1 percent from 5.7 percent in the last quarter, according to Williams, but even there the picture was mixed. Space available in buildings completed before World War II increased slightly to 7.4 percent from 7.2 percent. Average rentals in the prewar sector of the market were $41per square foot compared with $42.39 per square foot for post-war buildings.
In addition to leasing trends, some real estate executives pointed to the number of trophy buildings for sale as an indication that some people think the sales market may be near the peak. Two of the city's most notable office complexes -- Rockefeller Center and the World Trade Center -- are on the market, and such individual buildings as the Seagrams tower at 375 Park Avenue, the CBS headquarters at 51 West 52nd Street, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, 666 Fifth Avenue and 300 Park Avenue are either for sale, under contract or sold. According to Williams, the building at 1211 Avenue of the Americas sold for $561 million, or $291 a square foot, while 666 Fifth Avenue went for $540 million, or $369 a square foot. The structure at 300 Park Avenue was less costly, with a sales price of $200 million, or $276 a square foot.
T HE question is always 'How high is up,' and it may be that some people may have decided that we are up," Mr. Freedman said. "That may be an indication that the market is peaking and that owners are trying to lock in the top profit."
But others say that even if it appears that smart money is selling, the money that is buying, which includes Tishman Speyer Properties, the Jamestown Group and RFR/Davis, is pretty smart as well.
"A lot of these building were bought with opportunity-fund financing and the funds are not long-term holders," Ms. Tighe said. "They want to have what they call a 'realization event' after holding a property for three to five years to benefit from repositioning it and taking advantage of the cycle."
Mr. Malkin observed that many sellers have appeared to be trying to cash out while they still can. "In any 10 year period, there are three or so years when you can sell property well and about 18 months in that time you can sell incredibly well," he said. "The other seven years are bad to terrible."
He said it seemed clear that the 18 month hot sales period had passed and that some owners wanted to act before being pulled into a downturn. He added that it appeared there was less capital available for office investments as pension funds and other investors try to rebalance their portfolios with multifamily residential and industrial-distribution properties.

HEADLINE: Only the Best for Man's Best Friend. And Woman's Too.

BYLINE: By SUSAN KONIG

 BODY:
WHEN the Wozar family of Whitestone leaves town, they rarely bring 9-year-old Sherlock along. Instead, they rent a hotel room for him and his two siblings, with color cable television, air-conditioning, a telephone, room service and round-the-clock supervision.
Sherlock is a giant schnauzer, and his siblings are two Persian cats named Kahlua and Watson. And their home away from home is Barkingham Palace in Port Washington, where vacationing dog owners can check their pets into either kennels or private rooms. 
 "There's no place like this anywhere around that I know of," said Eyal Danay, who owns the seven-year-old business.
"We knew Long Island would be a great place for this kind of business," said Mr. Danay, who once managed a hotel called "Buff Pets and More" in Palm Springs, Calif., which is now defunct. "We took care of Frank Sinatra's dog in Palm Springs. It was a great area -- very affluent with lots of people interested in giving their pets the best. Long Island is very similar."
Indeed, America's love affair with pets continues and, with a booming economy, Long Islanders are particularly well poised to indulge theirs.
The American Veterinary Medical Association reports that, as of 1996 (the most recent year available), Americans had 59 million cats, 52 million dogs, 13 million birds and 4 million horses as pets -- numbers the group said have risen since then.
 
A Room of One's Own
 With its kennel accommodations, Barkingham can house up to 35 dogs at once. But the main attractions are the seven private rooms -- or dog suites, as Mr. Danay calls them -- which cost $30 to $35 a day. The two large suites are 14 square feet; the five others measure 11 by 5 feet. Each has cable television, a bed, blankets, a sofa and individual speaker phones on which vacationing owners can talk to their pooches.
Mail is also welcome. "An owner may send a postcard, and we'll bring it to the dog so he or she can pick up the scent," Mr. Danay said. "That can reassure them a bit."
"The TV's make the dogs feel at home and as if they're not alone," he said, adding that owners can request special programming, like cartoons, CNN or boxing. "It's not that the dogs understand the shows.. It's just that they are familiar sounds from home."
As if what Barkingham Palace provides -- including 35 diet plans -- isn't enough, some owners bring in toys, blankets and beds for their pets.
"Some don't want their dogs using things that the other dogs use," Mr. Danay said. "And, some dogs just feel more secure with their own stuff."
Mr. Danay, who owns five dogs himself, is awaiting the arrival of a regular client, a Maltese from Great Neck whose owner sends him over in a limousine. "We'll be sending a truck to the house to pick up the dog's special furniture," he said. "The owner wants to essentially recreate the home environment. There's a specially designed bed, Persian rugs and a whole bunch of toys we'll be getting."
 
For Working 'Parents'
Whenever Max, a black Labrador, is left home alone, he causes trouble. And that means trouble for his owner, Susan Salk of Syosset, because she and her husband both work full time. "Max acts out because he hates to be alone," Ms. Salk said. "And I feel so guilty leaving him. When I found out there was a day care center for dogs on Long Island, it was like my prayers were answered."
Nick and Paula Burriesci didn't set out to run a day care center. Their original intention was to open a grooming parlor, but they soon realized there was a need for more.
"A lot of my longtime clients mentioned how great a day care center would be," said Ms. Burriesci, a professional dog handler and groomer for 25 years.
Since Bubbles and Barks opened in Hicksville in November 1999, most of its clients have been are working people who leave their pups for up to nine hours a day, six days a week. In the center, which includes two carpeted rumpus rooms that total 1,500 square feet and can accommodate up to 50 dogs, animals are never caged. They are free to run, wrestle, play and socialize.
Copies of vaccination records are required for all dogs. A staff of six ensures that the dogs, which are separated by size, are under constant supervision. The cost is $10 per day, per dog, regardless of size.
As for behavior problem, Ms. Burriesci said, "we haven't really had any fights. Since the dogs are on neutral territory and their owners aren't around, they're relieved of their 'protective' instinct, and that makes them playful."
Destructive behavior like chewing or soiling carpets stems from boredom, lack of exercise or loneliness, Ms. Burriesci said. "It's separation anxiety," she said. "Many dogs are afraid to be left alone. Here, they have companionship and play all day.'
The Burriescis know whereof they speak. They're able to leave their own brood of six dogs at home "because they have each other," Ms. Burriesci said.
 
For Pets With Good Taste
Ten years ago, Seth Kaplan, a commercial real estate professional and lifelong pet owner, became disgruntled after a visit to a local pet store.
"They acted like they were doing me a favor by waiting on me, and the merchandise was very limited," he said.
So, Mr. Kaplan hired a consultant, drew up a business plan, and, in 1991, opened Pet Pantry, a store in Roslyn Heights that caters to household pets, with a special emphasis on new pet owners. Business grew so rapidly that he left real estate and never looked back.
While Pet Pantry carries 12 lines of predominantly preservative-free food and gourmet delicacies, and even delivers them, it is also a high-end boutique where many of Long Island's best-dressed animals come to shop.
"Long Island has the affluence to let me carry the high-end, exotic and unique products I've always wanted for my own pets," said Mr. Kaplan, who grew up in Roslyn and owns two dogs and two cats.
His merchandise, which he finds at pet trade shows, includes designer duds for dogs, ranging from Calvin Klein T-shirts and authentic leather Harley Davidson jackets to various brands of rainwear and pajamas. Prices range from $40 to $110.
There are also catnip cigars, doggy "designer impostor" colognes with names like "Tommy Holedigger," and personalized ceramic dishes including a line called "Whisker Ware" that features special cut-outs to accommodate cat whiskers.
Currently, his most popular toys include the Rooster, a plush plaything crowned with feathers and stuffed with organically grown catnip, and Snuggle Puppy, a stuffed dog with a battery that creates a heartbeat sound to comfort puppies who miss their mothers.
Pet Pantry usually has 50 to 100 beds in stock. Customers can also examine fabric swatches and design their own. Prices range from $50 to $170. There is other furniture, too -- day beds, sofas, chairs and chaise longues designed by Beastly Furnishings of Nebraska and priced from $250 to $700.
Jayne Stone, a self-described "dog fanatic" from Roslyn, has been a client since Pet Pantry opened. "This place reminds me of the television show 'Cheers,' only with animals," she said. "Everyone is welcome -- with or without their pets."
The store is adorned with photos of its furry regulars. But Mr. Kaplan's favorite pictures lie in a special album he leaves out for his customers -- photographs of dogs and cats from the Town of North Hempstead Animal Shelter and the Glen Cove Animal Lovers' League that are in need of adoption. "We want to save their lives," he said. "This has gotten a lot of them new homes."
 
The Doctor Is Out
Most pet owners know the hassle of taking an animal to the veterinarian. Coaxing pets in and out of carriers, not to mention cars, can be trying, to say the least.
Enter Dr. Jay Berkowitz of Port Washington, a veterinarian whose business consists exclusively of house calls in the Port Washington, Manhasset and Roslyn areas. His "office" is a van stocked with medical equipment and a laptop on which the medical records of his 1,400 patients are stored.
Much of Dr. Berkowitz's day is spent calming nervous dogs with stroking and with reassuring words, or patiently coaxing fearful cats out of hiding behind radiators or down from draperies -- a favorite dangling place for felines looking to avoid their vaccinations. He doesn't treat birds or reptiles.
If a pet needs to be spayed, neutered or requires surgery, he will take the animal with him (he is affiliated with the Long Island Animal Hospital in Old Westbury) and return it to the owner.
A graduate of Cornell University's veterinary school, Dr. Berkowitz, a Long Island native, spent nine years at an animal hospital until deciding 13 years ago that it was time for a change.
"I thought that doing only house calls would not only meet a need among pet owners, but would be a lot of fun as well," he said.
It's also been an education in human nature.
"Pets are incredibly important to people," he said. "And, one of the most surprising things, which I hear all the time, are regular clients telling me they haven't seen a doctor themselves in years. They're putting their animals first.
"I don't think people love animals any more today than before," he added. "I think it's just that, as more innovative products and services become available, people are eager to take advantage of them."
 
Have Pet, Will Travel
The Willow Pet Hotel has two options for vacationing humans: a boarding facility for cats and dogs in Deer Park and a travel agency for pets whose owners want to take them along for the trip.
Since 1969, this family-run business has been making full travel arrangements -- mostly by plane and train -- for clients wishing to transport their pets
Marc Rosenzweig, the native Long Islander who is the company's executive director, said business took off immediately.
"There was definitely a need for this," he said.
The company is registered as an intermediary handler with the United States Agriculture Department and belongs to the Independent Pet Animal Transport Association.
"We recently sent a Yorkshire terrier to Saudi Arabia," Mr. Rosenzweig said. The company has transported animals, not only throughout the continental United States, but to and from Europe, Japan, Singapore, Israel, and many Asian and African countries.
Mr. Rosenzweig, who owns several dogs himself, compares Willow Pet's travel agency to one that accommodates humans. "The client advises us where and when their animal needs to be transported, and we handle all the arrangements," he said. "We call the airlines and take into account the best flights for pets and the price. (Avoiding stop-overs and hot times of day are important, he notes, as is adequate air-conditioning).
Animals require certain inoculations and a health certificate within 10 days of transport. "If the client hasn't fulfilled these requirements, we can take the animal to our veterinarian," Mr. Rosenzweig said.
Small animals in travel carriers that fit underneath seats, and guide dogs can travel with their owners on trains and airplanes, he noted, though there is a ticketing fee. Larger ones are transported separately.
"We secure the animal 24 hours before transport and get it accustomed to the shipping kennel it will be traveling in," Mr. Rosenzweig said, noting that such kennels must meet U.S.D.A. specifications.
A member of the Pet Animal Travel Agency at Willow Pet Hotel brings the animal to airport or train station, and makes sure it gets on board safely. "Like people, animals need to arrive for flights a certain amount of time in advance," Mr. Rosenzweig said.
 
She Sits, but Doesn't Stay
 Several years ago, when Theresa Cahill went on vacation, she needed someone to tend to her own pets. She has two dogs, three degus, or Chilean wood rats, and a parrot.
When she found a sitter who would come to her house, she also found a business that piqued her curiosity.
Ms. Cahill began researching pet-sitting, seeking guidance from both Pet Sitters International and the National Association of Professional Pet Sitters. (She already had a long history with animals; she had been a preveterinary student at SUNY Farmingdale, had studied animal husbandry, and had worked for a veterinarian.
In 1995, Ms. Cahill launched A-1 Critter Sitters from her Riverhead home. With some 75 to 80 regular clients who live between Riverhead and Shirley, business is brisk.
About 10 percent of her calls are for "day care" -- people who work late or are out for the day. Most, however, are the pets of vacationers and business travelers. Ms. Cahill's husband and children help her out at peak times -- summers and school holidays.
"Some pets can't be boarded," she said. "They may be too young, too old or simply not socialized. Other people simply don't want to remove pets from the home environment. And, there are illnesses like kennel cough which can be avoided by keeping your pet at home."
She sits predominantly for dogs and cats, but she has also cared for cows, geese, chickens, horses, goats, sheep and a pot-belly pig..
Ms. Cahill, who is licensed, bonded and insured, will groom animals, play with them, give them walks and change their food and water.
"I also bring in the mail and turn lights on and off, to make the home look occupied,' she added. In case of emergency, she has the family veterinarian's name on file.
Prices start at $12 a visit for one animal.
She belongs to the Long Island Professional Pet-Sitters' Association in Deer Park, a group of 32 independently owned pet-sitting businesses.
"Members aren't not really competitors," she said. "Most are one- or two-person operations which cover different areas. We meet monthly to discuss things like what type of insurance is best for us, what to do with an overly aggressive dog, etc. And, we refer clients outside our areas to one another."
"Many owners will call to check in when they're away," she added. "I can't blame them -- these animals are their family, and they really miss them."

HEADLINE: Bronx Is in the Name. Drums Are Their Game. P.S. They're French.

BYLINE: By LESLIE KANDELL

 BODY:
THE following concert program is rated PG13:
It contains 17 brawny guys with bare arms, pummeling oil drums in violent rhythms, with pickaxs. Although there is no profanity (unless it's in French), one cannot ignore the yelling, or the smashing oil cans. Earplugs are available to the audience at no charge. 
 Here, here, what's all this? A variant palliative for aggression? A dream evening for the hearing challenged?
Intrepid listeners will have a chance to find out on Tuesday when Les Tambours du Bronx, an unusual drumming group from France, muscles into the Lycian Center in Sugar Loaf on its first North American tour.
To the extent that the culture of hip-hop is about rebellion, this event is a species of hip-hop -- that is, the antithesis of the classical music concert form. If there is an expected appropriate attire, the drummers of Les Tambours don't wear it. As to performing on valuable heirloom instruments: they don't play standard instruments at all and regularly destroy what they do play on. Quiet, a concert hall norm, is a joke. Even the Bronx reference is a joke.
The men, who no longer have to hold day jobs -- if they ever had them -- come from the outskirts of Nevers, an industrial town in central France known for repairing trains, and also known as the resting place of Bernadette of Lourdes, whose body is preserved under a glass bubble, reportedly as fresh as ever. Before Les Tambours was founded in 1987, its members were friends who met to drink at a place in Nevers called the Broadway Bar. Some were students, some had jobs, some were unemployed, but none were musicians. Their little jest, as their evenings at the Broadway Bar ended, was that they were going back home to the Bronx.
The leader, Ludovic le Mapihan (known as Map), said that the group got its shot at performing during the city's annual festival of movie shorts, "Festival de Nevers de l'Aube," whose presenter was a friend of one of them.
Which one? They don't consider that important, and furthermore, in the interest of unity, they have sent no individual information or separate photos to their presenters' locales.
"We wanted to make a small performance, but we were not sure what," Map said. (The telephone conversation is translated from an ad hoc mixture of French and English, representing a genuine dual effort.) "We had no money, but because Nevers is a city for train repairs, 55-gallon barrels were easy to find free, in gardens."
They performed 20 minutes at the festival, got all fired up and decided to go to any nearby festival, invited or not. "We played in the street," Map said. "Presenters liked us, and we began to be invited."
True to its perverse form, the all-male group, now aged 25 to 42, named its first commercial recording "Silence." It's anything but, though the label name, Naive, is more like it. The rhythms are clean, repetitive in the marching-band sense and seductive but acceptable, probably, even to the most mannered listener. "Bombast and unity," one reviewer said. Not bad.
Nothing about their performance is gentrified. Some numbers have added clapping or whistling, while in others, oil barrel clangor is augmented by groans, howls and snorts. The recording's final number, "Etouffez la Ventoline" (a title chosen for rhythm rather than meaning) has unintelligible words that might be broadcast over a railroad station loudspeaker.
Comparing Les Tambours with Japan's Kodo Drummers, Map acknowledged the similar visceral effect and then said something like: "Our rhythm is very basic. It goes directly to your body. Our instruments are different in the way we play. We smash very loud. When we finish the show, the instrument is destroyed. You can use both sides of the drum, so two shows maximum."
The destruction factor is handled through copious supplies: "A big truck follows us, with 400 barrels from France, and 4,000 sticks," he said. "We break the sticks. You cannot find the barrels outside of France -- not even in Italy or Germany. They're very thin. With thicker metal, you can hurt yourself." After trying different materials for their pickax mallets, they settled on beechwood, because it proved strong enough to survive a concert or two.
Since the drummers can't practice separately, they get together in what Map described as a hangar in the countryside. "We are not musicians," he said. "We play and move our arms a special way. We look for new members in the way we would look for a friend, not a drummer."
In European performances of Les Tambours, there is some interaction with the audience, which Map was not sure was happening on this tour. "We try to talk to the audience," he said, "but our English is not so good. We explain and ask what they think. We know they won't sleep."
Les Tambours du Bronx, 8 p.m. Tuesday at the Lycian Center, 1355 Kings Highway, Sugar Loaf. Tickets: $29, $23 for children. Information: (914) 469-2287.

HEADLINE: From Tiny Acorns, Philanthropy's Oak

BYLINE: By MARCELLE S. FISCHLER

 BODY:
IT doesn't take millions to make a difference. Philanthropists come from all walks of life and all levels of income. Some want to leave a legacy; others want to effect social change. What they share is the spirit of giving.
From the local soccer league to the Herstory Writers Workshop, a women's memoir-writing project, there are hundreds of charitable causes on Long Island and hundreds of small family foundations that help finance them. 
 A retired commodities broker on the East End uses his private foundation to help the families of prisoners. An 11-year-old girl from Oyster Bay sends the earnings from a fund started with an inheritance to her school and to the youth organization where she likes to play basketball. And a former tenor with the New York City Opera and his wife use their connections to stage an opera at a Shelter Rock church each March; the money the event raises goes into a fund they established to support women's literacy in Nassau County.
Sometimes charitable funds are established by people already in the spotlight. Billy Baldwin, one of the four acting Baldwin brothers, recently began a scholarship fund for graduating seniors at Massapequa High School, in the same district where his father, Alexander Baldwin, was a history teacher. In August, Paul Tonna, the presiding officer of the Suffolk County Legislature, established a foundation to help local foster children and then swam across the Long Island Sound to jump-start the fund-raising.
 
Learning to Give
Helping the needy and giving back to the community are lessons that children can learn and cherish. When her grandmother Hilda Weiser died three years ago, Rose Lena Glaser received $5,000 in her grandmother's memory. Lena, now a sixth grader at the Long Island School for the Gifted in Huntington Station, might have been tempted to go on a shopping spree for compact discs at Roosevelt Field. But her parents, Jordan Glaser and Hazel Weiser of Oyster Bay, had a different idea. Concerned about materialism and the values instilled in a child growing up on Long Island, they put Lena's inheritance into a charitable fund at the Long Island Community Foundation.
"Jordan and I believe philanthropy is taught," said Ms. Weiser, a consultant to nonprofit groups. "We did it so that Lena would have an opportunity to learn how to participate in her community. It wasn't her option. We set it up for her so she would know money could do more than buy stuff."
The interest generated by the Rose Fund, named for Lena's great-grandmother and namesake, Rose Epstein, is used for grants that Lena designates. "To have the Rose Fund and to be able to give money away to nonprofit organizations feels good," she said.
So far Lena has had three checks issued from her fund.
After accompanying her father, who volunteers at Planned Parenthood of Nassau County, she sent a $100 donation. "I liked the work that they were doing because it allows women to have choice over their lives," Lena said.
She also made a $125 donation to her school's scholarship fund, "because I like the school and want other kids to be able to have the opportunity to have what I have gotten," she said.
And earlier this year, Lena gave $150 to the Boys and Girls Club of Oyster Bay because she likes playing basketball there and meeting other children from her area.
Where to donate funds is often a topic of conversation at the family's dinner table. Her parents have established their own charity, the Hilda Weiser Fund, honoring Ms. Weiser's mother, with a $6,000 gift. The money the fund earns benefits the Long Island Fund for Women and Girls. Ms. Weiser, the group's co-president, said that it gives out grants and provides an avenue for women to meet and work together for economic independence, leadership and freedom from violence.
At its sixth annual awards breakfast on Wednesday, the fund will give $80,000 in grants to 27 groups, including Something Old, Something New of South Country, which teaches women of various backgrounds how to sew and weave; the Children's Scholarship Fund, which provides scholarships and school supplies to girls from low-income families; and the Committee on Domestic Harmony, which helps women from South Asia, the Middle East and Africa escape from violent relationships.
"My mother was very active in women's organizations on Long Island," Ms. Weiser said. "It's a way of guaranteeing that I'll be able to contribute to women's organizations and think about my mother when I do it. It's a way to keep her name alive. My parents didn't have money. My parents were generous with their time."
 
Ignored Families
When Alan Morton retired as a commodities broker on Wall Street in 1985, he wanted to help people with daunting problems that others had ignored. He first set up a foundation in his own name, channeling money to AIDS patients, and two years ago, to make the task easier, he began funneling his grant money through the Long Island Community Foundation. Grants now go to families of prisoners and to a scholarship program for youngsters from troubled homes.
"I had a little money, not very much, but I had enough to take care of my needs for the rest of my life," said Mr. Morton, who lives in Sag Harbor. "Anything which was surplus to that I wanted to try and do something with it. We have a general program of helping anyone whose needs aren't catered by traditional agencies. They fall through the cracks."
Families of prisoners do their time on the outside, Mr. Morton believes, because they are stigmatized by neighbors, treated curtly on prison visits and must get along without the financial and emotional support of the relative in jail. "I think they have a pretty raw deal," Mr. Morton said. "People aren't very sympathetic toward people in jail and understandably, but I think some of that rubs off on the families."
 
Friendship's Legacy
Ken Greenblatt met Alan P. Mendelsohn in the first grade at Canti ague School in Jericho. They became best friends. Mr. Mendelsohn died of Addison's disease, which affects the adrenal glands, in 1989. For the 20-year reunion of their class at Jericho High School last year, Mr. Greenblatt created a scholarship fund in Mr. Mendelsohn's name. "It's the 'nice guy' scholarship," said Mr. Greenblatt, 39, who lives in Woodbury. "In our world the nice guys finish first, bucking the trend of 'nice guys finish last.' "
Mr. Greenblatt, a vice president of the Millennium Planning Group, a money-management concern, began the fund, run by the Long Island Community Foundation, with $1,000 of his own money. At the reunion, he asked his classmates to join in, and so far, 78 people, including family members, have contributed a total of $16,000.
The first two scholarships, each $500, were awarded in June to a graduating boy and girl selected by a committee from the high school. The winners must "embody the characteristics and qualities of our friend Alan, who was one of the nicest people on the planet," Mr. Greenblatt said. "He was a great, all-around human being, a Renaissance man," he added. "That's what we wanted to acknowledge."
 
For Foster Children
As the presiding officer of the Suffolk County Legislature, Mr. Tonna, 42, assigned himself as chairman of the social services committee. The horror stories of sexual and physical abuse that child-protection workers recounted at meetings made him cry, he said. When he told his wife, Carol, 47, what was happening, she insisted they had to do something about it.
Together, in August they set up the Search Foundation, short for Seeking Avenues to Reward Foster Children, and so far they have raised $18,000, including their own gift of $1,000. To kick off the fund-raising in September, Mr. Tonna, a former lifeguard, swam six miles across Long Island Sound, from Stamford, Conn., to Caumsett State Park in Lloyd Neck.
As four of his five adopted children, all under age 5, climbed on his lap, wrapped their arms around his neck and legs and clamored for attention, Mr. Tonna said: "We have to take care of those who are least fortunate in our society. There is no group of people in our society that needs love and care more than foster children."
New York State grants payments of $400 for each foster child for school and hobby expenses, music, art and dancing lessons and summer camp. But that amount doesn't go very far, Mr. Tonna said, and the foundation the Tonnas set up will help fill the gaps.
"What we do is like a make-a-wish for foster kids," Mr. Tonna said. "When they want to go for swim lessons, or they need the soccer league or the baseball league, once that $400 is exhausted, the Search Foundation will help support efforts to pay for their other activities, to give the things all kids need. Foster kids need a childhood. That's what we're focusing on, that they get an opportunity to have a childhood like anybody else."
At any given time, there are about 1,000 foster children in Suffolk County, and an average of 53 children enter foster care each month, Mr. Tonna said. About 70 percent of these children eventually return to their families, and 21 percent are adopted. Mr. Tonna has set of a goal of raising $100,000 a year for the Search Foundation, or $100 for each foster child in Suffolk.
Mr. Tonna acknowledged that being the presiding officer of the County Legislature may have helped his fund-raising efforts. "Being a politician is not my day job," he said. "This is my avocation. Clearly for me, I have a huge agenda, a social agenda, a community agenda. And so I use the political stuff as a means to an end. This is one of those ends."
 
Close to Home
Murray and Lillian Barbash of Brightwaters believe that giving starts at home. They started the Barbash Family Fund nine years ago to give money to causes they were interested in.
"Our charity is mainly local," said Mr. Barbash, 76, a retired residential developer and a longtime supporter of the arts on the Island. "We both have a philosophy that charity is much more effective when you take an interest in the place you are putting your money. The value is enhanced by your presence."
Five years ago, the couple saw "Having Our Say" on Broadway, the story of Sadie and Bessie Delany, two pioneering black women who talk about their experiences in a racially divided society. Mr. and Mrs. Barbash later returned for a special matinee with 700 11th and 12th graders from Bay Shore, at a cost of $18,000.
"The Bay Shore school system is 40 percent minority," Mr. Barbash said. "One of the problems is to get the minority kids to come out of their shells and participate in the arts. It's been a marvelous experience getting everybody to participate and appreciate the arts creatively and passively and in every which way."
That first field trip was so successful that Mr. Barbash founded the Bay Shore Schools Arts Endowment Fund with $50,000, part of it his own money and part an anonymous donation. A year ago, he began bringing in corporate donors like the Keyspan Energy Corporation and the Roslyn Savings Bank.
In recognition of his efforts, Mr. Barbash will be honored as the outstanding philanthropist of the year by the Long Island chapter of the National Society of Fund Raising Executives on Friday.
When the Barbashes moved to Long Island in 1954, they chose Brightwaters because of the Bay Shore schools' top-notch reputation in the arts. Their three children attended Bay Shore schools, and three of their six grandchildren are now enrolled. "We bring arts to the school, and the kids to the arts," Mr. Barbash said. Perhaps as a result of getting the children involved and motivated, Mr. Barbash said, the district's SAT scores have climbed well above the state and national average.
As part of their personal involvement with the arts, the Barbashes were founders of the Long Island Philharmonic and have bailed the orchestra out on more than one occasion. "It's a hell of a problem keeping an orchestra viable in an atmosphere where the competition, not only in New York City, is ferocious," Mr. Barbash said. "On Long Island itself, Tilles gets the best orchestras in the world. How can the L.I. Philharmonic compete with that?"
The Barbashes set up their foundation at the urging of their accountant. "The foundation gives us a lot of flexibility, and it prepares for the future," Mr. Barbash said. "When the need arises we do it. We're not dot-com millionaires, but we are certainly substantial enough to give a considerable amount of money away. We just want to do these things in the community where we can see how our efforts benefit the community. It's a lot more effective than writing a big check and throwing it at an organization."
Mr. Barbash said that he and his wife found philanthropy challenging. "If some kids get turned on and lead fuller lives because they have been turned on early to appreciate the theater and music and art, then the whole thing is worth it," he said. "The bonus is that it does demonstrably help kids scholastically and throughout their whole lives."

HEADLINE: Island's Artists Create Art for Wrist or Lapel

BYLINE: By MARCIA BYALICK

 BODY:
A POTTER'S work makes its home on a shelf. A painter's work hangs on the wall. But the work of a jewelry maker can turn up anywhere: dangling from the ears of a customer waiting in line at the post office, encircling the wrist of a ticket taker at the local movie theater or adorning the suit jacket of a county district attorney.
Here's a look at several Long Island jewelry makers whose unusual, whimsical and elegant designs have helped elevate their craft to an art form.
 
Sisters in Motion 
 Ilene Barrack answers the door of her Great Neck home wearing a hot pink lace shawl, adorned with a few strategically placed crystal beads, that was, until a few days before, an antique beige table runner. The curtains behind her are rich Indian saris, held together with red rhinestone earrings.
Her sister, Miriam Miller, who lives in Roslyn, is already at work, painstakingly boring holes in the soft gray pearls she will entwine with the eight shades of blue crystals she plucks out of the plastic bowls before her.
"Today is a blue day," she explained, taking a tissue out of a magnificent crocheted bag she whipped up over the weekend.
"Sisters" reads their business card, and that relationship informs their energy, their work habits and their creativity.
After their international travel as publicists for the fashion industry was curtailed by the birth of their children, they decided to harness some of the talent first expressed during their Bayside High School years. In the 70's they haunted the stores in Flushing for yarn, trimmings and buttons, creating their own clothes. They befriended artists in Arizona and New Mexico and began designing Indian jewelry.
"We were so successful, so fast, that the phone would ring at 8 in the morning and someone would say: 'Brush your teeth, I'm coming over. I need a gift for my mother-in-law,' " said Ms. Barrack. "People would come here every day. Until the interest in Indian jewelry began to wane."
"Then," Ms. Miller continued, "a friend told us that the department stores were featuring all kinds of crystal beaded bracelets and necklaces. She knew we could create more beautiful pieces than they were selling. She was right."
In a matter of weeks they were in business. Ms. Miller ferreted out new sources for materials, using both their old contacts out West and on 37th Street in Manhattan, as well as new ones the computer came up with in India and Pakistan. Ms. Barrack bought a few pieces and studied them before coming up with her own take.
"My customers like my wacky combinations," she said. "I'm never consistent, and I love colors that clash. If someone says, 'Make that exact piece for me,' I can't. What I can do is give them a wristful of bracelets, each different, for the same price as a high-end department store charges for one."
The women use amethysts, rubies, green garnets, peridots, turquoise, tourmaline, pearls, coral and crushed oyster to accent their crystal jewelry.
"The two of us, working our 15 to 20 hours a week, barely produce enough to satisfy the orders coming in," Ms. Barrack said. "Filling the orders for bridal parties, a new venue for us, is keeping us really busy. If we were to hire other people to help us, we could . . . "
"But we don't want to do that," Ms. Miller finishes the thought. "We like our aloneness. We like having a home cottage industry that allows us time to still bake and crochet and knit."
"We don't like anything that takes us away from the kids. They're our No. 1 priority," added Ms. Barrack. "And it doesn't mean anything if we can't do it together."
 
Life in Porcelain
Although Erh-Ping Tsao's family was disappointed that he did not follow in the footsteps of his doctor father and scientist aunts and uncles, there is no doubt that his affinity for anatomy and biology is seen in the work he did choose.
Along with his wife, Cynthia Chuang, he creates imaginative interpretations of fish, birds, butterflies, grasshoppers, praying mantises and other creatures, made of specially painted porcelain, metal, and semi-precious stones.
In 1984, after attending the Taiwan Academy of Art, the two received their master's degrees in sculpture at the Parsons School of Design. The years that followed found them working out of a kiln in the bathroom of their Elmhurst apartment.
Now the couple, who have a home in Lattingtown, have a waiting list of galleries who want to exhibit their jewelry, a retail store of their own in Manhasset, and a production staff of 10 to help them.
At this point, Ms. Chuang takes care of the business end and Mr. Tsao "thinks."
"Our inspiration comes from ancient Egypt and Africa, from folk art and modern art," Mr. Tsao said. "Each of our pieces has a story behind it. I never sketch what I'm going to make. The trying part is already in my brain. The porcelain we use is soft and cannot be extended. But metal can. We have developed three-dimensional construction techniques that have never before been used with porcelain. I often solve these kind of problems in the middle of the night."
"Erh-Ping has a scientific mind with an artistic nature that is romantic and idealistic," Ms. Chuang said. "We depend on each other in both art creation and practical life. However, we still have independent space to enjoy personal meditations. We strongly complement one another."
 
Luster of Gold
Wendy Kay says she's shy so she likes to let her art speak for her.
"For me to personally sell my pieces, to have to schmooze for hours with dozens of customers, is as difficult as putting in the time and energy necessary to produce enough work for a craft fair," said Ms. Kay, a Sand Point resident who works in silver and gold. "That's why most of my work is either commissioned or sold in galleries."
Ms. Kay works out of a glass-enclosed, skylit studio overlooking the garden. Access is only from the patio or the garage, assuring that her quiet work space is completely separate from the rest of her life. Her materials, large sheets of silver and gold, are special-ordered from England. Before becoming one-of-a-kind earrings, necklaces and pins, they are shaped, rolled, hammered and melted on heat refractory counters, using anvils, torches, wheels and her tool of choice, a water welder.
Her signature design is a bimetal slide, most popularly right now in red or blue, that looks much like a piece of ziti. When the piece is slid onto a necklace, whether it be pearl or beads or crystal, the item becomes more versatile.
Ms. Kay's time is divided between her studio at home and a studio she uses as a classroom in Little Neck.
"Working at home as I do allows for flexibility but it can become very lonely and isolating," she said. "I found the energy and the focus I needed in a communal setting. The other artists work in silver and enamel. Observing their work, I got into using colors on my metals, using the water torch to form shapes and collages. If I'm tense, I might move into clay, a more pliable medium. I make masks and vessel forms, enhancing them with jewelry and feathers."
Recently her focus has been recycling old gold into more organic wearable art. When people bring her their treasures, she removes the stones and melts down the gold. Then, she designs a new piece.
"To have a trademark, if I could take a particular design and have it reproduced in a certain way so that it is my signature design . . . that would be wonderful."
 
Working Beads
Heidi Bram is that most rare of creatures: a jewelry maker who actually makes a living from her art, which she calls "bead manipulation."
An affirmation posted about the work space in her Centerport home says, "Be kind and special with yourself, being your knowing everything you need is in you."
"These sayings help me to remember who I am, why I'm here and what I'm doing this for," said the 29-year-old artist."
Today she is filling an order for one of the fashionable Long Island establishments who carry her jewelry. She creates three collections a season, each based on one color scheme and consisting of 12 to 15 necklaces, 15 earrings and 5 bracelets. This season black, garnet, smoked topaz and amethyst star in her work, accenting the glass and crystal that underlie all her pieces.
Five years ago, Ms. Bram was fired from her corporate job in upscale men's fashion. Her parents were more upset than she was.
"They have lived a safe life where you don't take risks," she said. "They were nervous that I didn't have security. It was hard for them. So I tried. I went on interviews but nothing panned out. Now I know why. It wasn't supposed to."
While Ms. Bram was collecting unemployment and pondering what to do with her degree in textiles, fashion buying and merchandising, a friend asked her if she could make her a beaded necklace similar to the one she was wearing.
Everyone in her friend's office loved it and asked her to make some for them.
"I always knew I wanted my own business but I didn't know what kind," said Ms. Bram. "When these necklaces proved so popular, I decided to create a collection and make the rounds of buyers and boutiques, both in Manhattan and on Long Island. I tried local craft fairs. I found I enjoyed interacting with people and learned pretty quickly not to take anything personally. Within a few months I was making a living."
Soon she found that the only way she could produce enough for the fairs was if she gave up selling to the stores and galleries. Or get help.
Recently she hired an assistant.
"Till now I was a one-woman operation," Ms. Bram said. "I did the designing, the bead shopping, the bead counting, the paperwork, all the production, the selling and delivering. But I didn't mind because each year, as I got better, my business grew. Happiness is very much about finding that place inside that makes us comfortable with what were doing. I'm so lucky that I have."

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Work Begins on Battery Landing for Staten Island Service;
Coming Up: One Ferry Terminal, Hold the Clock

 BODY:
Remember that Staten Island ferry terminal design with the giant clock? This isn't it.
This is the one that is actually being built. 
 In September, nine years after a spectacular fire ravaged the Whitehall Ferry Terminal in lower Manhattan, ground was broken for its replacement by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Borough President Guy V. Molinari of Staten Island and Michael G. Carey, president of the city Economic Development Corporation, which is overseeing the project.
The $135 million terminal will look considerably different from the one planned in 1992. Designed by Venturi, Scott Brown & Associates and Anderson/ Schwartz Architects, that version was to have been topped by a 120-foot clock with the city seal.
Some New Yorkers were captivated (Mayor David N. Dinkins said it would "become a bold new symbol for the city"), but others -- Mr. Molinari most prominently among them -- were infuriated.
"Its only probable benefit would be to remind people that they're late for work -- again," Mr. Molinari said about the clock, which would have greeted Staten Islanders crossing the harbor.
Instead of a clock, the new version will have a V-shaped crown, lined with photovoltaic panels that will furnish part of the terminal's power. The three-slip structure will be faced in glass and corrugated stainless steel. Under the crown will be an open-air viewing deck. "For the first time the public can get out and have elevated views of the harbor," said Frederic Schwartz of Schwartz Architects, successors to Anderson/Schwartz, which continued on the job after the departure of Venturi, Scott Brown. Engineers of the remarkably complex project -- above three subway lines, the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive and the East River -- include TAMS Consultants, Robert Silman Associates and Flack & Kurtz. The construction manager is Tishman/Harris.
Benefits for commuters include an air-conditioned waiting room. The three-year project involves demolition of the existing terminal. One ferry slip at a time will be taken out of service.
It has been a long wait, but Janel Patterson, a spokeswoman for the development corporation, said the design is now "a very contemporary reflection of the times, both in the energy-efficient components and also in the utilization of materials."

HEADLINE: Pinning Their Hopes

BYLINE: By ROBERT STRAUSS

DATELINE: PAULSBORO

 BODY:
THE streets of this little town along the southern Delaware River are not bursting with prosperity even in these flush times. There are lots of "For Rent" signs and boarded-up doors and windows. Mergers in the oil industry have caused layoffs at the riverfront refineries. The town hardly seems a destination for the hopeful.
Yet on every streetlight along Delaware Avenue is a large banner that reads "Paulsboro, Home of Champions" or "We've Got Paulsboro Pride." 
 Those banners mark the way to Paulsboro High School, an old multistory stone building in an era of low-slung, sprawling high school campuses. And each winter, much of the town turns out to watch the Red Raiders wrestling team overpower another opponent.
Last year, Paulsboro won the New Jersey Group 1 wrestling championship. It wasn't even close: a 56-14 trouncing of Bound Brook, making the Red Raiders 21-0 for the season.
In many ways, it was just another day at the office for Paulsboro High School wrestlers. Paulsboro has won the last 18 Group 1 wrestling titles, the most consecutive state championships of any wrestling team in the country. The team has won 243 straight Colonial Conference matches and 29 consecutive conference championships.
In fact, when Paulsboro's wrestling team loses, it's an occasion. The team has lost only 10 dual matches in the last 30 years, running up winning streaks of 55, 84 and 96 in that time.
But all those statistics, amazing though they may be, only start to tell the story of Paulsboro High School wrestling. Paulsboro and neighboring Gibbstown, which also feeds Paulsboro High, are the type of hardscrabble towns that people have been abandoning for decades, as the country has moved from manufacturing to a service economy. The Colonial Conference in which Paulsboro's teams play includes much more affluent places, like Haddonfield and Collingswood.
"We recognize the differences, I have to say that," said Walter Quint, Paulsboro's superintendent of schools for the last 10 years. "But Paulsboro kids go out of their way to break the stereotype you might think of in that regard. When you see them in public, they are always dressed better and behaving better than you would expect."
Some believe it has a lot to do with the wrestling heritage of the town, dating to 1939. That was when a young physical education teacher named Norman Hangen started a wrestling program at Paulsboro as an alternative to boxing.
"From what I heard, Mr. Hangen had a tough time convincing parents that this wasn't that fake professional wrestling," said Paul Morina, the current Paulsboro wrestling coach. "But once he did, everyone got on the bandwagon. It was seen as something to build character, something to have as a tradition."
Mr. Morina is an integral part of that tradition. He was a Paulsboro High wrestler who was South Jersey regional champion in the 148-pound weight class in 1977. His older brother, Carmel, was a state champion in the 188-pound weight class in 1975 and now coaches seventh and eighth graders in Paulsboro. Paul Morina's assistants all wrestled at Paulsboro.
"This is a family business," said Steve Anuszewski, a financial planner who wrestled with both Morinas in the mid-1970's in Paulsboro and now volunteers as an assistant coach. "And the town is always behind it. It isn't just a few kids who happen to be good. It's a whole town getting together. And kids who achieve beyond where some people from the outside would believe."
Tom Curl, for instance, is just a little worried about his advanced-placement calculus class. A junior, Mr. Curl placed fifth and third, respectively, in the state as a heavyweight (more than 215 pounds) the last two years. His friend Mike Mendenhall, another junior, was seventh in the state in the 189-pound weight class last year. He is taking advanced chemistry and is on his way, he hopes, to a career in computer engineering.
"If you are involved in Paulsboro wrestling, you see how you can reach goals," Mr. Curl said. "You extend yourself."
"I think we're recognized as achievers, here and throughout the state," Mr. Mendenhall said. "And it's because of the support we get at home and in town. When we go to away matches, there are almost always more people from Paulsboro than from the home team. They rent buses here. When we go to Virginia for tournaments, we have busloads of parents, friends, fans coming with us."
The climb to being part of the Paulsboro varsity starts early. Mr. Mendenhall started in a peewee wrestling club at age 6. Mr. Curl started even earlier.
"I was 4 when my father took me to Gateway High School to a wrestling match," he said. "I loved it. I made him watch wrestling matches on local cable. He took me to peewee classes."
When he was in third grade, Mr. Curl, who was then living in nearby Mantua, got his father to take him to Paulsboro for his wrestling because that was the place to be. The family later moved to Gibbstown and Mr. Curl was officially part of the Paulsboro tradition.
"It is both great and tough to be here," he said. "Great because of the support, but tough because our training and work is harder. I'm sure we work more than any other wrestling team. But it makes us better people, since we work hard and know that that means we can have success."
Like most of the varsity wrestlers, both Mr. Curl and Mr. Mendenhall are members of Paulsboro's other stellar sports squad, the football team. During the mid-1990's, the football team won a state-record 63 consecutive games. It has lost only two games since.
"I think it is the perfect complement," said Mr. Morina, who is thehigh school's interim athletic director as well as wrestling coach. "I know they are in good shape even before we start the season in December. And I know they come over with the right type of pride. I think it carries over to the rest of the school, and that is a good thing, especially if the town itself falls on bad times."
The halls of Paulsboro High are quiet during class time -- no tough guys bounding around, no disruptions coming from classrooms. The halls are, indeed, old and cramped, but they are without any clutter. While smoke spews out of refineries just past the football field behind the school, the grounds are neat and students pick up every piece of litter.
"Yes, this is a tough town, but the kids here are classy," said Mr. Quint, the superintendent. "I think in part it has to do with the wrestling team, which reinforces a sense of pride in the school and the town. No one here backs off from a challenge. But that also means they are not afraid of hard work."
Mr. Morina became coach in 1985, but he still reveres his old coach, Bob Frederick, whose teams lost only six matches in 15 years (three of those were in Mr. Frederick's first year as coach in 1970). Mr. Frederick, who works part-time in the Gloucester County College athletic department, still drops by to help out Mr. Morina.
"It's a matter of everyone in town doing their part," Mr. Frederick said. "There are youth wrestling teams and peewee tournaments and parents and friends doing everything to make sure they have good coaching and the proper equipment. Once again, these are tough kids from a tough community and they have always done their best."
Mr. Morina said the challenge for Paulsboro wrestling in the future was daunting. The team has had only 19 state champions, despite its 778-54-12 record since 1939, which reflects on the quality of the team overall as opposed to a handful of standout wrestlers. This is even more unusual in a school of only 747 students.
"Wrestling everywhere is bigger than it used to be, and we are in a little school, so getting a very good team is difficult," Mr. Morina said. "I can see the day where we might not be state champs, where we might get beaten a couple of times.
"That's when we'll find out how good this program really is, when I find out how good a coach I really am," he said. "But they have all been great kids, so that's what being a champion is."

HEADLINE: Giving It Away

BYLINE: By DEBRA NUSSBAUM

 BODY:
THERE are many tales about Bernice Wall Barbour, and one of the favorites involves the winter when she heard that elk were starving to death out West. She left her New Jersey home and headed out to her Wyoming ranch, where she bought a snowmobile and spent the winter hauling hay to the hungry animals.
Her passion for animals was so great that in 1987, two years before she died, Mrs. Barbour, a lifelong New Jersey resident, set up a foundation -- the Bernice Barbour Foundation Inc., based in Hackensack. Its mission: to give grants to groups that preserve and care for animals in the United States and to groups that prevent cruelty to animals. 
 Mrs. Barbour wanted her money to continue supporting the causes she loved, long after she was here to make the donations herself. Changes in tax laws over the past two decades have made foundations a popular way to do that -- and to do it now. Instead of setting up foundations as part of a will, people are getting them up and running while they are still alive and well.
"People who set up foundations are generally interested in doing good for their community and they would rather direct their money than have the government direct it for taxes," said William V. Engel, a lawyer and executive director of the E. J. Grassmann Trust in Warren.
As of 1998, there were 1,462 active foundations in New Jersey, according to Steven Lawrence, director of research for the Foundation Center, an organization that collects, organizes and analyzes information on foundations. New Jersey has about 3 percent of the United States' 46,832 foundations, twice as many as there were in 1982.
The majority of the country's foundations are small, with less than $100,000 in annual giving, and two-thirds have less than $1 million in assets. While some give million-dollar donations, many give grants of several hundred or several thousand dollars to a few dozen local organizations.
"A foundation can have a big impact," Mr. Lawrence said. A foundation can make a difference on one issue, or in one community where the giving is centered, like the Victoria Foundation in Montclair, which gives about 140 grants a year to organizations based in Newark.
Some foundations give to set organizations each year, while others take applications for their money. All have special fields of interest, and some can be quite specific. Mrs. Barbour's foundation, for example, will not support groups that do not spay or neuter animals before giving them out for adoption.
Foundation giving in the United States was almost $23 billion in 1999, Mr. Lawrence said. About $759 million was given out in New Jersey by foundations in 1998, the most recent state data available. Here are some of the Jersey foundations and their projects:
 
E. J. Grassmann Trust
E. J. Grassmann, a lifelong resident of Elizabeth, made his money in land surveying and in a company that mined and processed kaolin, a type of clay that is used to make paper shiny.
"He was a very private individual to the point that he would be unhappy that his name was on this trust," said Mr. Engel, the executive director of the trust. Few people knew him well and many found him intimidating. Mr. Grassmann married, but there were no children. His wife Ernestine, died about 18 months after his death in 1974.
Mr. Grassmann left money for his wife, but the rest of his estate went to charity. The trust, started in 1979, was a way "the money would do a lot of good over a long period of time," Mr. Engel said.
While Mr. Grassmann was alive, his favorite charities were the three hospitals in Elizabeth that have now merged to become Trinitas Hospital.
The trust now gives 175 grants each year. What started as an $8 million trust, when Mr. Grassmann died, is now $36 million. Grants have ranged form $1,500 to $90,000 though they average $10,000 each and few are more than $20,000. The foundation gets more than 300 applications each year and awards grants twice a year. Most of the money stays in New Jersey, but some grants are also awarded to groups in mid-Georgia, where the kaolin mines are.
The board of the trust has given preference to hospitals, social service groups, education organizations and land preservation organizations in the Elizabeth area, in keeping with the types of charities that Mr. Grassmann chose when he was alive.
Organizations with low administrative costs are given preference. Organizations receiving money in recent years have included the Nature Conservancy in Chester, the New Jersey Historical Society in Newark, St. Vincent Academy High School in Newark and the Muhlenberg Hospital Foundation in Plainfield.
 
Puffin Foundation Ltd.
The puffins, birds that live off the coast of Maine, were forced to leave their habitat because their eggs were being attacked by sea gulls. A professor who studied the species figured out a way to prevent the attacks and the puffins were able to live in the area again. Perry Rosenstein believes that the assault on the puffins "symbolizes what we thought was happening with our culture today: We're losing touch with our roots."
And so, 15 years ago, Mr. Rosenstein, who is president of Brighton-Best Socket Screw Manufacturing Inc., started a private family foundation that took its name from the birds. His wife, Gladys Miller-Rosenstein, is the executive director and his three children are on the board of the Puffin Foundation, which is now based in Teaneck.
"We strongly believe in individual creativity," Mr. Rosenstein said of the foundation, whose main interests are the arts and the environment. It gives grants to all types of artists and strives for diversity by giving money to native Americans, gays and "artists of all colors and political persuasions," he said. It has also helped organizations like Doctors Without Borders and groups that promote events against capital punishment. Those seeking grants, which can range from $1,000 to $7,000, must apply to the foundation.
The family opened the Puffin Cultural Forum in Teaneck, which has weekly arts programs, many of them free, including musical performances and lectures by artists and photographers.
 
The Victoria Foundation
Catherine M. McFarland, executive officer of the Victoria Foundation, said that when she mentions a project outside Newark to the board of directors, the response is, "I'm glad you've solved all of Newark's problems."
The board's point, Ms. McFarland said, is that "by focusing we can accomplish more."
Last year, the foundation gave 147 grants in the Newark area ranging from $1,000 to $500,000, with the average grant from $75,000 to $100,000. Grants are given to benefit the environment, education, health services, the homeless, leadership development and civil rights.
Hendon Chubb, the chief executive of an insurance company, created the foundation to help the poor and to honor his mother, Victoria.
The family story goes like this, Ms. McFarland said: Thomas and Victoria Chubb were living in England and not doing as well as they would have liked. They decided to move to Australia, where Victoria got a job as a teacher. Thomas went to America to seek his fortune, and Victoria agreed to join him later with their two children. When Victoria left Australia, her boat shipwrecked on Pitcairn Island (from "Mutiny on the Bounty"), where she is believed to have been the first white woman to set foot.
She and her family eventually made it to America, where her husband started the successful insurance business.
Thomas and Victoria's son, Hendon, lived and worked in New York. The foundation's focus in the 1940's and 50's was to help children with rheumatic heart problems. But by the late 1950's rheumatic fever had ceased to be a major health concern.
Percy Chubb II became president of the foundation near the end of the 1960's and helped change its focus. Aided by board members like Robert Lilley, who was a telephone executive in the Newark area, the board became interested in helping the city of Newark.
Percy Chubb's interest was "upward mobility for inner city residents," Ms. McFarland said.
In 1999, the foundation gave money to institutions including Newark Boys Chorus School, St. Michael School, Queen of Angels School, the Chad School Foundation, the Newark Public Library, the New Community Corporation, the Newark Community Development Network, the Pinelands Preservation Alliance, Friends of the Rockaway River Inc., the New Jersey Conservation Foundation and Urban Conservation Action Partnership Inc. Grants were also given to arts organizations like the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra and the New Jersey Performing Arts Center.
 
Pascale/Sykes Foundation Inc.
Families are important to Frances P. Sykes.
Two years after her father, Henry Pascale, a businessman, died in 1990, she started a foundation with her husband, Donald M. Sykes, to help poor working families in New Jersey and New York City.
"We focus on low-income families and flexible programs that promote the independence and integrity of the entire family," she said. "A lot of what we do is preventative."
Mrs. Sykes said she favored programs that worked at helping an entire family, rather than just focusing on one troubled family member. People who are living "one paycheck away from poverty," she said, really struggle when faced with situations like a troubled teenager or a child who needs expensive medicines. When a teenage son has an addiction, she said, "everyone in the family needs to adjust."
One group that the foundation has supported is St. Mary's Hospital Caritas Connection in Passaic, which has a literacy program for immigrant parents and their children. This program "strengthens the role of the parent," Mrs. Sykes said. The foundation also sponsors a bilingual Spanish-English newspaper in the Highbridge section of the Bronx, whose purpose, she said, "is to draw the neighborhood together."
The foundation also gives grants to Our Lady of Lourdes Health System in Camden to aid its programs for the homeless and the underinsured and to St. Paul's Community Development Corporation in Paterson, an offshoot of St. Paul's Episcopal Church that helps with social and economic needs in Paterson.
The foundation, which requires applications, gives about 10 grants a year ranging from $15,000 to $80,000.
 
The Barbara Piasecka Johnson Foundation
Barbara Piasecka Johnson and her husband, J. Seward Johnson, who died in 1983, set up this foundation 26 years ago. Mrs. Johnson, who grew up in Poland and still has family there, wanted to give assistance to medical, artistic and humanitarian projects in her homeland.
The grants have ranged from $221 given to a doctor so he could subscribe to The Journal of the American Medical Association, and $320 to a student so he could stay in New York while taking entrance exams for the Juilliard School of Music to $1 million to build homes in Poland for single mothers and terminally ill patients.
In the last few years, the foundation has become involved with programs whose aim is helping autistic children and adults in Poland.
The organization, based in Princeton, limits grants to organizations and groups that benefit Poland.
 
The Bernice Barbour Foundation
Two years before her death, Bernice Barbour, the widow of Robert Barbour, a businessman, set up a foundation that would benefit the animals she loved so dearly.
Eve Lloyd Thompson, a family friend and head of the foundation, used to tease Mrs. Barbour about having the fattest pigeons and squirrels around her Englewood home.
"She loved all animals," Mrs. Thompson said. "Since childhood, she had been an animal lover. She had a ranch in Wyoming and she loved horses."
The foundation awards grants from $1,000 to $100,000. Last year, the fund aided 118 organizations. They include Friends of the Bergen County Animal Shelter, Monmouth County S.P.C.A., the St. Hubert's Animal Welfare Center in Madison for animals that aren't adopted from other shelters, and Frontiers in Veterinary Medicine, a group that helps veterinary students to do research projects over the summer.
The center also finances research to benefit marine animals. The foundation's brochure with a photo of Mrs. Barbour and drawings of cats, ducks, horses and dogs best describes her mission.
It reads: "From the elk in the Rockies of Colorado who needed hay in a severe winter, to the birds and squirrels in the yard, her dedicated hands on approach to animal welfare was a wonderful thing to witness and a tradition the foundation she founded strives to continue in her memory."
To learn more about foundations in New Jersey and around the country, see the Foundation Center web site at www.fdncenter.org. The Foundation Directory, which lists the nation's foundations by state, is available in many New Jersey libraries. The directory includes financial data, application information and officers and often gives a sampling of grant recipients.

HEADLINE: Changing Fields (and Lawns and Gardens)

BYLINE: By ELISABETH GINSBURG

 BODY:
THE gardening bug is an insidious disease. Once stricken, some victims feel a compulsion to spend all their free time digging in the dirt and all their money buying plants and seeds. Others go even further and transform their working lives by entering the horticultural field.
John Holm, a former professional chef, is in the midst of such a career transformation. Born in Norway to a family that owned a restaurant, he was trained as a cook from an early age. Mr. Holm eventually emigrated to the United States and found work at Manhattan restaurants like La Grenouille and Restaurant 44. He also taught cooking at the French Culinary Institute and helped found a successful prepared-food business. 
 While a chef, Mr. Holm began tending a container garden on the terrace of his Brooklyn Heights apartment. Eventually he moved to a 2.5-acre lot in Bedford and began growing things on a larger scale. He applied to the New York Botanical Garden's School of Professional Horticulture, a two-year program that combines course work with hands-on training in the botanical garden itself. He expects to graduate in 2002 and start his own residential landscape design business.
Training that combines horticulture's intellectual and practical sides makes perfect sense to Mr. Holm, who has a high tolerance for the unglamorous and unpaid work in the botanical garden. "Because of my background in cooking," he said, "I am used to working hard and getting dirty." But "I feel a passion for this that I never did for cooking," he added. "I went into cooking because of my family. This I did for myself."
Five years ago, Mary Squires was a corporate attorney living on Long Island. Then she and her husband moved to Upper Saddle River. After finding out what it cost to hire landscapers, she decided to design her new property herself -- even though she had little experience with plants. "I started researching before I put anything in the ground," she said. Her interest increased, and after she had become a regular at her local retail nursery, a clerk suggested she take some horticulture courses at Bergen County College.
She began her studies with two courses, including Plant, Soil and Science, one of the toughest classes in the two-year degree program. Eventually she became immersed in horticulture education and went to school full time. She received a certificate in landscaping and ornamental horticulture (with honors), and went on to earn an associate's degree in applied science.
With her degrees in hand, Ms. Squires hung out her shingle as a plant consultant, installing and maintaining gardens, doing soil tests and educating her clients about environment-friendly methods of dealing with garden pests.
Ms. Squires specializes in interior "plantscaping," helping her clients with selection and placement of indoor plants. On each job she uses a light meter to gauge the amount of light in specific indoor locations, so people avoid dark corners full of dying plants. This educated approach is something new for Ms. Squires. "In my past life," she said, "I would just buy a plant and water it."
Ms. Squires still does a limited amount of legal work, "just to keep my hand in." In addition to running her own business, she hopes to gain greenhouse management experience by working part time for a local nursery within the next year.
Ms. Squires has no regrets about trading case management for pest management. "The time that I spend in gardens is infinitely more rewarding than the most demanding legal case," she said.
Kathleen Nelson of Gaylordsville, Conn., spends her spring, summer and fall days growing and selling perennials, a home-based business that she began when she made a midlife career change two decades ago. Busy outdoors during the growing season, she spends the winter writing copy for her plant catalog, doing bookkeeping and planning for the coming season.
Ms. Nelson grew up in "the swamps of northern Minnesota," collecting plants in the abundant wetlands. After obtaining a master's degree in zoology, she taught biology at Manhattan Community College. "I loved teaching," she said.
But in the mid-1970's, layoffs within the City University system left Ms. Nelson unemployed. A new job at the University of Bridgeport brought an unexpected bonus -- a husband. Ms. Nelson left teaching and entered professional horticulture at the age of 41, when she had her first child.
"The first couple of years, I didn't know what I was doing," she said. Her science background helped her learn quickly, and trial and error enabled her to make the decision to focus on retail rather than wholesale customers. Her business grew, bolstered by the surge in public interest in perennial plants around the time she started in the 1980's.
Ms. Nelson specializes in shade plants, noninvasive grasses and deer-resistant species, which also feature in her landscape designs for a small number of clients.
As her business has flourished, Ms. Nelson's environmental concerns have grown. A stint on a local wetlands commission changed her focus to promoting native plants. Though natives are enjoying something of a renaissance, the she thinks they need more exposure.
Ms. Nelson's child is now a college junior, and the second career continues to evolve. Though she gives occasional lectures, she said that a return to the classroom would be "emotionally draining." Running her small nursery, said Ms. Nelson, is the perfect combination of physical and intellectual activity.
That combination also appeals to Laura Leach, who made the switch to horticulture after 15 years as a sales, marketing and development executive. Like Mr. Holm, the Hastings, N.Y., resident is now a student in the New York Botanical Garden's horticulture school.
Ms. Leach, who was born in England, has a love of gardening that she inherited from her mother and grandmother. In high school she considered a horticultural career, but chose other options.
After leaving school, Ms. Leach re-encountered horticulture when she took a marketing job with Britain's National Trust, which oversees many historic structures and gardens. Later she worked as the director of development for the Welsh National Opera.
As with Ms. Nelson, marriage helped propel Ms. Leach into a new life. Several years ago, she and her husband emigrated to California, where she began part-time horticultural studies. The following year the couple moved to the East Coast. She had discovered the botanical garden's program on the Internet, and chose it because it provided "the opportunity to work alongside the best horticulturists." She praises the program's diversity. "Today I am preparing seeds for a seed exchange; yesterday I was climbing an oak tree to prune it," she said.
When she graduates in the spring of 2002, Ms. Leach may work as an administrator for a horticultural institution. She also plans to continue her education in landscape design. But she is also keeping her options open. "I am looking at where my skills are," she added.
Ms. Leach had advice for those considering a similar career change. "It's important to have some practical experience in the field first," she said, noting that the botanical garden program requires such hands-on work as a prerequisite for admission.
And, while a horticultural career may ultimately provide those who choose it with time to stop and smell the roses, she advised anyone approaching the field to be "realistic, not romantic."

HEADLINE: When It Comes to Eating Out, Things Are Looking Up

BYLINE: By DAVID CORCORAN

 BODY:
AFTER years of casual experimentation with a controlled substance -- restaurant food -- I became a serious user last spring, when I began reviewing restaurants for The Times's New Jersey section. It wasn't long into this new habit that a suspicion began to sneak up on me: Was it just me, or were New Jersey restaurants a whole lot better than they used to be?
My very first visit, to a Tenafly restaurant called, simply, America, set me thinking. The place was a knockout -- visually stunning, with specially designed menus and place settings, theatrical lighting, live jazz -- and so were the food and the wine list. Prices were high (about $70 for three courses, wine, tax and tip) but hardly outrageous, compared with the competition across the Hudson. 
 At the time, it seemed like beginner's luck. But each subsequent restaurant reinforced the impression that something momentous was afoot. Few of them were as good as America. But plain or fancy, low end or high, American or French or Mexican or Thai, nearly all made me want to come back.
These restaurants seemed to have a few things in common. Most were relatively new -- five months to three years. The chefs and owners (or chef-owners) had vastly diverse resumes, but each showed a passion for food and an ability to talk about it knowledgeably and thoughtfully. Most paid more than lip service to fresh, seasonal ingredients and to exotic, even slightly naughty ones -- preserved lemons, tamarind, sumac -- that can enliven a dish without hijacking it.
To find out what was up (besides my expense account), I began asking around. I soon discovered that I wasn't the only New Jersey diner who was feeling fortunate. A wide assortment of serious eaters, academic experts and restaurant people confirmed that if these aren't the best of times, they are the best that anyone can remember. And a couple of them reminded me that good times don't last forever -- that we'd better enjoy them while we can.
During the sustained economic boom that began in the early 90's, the state became vastly more hospitable to restaurants. People have more money to spend -- per capita income is now 27 percent above the national average, the highest in history -- and restaurateurs have responded by giving them more places to spend it. The New Jersey Restaurant Association says that from 1990 to 1998 the number of restaurants grew 28 percent, to 16,000 from 12,500. (The state's population grew less than 5 percent in that period.)
"People are realizing that almost any space can house a restaurant," said Jennifer Kitchen, a Web site designer and devoted Central Jersey restaurantgoer who lives in Bridgewater. "Strip malls, the state symbol of New Jersey, used to just house pizza joints, takeout Chinese and bagel shops. Now we're seeing more restaurants opening up in strip malls, and they're turning out to be surprisingly good."
Small wonder, since they are competing fiercely for customers. "Competition brings out the best in everyone," said Rosie Saferstein of West Orange, who runs an Internet forum on New Jersey restaurants (www.foodbytes.com). "Look at Ridgewood and Montclair" -- two towns that have been carpeted with new restaurants in recent years. "Ten or 15 years ago there weren't any Malaysian, Egyptian or Turkish restaurants, to my knowledge," she went on. "Now every cuisine is represented."
The boom in ethnic restaurants reflects a boom in immigration -- in the numbers of new immigrants and their diversity, affluence and mobility. "In the 1990 census, New Jersey's immigrant population was more diverse than any other state's," said Thomas J. Espenshade, a professor of sociology at Princeton University's Office of Population Research. Italians were the largest foreign-born group in 1990, he said, but "they probably won't be in 2000." That honor will go to Cubans or Indians -- not coincidentally, two groups that have been opening new restaurants by the dozen.
All these trends -- growing affluence, rising numbers of restaurants, ethnic diversity -- have surfed right along with a tidal wave of interest in food. "Our customers are much more discriminating than they used to be," said Marc Cappellini, general manager of Cooktique, a cookware store and cooking school in Tenafly. "They're asking more pointed questions of the chefs who teach here. 'What's the difference between fresh, frozen and dried herbs?' You didn't hear that in the past."
These customers watch the Food Channel. They subscribe to food magazines like Gourmet and Cooking Light, they crowd the aisles of stores like Cooktique and Williams Sonoma, they swap finds (and horror stories) in Internet discussion groups like Foodbytes and Chow hound.com. "We've come a long way from the 60's, when Julia Child was the only chef on TV," said Fred Mayo, dean of liberal and management studies at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y., which has sharply expanded its course catalog and student body in response to the wave of interest.
Restaurant owners are responding to this new sophistication. Betsy Alger was the executive chef of the Frog and the Peach in New Brunswick when it opened in 1983. "Our menu was much simpler then," said Ms. Alger, still an owner but no longer a chef. "Every main course had the same starch and the same medley of julienne vegetables. Now the public has gotten more sophisticated and demanding, and there's no way I could step into my kitchen and cook the way my chef does."
Dennis Foy, the chef-owner of EQ in Manhattan and Foy's in Point Pleasant Beach, is in an even better position to take the long view: his restaurant Tarragon Tree, which opened in Chatham in 1976 (and closed in 1988), was probably the first in the state to practice the new American style of cooking, with its attention to eclectic and seasonal ingredients.
"There's been an influx of talented chefs into New Jersey," he said. "The clientele is wiser. The resources are better. Products are easier to get. Years ago you couldn't find haricots verts, and prime dried aged meats were a problem unless you did them yourself. Now we're in a good state of food, a good head about food."
But not every indicator is so favorable for New Jersey's restaurants. From 1990 to 1998, the period in which the number of restaurants grew 28 percent, restaurant employment grew only 24 percent (to 176,000 from 142,000). Too many restaurants are chasing too few cooks, waiters and busboys, and it shows: even in expensive places, service can be offhand, poorly timed and confused to the point of cluelessness.
The best restaurants have adapted. "We don't expect as much experience coming in," said Ms. Alger, of the Frog and the Peach. "We used to send people away if they didn't dress properly for the job interview; we wouldn't think of doing that now." To keep good employees, the restaurant offers more benefits, an annual cost-of-living increase and professional training. At the Ryland Inn in Whitehouse, servers take periodic turns cooking, so they gain intimate knowledge of the food they serve.
But the staff shortage may well be emblematic of a larger problem for restaurants. They can attract good employees, and keep them, only as long as they can afford to pay them. And even in boom times, many restaurants are struggling to keep expenses down and prices competitive.
When the economy slows, as it must eventually, the explosive growth of the past decade may prove to have been more than many suburban restaurants can sustain. "In a major city," said Craig Shelton, the chef and owner of the Ryland Inn, "restaurant economics requires turning a table over three to four times a night -- a seating at 5, another one at 7, then at 9 and maybe even at 11 or midnight. You can't do that in the suburbs. Your clientele are commuters; here you do 95 percent of your business between 6:30 and 8:30. So you might ask: How is it that there are any good restaurants outside the city?"
Mr. Shelton answers his question by talking about his relentless efforts to maximize productivity. And it doesn't hurt that the Ryland Inn is one of the few restaurants in New Jersey with a national reputation. It may be able to go on serving $250 wine-and-tasting menus forever.
But others may find that they have to cut corners to stay in business. And when that happens, the best of times could be history.

HEADLINE: OFF THE SHELF;
Dear Fearless Leader Of the Federal Reserve

BYLINE: By ALECIA SWASY; Alecia Swasy, assistant managing editor for business at The St. Petersburg Times, is the author of "Soap Opera: The Inside Story of Procter & Gamble."

 BODY:

To: Alan Greenspan
Federal Reserve
Washington
HI Mr. Greenspan! 
 Are you free for dinner next Saturday?
I'm a big fan, so I thought that you and Andrea could come on down to St. Petersburg for a long weekend of grilling some dogs -- maybe filet mignon if I'm feeling irrationally exuberant in the market.
It has been a beautiful November here on the Gulf Coast of Florida and, well, if you're like the rest of America, you surely must need a break from all those Washington types. How do you put up with all those bureaucrats?
I've wanted to ask you to dinner for years. Who wouldn't want to break bread with a Woody Allen with math skills, the man who gets credit for this long-running economic expansion? O.K., maybe George Bush -- the former president, that is -- doesn't want to have supper with you, but he's just a grouch who blames interest rates for his loss to Bubba.
But the rest of us can raise a glass to you, and to the author Justin Martin for his new biography, "Greenspan: The Man Behind Money" (Perseus Publishing, $28), a delightful account of your personal and professional journey from nerdy, swing-band clarinet player to your icon status as Federal Reserve chairman.
What is fascinating about the book is its attention to minutiae, like your love of statistics. Did you really go to a cocktail party, spot the latest Statistical Abstract of the United States on a shelf, then retreat to a corner, ignoring everyone? One fan called you the "kind of person who knew how many thousand flat-headed bolts were used in a 1964 Chevrolet and what it would do to the economy if you took out three of them."
This love affair with the economy has roots in your early years at New York University's School of Commerce, where you read Keynes, a key influence on Franklin D. Roosevelt, who put people to work building roads during the Depression. From there, your work at the Conference Board was a natural fit, a place brimming with raw data to help you study the steel and rail industries. Sorry to read that your marriage to Joan Mitchell lasted less than a year -- but at least you two remained friends.
By the 1950's you had put away your clarinet, and at the tender age of 27 that Greenspan intellect won you a partnership at Townsend-Skinner, a New York consulting firm that would become Townsend-Greenspan. It is interesting to note that studying how X number of men working Y hours produced Z tons of steel proved to be a logical alternative to a failed musical career. "I get the same kind of joy from solving a hard mathematical problem as I do from hearing a Haydn quartet," you once said. Hard to remember, with the gee-whiz technology of today, that the firm's first computer was the size of a Honda Civic, but had less horsepower than a 386 microprocessor.
BUT the author should have given more than a couple of paragraphs to how you hired women economists at a lower wage than men -- even if everyone pulled that stunt back then. Still, your skepticism about Richard Nixon redeems you. The meeting of the future president and the economist was rich. "He waxed on about the economy in the obscuromystical style that has become his trademark," the author writes of you. Nixon was impressed with you, but you once described him as "intellectually insecure" and "difficult to deal with."
The book, which reflects access to the inner circle of your pals, is especially useful for those of us who were mere punks in the 1970's. For instance, Sunday nights at my house found eight children in front of the TV, focused on the Cartwright family riding those beautiful horses across the Ponderosa. I'm reminded that Nixon pre-empted "Bonanza" on Aug. 15, 1971, to tell America that he was freezing wages and prices -- a move that your pal Milton Friedman deemed the worst mistake in American economic policy in 40 years. As a 7-year-old, all I remember is Dad complaining about grocery prices, so it's helpful to have a refresher course on double-digit inflation.
The author does give you a thump for your incredible gaffe in the fall of 1974, when you were head of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Ford administration. As inflation and unemployment were out of control, you said Wall Street brokers were "hurt the most" by inflation. That remark earned you a place on the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s dubious distinction list. That could explain why you now talk in obscuromystical ways.
But you were on your way in the mid-1970's. Newsweek put you on a cover in 1975, a year when the magazine also featured Bruce Springsteen, Patty Hearst and Jimmy Hoffa. As your political career took off, you did manage to find time to kick up your heels with Barbara Walters and your future wife, Andrea Mitchell, both TV personalities.
What's your take on the author's Freudian dissection of your relationships with women? He says your relationship with your mother gave you a comfort level with strong, unconventional women, like the TV newswomen. Maybe you just like media darlings who share their Cuban cigars, which they get directly from Fidel.
Speaking of Ms. Mitchell, the book discloses a few details of your marriage, but it would have been fun to read more. The honeymoon was in Venice. The high point: a Vivaldi concert. And Ms. Mitchell's parents gave you a Steinway piano for a wedding gift. "Sometimes he'd play it and amuse himself or me," Ms. Mitchell said of the piano. Alas, it was a busy first year of marriage, because you were fighting a global financial crisis -- the Asian contagion.
If the book has a weakness, it is the rushed feeling of the closing chapters, which condense the Reagan, Bush and Clinton years. This was prime Greenspan time, starting when you became Fed chairman in 1987, just before the stock market crash. Then came the savings-and-loan crisis, when institutions went wild investing in junk bonds, bull sperm banks and Florida swamplands. Charles Keating was the king of the mess. And Neil Bush, a brother of George W., was a director of Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan, which had to be bailed out for $1 billion. Funny how the Bush family did not trot out that brother on the campaign trail with Babs and Jebby. And I'm sure you don't want to remember that you once wrote a glowing letter of recommendation about Mr. Keating, endorsing his management of Lincoln Savings and Loan.
Your legacy will forever connect to George Bush, pouting on national television that he could've won the race against Bill Clinton if you would have acted faster to lower interest rates. "I reappointed him, and he disappointed me," Mr. Bush said of you.
But you know what? You haven't disappointed the rest of us. You nailed the Asian contagion, earning you virtual coronation around the globe. The author says CNBC has become GNBC -- all Greenspan, all the time. Then there is that famous briefcase indicator: If you carry a thick case on days when you meet to discuss interest rates, you're pondering a rate change; if you carry a thin one, you're not making a move.
Senator John McCain said it best: "If he would happen to die, God forbid, I would do like they did in the movie 'Weekend at Bernie's.' I would prop him up and put a pair of dark glasses on him."
Glad you enlisted for a fourth term. Hope you and yours will stop by to chew on those dogs, with a side of G.D.P. and C.P.I. data. And don't worry: I'll round up a copy of the Statistical Abstract.
Cheers.

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Loan-Fund Yields Come With Risks

BYLINE: By RIVA D. ATLAS

 BODY:
MUTUAL funds that invest in bank loans to corporations have been marketed as higher-yielding alternatives to money market funds, with average returns of 5.9 percent over the last three years.
But many investors are now finding that the funds have a down side. Many of the loans to highly leveraged companies in which these funds invest have fallen in value as the companies struggle to pay their debts. Assets of these funds have been flat this year through September, after more than tripling, from $9 billion to $31 billion, from 1995 to 1999, according to Lipper Inc. 
 "It's become clear that these funds do have risk," said Sarah Bush, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. While the yields on loan funds make them attractive over the long term, she said, investors who depend on short-term income could be disappointed.
Despite such skepticism, Fidelity Investments, the largest mutual fund company, started its first loan fund in August. Until now, the loan fund market has been dominated by smaller mutual fund companies like Eaton Vance or Van Kampen Investments, or by brokerage firms like Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
The appeal of bank-loan funds is their protection against rising interest rates. They invest in debt with floating rates, meaning that borrowers' rates fluctuate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate, a benchmark that is repriced every three or six months.
Because the loans in which these funds invest are made to highly leveraged companies -- typically the same ones that issue junk bonds -- the loans yield a lot more than traditional corporate loans. Yet these loans are much less risky than junk bonds: after a bankruptcy filing, the borrowers are usually required to pay these loans off first, before any junk bonds.
This year through October, loan funds had a total return of 4.81 percent, on average, according to Lipper. That compares with a loss of 5.46 percent for high-yield bond funds and a return of 4.78 percent for money market funds.
Some investors also like the loan funds because of their yields, which have hovered around 8 percent over the last 12 months. But, unlike money market funds, loan funds have net asset values that can fluctuate depending on the health of the borrowers.
This year, the deteriorating finances of some highly indebted corporations, including an increase in junk-bond defaults, have taken a toll on the portfolios of these funds. Through Oct. 30, the net asset values of loan funds are down 26 to 58 cents a share, from an average price of $9.89, according to Morningstar.
The growth in loan funds has coincided with increased trading in loans to highly leveraged companies. Trading volume grew from $8 billion in 1991 to $110 billion last year, according to the Loan Pricing Corporation, a data firm in New York.
"It used to be that you could fit all the participants in this market on your speed-dial," said Christine McConnell, manager of Fidelity's new Floating Rate High Income fund. Increased liquidity is one reason that Fidelity felt comfortable starting a fund, she said.
The Fidelity fund and a new offering from Eaton Vance offer some new twists on the traditional loan-fund formula. Investors who want to redeem their shares, for example, can do so at any time. Most loan funds accept redemptions only once a quarter.
To meet redemptions, the Fidelity fund can keep up to 20 percent of its assets in money markets or other short-term paper. The Eaton Vance fund says it may invest up to 20 percent of its portfolio in junk bonds, which are more liquid, but riskier, than bank loans.
Increased ease of trading bank loans is generally positive for investors, who now have more benchmarks for assessing portfolio quality. But it also means increased volatility in the net asset values of the funds.
As more banks loans are traded, regulators and investors are increasing the pressure on managers of bank-loan funds to write down the value of their loans based on market prices. Banks, in contrast, typically carry loans at par, or 100 cents on the dollar, as long as they are still paying interest.
Many of the larger loan-fund managers -- like Eaton Vance, which runs $10 billion, and Van Kampen, which manages $9 billion -- began pricing a majority of their loans based on market values only over the last year. As a result, the net asset values of these funds are more volatile.
Especially hard hit are those funds exposed to companies whose bonds are in default or are otherwise out of favor. The $5.8 billion Van Kampen Prime Rate Income fund, the largest loan fund, had 8.5 percent of its assets invested in loans to wireless telecommunications companies as of July 31, according to its filings. A decline in the credit standing of these companies, and in the value of their loans, probably helped pull the fund's total return down to just 0.67 percent through October, the poorest showing of any of the 19 bank-loan funds tracked by Morningstar. The fund manager, Howard Tiffen, had no comment.
The Van Kampen fund's performance is far worse than its peers. But with defaults hitting 4 percent of outstanding junk bonds in the 12 months ended Oct. 31, according to Credit Suisse First Boston, loan-fund asset values could erode further. "I don't think the loan market will have a sustained recovery until the high-yield bond market improves," said Chauncey Lufkin, manager of the $2.9 billion Franklin Floating Rate fund, which had a total return of 5.58 percent this year through October. "That could take until the second quarter of next year."
Investors in loan funds take comfort in the strong historical performance of bank loans. Investors in secured bank loans have held on to 84 percent of their principal, on average, after a borrower went bankrupt, according to Moody's Investors Service. In 1990, the worst year on record for the junk-bond market, loan-fund returns averaged 9.6 percent, according to Morningstar.
Still, past performance could be a poor guide, given that the loan market has quadrupled in size since 1993, according to Sam DeRosa-Farag, who tracks the loan market at Credit Suisse First Boston.
Another factor is that banks no longer dominate this market. Investors like mutual funds now account for nearly half the buyers of loans, according to S.& P./Portfolio Management Data, up from 17 percent in 1994. When they start to lose confidence in the borrowers, the newer investors are more likely to sell loans than are the banks, which may want to preserve relationships with long-term clients.
"This is a totally new environment," Mr. DeRosa-Farag said. "For the majority of the 1990's, most of these loans traded at par. This will be a test of the market's success."
INVESTORS uneasy with short-term fluctuations in the loan market may want to stick to the new Fidelity or Eaton Vance funds, because of their ease of exit. Alternatively, five closed-end loan funds, with $3.8 billion in assets, trade on the New York Stock Exchange and can be bought and sold easily. All but one of them trade at a discount to net asset value.
As alternatives, some holders of loan funds may turn to investment grade, Treasury or mortgage bonds. Ten-year Treasury bonds boast an 8.8 percent total return this year, with investment grade and mortgage bonds returning 6.5 percent and 7.4 percent, respectively.

HEADLINE: Babes in the Woods: Putting 5 'Cute Utes' to the Test

 BODY:
SMALL sport utility vehicles are grabbing an ever-bigger chunk of the car market, and the hottest ones are cars at heart. They are designed like cars, with one-piece unit bodies, instead of like trucks, with separate bodies bolted to rugged frames. And they meld some car characteristics -- comfortable cabins, relatively responsive handling, compliant rides, reasonable fuel economy -- with the traits that have had people lining up for S.U.V.'s: good outward visibility, a "commanding" driving position, flexible cargo space and the bad-weather security of all-wheel drive.
At prices in the low $20,000 range, these perky S.U.V.'s -- "cute utes," in industry parlance -- are bargains compared with luxurious crossover vehicles like the $36,000 Lexus RX 300 and the $50,000 BMW X5. 
 The first of these was the Toyota RAV4 of 1996, followed by the Honda CR-V. Their success inspired a challenge from Subaru, which essentially gave its Impreza wagon a boxy body and a new name, the Forester.
For 2001, Toyota has brought out a redesigned RAV4 that is slightly larger and more powerful. The Forester has received a mild facelift. And new competition has arrived with the Ford Escape. (Mazda has a similar model, the Tribute.) Hyundai is testing the waters with its first sport utility, the Santa Fe.
In this new landscape, who is king of the hill? Three auto writers and a professional driver sought an answer as they took five vehicles into fender-to-fender combat in the woods of northern New Hampshire. Participating were James G. Cobb, the editor of this page; Cheryl Jensen, a freelance auto writer; Chris Jensen, auto editor of The Plain Dealer in Cleveland; and Tim O'Neil, a former professional rally driver who owns the Team O'Neil Car Control and Rally School near Franconia, N.H.
The test vehicles were a Ford Escape XLT; a Honda CR-V EX, a Hyundai Santa Fe LX, a Subaru Forester S and a Toyota RAV4 L. All had some form of automatic all-wheel drive. (The more rudimentary four-wheel-drive systems of truckish S.U.V.'s can generally be used only on loose surfaces or in snow or rain.)
There are a number of small truck-based utilities, too -- the Nissan Xterra, Kia Sportage, Suzuki Grand Vitara and Chevy Tracker -- but they were not invited to the party. These vehicles tend to be more capable off road but less polished in day-to-day use on pavement.
Also left out were two new vehicles that share some crossover characteristics -- the Chrysler PT Cruiser and Pontiac Aztek -- partly because they are not yet available with all-wheel drive. In any case, they feel more like minivans and cars than like S.U.V.'s.
The testing included identical drives in various conditions, including a moderately challenging off-road trail with stretches of mud (and a large black bear); a 20-mile loop on a variety of road surfaces and terrains; and slalom, braking and emergency-maneuver exercises at the O'Neil School. The vehicles were also scrutinized for their features, their comfort and their utility.
After two days of testing, a consensus was evident. All four participants voted the Escape best in class, based in large part on its prowess in every type of driving. The RAV4 was everyone's choice for second place, by varying margins.
Last place went, by acclamation, to the CR-V. The small Honda is the runaway leader in sales, but its design is the most dated. (The tested Honda was a 2000 model, though 2001's are virtually the same; a new version is due next year.) Also, the CR-V was the least-expensive test vehicle, about $5,000 less than the RAV4.
That left the Hyundai and Subaru to vie for third and fourth. The test drivers agreed that the Santa Fe was a surprisingly strong contender, marred mainly by a few cheap notes, including thin, low-rent carpeting.
The Forester seemed out of its element; despite its appearance and competence, its automobile genes were obvious, and it seemed the least convincing as an S.U.V.
What follows are the rankings of two participants.

Homeowners' Revenge: Selling Power to the Utility

BYLINE: By AMY ZIPKIN

 BODY:
WHILE some of his neighbors are concerned about rising energy prices, Thomas Hood sits comfortably in his 1820 home in Westhampton on Long Island, watching his utility meter move backward even as colder weather sets in.
Mr. Hood, 44, a software salesman and a self-described science enthusiast and environmentalist, figures that he has saved, on average, $200 a month on utility bills after installing an elaborate and pricey solar energy system. It not only powers his five-bedroom colonial-style home but sometimes generates an energy surplus that he sells to the Long Island Power Authority. 
 On the roof over the original part of the house is a solar system that heats the hot water, basement slab and swimming pool. On the roof of an addition to the home are the shingles containing photovoltaic cells that convert sunlight into electricity. Wires on the second roof under the shingles connect to an inverter that converts direct current to the alternating current used inside the home. "I'm a mini-utility," said Mr. Hood, whose home was the first to be connected to the power grid of the Long Island Power Authority. Thirty-three other residential customers are also connected.
As oil and natural-gas prices have risen, and as the deregulation of the utility industry brings uncertainty about future electric rates, an increasing number of homeowners are investigating alternative energy sources. A few, like Mr. Hood, have decided to generate and sell their own power -- a process known as net metering.
Theoretically, a home equipped with a photovoltaic system could eliminate electricity bills altogether. With the proper equipment installed, the power accumulated by photovoltaic cells during sunny summer days can even be stored until needed on less-radiant winter days. Excess energy fed back into the utility's power grid spins an electric meter backward.
The Solar Electric Power Association in Washington estimates that about 2,000 homes are now involved in net-metering programs nationwide, and it says shipments of photovoltaic cells have doubled in the last three years. Right now, 30 states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, have laws that require utilities to offer net metering to their customers.
Utilities and manufacturers report a slow but steady increase in interest in the programs. The Sacramento Municipal Utility District said it had 300 net-metering customers, and since April 1999, about 100 more customers have installed solar systems. AstroPower, a manufacturer of photovoltaic cells in Newark, Del., recently began test marketing residential solar systems in the Hudson Valley of New York. And Commonwealth Edison of Illinois says it has received hundreds of inquiries since last June, when it began offering a statewide program that pays customers for generating their own power.
"The vast majority of Americans don't know that the same solar cells that power their calculators can also power their homes," said Thomas J. Starrs, who runs Kelso, Starrs & Associates, a renewable-energy consultant on Vashon Island, Wash.
An exception is Stelle, Ill., a community north of Springfield in the central part of the state; one-third of its homes have solar systems. For now, though, only the home of Steven Bell, 48, a former fireman who now works as a solar technical consultant, is connected to the local utility, Commonwealth Edison.
Mr. Bell has solar panels on his roof and on a motorized track in his backyard that power a refrigerator, two freezers and a stereo, among other appliances, in his three-bedroom country-style home. He also has a battery-operated backup system to ensure against power failures and winter ice storms. Mr. Bell said he saves about $175 a year in energy costs, an amount that he acknowledges is small. But he added that money was not his primary motivation. "I'm carrying my energy burden on the planet," he said.
Small financial gains are common for solar-energy installers and net-metering participants, largely because the systems are still fairly expensive. Mr. Bell estimates that he spent $40,000 on his renewable-energy system over the last six years. Mr. Hood paid $20,000 for the photovoltaic roof and $4,000 for the solar hot water system, which were installed over the last two years. To offset his expenses, he received an $8,700 cash rebate from the Long Island Power Authority and a $3,750 tax credit from the state. Mr. Bell received a grant of $11,000 from his state's renewable-energy resources program.
The possible savings from solar systems are related to prevailing energy costs in a particular region. People who build homes in remote areas, for example, are likely to obtain substantial savings by installing their own solar-energy systems rather than paying utilities to extend power lines to their homes. The same may hold true for those living in parts of the Northeast, where energy costs are higher than in other areas. "If you're in a low-cost area of the country, the economics don't work as well as if you're in a high-cost area," said Dan W. Reicher, assistant secretary of energy.
NOT all utility companies and states are embracing net metering. Rolland Skinner, general manager of the Northwest Public Power District in Nebraska, which has no net-metering law, said renewable-energy programs amounted to a subsidy for certain customers and should include caps on payments from utilities. Otherwise, he said, a utility may have to charge its conventional customers more.
For all its environmental appeal, hooking up to the utility grid can be time-consuming. The Department of Energy found in a recent report that 25 percent of the 65 net-metering projects it surveyed had experienced delays of more than four months in hooking up with local utilities.
Jonathan Sawyer, 45, who runs a wireless communications company in Boulder, Colo., knows about such roadblocks. When he built his four-bedroom house in 1995, he investigated net metering and found his utility, the Public Service Company of Colorado, did not offer it. Instead, he said, the utility sent him a 50-page interconnection agreement about the procedures he needed to follow to become a power supplier. He gave up on the idea until two years ago, when the company initiated a net-metering program and referred him to Altair Energy in Golden, Colo. He paid the company to install $100,000 worth of photovoltaic equipment.
The program had its glitches. During the first month, the new analog meter was read incorrectly by utility workers and recorded that Mr. Sawyer owed $7,000, when he really owed less than $5. And, he said, he has yet to receive a $154 credit due for the extra 1,927 kilowatts his solar system produced over the last two years. Public Service of Colorado has acknowledged the problems and said it would soon send Mr. Sawyer a $154 check.
Despite those troubles, Mr. Sawyer said he had no regrets. "There's no good economic payback for doing it," he said. "But the country would be a lot better off if keeping up with the Joneses was who had the best solar system, instead of who had the larger car."

Teachers' Fund Happily Learns a New Math, Plus Tax

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

 BODY:
AT first glance, the genteel pension-fund giant with the monstrously ungainly name seems to have lost ground to upstart rivals.
For decades, when new faculty members arrived at colleges and universities, their only choice for a retirement plan was this venerable colossus, formally called the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association-College Retirement Equities Fund. But this fall, when Villanova University hired about 100 faculty and staff members, the group, known as TIAA-CREF or just as the Teachers, lagged behind the Vanguard Group in signing them up. 
 "At least 6 out of 10 used Vanguard as their only plan or split with TIAA-CREF," said James S. Kane Jr., the university's associate director of human resources. "Ten years ago, 8 out of 10 would probably go only to TIAA-CREF."
John H. Biggs, chief executive of the Teachers, a nonprofit company, acknowledged in an interview the loss of market share to profit-seeking competitors. "It's a big concern," Mr. Biggs said. "A lot of schools are now offering options."
But hold the pity. Despite the competition and the loss of its tax exemption, the huge and still somewhat paternalistic company thrives as perhaps never before, in part because it is now a full-fledged taxpayer. As such, it is emancipated from limitations that had prevented it from doing business with anyone but its traditional clientele -- faculty members and administrators at private colleges and universities.
Suddenly, in 1997, individual retirement accounts could be offered directly to faculty and staff members instead of through the institutions. And the public could be solicited for various new products: Mutual funds. Tuition savings plans. Life insurance. A trust company that offers estate planning and other advice.
In short, the Teachers, one of America's half-dozen biggest investors -- and undoubtedly the biggest that most Americans have never heard of -- has largely reinvented itself.
That reinvention was spurred in large part by the government's decision in 1997 to strip it of its tax-exempt status on annuities, its main business, which it had enjoyed since it was founded in 1918 to offer fixed annuities to educators. It was started with a $10 million donation by Andrew Carnegie, who on becoming a trustee at Cornell University was appalled at the lack of provisions for academic retirement.
The CREF element, founded in 1952 in the face of objections that it would be too risky to link retirement income to the stock market -- a contention repeated this campaign season in connection with Social Security -- is now considerably larger than its older sister. CREF has a constituency of 2.2 million college faculty and staff members.
Speaking of his failed lobbying campaign to preserve the tax exemption, Mr. Biggs said: "We fought it pretty hard. I was deeply disappointed when we lost the battle."
STILL, this low-key organization, which manages more than $300 billion from its Third Avenue headquarters in Midtown Manhattan, has revived itself while holding tightly to its nonprofit status, its obsession with low costs, its insistence on a shareholder-friendly attitude at companies in which it invests, and its focus on its academic clientele.
"The word 'customer' is beginning to creep into our language," acknowledged Mr. Biggs, 64, whose combined salary and bonus nearly doubled, to $3.7 million, between 1997 and 1999.
The CREF stock account, the world's biggest pool of equity managed as one entity, and other Teachers' money matches the combined assets of the next two big pension organizations, the California Public Employees Retirement System, known as Calpers, and the New York State Common Retirement Fund.
TIAA-CREF's total revenue jumped 21 percent in 1999, to $11.3 billion, a gain that reflects new inflows rather than a market-driven increase in assets.
And more new horizons beckon, including teachers in elementary and high schools, a group far more difficult to reach because of the entrenchment of state retirement plans. Already the Teachers has staked out a big lead in state plans for college savings.
Why did the Teachers lobby hard to keep a tax exemption that kept it shackled? The reason, its officials said, was simply to protect its annuity holders from tax liability, even at the cost of denying them the expanded product line many of them wanted. As it happened, said James A. Wolf, executive vice president for retirement services, "we were surprised" at how much taxes could be deferred and minimized.
But there was serious grumbling on campus about stodgy management and poor investment performance. "They took a lot of grief here," said Charles Paul, director of total compensation at Yale University.
Olivia S. Mitchell, a professor of insurance and risk management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and executive director of its Pension Research Council, said: "There was a fair amount of agitation in the university community to add more funds and to add more flexibility across funds. TIAA took awhile to adjust to that."
Now the complaints have largely subsided and market share has ticked up. Teachers now boasts of superior returns on its assets, overall about two-thirds in stocks and a third in fixed-income securities. All six of its mutual funds that are at least three years old -- the minimum to qualify for ratings from Morningstar Inc. -- have earned at least four stars out of five.
The performance of the public funds has been excellent, with the biggest, the Growth Equity fund, having an average annual return of 24.9 percent since inception. "They're consistently in the top quartile," said William Dougherty, president of Kanon Bloch Carre, a Boston investment adviser and manager. "It's a great service for the everyday investor to have these available. You're buying into one of the best institutional growth money managers in the country."
However, the 11 funds -- five were added last spring -- have attracted a relatively modest $3 billion, less than Mr. Dougherty had expected and a long way from realizing Mr. Biggs's prediction that the Teachers would be among the nation's top 10 fund companies by 2010.
The doubters include Burton J. Greenwald, a fund consultant in Philadelphia. "They have no marketing effort to speak of," he said, because of the emphasis on minimal costs.
Many potential customers, in fact, have gone to Vanguard, one of the biggest fund groups and one that is greatly admired by Mr. Biggs and his colleagues for its commitment to indexing and to low-cost operation. Mr. Biggs said that he and John C. Bogle, Vanguard's founder, are the two halves of a "mutual admiration society." Mr. Bogle is the fund industry's scourge because, among other things, he has called attention to what he considers unconscionably high fees.
"He says we have great variable annuities, and I say he's got great mutual funds," Mr. Biggs added. "He has said we're his only competition, and I would say that about him." Mr. Bogle confirmed this characterization.
Mr. Biggs also praises Martin L. Leibowitz, the Teachers' vice chairman and chief investment officer, whose recruitment he considers "the greatest coup of my business career." That career has included 19 years at the General American Insurance Company, a vice chancellorship at Washington University in St. Louis and a stint as chief executive of Centerre Trust, in St. Louis.
DESPITE what some critics have called stodginess, TIAA-CREF has proved highly innovative over the years. It created the variable annuity with the CREF stock account in 1952, the first inflation-linked bond for pension funds in 1997 and a real estate investment trust that directly owns and manages properties in 1995.
And, most important, TIAA-CREF was a pioneer of indexing, which it has combined with active management in a way that Mr. Leibowitz calls "certainly very rare if not unique" in the investment business.
To a degree almost unknown elsewhere, he said, the two approaches -- replicating benchmarks and selecting stocks with help from powerful computers seeking anomalies -- enjoy equal standing, a structure he said had produced "the big difference" in outperforming rivals.
Yet it seems unlikely that the Teachers will allow its increased exposure to outsiders to infect its culture; it wants to avoid the vulgar side of commerce -- separating people from their money rather than meeting their needs.
Mr. Biggs, who described himself as an "old-fashioned Democrat, liberal, populist, whatever," rules out any notion of the Teachers' becoming a publicly held company or buying another company.
"We would never do an acquisition," he said. "We're not going to do cross-marketing where you bring together a whole bunch of life insurance agents and a whole bunch of banks and expect the agents to sell credit cards and the bankers to sell life insurance policies. That's a concept that's as dumb as the old conglomerates in the 60's and 70's."

Putting Worries in Perspective

BYLINE: By Alex Berenson

 BODY:
Investors got a little worried about the presidential election and a lot worried about an apparent slowdown in information technology spending, sending stocks to one of their worst weeks since their April meltdown.
By the close of trading Friday, the technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index stood at 3,028.99, off 12.2 percent for the week and 25.6 percent for the year. Unless the Nasdaq rallies soon, this year is likely to be its worst since 1974, when an oil shock put the American economy in recession and sent the Nasdaq, then just 3 years old, down 35 percent. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed Friday at 10,602.95, a drop of 2 percent for the week. For the year, the Dow is now down 7.7 percent, putting it on pace for its first annual drop in a decade and worst performance since 1981.
The messy dispute over Tuesday's presidential vote is only part of why investors are nervous. Wall Street remains mostly confident that Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush will solve their spat peacefully, analysts say. It is much less confident that technology companies will post strong profit growth next year.
For investors, that concern is very bad news, since technology companies like Cisco Systems and EMC depend on growth to justify their high price-earnings ratios and huge market valuations.
"The bottom line really is we've got a tech wreck in the stock market that isn't necessarily over," said Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist of Deutsche Bank. Alex Berenson

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Waiting For the Other Shoe To Drop

BYLINE: By Gretchen Morgenson

 BODY:
AS the nation waits to hear exactly what the American people said when they "spoke" last Tuesday, investors' voices are coming in loud and clear. Stocks tumbled at the end of last week as the whiff of a constitutional crisis began wafting out of South Florida. The Nasdaq lost 12.2 percent of its value for the week, while the Dow Jones industrial average fell 2 percent. The Nasdaq is down 25.6 percent this year.
An election in the balance is about the last thing stock market investors want. It is bad enough that the nation's economic growth is slowing considerably and that corporate earnings have been so disappointing. Dell Computer added its name to the pile of former glamour stocks whose managers have forecast lower growth in coming months. Its shares lost 19 percent last week after the news. 
 It wasn't supposed to be this way. Many equity investors had assumed that the market's rallies in the past couple of autumns would be prologue, and had expected a year-end jump.
But those hopes were too rosy by half. As Louise Yamada, head of technical research at Salomon Smith Barney, pointed out, the stock market has rallied in the months after a presidential election only about as often as it has declined. In the 28 election cycles since 1888, she said, the overall market rose 57 percent of the time and fell 43 percent of the time from Election Day until the end of the year.
And Ms. Yamada said she believed that a sustained rally was especially unlikely this year, even before the mess in Florida started to unfold. She has suspected for months that the 18-year bull market was beginning to unwind and that investors should prepare for several years of flat returns from the Dow.
"The market was already fragile," Ms. Yamada said. "I don't think what's happening to stocks is the result of the election, but it is certainly not helping."
The question on many people's minds is how the nation's financial markets will respond to an escalation of what is already an ugly political brawl. The vow of the Al Gore camp to fight the Florida results in court was very unnerving.
"I'm amazed the markets have handled it as well as they have," said Charles A. Gabriel, senior political strategist at Prudential Securities in Washington, on Friday. "Now we have to go through a weekend news cycle that will be very painful, with the threat of insurrection and illegitimacy claims."
Another wild card is how foreign investors will view the interparty bickering. The Securities Industry Association estimates that foreign investors' net buys of United States stocks could exceed $194 billion this year, up from $107.5 billion last year. That the overall market has fallen in spite of such buying shows how vulnerable stock prices are to falling foreign demand.
The final presidential vote count, including absentee ballots, will not be concluded until Friday. That leaves an awful lot of time for warfare between the Democratic and Republican camps to get even nastier. If it does, stocks will probably experience further gyrations.
Richard Sylla, professor of financial history at New York University's Stern School of Business, said he believes that neither candidate wants to do anything that will damage the country. And if the count goes to George W. Bush, he thinks that Mr. Gore will be gracious. "The longer Mr. Gore has his people out questioning the results of the election, the more damaging it is to his own political future," he said.
Mr. Gabriel thinks that investors may hold the key to what ultimately happens in election 2000. "If the market ever gets to the point where it feels it needs to have a tantrum to send a signal to the two parties to end this, that's when you will come to a conclusion," he said. "American politicians today are very, very cognizant that 48 percent of American households own stocks."
He added, "What an incredible election cycle this would end up being if investors have to cast the final vote."

Downhill From Here?

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
So the election is still in doubt. As of Friday evening Mr. Bush led in Florida by a margin smaller than the enrollment in my Econ 102 class; I'm no constitutional scholar, but I think we should suspend judgment until those absentee ballots have come in and some of the votes have been triple-checked.
But however it comes out, how will economic policy fare? The answer, I'm afraid, is badly. 
 Broadly speaking, the next administration, whatever it is, will face two big economic tests. One -- the one that was the center of the campaign -- is whether it can stick to a fiscal policy, including a policy toward Social Security, that prepares this country for the demographic deluge. The other is whether it can deal adequately with the risk of economic instability, both here and, especially, abroad. Unfortunately, whoever wins we are likely to botch one or both tests.
In the last few years we actually started to have an almost responsible fiscal policy; but it was mainly an accident, the result both of an unexpected surge in revenues and of a deadlock that prevented either party from dissipating those revenues. If Mr. Gore ends up being declared president, that deadlock will continue, with an added dose of vituperation; so I guess you could say that that's a good thing.
Many commentators have been suggesting that if it's Mr. Bush, our fiscal policy will be almost equally tight -- that the moral ambiguity of Mr. Bush's victory, together with the narrowness of his party's hold on Congress, would deter him from implementing the budget-busting proposals he made during the campaign. I'm not so sure. Suppose that what we all fear turns out to be true -- that a Bush presidency is really a Trent Lott regency. Wouldn't the hard-line conservatives who run Congress try to rush through as much as possible -- tax cuts, a diversion of Social Security taxes into private accounts, whatever they can pass -- just in case they lost control of the legislature in 2002? Congress managed to run through about $900 billion of the surplus in the three months or so leading up to this election; think of what it might do in two years.
And then there's the other problem: economic instability.
It's amazing how quickly the terrifying financial crises of the 1990's have faded from memory. The globalization of financial markets created many new opportunities for things to go disastrously wrong, and they often did. In that unstable world the Clinton administration was willing to play firefighter, and -- in my opinion -- did a yeoman job of containing a series of blazes that could easily have engulfed much of the world. But would either candidate be willing and able to do the same?
Mr. Gore would have the will -- and, if he keeps on some of the key players from the Clinton administration, the skilled team -- to contain the fires next time. But one doubts whether he would have the room to maneuver. Congressional leaders violently opposed the Mexican rescue of 1995 -- the rescue that, again in my opinion, saved Mexican reform and made this year's remarkable democratic transition in that nation possible. Mr. Clinton was able to carry out that rescue only by exploiting a legal loophole that has since been closed. And until the next Congressional election anyway, a Gore administration would be even more hobbled.
Mr. Bush might have the room to act -- though he would have to fight his own party to do so -- but one wonders whether he would have the will. Mr. Bush's economic advisers are a mixed bag, but the inner circle seems to consist of men who have a purist opposition to government intervention in markets. My guess is that this would eventually change -- there are no atheists in foxholes, and no purist free-marketeers in banking crises -- but a lot could go wrong in the meantime.
As luck would have it, our election took place during a sunny interval when neither of our big economic problems seemed pressing. A booming economy and a soaring stock market had filled federal coffers; Asia had, sort of, recovered from its 1997-98 financial crisis. But the clouds are already gathering. I expect to see those projected surpluses dwindle rapidly over the next year or so. And by a number of indicators the global financial picture is deteriorating again.
So fix this year in your memory; you may not see one as good for quite a while.

With Capital In Gridlock, It's Back To the Lab

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
AS the lawyers fulminate and election returns remain in limbo, the one sure winner is President-elect Pyrrhus. In case you forgot, this King of Epirus beat the Romans in 279 B.C., but at a huge cost.
Whoever staggers away with a Pyrrhic victory in the current contest is likely to be wounded and weak. Since the presidential race was effectively fought to a draw and the Republican majorities in both houses of Congress have shrunk, incremental change is probably the most that a Bush or a Gore administration can shoot for in the next two years. That suits industries like the big drug companies, which fear tougher regulation or health care plans that would limit costs. 
 Jami Rubin, a pharmaceutical industry analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, took time last week to talk about the election and the outlook for Big Pharma. Following are excerpts from the conversation.
 
Q. Of the two candidates, Vice President Al Gore used some of his harshest rhetoric on the drug companies. As a candidate in 1992, President Clinton did the same thing. How much bite do you think there is to the vice president's bark?
 
A. It's true that the rhetoric in 1992 led to nothing. But the thing the drug companies feared from Gore was price controls. He never explicitly mentioned them, but there was the threat that by giving a drug benefit to the entire population, that would inevitably lead to price controls. That is why the industry couldn't embrace what Gore was talking about.
 
Q. Gov. George W. Bush wants to make some changes in Medicare as well. But his proposals aren't as far-reaching, right?
 
A. His Medicare reform proposal was very similar to the Breaux-Thomas proposal, which is a model the industry supports, because it will lead to increased volumes of prescription drugs. Initially, as a stopgap, he also proposed state-funded coverage for the low-income elderly. The industry wasn't terribly supportive.
 
Q. We still don't know who the next president will be. But can you make some predictions about what Washington will do about medical coverage?
 
A. There will be a Medicare drug benefit, but it will have to have features of bipartisanship. It is too big an issue to go away. But it will be a watered-down version. And, potentially, nothing will get done.
 
Q. So, absent major intervention by the government, isn't developing new drugs the major challenge facing these companies?
 
A. There is never enough product. And over the next five years, a lot of highly prescribed drugs go off patent, like Prozac, the anti-depression drug, and Mevacor, which treats cholesterol. Many of these drugs will be available in much cheaper form very soon.
Drug pipelines usually come in waves. There was a huge wave between 1995 and 1998, then a slowdown. There will be a little bit more visibility over the next two years.
 
Q. So which companies have good drug pipelines now?
 
A. Pfizer has a good pipeline, and Schering-Plough has a terrific pipeline. Merck, which is experiencing a number of patent expirations and faces more competition from generic drugs than anyone else, is managing the risk better than anyone thought. In fact, we could go through a period where a number of these companies that are facing patent expirations will perform better than expected.
 
Q. In addition to their own research and development, drug companies have been adding new products by buying or merging with other companies. But we haven't seen these giants buying up biotechnology concerns. Why?
 
A. The biotech companies are all very expensive. A number of big pharmaceutical companies have struck deals with them, and many are benefiting from their technology. American Home Products, for example, has struck a deal with Immunex to co-promote Enbrel, a rheumatoid arthritis drug. As long as biotech valuations remain very high, these companies will not try and make acquisitions. But they will do deals.
Similarly, although we have seen a lot of consolidation among drug companies, and are likely to see more deals over time, in the near term these companies are looking to co-promote drugs, to do joint ventures. Merck and Schering-Plough struck a very interesting deal to co-promote two products.
 
Q. As a group, the stocks have done better of late. Some of that improved performance is probably due to an easing of concern about what Washington might do. But hasn't the slowing economy heightened interest in the group as well?
 
A. The economy is slowing, and drug stocks have been great defensive stocks this year. Investors are willing to pay a higher premium for good growth stocks. And the group is trading at a multiple of 30 times earnings. That is at the higher end of its historical range; it has been higher.

To the Editor:
Re "Mission District Fights Case of Dot-Com Fever" (news article, Nov. 5):
Many of the people I've talked to in San Francisco bemoan the exodus of musicians and artists now leaving in droves because of the high cost of living. In the end, San Francisco will be little more than a tourist mecca. 
 Sadly, the same thing is happening here. Gentrification and exploding real estate values are undermining the cultural scene. Artists, small businesses, tenants and arts organizations are threatened and being forced to move out of Manhattan, and even out of the bustling neighborhoods of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and Long Island City, Queens.
It's time for public policies and initiatives to govern and plan sustainable housing and economic development. The costs of unfettered real estate expansion to our cultural and social life are too great without them.

HEADLINE: Pay Ball! Baseball's New Season

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
YOU probably believe that Hank Aaron hit more home runs than any other player in major-league baseball history. You might also be under the impression that Aaron holds the record for runs batted in and that Detroit's Ty Cobb scored more runs than any other player.
Wrong, wrong, wrong. 
 A young man from Miami named Alex Rodriguez holds those records. He has hit 778 home runs, batted in 2,432 runs and scored 2,573 runs.
Well, O.K., Rodriguez hasn't done all that yet, but judging from a 70-page briefing book that his agent recently gave to baseball executives, it is simply a matter of time. The agent, Scott Boras, compiled the book as his opening gambit in the bidding war that officially began yesterday for Rodriguez's services.
In seeking the first-ever $20 million annual contract for Rodriguez -- a shortstop for the Seattle Mariners last season -- Boras projected that over the next 15 years his client would surpass Aaron and Cobb and nearly equal the record of 4,256 hits held by Pete Rose.
"Alex Rodriguez is the best shortstop in Major League Baseball history at age 24," the book begins. Never mind that some people wonder whether Rodriguez is even the best shortstop in his own league today, given the presence of Nomar Garciaparra of the Red Sox and Derek Jeter of the Yankees, said Seymour Siwoff, the president of the Elias Sports Bureau.
Boras' boasting was only the latest example of baseball rhetoric having run amok in the last few years. One could hardly watch a game on television this season without hearing an announcer say that one player or another was one of the all-time great sluggers. Commentators called Mark McGwire the best power hitter in history. Or they favorably compared the statistics of players whom most people have never heard of -- like Troy Glaus of the Anaheim Angels or Todd Helton of the Colorado Rockies -- to members of the Hall of Fame.
The chief culprit is an offensive explosion that has changed baseball over the last decade. Today, ballparks are smaller than before, hitters are stronger, the strike zone is smaller and some say that balls are wound more tightly. Certainly, they are flying a lot further. Since 1992, the number of home runs per game has increased about 50 percent, and the number of runs is up two per game, or 25 percent. All this constitutes the sports equivalent of runaway inflation, and it has made one of baseball fans' favorite activities -- comparing players across eras increasingly difficult.
Hitting 30 home runs in a season, as Rodriguez has for four of the past five years, was once a sign that a player could be headed for the Hall of Fame. But in 2000 alone, 47 hitters reached that mark. Surely all of them are not Hall of Famers.
Carl N. Morris, chairman of the statistics department at Harvard and a baseball fan, suggests an analogy. "What if you hit .280 in the majors, and I batted .330 in the minors?" he asked. "I could say I'm a better hitter." That argument, Professor Morris said, is an extreme version of the comparisons being made today.
To avoid the problem, a government meteorologist in Washington named Clay Davenport has devised baseball's answer to the consumer price index. Among amateur baseball statisticians, a numerous and dedicated bunch, the formula has become known as the Davenport Translation. It puts players' performances in the context of league averages during their career, allowing for meaningful comparisons across eras.
The translations -- on the Internet at www.BaseballProspectus.com -- show that Rodriguez is indeed a terrific ballplayer but that an average season of his still falls well short of one by Aaron, Cobb, Mickey Mantle, Mike Schmidt, Honus Wagner (another shortstop) and a number of other retired stars.
That raises the question: What would those old players be earning today?
In the first decades of the 20th century, the best players made the equivalent of between $100,000 and $200,000. Then came Babe Ruth, who attracted fans to a stadium like no one before him. By the time the Depression arrived, Ruth was making $800,000 in today's dollars, allegedly prompting him to say he deserved to make more than the president of the United States because he had had a better year.
Lacking a union or any negotiating power, players would not again reach that level of pay until the 1970's, when salaries soared, said Doug Pappas, who keeps a salary database for the Society for American Baseball Research. Largely because of free agency, average salaries then tripled between 1984 and 1992 and have doubled again since 1992.
Still, even if the old legends could take advantage of recent developments, they probably would not be earning more than today's stars, analysts say. The economics of the game dictate the pay scale. So even if Aaron was posting numbers that were about 10 percent better than Rodriguez's, as the historical translations suggest he would, Aaron might simply displace Rodriguez as the game's highest paid player.
Perhaps the one exception is Ruth. His accomplishments were so remarkable -- hitting 60 home runs in a season, for example, when few other players hit more than 10 -- that he might reset the scale today. At a time when both home runs and hyperbole are mammoth, just imagine what his agent would be saying.

Vietnam's Youth Stage A Gentler Revolution

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

DATELINE: HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam

 BODY:
CAREFREE, war-free, with multicolored sparkles in their hair, Vietnam's young people are leading a revolution in Vietnam today, and it's not a Communist one.
It is a revolution of creeping globalization, and as in Communist lore, there is a small but very influential group of the young in the vanguard. When President Clinton goes to Vietnam this week -- the first American president to visit since the end of the war 25 years ago -- he will have a chance to encounter a new postwar generation that is open, curious, acquisitive and hungry to join the outside world, if the youth one meets in the cities and at the universities are any indication. 
 "We like freedom," said Ta Thi Minh Hong, 19, a first-year student at the Institute of International Relations, expressing what seems to be a newly discovered idea. "We want to do everything we like."
At least, it's fun to talk like that. The idea of freedom is itself an experiment and it is still being defined here, by people of all ages.
In a dozen interviews here and in the capital, Hanoi, young people made it clear that they agree with their elders that traditional Vietnamese values are paramount, that willy-nilly change is dangerous.
The freedom that attracts them seems a purely personal one, focusing on behavior and consumer goods. Like youth culture in other countries, it seems notably apolitical. And indeed, the cautious youth revolution of Vietnam may fit very well into the new, open marketplace that is being permitted, step by step, by the Communist government.
"I'm really impressed by the way young people live in America," said Nguyen Cong Huy, 19, a high school student who dreams of studying engineering in America. "For example -- I don't want to talk politics -- but the way young people live, they're free to live on their own, to have the relationships that they choose, sexual freedom. But actually, there should be limits. When you have too much freedom it can lead to problems."
With that kind of worldview emerging, where better to seek cultural wisdom than at a market research company? And indeed, the Vietnam office of the ACNielsen company has an insight to offer.
"This is the first generation in Vietnam to experience a true youth culture, with shared values, identity, symbols and language," said Gordon Milne, an ACNielsen executive who has collated interviews with hundreds of young people. "In the past," he said, "you as a teenager were basically a young old person. Same beliefs. Same values. Now we are seeing a set of young people whose expectations, lifestyle and behavior are more and more different from their parents."
Advertisers beware, he said. The young are becoming savvy consumers. It is no longer enough simply to offer a foreign product. They want quality. They want brand names. They want whatever it is that young people want in other countries.
But they are still learning. Compared with other Asian nations, Mr. Milne said, "we are talking about 20 to 25 years difference in terms of youth culture."
And they are still hesitant. The youth revolution in Vietnam remains a modest and polite one.
One young rebel is notable in his crowd for wearing a nose ring. But it's a clip-on ring and he takes it off when he goes home. After all, he wouldn't want to offend his parents.
Clearly, it is still easier to be a parent in Vietnam than in many a country. But perhaps it takes a bit more work these days than it used to. "My friends quarrel with their parents because they're different from their parents in every way," said Miss Hong, the student. "But parents understand so much about life. Their advice is useful for me to be a good person. If I think my parents are not right, or they don't understand me, I talk out my ideas and we discuss it."
Even that represents a leap forward. In the past, when it came to morals and manners, parents ruled. Now there is MTV (though a tame version, vetted by the government), the Internet (though still expensive and limited), pirated foreign movies and, for the privileged, satellite television, travel and a foreign education.
Not long ago, everything Korean was cool -- fashion, makeup, music. But this is a youth culture; nothing lasts long.
"It doesn't matter, we can change quickly," said Nguyen My Nhung, 22, an auditor for a foreign company, raising her voice over the music at Hanoi's loudest discotheque, the New Century. "We have Internet access, satellite TV, fashion shows. We can try anything."
Like others with the money to go to a disco (many of them the children of the Communist elite) she was defensive about her privilege, asserting her solidarity with the great majority of Vietnamese who are poor.
MR. MILNE at ACNielsen acknowledged that his analyses are based on a tiny slice of society. "None of this extends to the guys working in the fields," he said. "Their lives have not changed significantly, unfortunately." But that does not mean that the ideas now percolating in the cities won't spread to the countryside. Indeed, a basic fact of life today is that most Vietnamese, whether rural or urban, were born after the war, and are the first for many generations to be raised in a time of peace (although it is also a time of poverty).
And yet Vietnam's history of war and the creation of an independent nation after its long colonization by the French are part of the fabric of life here. Even the bold talk of teenagers is cast in terms of the war.
"In the past they thought independence was the most important thing to focus on," Miss Hong said. "Now people in my generation don't care so much about it. We focus on music, fashion, making friends and going on picnics. My parents and their friends grew up in war, so they couldn't pay more attention to music or other habits, although they liked them. Now we're at peace, and if we want to we can learn about all fields in life."
Perhaps more than their counterparts abroad -- given the sacrifices they are constantly being told their parents made -- a number of those interviewed were sensitive about accusations that they are a Vietnamese version of a Me Generation.
"That's not true," said Nguyen Thanh Ha, 22, a graduate of National Economics University in Hanoi. "It's just the surface. You must look deeper inside."
"We are hard-working," she continued. "We want to improve our own lives first before asking others to do that for us." And she added: "You don't need a strike or a demonstration. Why should we spend our time demonstrating for democracy when we have so much more to worry about?"

HEADLINE: Can Black Gold Ever Flow Green?

BYLINE: By NEELA BANERJEE

DATELINE: ARCTIC VILLAGE, Alaska

 BODY:
AS ridged as crocodile skin, the marshy coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge stretches 110 miles from the Canning River in the west to Alaska's border with Canada in the east. Over a few weeks in the early Arctic autumn, the mottled green length of the plain deepens to the color of coffee grounds and rust, a dark vein between the slate Beaufort Sea and the frayed northern edge of the Brooks mountain range.
The fate of this hushed span of tundra, like many other matters, may hang on the outcome of the presidential election. If Gov. George W. Bush of Texas is the new president, this plain and the oil deposits it covers may become an unlikely proving ground for the kind of company BP Amoco is and what it aspires to be: an oil company that is also a protector of the environment. 
From its base in London, BP Amoco, the world's third-largest oil company and arguably the most powerful player in Alaskan oil, has broken ranks with most of the petroleum industry and worked to build a reputation as an environmental pioneer, while continuing to promote oil development. Over the last three years, it has acknowledged the danger of global warming and embraced alternative fuels. To foster this image, BP Amoco unveiled a sunburst logo and a new motto: Beyond Petroleum.
So far, BP, which pumps slightly more than 300,000 barrels of oil a day from Alaska, has sidestepped the question of drilling on the coastal plain of the refuge, an emotional environmental issue that gained national attention during the presidential race.
Drilling proponents, including Mr. Bush, the Alaskan congressional delegation and most of the Republican Party, say the country's energy independence hinges on tapping the billions of barrels of oil that geologists suspect are below the plain's permafrost, perhaps enough to pump a million barrels a day for 20 years. For opponents of the drilling, including Vice President Al Gore, the issue is a zero-sum game: if the area is opened to development, a rare wilderness where many birds and animals bear their young would be lost.
Mr. Bush has said unequivocally that he would open the coastal plain to oil exploration and production, though he would need Congressional support to proceed. Sir John Browne, the BP chief executive, said last week that if the area was unlocked under a Republican administration, BP would be interested in new exploration opportunities there. If it bids on leases to develop fields, which is highly probable given the demands on the company to bolster production and its stock price, BP would have a chance to show what Beyond Petroleum really means.
A green oil company may seem an oxymoron, but some regulators, scientists, environmentalists and investors say they cautiously believe that the company might be trying to transform itself and an industry that has become synonymous with pollution. For the last few years, environmentalists and indigenous groups have met with BP executives and board members to try to persuade them to promise not to drill in the refuge, just as the company pledged a decade ago to stay out of Antarctica. Those who have placed some faith in BP see the Arctic Refuge, home to scarce, unique wildlife, as the crucial test of the company's environmental resolve.
The BP record so far is mixed. The company's other activities in Alaska over the last few years suggest that there is a vast geographical and philosophical gulf within the company. On one side are executives in London who preach environmentalism; on the other are engineers in Anchorage who face the pressure of oil-driven local politics and their own bottom line.
BP executives repeat a company-wide mantra of "no damage" to the environment, and its units have to meet certain environmental goals. "We have learned a lot in 30 years," said F. X. O'Keefe, the head of BP's Alaska Exploration unit. "Our record shows we can go into different areas with little to no impact."
But the company's stock price ultimately depends on how much oil it draws out of the ground and at what cost. To ensure a steady flow of oil as supplies from Alaska's North Slope decline, BP has proceeded with projects and campaigns that pose significant risks to Alaska's ecology, said many state and federal regulators, wildlife biologists, environmentalists and representatives of native peoples.
"They're trying to present a new BP, but it's business as usual," said Francis A. Grant-Suttie, who, as director of private-sector initiatives at the World Wildlife Fund, meets regularly with BP executives. "On the P.R. level, they have been successful at differentiating themselves from others, but by virtue of what they're doing on the coastal plain, you can see it's sheer rhetoric."
THIS year, the company agreed to a compliance order with the state of Alaska that prohibits it from drilling several months of the year at Northstar, the first offshore well in the North American Arctic. The state contends that BP would not be able to clean up an oil spill in the open waters off Northstar. BP was also placed under criminal probation for five years and paid $7 million in civil and criminal penalties to the federal government after fumbling a case of dumping by a contractor at another Alaska site, Endicott.
Although BP has said it is not an active party in the heated discussion about development in the refuge, it has donated tens of thousands of dollars to Arctic Power, a group lobbying to open the refuge to drilling, as well as to politicians who support such efforts, including Mr. Bush and the Republican Party.
"Being 'beyond petroleum' isn't an impossibility, but what on the ground says they are?" asked Theodore L. Rockwell Jr., who coordinates the Environmental Protection Agency's oil and gas program in Alaska.
BP built its reputation on exploration and production, first in Iran more than 90 years ago and, over the last generation, in the North Sea and Alaska. Earlier this year, when BP bought the Atlantic Richfield Company, its main rival on the North Slope, it had to sell ARCO's Alaskan fields to Phillips Petroleum in order to receive federal approval for the deal. Phillips produces somewhat more oil, but BP, on a contract basis with other oil concerns, operates most North Slope fields, making it the dominant force in Alaskan oil.
The company's makeover from a staid British energy empire to a brash maverick that embraced environmentalism is the handiwork of Sir John, the chief executive. A career company man who earned his M.B.A. in the United States and worked in Alaska in the late 1960's, Sir John, 52, has given the 154 business units within BP greater independence while demanding impressive results. He also familiarized himself with research on global warming and said three years ago that the company should take a stand on the issue, said David Rice, chief of staff for government and public affairs at BP.
Bucking industry wisdom, BP agreed with the idea that carbon dioxide emissions contribute to global warming and pledged to cut its own emissions by 10 percent by 2010. The company is among the world's largest makers of solar panels and uses solar power at many of its own facilities. It is gradually shifting the emphasis of its exploration and production from crude oil to cleaner-burning natural gas.
In a letter to employees in July, Sir John wrote that BP's values "may be manifested in different ways, but they have much in common: a respect for the individual and the diversity of mankind, a responsibility to protect the natural environment."
Shareholders take Sir John's message seriously. At the annual meeting on April, 13 percent of shareholders voted for a resolution demanding that BP terminate Northstar and stay out of the refuge, a proportion so high that it stunned company management and even those who introduced the measure.
"Maybe it is painful for BP to have this degree of scrutiny, but being held accountable will help BP improve its environmental performance over the long run," said Simon Billenness, senior analyst at Trillium Asset Management of Boston, one of the sponsors of the resolution.
The notion of drilling in the coastal plain of the refuge provokes intense debate because of what the opposing sides see at stake. Every summer, thousands of birds from as near as Washington State and as far as Antarctica alight upon the narrow strip of tundra to bear their young. About 150,000 caribou, known as the Porcupine herd, migrate almost 500 miles annually from Canada to calve on the treeless expanse.
"There are a lot of people who will never go to the refuge, but I get some peace of mind knowing that there is an area of naturalness on such a scale," said Fran Mauer, a wildlife biologist with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and an expert on the refuge. "Where else can you have such herds of caribou, so many bears, oxen roaming?"
DRILLING proponents say there are about 16 billion barrels in the refuge. But no one knows how much oil is in the coastal plain because very little exploration has been done there. One exploratory well backed by BP and Chevron was drilled years ago on land owned by indigenous peoples within the refuge. BP said the results were a proprietary secret.
Based on seismic data and information gleaned from oil wells near the refuge, the United States Geological Survey has estimated that technologically recoverable oil in the area is about 7.7 billion barrels. If the area pumped one million barrels a day, it could supply oil to the United States for two decades. In comparison, the great Prudhoe Bay field in the North Slope of Alaska, where BP staked its fortune 30 years ago, had about 9.2 billion barrels.
Whatever numbers the experts settle on, Greg Gilbert worries that they will draw oil companies into the coastal plain. A member of the 7,500-member Gwich'in Indian nation that lives scattered through the boreal forests of northwest Canada and north central Alaska, Mr. Gilbert hunts caribou to feed his family of seven. Until about 50 years ago, the Gwich'in followed the Porcupine herd in its trek. Now, they live in settlements of one-story clapboard houses heated by wood stoves and often without running water.
Arctic Village, a settlement outside the southern rim of the refuge, is home to Mr. Gilbert and about 250 other Gwich'in, most of them unemployed, who survive by hunting caribou. Every few hours during one fall day, young men rode down from a nearby ridge in their all-terrain vehicles and unloaded shanks and sides of caribou and moose into their cabins.
Bundled in a fur hat against the biting wind one afternoon, Mr. Gilbert climbed a rickety 10-foot platform on the edge of a forest of stunted birch and pine and took out binoculars to survey for caribou.
"Caribou are sensitive," Mr. Gilbert said. "The oil companies want to drill in the refuge, but the elders say the caribou will disappear. They will change their route."
He climbed down from the observation platform, and his face was tight with concern. "I think drilling will eventually happen," he said. "The oil companies have the power to do it. But I worry about the future, my kids, their kids."
Opponents of drilling say the refuge could be better protected from development if President Clinton declared the area a national monument. Congress could overturn such a designation, but there is no precedent for doing so.
BP contends that oil development would not harm caribou, pointing to the thriving herd in the North Slope. A range of independent wildlife biologists dispute BP's argument. Moreover, the coastal plain in the refuge is far smaller than the North Slope but has 10 times the caribou population, which would make it very hard for the animals to avoid oil infrastructure.
BP says it can develop oil fields on the coastal plain with what it calls "minimal" environmental impact. The acreage that its newest wells occupy, their "footprint," is much smaller than that of older wells, and pipelines are built higher to let caribou pass underneath. Often, there are no roads nearby, and workers are airlifted in.
Stray caribou roam near the Prudhoe Bay roads that rumble with trucks and pick-ups. Others graze sometimes under pipelines. One bright morning, near the Phillips Alpine field, a flock of geese lifted like a hand from the flat table of the tundra. "The drive is to do no damage to the environment," said Mr. O'Keefe of BP's Alaska Exploration unit, echoing the "no damage" theme heard so often in BP offices from London to Anchorage. "There's no conflict here. The idea runs through all levels of the company."
From the spare halls of BP's Alaska headquarters in Anchorage to the bustling company cafeteria in Deadhorse in the North Slope, green-and-yellow posters spread the new environmental gospel: "Go, Do, Think Beyond." "BP. Bold. Progressive."
BUT doubts about the company's environmental mission run deep. In London, wags say the company is Beyond Belief. In Alaska, it is said that workers on the North Slope, many of whom have weathered the harsh tundra and the industry's bad image for more than 20 years, grumble that BP looks weak for going green.
BP has made sure that its interests are protected. This year, it contributed $50,000 to Arctic Power, the pro-development lobbying group. A BP executive also serves on the board of the group. BP donates to politicians who vote regularly to open the refuge. Moreover, its donations to the Republican Party this year were $613,870 out of its total of $901,796 to political action committees and party organizations, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The company contributed $34,421 to Mr. Bush this year, compared with $4,250 to Mr. Gore.
BP's interest in the refuge reflects its need to keep Alaska output high. At its peak in 1988, the North Slope produced an average of 2.03 million barrels of oil a day. In 1999, daily output fell to about 1.08 million barrels, according to the state Department of Natural Resources.
As the Arctic Refuge issues are worked out, BP is looking for rich new reservoirs in the National Petroleum Reserve to the west of its Prudhoe Bay fields, and offshoots of its older developments. So it embarked on Northstar, a 176-million-barrel field that, in the diminishing reservoir of the North Slope, is considered a large find.
The rig sits on a square, artificial five-acre island in the ocean beyond barrier islands. Endangered bowhead whales migrate near Northstar, and within the barrier islands two types of threatened sea ducks gather by the thousands every summer before migrating south for the winter.
When the field is operating fully, 65,000 barrels of crude oil will pass to shore daily through a pipeline buried below the seabed, an engineering first. BP will start drilling this winter, and it is seeking regulatory approval for another offshore well, Liberty, farther to the east of Northstar and closer to the refuge.
To be able to drill year-round at Northstar, BP must prove to Alaskan officials that it can clean up a spill in the ice-strewn water, should work at Northstar ever go awry. Since last fall, BP has held three clean-up drills, and each time it has failed. In every attempt, the broken ice in the water wrecked or disabled the equipment designed to collect oil. During a test last month, popcorn thrown on the water as a mock spill floated past the clean-up barges, silent testimony to BP's difficulties.
As a result of the tests, Alaska has placed BP under a compliance order that prohibits the company from drilling at Northstar when the frozen ocean around it has thawed and broken, or from about May to November.
The company, Alaska officials said, claimed in its plan that it could capture oil when up to 70 percent of the sea is covered with ice. But the state resources department contended that BP had difficulty even where there were trace amounts of ice in the water, based on what its monitors had witnessed.
"When you can't clean up oil in the Arctic, should you be going in at all?" asked one federal official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Northstar's pipeline is the first to run under the seabed of the Arctic Ocean. In winter, a process called ice scouring occurs in the Arctic, as ice breaks up, smashes together and plows into the sea floor. BP has installed a thick, single-wall pipeline that the company says is buried deep enough to avoid a puncture. The Joint Pipeline Office, a state and federal committee, tested and approved the pipe.
But other federal officials, environmentalists and an independent expert on pipelines contended that a double-walled pipe would be significantly safer. The draft version of the environmental impact statement gave the BP pipeline about a one-in-four chance of failure. The final version put the odds at 2 to 5 percent.
Ibrahim Konuk, head of the Canadian research team and a consultant for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service on the environmental impact statement for Liberty, cited concerns based on a lengthy computer modeling project conducted by Canada's Geological Survey on ice scouring and pipelines. "There's a very good chance that single pipe will fail," he said.
BP and the Joint Pipeline Office say a double-walled pipe would be more complicated, and therefore harder to monitor and repair. The company said it would stick with a single-walled pipe at Liberty.
BP has excelled in one environmental area: as part of a plea agreement to settle a federal criminal case filed against the company late last year, BP has instituted a nationwide environmental monitoring program at its exploration, drilling and production units to improve oversight and reduce the chance of accidents and spills.
In 1995, a whistleblower from BP's North Slope Endicott field reported that the contractor for which he was working, Doyon Drilling, had been illegally disposing of hazardous wastes from about 1993 to 1995. Last year, the Justice Department filed the criminal suit and a civil suit against BP. The company, which pleaded guilty to one violation of federal environmental laws, was fined $500,000 in the criminal proceeding and paid $6.5 million to settle the civil suit.
FEDERAL attorneys in the criminal case against BP contended that the company knew of Doyon's activities but looked the other way -- an accusation that BP denied. In the settlement of the criminal case, BP was placed on probation for five years. The company also volunteered over that period to put into place a stringent nationwide environmental management program at a cost of about $15 million.
While praising the extra step taken by BP, a federal prosecutor recognized the challenge that the company faces. "I think folks at their highest levels are committed to environmental issues," said Deborah Smith, deputy chief of the environmental crimes section at the Justice Department. "But does that reach down to their oil rig operator and change the thinking of an oil rig worker who is from an industry that hasn't always been concerned about the environment?"

During the Confusion, a Turn Toward Treasuries

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
IN the midst of all the uncertainty about the identity of the next president, the Treasury market is the place to be.
Some investors are moving -- but not yet running -- to this traditional bond haven. Bonds barely moved on Wednesday, the first uncertain day after the election. But prices rose and yields fell on Thursday and Friday. If court challenges from the Democrats delay the outcome much longer, the uncertainty will weigh more heavily on investors, making Treasury securities more attractive as a risk-reducing investment. 
 A stock market selloff because of the uncertainty, or continuing worries about earnings, would also help bonds. That happened briefly on Thursday, when stocks sold off in response to the announcement from William M. Daley, chairman of Vice President Al Gore's campaign committee, that Mr. Gore would not concede based on the initial results of the Florida recount. As the Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 150 points, bond prices rose quickly.
William Stevens, senior portfolio manager at Montgomery Asset Management, said that for the near term, the bond market would be driven more by stocks than by the final choice of who is the president-elect.
The slowdown in economic growth, meanwhile, will continue to put downward pressure on Treasury yields, pushing their prices higher. (In this situation, corporate bonds are not a haven.) If the presidential uncertainty stretches on for several weeks, it might slow the economy a bit more, especially if the stock market falls sharply and consumers curb their spending. Richard Berner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, is already predicting that the economy will slow to a 2.25 percent growth rate in the first half of next year, less than half its recent pace.
The presidential uncertainty was a background irritant, not the prime cause of the sharp selloff in the stock market last week. But it added downward pressure.
For the week, the Nasdaq was down 12.2 percent, its third-worst week ever. It is now at its lowest point in a year. But most of that decline was because of bad news for growth in sales and earnings in the technology sector. A report on Wednesday warned of slowing demand for optical networking equipment, whose producers are among the most highly valued in the Nasdaq index. On Friday, a warning from Dell Computer of slowing sales growth set back the technology sector again. The Dow was off a more moderate 2 percent for the week.
The minimal political impact reflects, in part, the fact that the two parties, despite their differences on specific tax and spending proposals, are pretty close on overall economic policy, especially on the role of the Federal Reserve in its fight against inflation.
"Our guess is that it is not going to make a huge amount of difference," said Greg Jensen, senior research associate at Bridgewater Associates in Westport, Conn. "The policies are not going to be that different."
Since World War II, the best stock market results have come under a Republican White House and Congress, with the average annual total return for the Standard & Poor's 500 index at 22 percent, according to Bridgewater. The next-best returns -- 19 percent a year -- have come when a Democrat is president and the Republicans control Congress.
But economic growth is a different story. During the two years when Republicans held both the White House and Congress, 1953 and 1954, economic growth was an annualized 2.19 percent. The eight years of a Democratic White House and a Republican Congress, six of them under President Clinton, saw 4.08 percent growth, on average.
The sample size -- the years these combinations were in control -- is small, which leads Mr. Jensen to dismiss these results as inconclusive. Still, they say that the recent balancing of the federal budget, despite a split government, has been particularly good for the markets and the economy.

HEADLINE: In This Gilded Age, Gilded Model T's

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
AUTOMAKERS have long portrayed themselves as building cars for everyday American families. Henry Ford took pride in the spartan features of the Model T, available only in black. Alfred Sloan offered a "ladder" of models, from simple Chevrolets to elegant Cadillacs, with the slogan, "a car for every purse and purpose."
Times change. Increasingly, auto companies are setting their sights on another target. The open secret in Detroit these days is that middle-income Americans are buying a slowly but steadily shrinking share of new automobiles. The people buying the bulk of the new cars and sport utility vehicles are the nation's affluent. 
 The most prosperous 20 percent of the population accounted for 45 percent of the spending on new automobiles in 1990. Now, they account for 60 percent of the spending, according to General Motors, and a rising share, currently 40 percent, of the number of new vehicles as well. "It's probably the biggest trend ever affecting the auto industry -- we continue to shift toward higher-income, better-educated customers," said Paul Ballew, G.M.'s director of market research.
Automakers still sell roughly five million vehicles a year -- or nearly a third of all vehicles -- to households earning less than $50,000 annually, the cutoff point for the bottom three-fifths of the population in terms of income. But auto executives and economists say that figure does not tell the whole story.
These buyers are often not middle-class families, the experts say. Instead, as many as two-thirds of these buyers are young people whose more prosperous parents and grandparents help them with the purchase, or retirees who have considerable assets even though they do not have large incomes, said W. Van Bussmann, the corporate economist for the Chrysler group of DaimlerChrysler.
The change matters -- a lot. It is transforming what automakers sell. More and more vehicles in showrooms these days -- with the exception of a few tiny imports from Korea -- come loaded with expensive equipment like power-adjustable leather seats, compact-disc changers and even computer navigation systems. And because high-income families care little about gasoline prices, vehicles are also getting bigger. Subject to less-stringent federal fuel-economy standards than cars, sport utilities in particular are growing so big that they no longer fit in many garages.
WITH young, middle-income families buying fewer new cars and light trucks with their own money, the market has withered for small sedans. One, the Ford Escort, the most popular car sold in the early 1980's, has faded away without much notice; Ford replaced it last year with the taller, fancier Focus.
"If you're going to sell more vehicles, and the first-time buyers are disappearing, you've got to sell more larger, more expensive vehicles," Mr. Bussmann said.
Those larger vehicles burn plenty of gasoline. High oil prices used to devastate Detroit, yet they have had little effect this year. One reason is the strong economy. But also important is the fact that the auto industry's sales have swung toward affluent Americans, whose driving habits are not affected greatly by the cost of gasoline.
Gas prices, adjusted only for inflation, would have to be $2.55 a gallon now to match the average price when oil prices peaked in 1981. But adjusted for the increase in annual income of the top 20 percent of the population, gas prices would have to be $3.66 a gallon to have the same effect on affluent families' pocketbooks that they did in 1981.
Adjusted for the increase in income of the top 5 percent of the nation's households gas prices would have to be $4.47 now to have the same effect as in 1981. These households now buy 11 percent of new automobiles, according to J. D. Power & Associates.
Affluent Americans mean more to Detroit these days not only because they buy expensive sets of wheels, but also because they buy more of them per person. Selling third and fourth automobiles to high-income families has become one of the fastest-growth segments of the industry. Although industry sales slowed somewhat in October, they remain high by historical standards and are still expected to set another record this year. The total is expected to reach 17.5 million, up from 17 million last year.
Some less-affluent consumers, meanwhile, have had to change their expectations. They are buying used cars, which have become much more reliable. In the old days -- the 1950's, 60's and 70's -- auto companies could count on planned obsolescence to keep their sales climbing. But Japanese competition ended that lucrative game. Now some engines are designed to go without so much as a tune-up for 100,000 miles, which is eight years of driving for the typical family. So instead of buying bare-bones, midsized coupes and sedans with cloth seats and nothing but an AM radio -- a staple of the auto industry from the 1950's to the 70's -- many middle-income households are now choosing late-model used cars with lots of fancy equipment.
The rise of new-car leasing is giving used-car shoppers a much broader range from which to choose. One-fourth of all new vehicles -- including half of many models of sport utility vehicles -- are now leased. While one-third of the people who lease vehicles choose to buy them at the end of their leases, the rest return them to dealers for resale.
People who actually want just cloth seats and plain radios in cars are finding them increasingly scarce. "You give me air-conditioning and a radio, then I'm not worried about all those other amenities," said Howard Jefferson, 63, an insurance agent in Houston who has been shopping unsuccessfully for a midsized S.U.V. not stuffed with luxury equipment.
The shift to bigger vehicles with more gadgets has led to a peculiarity in government statistics: inflation in new automobile prices, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, has disappeared. Yet actual prices for new family vehicles have climbed steadily. A Dodge Intrepid sedan costs as much as $30,020 when fully loaded.
The paradox is a result of government inflation calculations that assume that people choose vehicles of the same size and with the same equipment year after year.
The government reports that new-car prices were unchanged in 1998 and then fell 0.3 percent last year. But the National Automobile Dealers Association figures that the average price that customers really paid for new automobiles, including rebates, jumped 4.2 percent in 1998 and 3.6 percent last year, to $24,450. Those increases were well ahead of the over all Consumer Price Index, which rose 1.6 percent in 1998 and 2.7 percent last year.
WALK behind the showrooms to some dealerships' service areas and another sign of the times is revealed. The well-heeled people who are buying autos today want the latest compact-disc systems, not just radios or tape decks.
Alan Helfman, a Chrysler and Jeep dealer in Houston, said his mechanics had to replace so many factory-installed car radios with fancier systems that he eventually ran out of room to store all the discarded radios. He could not even find another dealer who wanted them.
"We had to throw all those radios out," he recalled, adding that automakers had recently responded by shipping a much higher percentage of vehicles already equipped with upgraded sound systems.
Robert Casey, the curator of transportation at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Mich. (which has little interest in those radios, either), said that when Henry Ford doubled his workers' wages in early 1914, to $5 a day, he made it possible for them to buy a new Model T with about five months' pay. Today, an average-priced car costs a median-income family about six months' pay, and even more when today's higher taxes are included.
Of course, some middle-income families have always chosen used cars out of a general sense of frugality, but the practice previously carried more of a stigma. "I always thought my family was deprived because we didn't buy new cars," said Mr. Casey, who grew up in a middle-class household in the 1950's.
In those days, his friends' families bought simply equipped new cars. Now, he said, "The day of the cheap car, the Model T-type car, has passed."
The trend toward bigger, options-laden cars bought by better-heeled customers is good news for automakers and their dealers. Manufacturers lose money on small cars, with the exception of a few hits like the Volkswagen New Beetle, and make little money on bare-bones cars, because they compete to advertise the lowest price for their models in each market segment.
The costs of making and shipping big vehicles are little more than for small ones -- a few hundred dollars' worth of extra steel, aluminum and insulation, and a couple of hundred dollars more to get them to dealers because fewer can be loaded on each railroad car or truck. Design costs vary little with a vehicle's size, though they used to be higher for large models because fewer were sold.
Automakers now derive most of their profits from big sport utilities and pickup trucks because they carry much higher markups and are sold in large numbers. The higher prices are possible partly because manufacturers had consistently underestimated demand over the last 15 years, and so had inadequate supplies until the last year or so. Adding lots of options tends to be very profitable, too, because automakers mark up their price considerably over its cost. For most of the last six years, Ford, G.M. and Chrysler earned record profits -- tens of billions of dollars.
A few people in the auto industry, however, worry whether the good times can last. In most recessions during the 20th century, affluent families often continued to buy new cars while less-prosperous families tightened their belts. But these days, higher-income families are more likely to be heavily invested in stocks. That appears to have made the auto industry much more dependent on the vagaries of the stock market.
David L. Littmann, the senior economist at Comerica Bank in Detroit, said a 10 percent drop in the three-month moving average of the Wilshire 5000 stock index now produces a 14 percent drop in auto sales -- unless automakers offset the impact by offering deep discounts, as seen this year. Sales of full-size sport utility vehicles, which tend to appeal to high-income, middle-aged buyers who may be especially dependent on the stock market, have been weak in recent months.
ANOTHER concern lies in the savings rate. According to the Commerce Department, Americans drew down their savings by an amount equal to 0.1 percent of their personal incomes in September, and by 0.4 percent in August. One popular theory has been that Americans have been willing to spend more than their earnings because the long bull market in stocks has made them feel prosperous.
Many buyers with fairly high incomes appear to spend money as fast as they earn it and then borrow even more, said Michael Coy, general manager of a Cadillac and Pontiac dealership in the suburbs of Portland, Ore. He suspects that many high-income customers with limited savings will be in serious financial trouble if the economy slows or if the stock market stumbles badly.
"I've told people, 'You really shouldn't be looking at this car,' " he said. "They get so mad at you, they leave."

In Praise of a Different Market

 BODY:
Abby Joseph Cohen, the Goldman Sachs strategist, rose last Monday night to praise the wiser fiscal policies, lowered inflation, increased openness to trade and better financial disclosure that have improved the business climate. But she was speaking of a Mediterranean climate, namely Israel's. The occasion was a fund-raising dinner in New York for Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, where a cousin of hers is a senior research scientist. 
 In Israel, Ms. Cohen has given the nation's leaders lessons about America's economic success. In an interview last week, she noted increased investment flows between Israel and the United States, but stopped short of a recommendation, saying, "I am not the Goldman Sachs investment strategist for Israel."

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE nation crossed a new threshold last week: the permanent campaign became the endless election. The nightly tracking polls that showed a race too close to call turned into an election too close to call, and platoons of Democratic and Republican lawyers descended on Florida to continue the fight.
There was, unmistakably, a wave of anxiety in the political community: Had the partisan struggle gone too far? Was this the fearful coda -- think of the last scene of "Carrie," monstrous hand coming out of the grave -- to an era that has already seen unprecedented partisan struggle over judicial nominations, various and assorted investigations of speakers, presidents and cabinet officers, and ultimately the first presidential impeachment in 130 years? 
 The reassuring, healing rituals that end a presidential campaign -- concession, acceptance, transition -- were eerily stalled. In some ways, it felt familiar. Living in a near-constant state of partisan warfare has become the norm in Washington, with Democrats and Republicans as lethally and equally matched as opposing armies in World War I. The voters say they abhor it, but continue to create an uneasy equipoise in a system that works most efficiently with a majority.
Still, even to veterans of past wars, this was a singular moment: "Clearly this is as dangerous a minefield politically and governmentally as we've had in a long time," said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader.
There was another way of looking at this pass the nation has arrived at. After running campaigns this fall that were, so often, framed more by the language and techniques of marketing than ideology, both parties were hungry to finish the fight. Both parties stopped obsessing, at least for a moment, about the swing voter who is tired of partisan warfare.
Maybe this brutal post-election clash was inevitable. The two parties ran such careful tactical campaigns, muted so many of their differences, co-opted so many of each other's issues that they fought to, or bogged down in, a standstill.
Their message was exquisitely calibrated for their target audience -- prescription drugs for the elderly, education money for suburban parents -- in the middle of the middle of the battleground states. Many people who listened to Gov. George W. Bush on abortion or Vice President Al Gore on guns in the debates would never have imagined the sharp line that divides the two. That's one way of making sense of this astounding virtual tie in the presidential election. Each party consolidated its core supporters and won half the independents.
But voters can be of two minds about partisanship. Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the Democratic leader in the House, tells of a town meeting he attended a few years ago. One voter rose to complain that politicians never stood up and fought for what they believed in. Another stood up to complain that politicians should stop all the partisan squabbling in Washington.
When Mr. Gephardt noted the conflicting messages, a third voter rose and said voters wanted both: a principled stand, but "at the end of the day, we expect you to get something done." Mr. Gephardt added, "That's hard to do, when you're locked in a hard political contest."
It may be that both voters and politicians simply have to adjust to life in an achingly competitive two-party system, which has not been the norm for much of this century. The Depression-era New Deal coalition forged by Franklin Roosevelt dominated politics for decades. Medicare and the Great Society programs were passed by a Congress with extraordinary Democratic majorities, pushed by a Democratic president. By the late 1960's, though, that coalition was falling apart, opening the way for Richard Nixon and eventually Ronald Reagan, who presided over a new conservative majority, swelled by "Reagan Democrats."
BUT this election caps a decade of trench warfare by the parties. Each time one of them has proclaimed a broad governing mandate, or seemed to have achieved one, the voters have pushed back. President Clinton's attempt at a more activist government after the 1992 election, notably his attempt at national health insurance, was followed by Republican sweeps in Congress in 1994; Newt Gingrich's declaration of a Republican revolution was followed by a Clinton victory in 1996.
At this point, the parity between the two parties is extraordinary. Witness the post-election Congress, still Republican-controlled but with one of the smallest majorities of this century in the House and, at the moment, a one-seat majority in the Senate. The exit polls underscore the point: Mr. Gore carried women, Mr. Bush carried men. Mr. Gore carried the coasts, Mr. Bush most of the heartland. Mr. Gore carried blacks and Hispanics, Mr. Bush carried whites. Mr. Gore carried almost all the Democrats, Mr. Bush carried almost all the Republicans, and they split the independents.
The technology of politics -- and the immense amounts of money feeding it -- only heighten this intense competition.
Scholars say there may be no new majority coalition until a major event, like an economic downturn. "When folks feel there's nothing much at stake, that everything's going pretty well, you're probably not going to have much of a shift," said Alan Brinkley, a historian at Columbia University. Some analysts wonder whether there will ever be another truly enduring majority, like the one Roosevelt created with the New Deal. The culture is too different from the pre-television, pre-Internet, pre-suburban-sprawl days when precinct captains could reliably turn out votes and the party was an important source of identity.
Both parties can spin their scenarios. Mickey Edwards, a former Republican congressman who is now at Harvard's Kennedy School, argues that Mr. Bush's "compassionate conservatism" can go a long way toward creating a new Republican majority, particularly if the party can gradually attract more blacks and Hispanics. Representative Barney Frank believes that "showing you can combine both economic growth and equity" is the winning Democratic message.
There remains another way for the parties to break the stalemate. Politicians in both parties might try abandoning the poll-tested politics that both candidates deployed this season in favor of a more traditional definition of leadership: offering voters a vision that dares to go beyond what they think they already want.
In the meantime, there is life on the razor's edge. On Capitol Hill, Democrats like Mr. Daschle were talking about the possibility of power-sharing in the new Senate, in the allocation of committee seats and the like. Regardless of who wins the presidency, most politicians who could count were aware of two possibilities for the next few years -- coalition building across party lines, or what the voters would dismiss as "partisan squabbling."
There is not much time for bipartisanship before the pressures of the next election set in; the two-year cycle is relentless, particularly in such a competitive climate, when a kind of arms-race mentality sets in around fund-raising. And nobody is likely to feel very comfortable. Even before the winners are clear, there are already predictions that the voters will look for a midcourse correction in 2002.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW;
A Retirement Plan That Wall Street Likes

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
JUST as companies made the shift away from the fixed monthly pension to the more mercurial 401(k) plan, some politicians want to move Social Security in the same direction. During his campaign, George W. Bush offered just such a proposal, becoming the first presidential candidate to suggest so radical an alteration of the national pension system. If he takes office as president, he will surely ask Congress to act. But transforming Social Security into individual retirement accounts would condemn some older people -- perhaps tens of millions -- to smaller pensions.
Strangely, that probability has not raised an outcry. In these good times, the promise of comfortable retirement from stock market gains is too pervasive. Nor is much thought given to our longevity.
Only the wealthiest 20 percent or so of Americans can afford to live comfortably past age 90 on 401(k)-style savings. The rest of us would sink gradually toward poverty, except for that Social Security check, which rises with inflation and arrives each month no matter how long we live. 
 "We forget, or were never really taught, that Social Security is an insurance policy that redistributes a pool of retirement money from those who die early to those who live long," said Teresa Ghilarducci, an economist and pension expert at the University of Notre Dame. "I thought that Social Security, for this reason, was untouchable. But the stock market kept rising and people now believe they will get a high return forever on their private savings. There is even 'buyers' remorse,' a regret that government has not gotten them into stocks already."
Mr. Bush reflected this optimism about the market -- an optimism that Wall Street certainly encourages -- when he proposed in a campaign speech last May that the Social Security Administration finance individual accounts for workers under 50 or 55. The savings in these accounts would help to fund the monthly benefit checks of each of these younger workers when they eventually retired, greatly fattening their pensions, Mr. Bush promised.
"Right now, the real return people get from what they put into Social Security is a dismal 2 percent a year," he declared. "Over the long term, sound investments yield about a 6 percent return. Investing that 4 percent difference, over a lifetime, can show a dramatic difference."
Mr. Bush's proposal to alter the mix of Social Security benefits did not seem to sit well among many people over 65. Those who said in exit polls last Tuesday that Social Security was their most important election issue voted 3 to 2 for Al Gore. Mr. Gore has promised not to alter Social Security benefits, or to privatize any portion of them. If he wins the presidency, Congress will face the easier task of raising more funding for Social Security, unchanged. Mr. Gore would subsidize individual savings accounts set up apart from Social Security, matching with federal money a person's own savings. But as president, he could find himself pressured into proposing a partial privatization of Social Security, in effect, mimicking Mr. Bush.
The pressure would come from Wall Street, which is already lobbying for privatized Social Security accounts and the windfall they would bring to investment firms. But millions of Americans just entering the work force or in midcareer would probably join in. They seem to share Mr. Bush's faith in the stock market, his faith that the robust economy can avoid a damaging recession, his ideological preference for less government in people's lives and his skepticism that Social Security will still be solvent when they retire.
Only older people, already retired, seem to shy away from individual Social Security accounts. Perhaps they are more aware than their children that annuities bought at retirement with personal savings -- even savings that have mushroomed in the booming stock market -- do not always pay off as well as Social Security. That is particularly the case for retirees who had been low-income or middle-income workers. It is doubly so if the annuity checks have to keep coming for 20 to 30 years of retirement. People are living longer, but the extra coverage is expensive. And unlike Social Security, many annuities bought in the private sector are not adjusted upward each year for inflation.
"I have tried to explain this to a lot of audiences and they don't understand it very well," said Alan Blinder, a Princeton University economist and an adviser to Mr. Gore. "They don't understand that Social Security is a re-distributive insurance program."
Mr. Blinder is right. Mr. Bush should have been hammered during the election campaign for proposing a plan that could shortchange future pensioners. Instead, he was hammered by various economists, politicians and Mr. Gore for what they described as smoke-and-mirrors funding. Mr. Bush, they said, had already dedicated money from the budget surplus to cut taxes and finance other projects, and now he would spend many of those same dollars for Social Security. Specifically, they contended, Mr. Bush would spend $1 trillion from the surplus over the next decade to fund individual retirement accounts, although much of the $1 trillion had already been designated for other purposes.
The Bush approach grows out of a half-dozen other privatization plans put together in recent years by economists and members of Congress. Most would divert a portion of the 12.4 percent payroll tax that funds Social Security. The rechanneled money would finance individual retirement accounts. Roughly two percentage points would be diverted. But full benefits would still be paid to current retirees and to everyone else within 10 years of retirement or much longer.
The transition costs of privatization are formidable. They would exceed existing 12.4 percent payroll tax revenue by at least two percentage points. Mr. Bush would pay this bill for the next 10 years by tapping the projected budget surplus. Others have devised different plans. Some would borrow. Others would transfer general tax revenue to Social Security and count on rising corporate tax revenue from higher profits to replace the transferred money.
The huge cost should discourage Congress from making any changes. But the privatizers insist that the big outlay up front will come back in much bigger savings a few decades from now. As the returns from the individual retirement accounts fatten future pension checks, they say, the mandated benefits would be cut back and Social Security would be solvent until at least 2075 -- without having to raise the 12.4 percent payroll tax.
At that level, Social Security as it now exists, financed by payroll taxes, runs out of money in 2037, done in by the horde of retired baby boomers and the ever longer life expectancy.
Saving Social Security has thus become the grand justification for those who in fact want to dismantle or partly privatize a government pension system that is the principal source of income today for 63 percent of the nation's retirees. "You have benefits from the new personal accounts increasingly substituting for the mandated benefits," said Peter Ferrara, a professor at the George Mason School of Law. "But there would still be a safety net."
Is privatizing or partially privatizing Social Security really the only way to save it? There is an easier way to raise new money, while still preserving the present system. What is more, counting on the stock and bond markets to enlarge pensions is more like a crap shoot than a sure thing. Let's examine funding first.
Until 1990, Congress financed Social Security by raising the payroll tax every year or two, dividing the tax equally between employee and employer, so that each now pays 6.2 percent. True, Social Security outlays are about to take a quantum leap as the baby boomers begin to retire, but many experts estimate that if the payroll tax were raised now by no more than two percentage points, combined with modest cuts in benefits, Social Security would be solvent for 75 years in its present form.
Employers could pick up most of the two percentage points, if low-income workers could not afford any additional burden. Or the tax could be left where it is, but levied on a higher maximum wage.
The payroll tax currently applies to the first $76,200 of annual income. Raising that cap to $95,000 or higher would go a long way toward the desired 75 years of solvency, said Gary Burtless, a senior economist at the Brookings Institution.
"A higher cap would have another advantage," he said. "It would dampen the enthusiasm for giving raises to upper-income workers. Employers would think twice about having to pay more payroll tax. Wage inequality might even lessen."
Let's assume that the Bush approach prevails. Social Security's fixed monthly benefits give way, at least in part, to individual retirement accounts. Those accounts will keep pensioners whole, the proponents say, if they are invested in a mix of stocks and bonds that yield 5.5 percent to 6 percent a year, adjusted for inflation. That has roughly been the average return over the last century or so.
People's savings, however, do not rise in line with the 100-year average. The return on personal savings over the past 10 years has been way above average.
But woe to the person who retired in 1982, if he had had to make ends meet with one of Mr. Bush's individual retirement accounts.
"If you had invested $100 in stocks in 1969," Mr. Burtless said, "by 1982 you would have had less than $100, even after reinvesting the dividends."

It's All the Rage at Work, Too

BYLINE: By Vivian Marino

 BODY:
First there was road rage, when stressed drivers lashed out at fellow motorists. Then came air rage, when irate passengers lost their cool at 30,000 feet. Now, perhaps as an unintended side effect of the booming economy, there is desk rage.
A new survey suggests that uncivilized behavior is common in the workplace. In fact, it may become even more prevalent as employers deal with a growing shortage of qualified workers, said Sean Hutchinson, president of Integra Realty, a New York-based real estate advisory firm, which commissioned the survey. "Productivity in America is soaring, but at the price of a growing 'desk rage,' " he said. 
 Of the 1,305 American workers questioned in the telephone survey, 42 percent said yelling and verbal abuse were common in their jobs; 29 percent acknowledged screaming at co-workers themselves. One in 10 said they worked in an atmosphere where physical violence had occurred.
The survey also found that desk rage had adversely affected the health of some workers.
Thirty-four percent said they had suffered from insomnia, while 26 percent ate too much chocolate. Sixteen percent said they smoked in excess, and 11 percent drank too much alcohol. Vivian Marino

HEADLINE: The Transformation of AT&T

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"The Chaos at the Core of Prosperity" (Nov. 5) rightly observed that technology and deregulation are changing the American corporate landscape. The article also reminded us that an early 20th-century economist, Joseph A. Schumpeter, believed economies grow by creating new businesses that take over old ones. 
 All of these forces are at work in the transformation of AT&T. Following the 1984 court-ordered breakup of the Bell System, AT&T's primary business was long distance, which represented the bulk of its revenue. But technology and deregulation made it increasingly clear that long distance was simply an application that could be included within other communications services. The company had to transform itself from being just a "long distance company" if it were to have a future.
Over the last three years, that is exactly what we have done and, contrary to your commentary, our restructuring is consistent with that goal. AT&T has redefined itself by transforming its networks with new digital technology. The AT&T wireless, cable and data networks are state-of-the-art facilities over which we bundle voice, data and video communications services. In fact, in the last quarter, our wireless service revenue grew more than 30 percent; business data and Internet protocol services, more than 20 percent; and broadband cable services, nearly 11 percent.
These new networks, and the new services we bundle on them, are at the core of what we are building and the heart of the new AT&T companies.
AT&T has been an American icon for more than a century. Now it will be more than an American memory.

HEADLINE: Bosnia Votes With Hope to Break Ethnic Parties' Rule

BYLINE: By CARLOTTA GALL

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Nov. 11

 BODY:
The people of Bosnia were voting today in general elections without excitement, but many expressed a determination to try to bring change to their country almost five years after the peace agreement was reached in Dayton, Ohio.
Since the old Yugoslavia began to disintegrate, and each of its six republics held separate elections in 1990, Bosnia has been dominated by nationalist parties representing its main groups: Muslims, Serbs and Croats. Those parties dominated throughout the 1992-95 war, and have retained power in the country's two halves -- the Muslim-Croat Federation and the Bosnian Serb Republic. 
 Today that may change. Opinion polls indicate that a multiethnic party of professionals, the Social Democratic Party, which has rejected nationalist politics and campaigned on trying to mend the shattered economy, may gain power in several regions and become kingmaker on a national level.
"There is a very good chance that every institution will not have the nationalist parties represented, except the presidency of the Serb Republic," said Michael Balagus, director of the National Democratic Institute program in Sarajevo.
Mr. Balagus said the three main nationalist parties -- the Muslim-led Party for Democratic Action, the Serbian Democratic Party and the Croatian Democratic Union -- have gradually slid from their wartime positions of absolute dominance.
Voters may also be influenced by the recent shifts in regional politics. Franjo Tudjman, who led neighboring Croatia to independence in 1991 and helped to spark the Bosnian war by conspiring with Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia to divide up Bosnia, died last December. Mr. Milosevic lost power in Yugoslav elections last month, and Alija Izetbegovic, the leader of the Muslim Party for Democratic Action, retired this fall.
According to polls conducted throughout most of this year, the multiethnic Social Democratic Party could win 40 percent of the mandates in the Muslim-Croat Federation. "It should have no trouble at all in putting together a government," Mr. Balagus said, adding that it will find coalition partners in the smaller Bosnian parties and can thus avoid coalition with nationalists.
In the Serbian Republic, the nationalist party is likely to win the presidency. But the vote for the Serbian Parliament may prove to be more divided, perhaps affording more moderate parties enough seats to prevent the Serbian Democratic Party from forming a government.
"Voters seem to be saying that in the institutions that matter, like the national assembly, we want more moderate people, while we want to retain the nationalist symbol in the presidency," which is largely a ceremonial institution, Mr. Balagus said.
Even in the federal Parliament, which includes deputies from both halves of Bosnia, there is a chance that the Social Democrats will hold significant sway, Mr. Balagus said. Zlatko Lugumdzija, the Social Democrats' leader, predicted before the vote that his party would win control of almost all the 10 regions in the Muslim-Croat Federation.
Some of the international officials who administer Bosnia are worried that the defeat of the Muslim-led Party for Democratic Action will lead departing officials to steal or cover up previous corrupt dealings.
"There are 30 days between the elections and the hand over of power," said one official, who requested anonymity. "There is a fear there will be financial looting."
Residents of Sarajevo who turned out to vote this morning seemed united in their determination to vote out the current government and bring in a new team of professionals.
"Getting the nationalists out of power will be enough," said Biljena Crapic, a Serb doctor who lives in Sarajevo. "I hope that will happen. I'm a Serb but a normal one, born in Sarajevo."
A government economist, Sibe Bosniak, said the main reason people were voting against the government was because of the widespread corruption and misuse of funds by government officials. "I am ashamed when foreigners come to visit," he said. Referring to the three-member presidency, in which a Serb, a Muslim and a Croat take turns as chairman, he added, "They send one leader and we come up with three."
People in the Serb suburbs of Sarajevo said they also voted to change the government, but opted for the familiar Serbian Democratic Party.
Milidrag Bojan, 22, a private tradesman, said he was not interested in politics but felt that Serbs still needed their own leaders. "In 50 years, we have not had anyone who led us well," he said. "The war was the most stupid thing in my life and everyone's life. It was started by a few, and we followed like sheep."

HEADLINE: Government Gets Huge Turnout At Rally in Support of Estrada

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: MANILA, Nov. 11

 BODY:
Hundreds of thousands of Filipinos today joined a government-organized prayer rally that critics said was intended to demonstrate support for President Joseph Estrada, who faces impeachment on corruption charges.
Many in the crowd, predominantly made up of poorer Filipinos, were members of several large charismatic Christian groups that have supported Mr. Estrada since his election in 1998. The day was proclaimed a national holiday. 
 Although the administration said the rally was nonpolitical, it was widely viewed as an effort to show that the president continues to enjoy popular support and can attract larger crowds than the tens of thousands of people who demonstrated a week ago in Manila for his resignation.
Mr. Estrada has been accused by a provincial governor of having accepted more than $11 million from illegal gambling operators and tobacco taxes. He has acknowledged having been offered a $4 million bribe by the governor, but says he refused it.
Mr. Estrada admitted, however, that the money went into a bank account controlled by his brother-in-law, but he said the transfer had happened without his knowledge. He said he failed to report the bribery attempt because "a president has so much work to do -- that is the duty of our national police." Under Philippine law, public officials who "maliciously" fail to report a crime like bribery are subject to up to six years' imprisonment.
Critics say Mr. Estrada should step down now without waiting for an impeachment trial to prevent more damage to the ailing economy from the political crisis. But Mr. Estrada, in his weekly television program today, accused the opposition groups of damaging the economy by enflaming political uncertainty.
The House of Representatives is scheduled to begin preparing articles of impeachment against Mr. Estrada on Monday. The articles are virtually certain to be sent to the Senate for a trial because more than the required 73 House members have signed a resolution backing impeachment.
The Bankers' Association of the Philippines, which represents the country's commercial banks, placed full-page ads in newspapers today urging a speedy and impartial impeachment process but also suggesting that Mr. Estrada resign.
"If in spite of the constitutional processes, the economy will continue to suffer because of the protracted crisis; resignation, if freely chosen, is honorable and a heroic action," the association's advertisement said.
On Friday, Mr. Estrada also denied new allegations by the former head of the Securities and Exchange Commission that he received a $20 million kickback from the sale of the country's largest telephone company and pocketed more than $16 million from a controversial stock sale.

HEADLINE: COUNTING THE VOTE: POLITICAL MEMO;
Projecting a Relaxed Air As Recount Battle Sizzles

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., Nov. 11

 BODY:
As Gov. George W. Bush's representatives filed a lawsuit to stop a manual recount of ballots in certain Florida counties, Mr. Bush could not have seemed more distant from the fray.
Tieless and smiling, he chatted with reporters at his ranch near Waco about how well he was sleeping, how kindly local residents were treating him and how disruptive his dog, Spot, was being. The spaniel kept drowning out Mr. Bush's remarks with his barks. 
 "Sorry," Mr. Bush said. "The dog wanted to have a few comments. What she says was, 'Let's finish the recount.' "
He projected an image of complete assurance and ease, which was pretty much what Vice President Al Gore was doing later in the evening. Mr. Gore's only public appearance was a trip to the movie theater with his wife, Tipper; his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman; and Mr. Lieberman's wife, Hadassah.
When they left the movie, "Men of Honor," an enthusiastic crowd greeted them in the lobby with cheers and high-fives.
Both scenes were counterpoints to what was going on in Florida, which hurtled further into uncharted territory, as teams of lawyers and party officials stepped up one of the strangest political and legal battles in the history of presidential elections.
And that contrast demonstrated what a fine line Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore were trying to walk, what a delicate balance they were trying to strike. Both want the presidency, which means winning Florida, yet neither wants to be seen as doing anything extraordinary or illegitimate to get it.
Both also realize the strategic importance of every pose that they or their advisers strike, every image they project, every word they speak, every claim they stake. There are mind games at work, along with an understanding that the court of public opinion may turn out to be the decisive arena.
Thus James A. Baker III, the Bush campaign's chief representative in Florida, spoke the language of justice at his news conference today and portrayed the decision to go to court as a reactive measure, not an aggressive one.
He used words like democracy, respect, integrity, reasonable and regret. He said that the Bush campaign would withdraw its lawsuit instantly if the Gore campaign agreed to accept the results of a mechanical recount in Florida, which shows Mr. Bush in the lead, pending the receipt of absentee ballots from overseas.
And he talked about the people in Florida who had already filed lawsuits as "supporters of our opponents," implying that the Gore campaign's fingerprints were none too invisible.
Warren Christopher, the Gore campaign's chief representative in Florida, said those plaintiffs had acted on their own.
At his own news conference, he used words like principle and common procedure. He said the Gore campaign simply wanted to determine the "will of the people" and wondered if the Bush campaign was acting out of "fear."
Mr. Gore's advisers and allies trumpeted the fact that, at least officially, the Bush campaign was the first to head into court, which Mr. Baker had previously said was not the place to decide a presidential election.
By comparison, they insisted, they were sticking with actual ballots and merely striving for accuracy by demanding a manual recount -- on top of the mechanical recount -- in several counties. What went unmentioned today was the Democrats' reason for focusing on the counties in question: they are predominantly Democratic, and any change in the tallies there is likely to cut proportionately in Mr. Gore's favor.
As the campaign representatives most squarely in the public eye, Mr. Baker and Mr. Christopher tried to appear dignified, dueling former secretaries of state with wizened faces and weighty voices. They lofted insinuations of malfeasance or hypocrisy in deliberately muted manners.
But away from the television cameras, the candidates' advisers hurled less delicate accusations. Several of Mr. Bush's aides spoke acidly of a "Democratic war room" churning out lawsuits and of Democratic vote counters with sharp fingernails manipulating the ballots.
Both campaigns encountered dilemmas. If they went too far, they risked alienating voters and jeopardizing respect for their candidates. If they did not go far enough, they risked being steamrolled by more aggressive adversaries and perhaps surrendering a presidency.
So they did what they had to do, all the while presenting themselves simply as guardians of truth and the American way. And they kept the candidates more or less off the battlefield and tried to make them look presidential.
The only time Mr. Gore was publicly seen on Thursday was when he went jogging, his daughters at his side. The next day, he played touch football with his family on the verdant lawn of the United States Naval Observatory, his home in Washington, evoking memories of the kind of games the Kennedys engaged in at their compound in Hyannisport.
When a reporter shouted out a question about what was happening in Florida, Mr. Gore's only response was to say that one team in the football game was beating the other by 6 to 0.
In portraying Mr. Gore as a candidate who was not yet presuming anything, his advisers were trying to create a public impression that Mr. Bush was acting rashly and arrogantly by meeting with advisers likely to become cabinet members.
Mr. Bush allowed himself to be photographed on Friday with Condoleezza Rice, his chief foreign policy adviser, and Lawrence Lindsey, his chief economics adviser. The tableau in a living room in the governor's mansion here resembled an august gathering in the Oval Office.
Mr. Bush was clearly sending several signals: that he was ready to assume the presidency; that important business was being impeded by the Gore campaign's challenges of the vote count in Florida, and that any cool-headed analysis of the mechanical recount there gave him the victory.
Both Friday and today, Mr. Bush said he was simply trying to be responsible, a word chosen with care. During both appearances, his running mate, Dick Cheney, was at his side.
"I keep using the word responsible because I think the people of America understand that there's a very good chance that Dick and I will be the president and vice president," Mr. Bush said at his ranch this afternoon. "When that happens, we need to be prepared."
The Bush campaign thought long and hard before seeking the injunction, said several Republican officials with ties to the campaign. Mr. Bush and his advisers knew that they risked losing a public relations advantage, they said.
Another option had been to demand manual recounts in counties with a Republican advantage, but the Bush campaign believed that the quickest way to end the turmoil in Florida -- and the surest way for Mr. Bush to emerge as the winner -- was to let the mechanical recount stand.
They also believed that the mechanical recount was the fairest method, one that did not give any counties special importance and did not tweak a set of rules by which both candidates had played.
And they knew they had to do something.
"If you didn't, it would look like you weren't fighting hard enough," said one official. "It's in the back of Bush's mind -- you've got to show respect for the Constitution and not look politically cavalier, but you've got to fight hard enough so your partisans don't think you're a wimp and your potential political opponents don't think you're a wimp and a pushover."
Indeed, the Bush campaign was in part issuing a warning today that if the vice president and his aides wanted to go to the mat, Mr. Bush's advisers would meet them there. On Friday, Mr. Baker mentioned the other states, like Iowa and Wisconsin, in which the vote was narrow and local partisans might feel compelled to demand recounts.
Mr. Bush's cryptic remark today was that "all options are open, of course."
Those words were not so much a prediction as they were a suggestion that the Democrats had opened a Pandora's box -- and an attempt to build public pressure for closing it.

6 Nightmares
 Real Threats in a Dangerous World and How America Can Meet Them.
 By Anthony Lake.
 318 pp. Boston:
 Little, Brown & Company. $27.95. 
 These are tough times for former national security officials. In the steamy years of the cold war their memoirs -- no matter how dense and dull -- became instant best sellers. Today they seem destined for discount bins. Anthony Lake has tried to solve this problem by writing not a memoir of his years as President Clinton's national security adviser, but a book about the threats facing America -- his "6 Nightmares" -- with little vignettes from his years in office interspersed throughout.
Lake begins the discussion of each nightmare with, well, a nightmare -- a fictional account of some national security disaster. He tells each story using a different technique -- from straightforward reporting to government memos to excerpts from a soldier's diary. As they would say in Hollywood, it's John Grisham meets Henry Kissinger.
Except it isn't. The opening dramas are long and tiresome. I felt as if I were reading one of those interminable human-interest articles, impatiently wondering what had happened to whom and why it mattered. The first chapter, "New Tools for New Terrorists," opens: "Ed was not a basketball fan, but he . . . certainly enjoyed any time he could spend with his daughter, Samantha." Grisham has nothing to worry about.
The book gets much better. Once into the substance, Lake shows an easy mastery of the subject, high intelligence and good judgment. The six nightmares he describes are a useful list of the real threats to American security. Most acute among them are the spread of new weapons of mass destruction -- chemical, biological, and computer-based -- that can be manufactured, moved and used cheaply and quickly.
The end of the cold war has made it easier to get hold of deadly weapons. Most readily they can be bought or stolen from Russia, where vast arsenals now lie dangerously unprotected. And if the nuclear and biochemical materials are not for sale, the scientists and intelligence experts associated with them are. Lake calls these the problems of "loose nukes,"+ "loose geeks" and "loose spooks."
And then there's Iraq. Iraq has admitted that in the 1990's it possessed, among other goodies, 2,245 gallons of anthrax agent (which can kill billions), 5,125 gallons of botulinum toxin (enough to kill the earth's population several times over), four metric tons of VX, a nerve gas one drop of which can kill. After 1998, no inspectors have been in Iraq and these materials remain with Saddam Hussein.
Were these weapons used the results would be ghastly. But Lake argues that another new form of warfare, e-terror and e-crime, could have nasty results as well. He refuses to go into details, apparently keeping government secrets, but he quotes -- and seems to endorse, writing "this is the present" -- scenarios from James Adams's "Next World War":
"A CyberTerrorist will remotely access the processing control systems of a cereal manufacturer, change the levels of iron supplement, and sicken and kill the children of a nation . . .
"A CyberTerrorist will attack the next generation of air-traffic control systems, and collide two large civilian aircraft."
The dangers of these unconventional forms of warfare have been rising in recent years for a simple reason -- globalization helps terrorism. The lowering of borders, the rise of a global economy, the revolution in information technology, all these great and wondrous things have enormous benefits for terrorists. The costs of many of the ingredients of nuclear and chemical weaponry are falling fast. Global supplies and networks make them easier to obtain. And surfing through the internet one can find "manuals for mayhem and murder" along the lines of Uncle Fester's Silent Death, which includes recipes for botulism, shellfish toxin and ricin.
America is particularly vulnerable for the very reason it is so comfortable with globalization -- its openness. America's border controls are designed to be loose. For true global assembly lines and supply chains to work, goods and people must flow speedily in and out of the country. In 1996, Lake points out, 75 million cars, 3.5 million trucks and railroad cars and 254 million people crossed from Mexico into America. Fewer than 5 percent of the vehicles could be searched. A joke circulating in the Pentagon is that if someone wanted to smuggle weapons of mass destruction into the United States, the easiest way would be to put them in a shipment of illegal drugs.
When a nation or group strikes at America, Lake advocates a firm response, though he recognizes Washington's quandary. The terrorists often remain anonymous. (We still have not solved the attacks on the marines in Lebanon in 1983, let alone the bombing of the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 or Saudi Arabia in 1996.) Proof against such groups is always incomplete and in any case publicizing it would mean revealing intelligence methods. Yet Lake rightly urges that Washington not be hamstrung and act, as long as it is confident in its cause. He also argues for more covert operations to penetrate terrorist groups and rogue states.
Lake offers up some more general solutions as well. He wants to reorganize bureaucracies to erode traditional distinctions between law enforcement and national security: in other words, have the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. (among others) work together. He wants government to work with private businesses in the hunt for cybercrime and cyberterror. He wants more attention and more money for these problems.
All of Lake's suggestions are useful but there is a trade-off he does not fully come to grips with. The heart of the battle against today's borderless terrorism requires monitoring people within the United States. Lake quotes a government study from 1998 that claims that "the single most significant deficiency in the nation's ability to combat terrorism is a lack of information, particularly regarding domestic terrorism." For a nation that values civil liberties this presents difficult choices.
Next Lake moves on to discuss the problems of peacekeeping and "the perils of weakness." During the cold war Washington worried about the rising power of the Soviet Union, China, North Korea and North Vietnam. Now it worries about Russia and its crumbling nuclear infrastructure; China, where a revolution, crackdown, or breakup all seem possible; North Korea, which is an implosion waiting to happen; Japan, whose stagnant economy threatens the world economy; Indonesia, where stagnation seems the best option. And so on.
With regard to peacekeeping, Lake argues that America's current course -- reflecting on Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia and Kosovo -- could be "disastrous: a growing number of peacekeeping garrisons scattered around the world with no end in sight." His solution is not to walk away from societies racked by civil war but to establish a reasonable definition of success before embarking on a military intervention. Success, for Lake, means we should "limit our military mission to giving such societies 'breathing space,' "before leaving. "If we reach farther, and set as our goal the full healing of a shattered nation, we condemn ourselves either to defeat or the near-perpetual occupation of a society that will develop habits of dependency, or grow to resent our presence. or both."
Weak states and peacekeeping pose important challenges but they both symbolize the extraordinary position of power in which the United States finds itself. Its principal foreign policy concerns are how to handle its competitors, if and when they collapse, and what are the best rules of the road for altruistic interventions. Even the elevation of terrorism -- which does deserve greater attention -- is in part a reflection of the waning of other, larger threats.
Lake ends with an unusual chapter. His final nightmare is about Washington. While acknowledging that partisanship has always existed, he makes the case that it is now qualitatively worse -- partly because as ideological differences have narrowed, political battles become more personality-based. Lake is hardly unbiased. He was nominated to become director of central intelligence in 1996 but withdrew when it appeared that he would have trouble being confirmed. Whatever his own situation, however, Lake makes a persuasive case on this general subject, not exempting his party, or indeed his president, from guilt in any way. But changing the political culture in Washington is a daunting task. It might prove easier to tackle international terrorism.

HEADLINE: COLLEGE PREP;
Learning How to Learn

BYLINE: By Glenn C. Altschuler; Glenn C. Altschuler is dean of the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions and the Thomas and Dorothy Litwin Professor of American Studies at Cornell University.

 BODY:
As they begin their first year of college, many students do not know how to study -- in no small part because they have not been challenged in secondary school, where their transcripts are embellished by grade point inflation.
A nationwide survey by the University of California at Los Angeles of over 364,000 students in 1999 found that only 31.5 percent reported spending six or more hours a week studying or doing homework in their last year of high school. That was down from 43.7 percent in 1987, when the question was first asked. And 40.2 percent said they studied fewer than three hours a week, while 17.1 percent owned up to studying less than one hour a week. 
 No surprise then that so many college freshmen who insist they know all the material wonder why their first battery of exams do not go so well. No surprise either that offering courses that teach "learning strategies" has become a cottage industry. (Professionals think the term "study skills" too narrow, and they have banished the stigmatizing word "remedial" from the lexicon of higher education.)
For the bookish, "How to Study in College," by Walter Pauk, the standard text in the field, is available in its seventh edition, at more than 400 pages. For those inclined to the Internet, hundreds of institutions have established web sites with mcnuggets of advice on how to study and to advertise the services of learning strategies centers. The University of St. Thomas, in St. Paul, Minn., for example, insists that successful students commit daily MURDER (Mood, Understand, Recall, Digest, Expand, Review).
Over 1.6 million students are enrolled in learning strategies courses in two- and four-year colleges and universities, according to the National Association for Developmental Education; an additional 900,000 take advantage of tutoring and supplemental instruction, individually or in groups.
At the Learning Resource Centers at the New Brunswick, Newark and Camden, N.J., campuses of Rutgers, about 13,000 students in 34,000 visits a year are supported in a variety of settings. They include workshops with descriptions like "Cramming for exams -- and the consequences -- in the social sciences" and "Identifying and understanding one's individual learning style for success in ecology courses."
Nonetheless, it is not easy to get the students who most need assistance to use the resources available to them. Doing so, suggests Janet Snoyer, a learning strategies specialist at Cornell University, means "breaking down the relentless high school mind-set that 'help' is designed for laggards and ill-equipped minds." Professionals know that although they will require those with manifestly inadequate preparation to see them and will exhort all first-year students to come in early in the semester, many students will not make an appointment until they receive a disappointing grade, and others not even then.
Sometimes, a lack of motivation, procrastination and difficulty managing time on the part of students are symptoms of emotional or personal distress. For such students, Ms. Snoyer says, "Study skills tips barely reach the tip of the iceberg," and a referral to peer counseling or psychological services is appropriate.
But for many students learning how to learn is the iceberg. Fortunately, it can be chipped away at, or even melted. Professionals begin by getting students to acknowledge that being an undergraduate is a full-time job, requiring 35 or 40 hours every week including attendance in class and course-related work. Accounting for how they have spent every hour for a week or two (including snoozing and schmoozing) helps students assess their ability to set priorities, manage time and, if necessary, to create a new schedule and monitor their adherence to it.
When they hit the books, students should also consider where, how long and with whom they will study. Will proximity to a telephone, television, refrigerator, friend or potential date lead into temptation? Can extended exposure to an isolated library carrel cause narcolepsy?
A Cornell student, Paul Kangas, discovered that trying to study "while lying in bed was a good antidote for insomnia but not the best way to memorize a list of German vocabulary words." But no matter how conducive to studying their accommodations may be, few undergraduates work more effectively at night than during the day.
And even fewer can concentrate for more than 90 minutes without a break. That is why, as Michael Chen, an instructor in the Center for Learning and Teaching at Cornell, puts it, "Time between classes is prime time, not face time."
In his book, Mr. Pauk advises undergraduates to carry pocket work so that they can read an article or memorize vocabulary for Spanish class while waiting at the doctor's office or the airport. Even if this approach seems a bit compulsive, a specific goal -- one chapter, three problem sets -- and a reward when it is reached, makes study less daunting. That reward, whether it is a coffee break or an update on the Jets game, works only if it lasts no more than half an hour.
Although students often spend their study time alone, study in groups can be extremely helpful. Carolyn Janiak, a Cornell student, said she found that she always learned more when working with others because discussions "force me to focus on the bigger picture and argument." As she clarified her opinions, she said, she was able to memorize details as well.
Group sessions work best if each student has already reviewed (and if necessary memorized) all the material required for an assignment or exam; parceling out the work for vicarious learning is risky. Leslie Schettino, who teaches learning strategies courses in New York State at Tompkins Cortland Community College and Ithaca College asks members of study groups to compare lecture notes, read problems aloud, pretend they are tutors in, say, the math lab and end a meeting only when everyone understands the most important concepts. Often students discover that the best way to master material is to be forced to explain it to someone else.
But groups are not for everyone. Andrew Janis of Cornell tries to study when his roommate is out because "complaints about organic chemistry distract me." He plays "quiet jazz" or turns his radio to "an AM station that is all fuzz." As he examines notes, handouts and review sheets, he uses an online encyclopedia to help with dates and other pertinent information.
Effective note-taking is essential. It takes time for students, who are used to high school teachers who signal them with the phrase, "Now this is really important," to recognize the "architecture" of a lecture -- the introduction and summary, inflection, emphasis and pause, the use of "therefore," the digression -- and to figure out what is worth taking down. Successful students read over their notes nightly, identifying the theme and two or three crucial points. If anything is not clear, they ask the instructor for clarification as soon as possible. To review notes for the first time the night before an exam is to court disaster.
Notes on a text should be taken on a separate sheet of paper or a computer. Students might begin by skimming to identify the "geography" of the book -- its subheadings, graphs, maps and tables and its main lines of argument. I advise students to throw out their highlighters: those who use them are passive learners who do little more than paint their books yellow. Students who summarize a chapter in their own words, in a few paragraphs, tend to understand the material better and remember it longer. Questions might be recorded in the margin of the book, to be raised in discussions or in office hours.
Learning how to learn is not easy. It requires will and discipline, what the 19th-century English biologist Thomas Henry Huxley called "the ability to make yourself do the thing you have to do, when it ought to be done, whether you like it or not."
But just about everyone can do it. And the rewards -- emotional, intellectual and financial -- reach well beyond a grade in a college course.

HEADLINE: BLACKBOARD: NEW USES FOR TECHNOLOGY;
Lizzie Borden Online: Learning How to Research Primary Sources

BYLINE: By Eric Goldscheider

 BODY:
Did Lizzie Borden murder her father and stepmother with an ax in 1892? A jury acquitted her, but for more than a century some historians have questioned her innocence.
Now, students enrolled in History 201 at the University of Massachusetts can look into the crime more closely themselves, at the same time acquiring knowledge of the period known as the Gilded Age and learning how to ply the historian's craft. The basic "text" for the course is at http://ccbit.cs.umass.edu/lizzie/. 
 It is not exactly a Web-based course. The class meets, and students hand in papers, but much of the content is online. That includes such research material as trial transcripts, census data, probate records, news reports, maps and hundreds of period photographs.
There are virtual tours of Fall River, Mass., the industrial city where the crime and Lizzie Borden's trial took place at a time of great social and economic flux. Students might follow the route Andrew J. Borden walked to survey his financial interests by pointing and clicking on blue arrows to see photos of the buildings and streets he saw the morning of the day his skull was split open as he napped on his couch.
David Hart, executive director of the Center for Computer-Based Instructional Technology at the university campus in Amherst, started working with history teachers to create the Lizzie Borden Web site five years ago when O.J. Simpson's travails were a national sensation. Parallels between the two trials were striking, he said. Not only were high-toned defendants represented by high-powered lawyers (Ms. Borden had a former governor on her team), but hot-button social issues, like race in Mr. Simpson's case and gender in Ms. Borden's, figured prominently in the trials.
And contemporary media technology facilitated the prominent coverage given both trials -- cable TV in the Simpson trial and The Associated Press wire in the Borden case.
Students sleuthing for the truth regarding Ms. Borden look at wealth disparities in the city and within her family. The scope then widens to the social and cultural climate of the day. Finally, students examine how economic, political, labor and gender issues of the Gilded Age fit into the sweep of history.
The computer puts a large collection of primary sources "literally at the students' fingertips," Mr. Hart said. They learn how to read and draw inferences from undigested material. The next step, marshaling arguments to support historical hypotheses, requires them to evaluate that material for relevance and signs of bias. He is considering using the technique to develop sites for other famous events in history, as well.
Victoria Getis, a historian who helped develop the curriculum, said students generally concluded that Lizzie Borden was guilty, but that she was acquitted with the help of clever lawyers, along with some complicity on the part of Fall River's upper classes.

HEADLINE: Chicago Girds for Big Battle Over Its Skyline

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
On a crisp October afternoon, a giant crane ripped into an old brick building on Maxwell Street, once a hive of pushcarts and tenements, now hailed by cultural historians as the birthplace of the electric blues. The demolition crew did not stop to take down the old hand-lettered placards in the windows, advertising "Stereo Players" and "Blues Jazz Gospel."
Jimmie Lee Robinson, an elderly musician, arrived carrying a stool and a guitar. He sat on the empty street in front of the building while the bricks crashed down behind him and played an elegy: "The Maxwell Street Blues." 
 Chicago, the "stormy, husky, brawling, City of the Big Shoulders," as Carl Sandburg wrote, is in the midst of its biggest building boom since the 1920's, lagging behind only Atlanta and Phoenix in the number of construction permits issued in the last two years. Hundreds of buildings are being leveled for apartment towers, malls and college dormitories.
Along Maxwell Street, more than 50 buildings are being demolished for a campus expansion and pricey condominiums; in the Near North, Coe House, a showy Queen Anne apartment house, has just bitten the dust, along with the Italianate town houses next door. Two weeks ago, demolition started on the Hesing Mansion, a mansard-roofed villa. After protests and a petition to the Illinois Supreme Court, destruction of the Platt Luggage Building, a 1907 Georgian Revival building on Prairie Avenue, was halted last month, but not before wreckers had knocked a hole in its upper corner.
And developers are eyeing the prime sites that remain -- from a big chunk of a block of Lake Shore Drive to a low-rise street of boutiques along North Rush Street to a long swath of Michigan Avenue, the city's most picturesque vista, where three 50-story towers have been proposed for one vacant lot.
In this preservation-versus-development debate, more is at stake than a few 19th-century villas. When the construction debris from the biggest boom in decades is finally carted away, Chicago will have determined the fate of its famed lakefront skyline and its low-rise streetscapes.
While many politicians applaud the demolitions as progress, an example of a great metropolis doing what it has always done since the Great Fire of 1871 -- ripping down and building anew -- others shake their heads in dismay.
"Chicago's great contribution is its architecture," said David Garrard Lowe, an architectural historian. "And every day, they knock down a piece of its heritage. Chicago's vitality is getting zapped." Mr. Lowe said the new edition of his book "Lost Chicago" (Watson-Guptill, 2000) contained 50 percent more photographs of demolished buildings than the 1975 original.
Chicago, the birthplace of the skyscraper, has increasingly tried to preserve the works of its architectural masters: Louis Sullivan, Frank Lloyd Wright and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe.
But many here worry about losing other, less celebrated buildings, which give context and form to the skyline and the center city. "There is an 'I will' spirit here: if it's economic development, it must be good," said Stanley Tigerman, an architect who has designed 40 buildings here since the 60's. "Mies van der Rohe himself said, 'Build it, don't talk.' "
Christopher R. Hill, the city's planning commissioner, said that Mayor Richard M. Daley was a "preservationist, absolutely," and that the city had done a good job of saving the "truly significant" buildings. But because of still-swelling development pressure, he said, "not all of the buildings can be saved."
Social historians talk about Chicago's "ambiguity," a reflection of its location in the middle of the country, pulled between the Wild West and the Cultured East, between rough-and-tumble stockyards and black-tie nights at the opera. These tensions add up to a poignant debate over whether progress and the rights of property owners are more important than preserving the architectural spectrum.
"Of all the cities we can think of, except maybe Hong Kong, we associate Chicago with new things, with building new," said Witold Rybczynski, a professor of urbanism at the University of Pennsylvania, who wrote about Chicago's past in his book "City Life" (Touchstone, 1995). "Combining that with preservation is a difficult task, a tricky thing. It's hard to find the middle ground in Chicago."
This week, the Chicago City Council will try.
On Tuesday, the council will begin hearing arguments on whether to create the city's first two large commercial historic districts, where development would be regulated. The first to be discussed will be the Motor Row District along South Michigan Avenue, includes Henry Ford's first showroom. For preservationists, it is not a moment too soon: the showroom's owner has already applied for a demolition permit.
Up for discussion in January is the Historic Michigan Boulevard District, a world-famous thoroughfare that city historians compare to the Bund in Shanghai and Central Park West in New York. This is the streetscape seen across Grant Park and from Lake Michigan. "The overall effect of the ensemble seems as if some of the best of Chicago architecture gathered along the lakefront, and posed for a group photo," the Commission on Chicago Landmarks wrote in its report.
Mr. Hill called the hearings "the great battleground." Many property owners oppose designation, and there is a tradition here of bowing to a property owner's wishes. "I have quite a few problems with both of those districts," said Burton Natarus, the alderman from the 42nd Ward, which includes the proposed Michigan Boulevard District and part of the Motor Row District. Until recently, Chicago politicians generally observed the old-fashioned courtesies; Mr. Natarus still proclaims that "if the owner has problems, I usually do, too."
Some Chicagoans have problems with the landmark process, which many compare to freezing buildings in time. Mr. Tigerman said Chicago's wealth of great architecture can actually work against preservation.
"Look, there are 45 Mies buildings, 75 Frank Lloyd Wright buildings, and God knows how many buildings there are by the first Chicago School and the second Chicago school," he said, with some exaggeration. "So there is an attitude that if one or two come down, what's the big deal?" (Preservationists did fight to keep Mies van der Rohe's 1951 Arts Club interior on North Michigan Avenue, but the building was demolished five years ago, replaced by a retail mall.)
In Chicago, there are 17,371 buildings and sites listed in the city's four-year-old official survey of architecturally and historically significant buildings. At least 52 buildings have fallen in the last 18 months, preservationsts say. Last year, the city designated five new ones. (Altogether the city has 151 individual landmarks, compared with New York City's 1,048.)
Although Chicago does have 30 historic districts, they are primarily residential, like Hyde Park's Kenwood District, and outside the Central Business District, where development pressures are most intense. The business district boasts most of the city's finest public buildings, including the strip known as the Magnificent Mile and the (undesignated) Wrigley Building.
To Chicago developers like Steven Fifield, preservation is nice in principle but can be a hindrance. Mr. Fifield had announced a plan to knock down the grandiose Medinah Temple, owned by the Shriners, and to demolish the core of Tree Studios next door, an artists' enclave, to build a 47-story tower. He withdrew the plans after Chicagoans sent thousands of postcards to City Hall. In the end, most of the artists will still be displaced, but the temple has been saved -- more or less. Part of the interior will be demolished to house a Bloomingdale's home furnishings store; some rejoice that the shell has been saved.
In Chicago, tearing down a building and re-erecting its facade is considered preserving it. In the last year, at least six important buildings have received this treatment, including the ornate Harris and Selwyn theaters, the Old Heidelberg restaurant, and the Perkins, Fellows & Hamilton architectural studio, built in 1917. Several weeks ago, the city announced that Platt Luggage would be saved by demolishing everything but its grand front. The University of Illinois, for its campus expansion, will reuse the facades of six of the 60 Maxwell Street buildings it will demolish. A plan to put silhouettes of street scenes in second-story widows, masking modern apartments, is being reconsidered. Critics have called the silhouettes "Disneyesque" and "Potemkinesque."
Even official landmarks are not safe from progress. The McGraw-Hill Building, built in 1928, was torn down last year, and its facade was re-erected with a 16-story shopping mall and hotel behind it.
With a surplus of city money, there is also pressure to demolish abandoned houses in urban neighborhoods to curtail their use by drug dealers and addicts.
Jim Peters, director of the city's landmarks commission, said he believed property owners could benefit from historic districts. Mr. Peters pointed to the country's most famous landmarked commercial districts -- Ladies' Mile in New York and Pioneer Square in Seattle -- where, he said, property values "have gone sky-high."
"The problem is, we haven't been able to convince Chicago's owners that values in a Chicago commercial landmark district go up, not down, because we don't have any commercial historic districts -- yet," he said.
"We're going into a real battle."

HEADLINE: How High School Students Did on the Regents Exams

BYLINE: By Kate Zernike

 BODY:
For the first time since it required tougher English tests for high school graduation, the State Board of Regents has released scores that capture the progress of an entire class.
 The data presented here are for New York City students who entered ninth grade for the first time in fall 1996. To reflect that many students did not make it to senior year in the typical four years, the state released the data both for the entire group - whose general education enrollment is tabulated below - and for the smaller group of students who were seniors last year. 
 The state also released data on all students who took and passed the Regents math exam, which became a condition of graduation for those entering in fall 1997 (this year's senior class).
 In both the English and math exams, a passing score is 55 out of 100. Beginning with students who entered in fall 2000, the passing grade on the English exam will be 65. The passing grade on the math exam will rise to 65 for those entering ninth grade in fall 2001. KATE ZERNIKE

HEADLINE: Less Austerity, More Diversity at PREP SCHOOL Today

BYLINE: By VICTORIA GOLDMAN and CATHERINE HAUSMAN; Victoria Goldman and Catherine Hausman are co-authors of "The Manhattan Family Guide to Private Schools" and write the Junior Ivy League column for Our Town and West Side Spirit in Manhattan.

 BODY:

Fifty years after Holden Caulfield despaired of life at Pencey, prep schools are far less forbidding. They welcome a variety of students, from Park Avenue to the inner city. And with e-mail contact, friends and family are not so far away.
It has been half a century since Holden Caulfield bounced around a frozen archipelago of boarding schools before flunking out of Pencey Prep. Turning his back on the "phonies" and the casual cruelty of his classmates, Holden walked out of the school's wrought iron gates and into the night, the snow swirling around his red hunting cap; bound for home and his younger sister Phoebe -- sweetness and light. 
 To generations of students whose syllabuses include J.D. Salinger's "Catcher in the Rye," boarding school represents the winter of their adolescent discontent; a cold, distant place where parents threaten to send their children if they don't measure up. In Holden's day, third-generation legacies -- children of alumni -- knew that in the fall of their 13th year they and their monogrammed suitcases were going to prep school. Parents dropped their children off in September, picked them up again in June and let the schoolmasters worry about what went on in between.
If Holden Caulfield were to return to school for Alumni Day 2001, he would find that the world of proctors and prefects, dorm teas and Mr. Chips has undergone a millennial thaw. Most of the approximately 36,000 students at boarding schools packed their bags willingly and are in daily e-mail contact with mom and dad. The ivy is no longer one shade of green. Students are as likely to room with a real prince of Thailand as with the fresh prince of Bel Air, as the schools reach farther into the public high schools for the majority of their students, making admissions more competitive than ever.
The monastic life of formal dinners, daily chapel and cold showers has given way to international theme meals, contemporary ecumenism and interdorm dances. Instead of debating whether to go coed -- the schools did a quarter-century ago -- trustees now debate same-sex relationships within dorms.
Faculty members, the shrill martinets of yore, have mellowed into compassionate mentors. Perhaps the biggest change is that the elite prep schools are no longer a sure ticket to the Ivy League; most of the prep schools have graduates at a variety of colleges. One thing that will never change is that many students at the top schools still pull all-nighters just to get a 4.5 average out of a possible 6.0. Stress junkies thrive here.
It was May in Massachusetts, and the lilac and dogwood were in voluptuous bloom in the town of Groton. At the wrought iron gates of the Groton School, a plaque commemorates Auchincloss family alumni. The Gothic Revival chapel is on the left. Groton is a small school with 340 residential students. Perhaps this was the Whooten School that Holden briefly attended. Frederick Law Olmsted, the landscape architect who planned Central Park, designed the campus. The buildings in Georgian and Kentish Manor House style, red brick with white trim, enclose an island of emerald grass known as the Circle.
Quincy Fennebresque, 18, a squash player with an easy grace, has been at Groton since ninth grade, or third form. He wore an untucked Oxford shirt, no tie, khakis and a pair of reef sandals -- the all-season preferred preppy footwear. His close-cropped hair is still tinged with the bleached blond color that he sported most of sixth form, or senior year.
Growing up on Park Avenue, Holden's home turf, Quincy attended a private day school that ends at ninth grade. After much discussion with his parents in the family library, Quincy decided to go away, as do only one-tenth of 1 percent of all high school students. "I felt like I could govern my own hours, eat, sleep and study when I wanted to," he said.
What finally persuaded him to go to Groton was his revisit to the school. "My ninth-grade host and I went to dinner, and Thursday is parlor night at the headmaster's house: cookies, milk, Twister, air hockey, Ping-Pong and football," he recalled. "Then there was the pillow fight in the hallway, it was so much fun."
But it is not all fun and games at Groton, a rigorous school with Saturday morning classes and mandatory chapel attendance four days a week. In ninth grade the school instills study skills, "In tenth grade when they bestow all this free time on you -- hopefully you'll know what to do with it," Quincy said. Apparently he did, undertaking a six-academic course load every semester, including Greek and Latin, and completing seven advanced placement courses.
When asked what he missed most about being away from home, Quincy replied, "Watching my little sister grow up." Echoes of Holden's yearning for sister Phoebe and maybe his lost youth.
In the dining hall, seating is informal, and because the school is so small, it is easy to get to know one another. Three days a week students sit down to a formal meal under the John Singer Sargent portrait of Endicott Peabody, the founder, rector and head of Groton School from 1884 to 1940, a 56-year reign. Groton was founded to educate the sons of New England's socially prominent families.
For decades Groton was a portal to power whose graduates trod a well-worn path to the State Department and the C.I.A. The Groton "honor roll" of public servants includes Dean Acheson, W. Averill Harriman, Paul H. Nitze and Presidents Franklin D. and Theodore Roosevelt.
Today, the idea of service is still paramount, but students give back in more personal, less political ways. Quincy spent one summer working for Amigos, a public health program in Mexico that helps villagers combat dehydration and disease. Quincy said he and two other young men lived in a shack with one light bulb and no running water and dug holes, mixed cement, and built latrines and stoves.
Hardwick Simmons, Groton '58, parent '84, said: "About four years ago, Groton hired a consultant to help with the design of current capital campaign. He told us that we would have a hard time, not because the alumni didn't have the means, but because he had never seen a group of alumni with so many charitable interests."
Mr. Simmons, known to friends as Wick, retired this fall as chief executive of Prudential Securities at age 60. In his office in downtown Manhattan a pillow embroidered with the Groton school crest sat on his school chair. Mr. Simmons, a patrician-looking man with chiseled features and salt and pepper hair, is president of Groton's board of trustees. He entered the ninth grade at Groton when he was 14.
"At that time, boarding school essentially provided a piece of your upbringing," he recalled. "When you went away to boarding school, it was because you had a parent who believed like mine did, and I believe this for my own kids, the most important thing I do is put you on your own two feet. We were pushed out of the nest."
Groton was a place of discipline where boys wore a coat and tie to breakfast, lunch and dinner. "I used to sneak into the fine arts library music room and play Elvis Presley, which I couldn't do any other place," Mr. Simmons said. For amusement, he and his friends sometimes "trundled off and walked down the train tracks to Ayer," a nearby town.
"The only time you saw a girl was at three glee club concerts a year and a dance in February. You could invite a girl up for that weekend and she would stay at a master's house," Mr. Simmons said. Preppies had to work extra hard to meet girls over the summer and on breaks.
Beginning in the early 1970's, coeducation changed the landscape of boarding schools forever. What was once the old boy network became the old school network. Mr. Simmons says girls softened the edges of the school. "It isn't the English boarding school it once was," he said wistfully. "It doesn't have the same hierarchical thunder." Sixth form prefects -- seniors -- no longer rule the school, doling out black marks. Students no longer "work all that time in that incubating community to be the top dog," he said, adding, "Life's broader."
Groton enrolled a black student in 1952, a move that made the newspapers at the time. In the 1999-2000 school year 76 students of color were enrolled at Groton, accounting for 22 percent of all students.
Steve Ruzika, director of the Association of Boarding Schools, said, "There is so much more diversity on campus today. There's been a conscious effort to have kids of color, kids from abroad and from Latin and South America, and the recognition that they have enriched the life of the school." Elitism is a label the boarding schools avoid like poison ivy, but they still consider themselves academically elite.
The role of admissions director at the top schools has changed from that of gate keeper to door opener, said Richard Schubart, former director of admissions and chairman of the history department at Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, N.H. Once a haven for the upper crust, these schools have increasingly attracted intellectual students from the inner city. Of the 334 new students entering Exeter last year, 55 percent came from public schools. Children of alumni, valued for community building and nurturing the endowment, are still given a second look, provided they meet the rigorous admission standards.
While recruiting students is nothing new -- the schools have been stocking their athletic teams for decades -- marketing is. Admissions officers hold receptions in small towns and urban neighborhoods at the homes of families whose children are currently enrolled. Each year the association of boarding schools sponsors a tour to Asia, where it holds boarding school fairs in six countries.
It was the day after advanced placement exams. Speakers in dorm windows blared the music of "No Doubt," while Frisbee players ran barefoot over the grass.
Rachel Thompson, a junior from Washington, came to Groton through Project Match, one of a dozen diversity programs that open the doors to boarding schools for academically talented minority students. "I never thought this would be a part of me," she said. "I love the fact that my Spanish teacher not only teaches Spanish but he's written the book we are reading out of."
In addition to carrying six academic courses, she is head of the gospel choir, a member of the Alliance for Student Harmony, and plays soccer, ice hockey and basketball. She is also the first black woman to be awarded the Wallace Scholarship, given by a Boston family in recognition of scholastic excellence and outstanding character.
Project Match is run by Wanda Hill out of her home in McLean, Va. In the 1970's she sent her two sons to Groton, calling it a "leap of faith."
"We're not wealthy, and we were older parents," Ms. Hill said, "and we knew that we could not leave them anything but a good education." Over the last 20 years she has placed more than 400 students in 78 schools. Some of her students cannot afford to buy the school T-shirt, while others pay full tuition. One of the changes she has seen is a greater inclusiveness of minority students on campus. "It evolved from an African-American society or a black student union to organizations for all kids, white kids included," she said.
Admission to boarding school is getting more competitive, even for talented minority students. In 1956 fewer than 5,000 students took the entrance exam for secondary schools. Last year, approximately 51,000 students sat for the exam. Barring a sudden downturn in the economy, the number is expected to increase through 2007 before dropping off, according to Regan Kenyon, who runs the Secondary School Admission Test.
For all the changes, the soul of old Groton resides in Rector Peabody's chapel, but here again tradition occasionally collides with modern mores. Although no longer a daily ritual, students still fill the pews most mornings at 8 as part of the school's mission to "cultivate manly, Christian character." Students have been known to show up for morning chapel with their jackets thrown over their pajamas. The centerpiece of chapel is the chapel talk, a rite of passage for seniors. Recently, a senior came out in chapel, trusting in the support of the community, which he received. At Sunday chapel on Alumni Day, seniors replaced the opening hymn in the Groton School Hymnal, "Thy temple gates stand open wide" with Britney Spears's "Baby, One More Time."
"There's less of a Groton product today than when I went," Mr. Simmons said. "We're turning out a more diverse group of individuals. We were kind of incubated; we were a product that came out the other end."
Exeter is a large school of approximately 1,000 students, 16 percent of whom are day students. The founder, John Phillips, was known as a strict Calvinist with a liberal spirit, and the school still mixes Puritan values with a democratic ethos.
At its founding in 1781, Exeter charged no tuition, and the trustees voted that "no student shall wear silk of any kind." Students still dress down, but tuition not only arrived but has climbed sharply: For the academic year 2000-2001 tuition is $25,100 for boarding and $18,900 for day students. Book fees total $600. The approximate value of Exeter's endowment as of June 30 was almost $500 million. Last year 35 percent of the student body received financial assistance grants, totaling more than $6 million. The average grant is $18,000.
Although Exeter admitted girls in 1973, the original motto, "Come hither, boys, that you may become men" is still engraved over the front entrance. The academy bell still chimes on the class change, not the hour; Lily of the Valley graces the entrance to Phillips Church, and children of faculty members, affectionately known as fac brats, ride their tricycles down the paths.
Exeter and Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., remain archrivals, and Exeter's sports scores, which are updated twice weekly, get the most hits on Exeter's Web site. Like Groton, the school has mellowed considerably. "Classical Exeter was harsher and more forbidding," Mr. Schubart said, "You got the feeling that every Exeter course was almost a secondary admissions committee, out to prove that the admissions office got it wrong."
Bernard Helfat, Class of '34, parent '69, spent his senior year at Exeter. His younger son attended the school, his older son, a late-bloomer cum millionaire who "wasn't that interested in school," was not admitted. Mr. Helfat, a lawyer in New York, is a class agent and visits his alma mater annually. "The instructors were the heart and soul of the school," he said. "My Latin teacher would take that window pole, raise it over a student's head and slam it down on the middle of the table. It got everybody's attention. And he was a very popular instructor."
There is much greater interaction between faculty and students today. Dorm faculty prowl the halls telling students to "get off the phone," "get to bed" or "clean up this mess." The TV in the common room goes off at 8 p.m. Dorm proctors check students into their rooms at 9:30, and lights go out at 10:30. If students request too many "late lights," the dorm proctor will look into their study habits. They are also alert to signs of social and psychological distress.
Three years ago Exeter put phone and computer connections in every dorm room. Students can now be in daily contact with their parents, and term papers can be e-mailed home for editing, although that is frowned upon. A junior who talks to her mother on the phone every night said, "I'll never stop missing my family, I miss them, like, every day, but I know how to handle it."
The attrition rate, defined as the number of students who do not re-enroll at the school even though they are invited to do so, varies from school to school. According to statistics of the National Association of Independent Schools for the 1997-98 academic year the median attrition rate for boarding students was 10.6 percent.
In midafternoon, in a common room, a few boys were watching "Air Force One." In a room down the hall a tie, jacket and khakis lay strewn on the floor and wet towels thrown over the lintel. Holden might have just ducked out to meet with his rheumy adviser, "old Spencer."
Computers, printers and stackable CD players are on every desk except a few. Some students come to school with little more than a toothbrush. One faculty adviser took a student shopping for posters, curtains and a throw rug to make her stark room cozier.
Will Frazier, a senior from Cleveland who has deep dimples when he smiles, came to Exeter almost by accident. When he took the private school entrance test he marked the box for Exeter because he liked the name. Raised by his aunt who reared 10 other children -- his mother is deceased -- Will didn't know what to expect when he decided to prep. "I come from a pretty rough neighborhood, not many kids finish high school," he said. "There's a lot of drugs and violence. When I came to Exeter, it was a total socioeconomic jump that I wasn't really prepared for." At first Will and a Hispanic student "were the diversity of the dorm."
Will connected with the Exeter community by joining the Exeter Social Service Organization, the Ionian Society, the concert choir and the Exceteras, an a cappella singing group. Spring breaks were spent with his roommate's family, and they also helped him get a summer job in a law firm.
Will describes his years at Exeter as a "joyous struggle." He found the academics challenging, but asking for help was especially difficult, and there were not many faculty members of color to turn to.
He managed to get the grades but took only one advanced placement course, in French. "Boarding school has been a life line for him -- it's filled his summers, given him a peer group of other high-achieving kids, and he has the internal fortitude to make it work," said Lynne Harwell Algrant, executive director of a New York City program that sends minority students to private schools.
"But not being part of a larger black community during the developmental years can lead to an insecure identity as a black man; socially, he'll have to navigate a much more diverse world at college," she said.
"If you can persevere through Exeter, you can persevere through just about anything I think," Will said. "It's really hard on so many levels." When asked if he kept in touch with friends from home, Will replied, "I don't have any home friends."
Ms. Harwell Algrant said, "It can be a painful realization that in order to continue on this path of ambition, motivation and mobility -- to know that you can't go home again."
Exeter was always tough, but getting into college used to be easier. "The biggest difference in the school today," Mr. Helfat said, "is if you got out of Exeter and you were interested in going to Harvard, Yale or Princeton, that's where you went. The colleges figured that students at Exeter had basically been preselected for them. This world is gone."
Phyllis Steinbrecher, an educational consultant in Westport, Conn., said, "High School is the best time to invest in your child's social and intellectual skills because that is the time when these skills come together and take off." Still, she acknowledged, colleges and universities "are looking for more than what a few select schools can produce."
In April, the Exonian, Exeter's school newspaper, published the Class of 2000 admissions statistics. It is a tradition at many elite prep schools to publish the list of graduates and the schools they will be attending but this was the first year the Exonian did so. Many students responded with outrage. "This was something that should be kept private and not thrown on the front page of the school newspaper," wrote one student. The issue of racial preferences in college admissions is particularly sensitive.
"We've had a really hot debate about the whole college admissions thing and being a person of color versus being a normal majority," Will said. "It's really frustrating to me, well, because I'm black, and I don't want people to think that the only reason I got into the school that I got into is because I'm black. People just don't feed you off a silver platter just because you grew up in the projects. I mean you have to work." At Exeter's graduation, Will wore a white shirt, tie and a blazer like the other young men. The girls wore white dresses. The class of 2000 voted not to wear the traditional cap and gown. After the last diploma was handed out, almost everyone lit up a cigar.
On Prize Day at Groton, Quincy Fennebresque, wearing the Groton School tie given to every graduating senior, joyously threw his straw boater into the air. Will and Quincy are now members of the Class of 2004 at Yale. Fortunately, they do not resemble Holden Caulfield.
"You could see a few Holden Caulfields here and there," said Sarah Curtis of Greenwich, Conn., a junior at Exeter. "You learn to appreciate people. You just don't just dismiss them as phonies." But Holden fell through the cracks, and found that his own two feet were too wobbly to support him, so young and so far away from home
The boarding schools were forced to change with the times or risk becoming as anachronistic as a faded letter sweater. Although they have relaxed the rules, they keep raising the academic ante. It takes a teenager with a combination of maturity, stamina, an outgoing personality and a lot of self-discipline to succeed away from home. Yet, teenagers will always identify with Holden, a misfit whose vulnerability is a reminder of their own growing pains.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 26, 2000, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article in the quarterly Education Life section on Nov. 12 about changes at boarding schools in the last 50 years misstated the date of the first admissions of girls to Phillips Exeter Academy. They were admitted as day students in 1970 and as boarding students in 1971, not in 1973. The article also referred incorrectly to the traditional chiming of the school's bell. It takes place on the hour and for dormitory check-in, breakfast and assemblies, not just to signal the class change.

HEADLINE: Turn Left at the Shoe Store . . .

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI 

 BODY:
It's probably safe to say the Internet has saved Americans millions of gallons in fuel, formerly wasted by people driving aimlessly along back roads with directions from someone who never quite figured out the whole left-right thing.
By now, in fact, it's second nature to many people to get onto the Web for door-to-door directions before they leave the house on a long driving trip. But in their haste to hit the road, a lot of those people -- myself included -- have never bothered to pause on any of the mapping Web sites, and, well, get lost.
 A few years ago, such exploration would have yielded little, as sites like mapquest .com and mapsonus.com provided mostly basic features like directions and maps. But that's changing quickly. More recently, the map sites have expanded their offerings to include much of the information you'd want before leaving, including attractions along the way, road construction, weather maps, gas station stops, accommodations and even travel games to keep the back seat from becoming a war zone. 
 Those improvements come not only from new technologies but also from new competition from off-line companies that are synonymous with mapping. At the top of that list is Rand McNally, the Chicago-based company that has thrown life preservers to directionally challenged travelers for 144 years. Randmcnally.com rolled out a new version of its map site this summer, and quickly made its way into the five most frequently visited such sites on the Web -- behind maps.com, mapsonus.com, mapblast.com and mapquest.com. While mapquest.com is by far the most visited map site on the Web, according to Media Metrix, an Internet research firm, randmcnally.com has pulled nearly even with it in another important category: the number of minutes an average user spends per month on the site.
Part of this may be because randmcnally .com is simply a slower site than the others, but it is also a good example of everything you can do on a map site in addition to getting directions. On its new version, randmcnally.com includes a feature called the Road Trip Guide, which allows users to chart a course from one point to the next, as you would expect, but also type in information about whether they're traveling with children or pets, how long they plan to be on the road, and what sorts of entertainment or activities they might be interested in.
I recently kicked the tires of the Road Trip Guide, so to speak, by setting up a driving itinerary from Connecticut to Boulder, Colo. -- purely imaginary, as my family, with three children from 15 months to 11 years, could never survive such a trip. But the itinerary was enough to get me thinking that it might be a good idea to try one day, perhaps when they invent more effective children's sedatives. The guide alerted me to construction zones en route, as well as activities like hiking and museum visits.
Unlike other mapping sites, though, randmcnally.com did not give users a way to make hotel reservations, nor did it offer real-time traffic updates.
The traffic update feature is among the more helpful ones offered by mapquest .com. By clicking on a nearby city, you get information about traffic jams and their causes, so you can plan accordingly if, for instance, the backup is related to roadwork that is unfinished, or that is about to be cleared. Unfortunately, the site's technology can't yet take that information and give you an alternative route. Mapquest.com also understands what some of the other mapping sites apparently do not: that users often need to print out their maps -- and don't need all of the logos and advertisements thrown in. The site recently added a feature that allows users to get a printer-friendly version of its maps, thereby saving you lots of paper and ink and valuable minutes waiting for yet another page half filled with links and ads.
But while the printed versions of online maps are improving, they are still far from achieving the quality of those found off-line. In part, that's because highly detailed maps and road atlases are so dense with information that sites that try to reproduce them online slow to a crawl. Meanwhile, the average computer printer is unable to process those maps clearly enough to make them useful. When bandwidth and printers improve, executives for the map sites said, users will be able to print road atlases that are comparable to the ones now found in bookstores and gas stations.
Another feature starting to creep onto the pages of mapping Web sites is one that allows you to find fast-food restaurants and hotels. While getting directions from MapQuest, you can get information about a handful of such establishments. Such a feature is nice, if you happen to have a Six Flags, Microtel or a Denny's on your route, to name a few of the limited choices. But for more detailed information about restaurants, hotels, A.T.M.'s and other stops, mapblast.com is the most effective site.
Mapblast.com gives the locations of about 370 companies -- hotels, gas stations, restaurants, bookstores, even shoe stores. The site will put together an itinerary with those stores shown on the map and will provide information about where exactly to find them (though the markings are difficult to distinguish from one another). The only drawback is that if you are on a stretch of highway that doesn't include the five brands of gasoline listed on mapblast.com, you might pass by an exit with a gas station.
An alternative to the Web map sites -- at a cost -- is the navigation systems that are becoming increasingly common in cars. Luxury and economy auto makers alike are building Global Positioning System units into their cars, while companies like Garmin, Alpine, Magellan, Visteon and Clarion sell systems ranging in price from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand that consumers can install. The pricier systems will even speak the directions to you and plot detours if you run into a traffic jam after you've given the address of your destination verbally, and will alert you to points of interest along the way.
In other words, they're a far cry from the Internet's map sites, but then again, the map sites are free. And if handheld wireless devices improve, as they should, they will be able to deliver an array of information from the mapping sites that could rival the offerings of G.P.S. units.
Of course, even those who are not driving still need directions at times. In the Alaskan woods, or a city subway system, a map is a lifesaver. On this score, the map sites come up short. For back-country travelers, several sites -- including maps.com and mapquest.com -- now offer topographical maps, courtesy of another site, topozone .com. The maps, which show the contours of all 59,000 quadrants of land in the United States, are helpful for anyone planning a backwoods trip. But again, the fidelity of such maps on the average printer is poor.
City bus and subway maps are conspicuously absent from map sites; the best way to find them is to use search engines like Alta Vista and Google, which frequently lead you to the site of a city's transit authority. Most of those sites do offer maps -- often in a printer-friendly format. But as far as map sites go, the message for transit users is clear: find a cab.

The Timetable of Age Overtakes Stations

BYLINE: By BEN UPHAM 

 BODY:
SIXTY-THREE years after the last trains slowed for their platforms, after the last late commuters hurried through their handsome doorways, under their elegant roofs and colorful tiled archways, a few abandoned stations of the long-defunct Harlem branch of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad still cling to life in the Bronx. But they endure in a condition that barely hints at their original architectural beauty.
The stations, completed in 1908, were the work of the renowned architect Cass Gilbert (1859-1934), who designed them in a variety of styles so as to make each station unique. But Gilbert, whose many credits include the Woolworth Building, might be startled to learn that his stations were now housing such activities as a gun club, a pizza parlor and an adult entertainment establishment. 
 "They were widely admired stations that got the New Haven Railroad excellent publicity," said Steven Flanders, who is an author of the book "Cass Gilbert, Life and Work: Architect of the Public Domain," due next year from W. W. Norton. "And, as a result, he got the commission for the monumental Union Station in New Haven."
Writing in Architectural Record magazine the year they were finished, the critic Montgomery Schuyler described the stations as "great fun" and added, "The architectural pilgrim who gives a whole day to the branch will find himself not only repaid but rewarded."
The 11.5-mile Harlem branch ran from freight yards at 132nd Street in the South Bronx north to New Rochelle in Westchester County. The first tracks were built in 1866 and were bought in 1904 by the New Haven, which expanded them and added the stations. The branch, which was once intended to be the main route from New York to Boston, ended service in 1932 after years of declining revenues. Another local line used the stations for five more years, after which the tracks were used only for freight and express trains, including, currently, the Amtrak New York-to-Boston Acela service.
Of the 13 stations planned for the line, only 4 still stand. The others were torn down or never built. One reason they remain after decades of disuse is that they were built to last, according to Wayne Drummond, president of the New Haven Railroad Historical and Technical Association. "They built them for the ages," Mr. Drummond said, "unlike today, where they expect to tear them down in 20 years."
The station at Hunts Point, with its Dutch-style roof, has become a strip mall of sorts, with restaurants, a bar and a bodega sharing space in a structure that sits on Hunts Point Avenue in the shadow of the Bruckner Expressway.
The Morris Park Station, a dilapidated structure, surrounded by weeds, at the intersection of Paulson and Sacket Avenues, was once an exquisite bungalow of poly chromed tile and brick. The station has been used as a firing range since 1942; the walls are so thick that the shots reportedly cannot be heard outside.
The Italian palazzo-style station at Westchester Avenue, near the Bronx River, is abandoned but can be viewed from the Dyre Avenue IRT, which passes above it.
The fourth station, City Island, on Pelham Parkway, lies in near-ruins, its roof having caved in after a fire. This station has the most interesting history: it was once served by the city's first and only monorail. The monorail, which was built in 1909 and was just over a mile long, connected the station with City Island, an isolated community off Orchard Beach. The single car, named the Flying Lady, was capable of reaching speeds of 50 to 60 miles an hour, supported by one track below and two electrified tracks above.
On July 17, 1910, packed with 100 passengers, double its capacity, the Flying Lady fell off the track while rounding a curve. Several people were injured, and the company went bankrupt after several lawsuits. The monorail was closed in 1914 and replaced with safer and more economical cars running on a two-rail track.
The failure of the Harlem line and its closing only 24 years after its grand stations were completed was the result of an unlucky gamble by the New Haven Railroad on the future of New York. By the turn of the century, the New Haven was chafing at the fees it had to pay upon entering Grand Central Terminal. To avoid them, the company planned a massive new terminal on the Harlem River.
Being far from Midtown, the new terminal was a risk, but there was precedent: In 1871, Cornelius Vanderbilt had moved the Grand Central Depot from Park Row up to 42nd Street, "which was considered nowhere," Mr. Drummond said.
"People considered it nuts," he added. "However, the city moved north," and the New Haven "figured that within another 50 years the center of the city would be somewhere around 125th Street."
As it turned out, the city's 1916 zoning act, which restricted commercial development north of 59th Street, knocked the foundation out from under the New Haven's ambitious plans, and the Bronx lines withered with a tenth of the expected passengers.
But the old Harlem line may be resuscitated in a new form. Metro-North Railroad is considering a plan to run local commuter service along the tracks for the first time since 1937.
"Where people used to come from the suburbs, now people are traveling, during rush hour, north out of Grand Central and the Bronx to places such as White Plains, Stamford and Greenwich," said Dan Brucker, a spokesman for Metro-North Railroad. Local groups would also like to see the line reopened.
The stations, meanwhile, have gained acclaim along with their architect (a retrospective of Gilbert's work is at the New-York Historical Society, through Jan. 21.), and several campaigns are under way to rescue and preserve them. The New York Landmarks Conservancy, a nonprofit building conservation group, wants to save the stations, and the Point Community Development Corporation has nominated the Hunts Point Station for inclusion on the Great American Station Foundation's Most Endangered Station List.
"The stations were built to demonstrate to a waiting world that the New Haven was upgrading this line very sharply, and intended to make it permanent," Mr. Flanders said, "but permanency lasted only 20 years."

The Clouds of Technology and Politics

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Against a backdrop of political gridlock welcomed by no one on Wall Street, stocks fell broadly last week as the market absorbed yet another series of unnerving developments in high technology.
 Though it had little effect on the bond market, the election clearly cast a pall over stocks. "Buy-and-sell programs have been unplugged by the stalemate" in the presidential election, said Robert H. Stovall, senior market strategist at Prudential Securities. "People have moved further into cash." 
 Declining in every session, the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index ended the week at 3.028.99, down 12.2 percent. It was the Nasdaq's third-worst week on record.
 Other major gauges also gave ground, although some blue-chip stocks attracted money fleeing technology.
 Drug and tobacco stocks, in fact, climbed for the week, benefiting from the view that if George W. Bush won the presidential sweepstakes, political pressure on these industries would be reduced.
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 10,602.95, down 2 percent for the week. ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

Financial Aid Free-For-All As Students and Colleges Seek Deals

BYLINE: By EDWARD B. FISKE; Edward B. Fiske, a former education editor of The New York Times, is editor of the annual "Fiske Guide to Colleges" and co-author, with Bruce G. Hammond, of "The Fiske Guide to Getting into the Right College" (Random House).

 BODY:
When Simon Kendall was applying to college four years ago, he set his sights on a small liberal arts college in the Middle Atlantic region knowing that cost would be a factor in his decision. Haverford College was his first choice, but, like other elite private colleges, it offers financial aid only on the basis of a family's "demonstrated need."
Franklin and Marshall College, however, which boasts that it was founded in 1787 "to bring culture and civility" to what was then the Pennsylvania frontier, operates under no such restraints. It offered Mr. Kendall a package that included a merit scholarship that was nearly half again as large as the $18,000 that Haverford had calculated he would need. To seal the deal, it even threw in a free computer and a $3,000 travel grant. 
 Last June he graduated from F.&M.
Stories similar to Mr. Kendall's are becoming increasingly common as the financial aid practices of American colleges -- a system once marked by generally accepted rules and shared educational and social values -- are evolving into a nihilistic free-for-all. Colleges that once viewed scholarships as a way of opening their doors to needy students now view them primarily as tools for enhancing their own institutional prestige. Families of college-bound students are fighting back by using an offer from one college as a lever to squeeze extra dollars out of another one.
"Applying for financial aid used to be a relatively straightforward process," said Phyllis Steinbrecher, an admissions counselor in Westport, Conn. "Now it's a maze."
Students and parents attempting to get through the maze of financial aid should understand the language of the terrain well before they confront the application deadline, which is usually in February. Following is a guide to the rhetoric of financial-aid-speak:
Need-based financial aid -- In the mid-1950's, when American colleges and universities were facing an enrollment slump after an influx of Korean War veterans, some institutions began using scholarships to compete for the most attractive students. To avoid the academic equivalent of a gasoline price war, the country's leading colleges and universities formed the College Scholarship Service of the College Board and drew up a questionnaire to calculate the demonstrated financial need of families.
The principle of directing scholarship resources to the most financially needy was consistent with the social idealism of the 1960's and 1970's, and hundreds of colleges and universities embraced the mantra of need-based aid. Although their ranks are declining, the most wealthy and selective private colleges -- including, as Mr. Kendall discovered, Haverford -- still hold to this principle.
Need-blind admissions -- Hundreds of private colleges boast that they are "need-blind" in the sense that admissions decisions are made without regard to whether the student will be applying for scholarship assistance. Harvard College even goes so far as to require that members of the admissions committee who know the details of a particular student's financial situation recuse themselves from voting on that candidate.
Meeting demonstrated need -- For practical purposes, the key issue is not whether a college admits the most qualified students without regard to their financial circumstances but how far the college will go in meeting the demonstrated need of those they accept. Virtually all public institutions have need-blind admissions policies, but few, if any, agree to meet the full needs of their students. No one knows exactly how many colleges do meet the demonstrated need of everyone they accept, but informed estimates put the number at somewhere between 25 and 50 and dropping. They include Stanford, Duke and all of the Ivy League schools except Brown, as well as some elite small liberal arts colleges like Amherst, Pomona and Wellesley.
Charles Karelis, the president of Colgate University, said that his institution was forced to take financial need into consideration for about 50 students each year and that he hoped to find the funds to make the university need-blind in the pure sense. "It's not just about equity; it's about quality," he said. "A lot of what students learn in college comes from each other. If I am a full-pay parent, I want to know that the students my child will go to school with are chosen because of who they are, not because of how much money they have."
Merit scholarships -- Need-based financial aid policies began to erode in the late 1970's, when the last baby boomers were working their way through the higher education system, and admissions directors faced the prospect of empty classroom seats. Second- and third-tier schools began to offer merit scholarships to attract academically able students. That practice has now spread to highly selective schools, including some that are need-blind and meet full demonstrated need. Macalester College in St. Paul, Minn., for example, offers a $5,000 tuition discount to any student who is a National Merit Scholar regardless of financial circumstances.
Many in the admissions world are troubled that most merit scholarships go to students who would attend college anyway. "The idealism that existed in financial aid about wanting to make it possible for students from any background to come to college is being lost," said Paul Thiboutot, dean of admissions at Carleton College. "We are no longer using limited funds in the most equitable way."
Preferential packaging -- Colleges compete for students not only on the basis of how much aid they offer but on how the aid packages are divided among grants, on-campus jobs and loans. The most sought-after students are offered packages loaded toward grants, while those lower down the preference scale get packages with a higher proportion of loans.
Preferential packaging is common, even among selective schools like Cornell University that do not offer merit aid. "Preferential packaging has become the equivalent of merit aid for some institutions that wish their financial aid programs to remain fully need-based," wrote James Monks, a senior economist at the Consortium on Financing Higher Education.
Subjective definitions of need -- The days when families and colleges could rely on the College Scholarship Service questionnaire to define how much a family would be expected to contribute to their child's education are now long gone. Congress has established a separate federal methodology for the distribution of public funds. Peter van Buskirk, associate vice president for enrollment management at Franklin and Marshall, said colleges varied the standard depending on how eager they were to enroll a particular student. "You look for the strongest leveraging point," he said.
Offer matching -- Like appliance dealers who make a point of meeting the advertised price of any competitor, many institutions, even Harvard, now actively encourage prospective students to show them other offers and give them a chance to respond.
"Our message to students is: if you get a better package from one of our competitors, let us know," said Michael Steidel, director of admissions at Carnegie Mellon University. Last year Carnegie Mellon received 773 requests to take a second look and responded positively to 442 of them, with an average increase of $3,900 a year.
Early Decision -- The most striking recent trend in college admissions has been the push by colleges toward more "early decision." Many colleges, including some of the most prestigious, now fill more than a third of their classes this way. College admissions directors like early decision because, by locking up a high proportion of seats in December, colleges can send out fewer offers in March and thus appear to be more selective. But early decision complicates the situation for financial aid applicants, who are left with only one take-it-or-leave offer. "We tell students right up front: If financial aid is important to you, it is best to apply for regular admissions," Mr. Steidel said.
As occurred in the 1950's, something of a backlash is now developing against the extent to which colleges are using financial aid to promote their own institutional prestige rather than the broader social goal of enhanced access to higher education.
Michael S. McPherson, the president of Macalester College, and Morton Owen Schapiro, the president of Williams College, have called for a "national effort to restore the commitment of colleges and governments to the principle of meeting students' financial need."
They want Congress to pass a law that will permit colleges to enter into agreements to apply common standards for assessing need and awarding aid "without running afoul of antitrust laws." They have also called for a new federal student-aid program that would provide extra funds to students at colleges that adhere to need-based principles of awarding financial aid.
Ronald G. Ehrenberg, director of the Cornell Higher Education Research Institute, suggests that colleges are asking for trouble by using financial aid primarily to advance their own interests rather than those of students and society at large. Noting that Congress requires private foundations to spend at least 5 percent of the value of their endowments each year to maintain their tax-free status, he wrote:
"Although there were good reasons for their having done so, selective private institutions that continue to raise tuition by much more than the rate of inflation, that back off of their commitment to maintain accessibility and that continue to exhibit large endowment growth may well be courting potential disaster. They will be almost 'asking' to be regulated."
 
Maximizing the Chances of Getting a Good Aid Package
 
Students and families can take a number of steps to maximize their chances of receiving satisfactory financial aid packages. Following are some tips from financial aid professionals:
 
1. Have a family discussion early on about the role that price will play in selecting a college. "If parents are not able, or not willing, to pay $30,000 a year for college through current income and loans, then this should be understood from the beginning," said Kalman A. Chany, an author and financial aid counselor in New York City. "April is not a good time to have this kind of discussion."
 
2. Do an early projection of the aid for which you are likely to qualify. Many colleges will assist families in doing this even before they apply. Parents can get an appointment with the financial aid office while the child is doing the campus tour.
 
3. Look beyond sticker prices. Schools with the highest tuition rates also tend to have the most financial aid. You may end up paying less at a private college than at a public university with few scholarships to offer.
4. Include one or two financial aid "safety" schools in your application list. "Just be sure that these are schools you would like to attend," Richard Avitabile, director of admissions at New York University, said.
 
5. Push schools about their financial aid policies. "Get ballpark information on whether a school is need-blind, what proportion of students receive financial aid, the average size of an award and so forth," said William C. Hiss, vice president of Bates College.
 
6. Keep merit scholarships in perspective. A large merit award from College of the Perpetual Magnolia may be flattering, but it may also be a sign that the college needs to "buy" qualified students. "Students who are offered large merit scholarships should ask themselves whether they want to be in a situation where they are the elite," said Elizabeth J. McCormick, director of financial aid at Wesleyan University. Saving a few thousand dollars in the short run may undermine the long-term value of your investment in higher education. EDWARD B. FISKE

 Having just returned from Venezuela, I saw more poverty, more misery, a lot less employment and more talk from local employers about closing down more companies and laying off more employees.
More money is needed for education and health. Less damaging talk is needed to keep the rich from closing factories and laying off thousands of unskilled workers who make less than $200 a month.
And less damaging talk is a must to bring in investment from the United States, Europe and Asia. Associating one's regime with failed leaderships in Cuba, for example, will not do that.

HEADLINE: Dissecting the Deal;
If AOL and Time Warner Do Merge, Regulators, Competitors and Analysts Wonder How the Pieces Will Add Up

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
THE two companies promise to create a 21st-century bridge between the new Internet economy and the venerable entertainment and publishing industries.
Government antitrust officials, meanwhile, are trying to prevent the companies from building too powerful an information-age monolith. 
 So what exactly is this new entity, AOL Time Warner, which is intent on completing its long-planned merger in the coming weeks -- unless the Federal Trade Commission decides to block it?
On Wall Street, the emerging entity is clearly seen as America Online, which used its high stock price last January to clinch an agreement to buy Time Warner's hard assets cheaply and is now installing its own management. But seen from the trenches of the movie, television, music, publishing and online industries, AOL Time Warner looks remarkably similar to the old Time Warner -- with a big new Internet division.
Time Warner, after all, has long been a company that combined substantial content -- movies, TV shows, music and news -- with a range of distribution conduits, including cable systems, cable channels, a broadcast network and publishing companies. The new opportunities and pitfalls that come with AOL's huge online distribution system are simply new variations on themes that have been playing out at Time Warner for years:
* Cross promotion. AOL and Time Warner executives have made much of their early attempts to promote Time Warner movies and magazine subscriptions on the AOL service and their plans to put AOL disks in Time Warner magazines.
* Bundling. The companies talk of offering advertisers packages with everything from banner ads to licenses to Bugs Bunny.
* Preferred distribution. Just as Time Warner must now decide whether Home Box Office will feature Warner Brothers movies or the fare of other studios, the new company would have to carefully judge how much to use its online presence in 25 million homes to favor its other properties.
These issues, especially as they relate to high-speed Internet access and interactive TV, have been the sticking points in the federal review. Last Thursday, the F.T.C. gave the companies three more weeks to reach a compromise. The package of articles, outlined below, examine the prospects and competitive issues -- business by business -- in the merger. SAUL HANSELL

HEADLINE: DISSECTING THE DEAL: MUSIC;
Tapping the Internet's Power As an 'Obsession Incubator'

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

 BODY:
It is difficult to find a consensus on what the pending merger of Time Warner and America Online means for the music industry.
Some music industry analysts contend that the combination would give Warner Music, which is now third in market share in the United States, an enviable edge in competing against rivals like Seagram's Universal/ MCA and Sony for a bigger share of the nation's highly competitive music business. 
 Those holding this view see AOL as a valuable means for promoting Warner releases at the expense of rivals. "The Internet is a very effective obsession incubator," said Pat Keane, a senior analyst at Jupiter Research. "It makes it easier to hype an artist by seeding chat rooms and fan rooms."
Michael J. Wolf, a media strategist at the management consulting firm Booz-Allen & Hamilton, agreed. "There is better shelf space, better promotion, so they have a better chance at building a relationship with the consumer," he said.
But Christopher Dixon, an analyst at UBS Warburg, said any edge Time Warner and AOL gained through Internet marketing would be eroded by alliances being formed by rivals.
Mr. Dixon said Bertelsmann, for example, would gain clout if it succeeded in current efforts to merge its music business with the EMI Group -- the British recording company that Time Warner would have acquired if European regulators had not blocked the deal. And he noted Bertelsmann's recently announced investment in Napster, the Internet music file swapping service.
But AOL is already weighing its own subscription music service. Certainly, AOL customers are already conditioned to paying for product, several music industry experts pointed out. And analysts say that by aligning with AOL, Warner Music could be more effective at selling its back catalog in the form of digital music files.
But why would consumers be content to pay for a service that offered only Warner Music, said Bruce Greenwald, an economics and finance professor at Columbia University. And if AOL offered music of other companies, then how much advantage does the merger give Warner Music over its rivals?
"Why did they need to merge to get those advantages?" Professor Greenwald asked.

HEADLINE: OPEC Delays Decision on Raising Output

BYLINE: By NEELA BANERJEE 

DATELINE: VIENNA, Nov. 12

 BODY:
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries chose the Venezuelan oil minister, Ali Rodriguez Araque, as its new secretary general today, paving the way for the producers' group to deal with pressing questions of oil output more expeditiously at a time when prices remain stubbornly high. But OPEC put off until January any decision on changing current production levels.
The selection of Mr. Rodriguez, which OPEC members made after meeting in informal sessions in their hotel rooms here, was unofficially disclosed by Qatar's oil minister, Abdullah bin Hamad al-Attiyah. It is expected be announced at a news conference here on Monday morning. OPEC chose not to hold an official meeting today in observance of an Austrian day of mourning for more than 150 victims of a cable car fire. 
 Mehdi Varzi, director of research at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, praised the selection of a secretary general. "This is very good," he said, "because now they can get to the real matters of production at hand."
Despite oil prices that have stayed above $30 a barrel for months, oil ministers of the 11-member group said they had decided to forgo yet another increase in production now. Late last month, OPEC chose to lift production by 500,000 barrels a day because of the persistent high prices, its fourth increase since March. OPEC nations produced roughly 29.5 million barrels a day in October, according to the International Energy Agency in Paris, or almost 40 percent of the world's crude oil.
OPEC will most likely take up the production question again at a meeting on Jan. 17, Mr. Attiyah said.
The main reason the producers' group is reluctant to increase output is that almost none of the members, except Saudi Arabia, have the excess capacity to pump more oil. Moreover, OPEC members fear that yet another increase, in response to constant pressure from importing countries, like the United States, would lead to a glut of petroleum early next year and set off a steep drop in the commodity price of oil.
Production increases take time to work themselves through ports, pipelines and refineries, so their effect on retail oil prices and on national economies is often delayed.
OPEC members maintain that the full effect of their production increases this year has yet to be felt. Indeed, the International Energy Agency forecast on Thursday that at current output levels, crude oil supplies will exceed demand by 1.3 million barrels a day in the first quarter of 2001. Even now, OPEC members, whose economies depend almost entirely on revenue from oil exports, recall how a production increase in late 1997 caused a free fall in the price of oil, driving it down at one point to about $10 a barrel.
So despite the high retail prices now for gasoline and heating oil, if crude oil prices start falling too fast by the mid-January meeting, OPEC may even choose to cut production.
Mr. Rodriguez, 63, who has served as OPEC's presiding officer, will take over as secretary general on Jan. 1. He has spent most of this year trying to calm the oil markets and to unify the cartel. While the markets often treat OPEC pronouncements with skepticism, Mr. Rodriguez has built close ties with the oil ministers of several member nations that commonly quarreled among themselves and delayed key decisions.
"This is positive for OPEC because he represents them well," said Falah Aljibury, an independent oil consultant in Palo Alto, Calif. "He is capable of saying diplomatic things to the market, but he leaves the actions to the members, which is what they like."
In order to remain independent of national concerns, Mr. Rodriguez, a lawyer and economist, will probably have to leave his post as Venezuela's minister of energy and mines. He will be replaced as OPEC president by the Algerian oil minister, Chakib Khelil, OPEC officials said.

HEADLINE: Yugoslavia Is Cheered but Faces Cheerless Times

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, Nov. 12

 BODY:
The new Yugoslavia has been welcomed back to the world almost uncritically by a United States and a Europe that cannot quite believe their luck. Slobodan Milosevic, the autocrat who stirred such turmoil in the Balkans for so long, is gone.
But the new Yugoslav and Serbian governments are finding that Mr. Milosevic's rule left enormous holes in their budgets for basic needs like electricity, food and pensions, and a West that never believed Mr. Milosevic would fall so quickly has been caught unprepared, promising quick aid but scrambling to deliver it. 
 Elections for a new Serbian Parliament and government -- and Serbia is where the real power lies here -- are on Dec. 23, and should be the vital moment when the anti-Milosevic coalition, already bickering viciously, is consolidated in power.
But since Mr. Milosevic was overthrown in early October, the people of Serbia have suffered prolonged electric shortages and power cuts and price rises on basic foods that brought inflation in October alone to 27 percent, after the artificially restricted increases of 2 to 3 percent a month under Mr. Milosevic.
The weather has been mild but will soon turn cold, putting sharp new strains on energy supplies before the election; the pension system is broke, and there are significant shortages of cooking oil, sugar and medicine.
Western diplomats and officials recognize the need for speedy support for the new Yugoslav president, Vojislav Kostunica, and his allies in the 18-party coalition still known as DOS, or the Democratic Opposition of Serbia.
Serbian officials say they need $500 million in energy, food, medicine and pension support to get through the winter -- $2 million a day alone for electricity and natural gas. Western help is coming, but slowly, tied up with bureaucratic and political restrictions.
"Serbia needs assistance right now and a timely supply of the fuel and electricity will consolidate democratic processes in the country," said the Serbian deputy prime minister, Nebojsa Covic.
Goran Pitic, an opposition economist who has suddenly become the Serbian minister for foreign economic cooperation, said: "People are proud of getting rid of Milosevic and will put up with lots of sacrifice. But already people grumble about why we seem incompetent at providing basic needs."
Nada Maricic, a pensioner of 78, said she lacked electricity for six hours a day and most of the night. "When we were bombed, we had electricity until the end, and now, not," she said, referring to the 78 days of bombing by NATO last year. "The new ones will learn. I just hope they will learn fast."
Katarina Bogicic, a student of 18, said, laughing: "It would almost be better to cut off the electricity altogether. It shuts off when I come home and starts up just when I'm ready to leave. It really gets on my nerves." Still, she said, "I'm proud of people."
"We know if we don't have electricity now, we'll have it next year," she said.
The Milosevic government used most of its reserves to get through the election of Sept. 24, said Miroljub Labus, the federal deputy prime minister. Now, he said, the opposition must prove its mettle, and it needs help from the West that promised it.
"Frankly speaking, we have enough in promises, and we're grateful," he said. "But disbursement is another problem -- it's a question of timing. The European Union is moving incredibly fast by their standards, but it's not fast enough for us. We're in the middle of an energy crisis, and below that, we have a deep social crisis, with low wages and people very nervous about their future."
Mr. Pitic said: "We appreciate all help but we need more, especially from the big players. Our message is: cash. We don't have to see that cash, but there are bills to be paid. We're a transitional government before the elections, and our main task is heating, electricity, food and wages. Then we can worry about price stability and economic transformation."
The European Union, spurred by Christopher Patten, its foreign-policy commissioner, has been pushing its varied countries and officials to get electricity and oil to Yugoslavia as fast as they can.
"We've been bending every rule to get help here even a day sooner, especially energy, food and medicine," said Michael Graham, the European Union ambassador here. "But with the best will in the world, it's complicated."
When Mr. Milosevic fell, "money for Serbia wasn't even there," Mr. Graham said. "Three months ago, everyone yawned and said Milosevic would be in power for at least another year."
Mr. Patten and the European Union wrenched 200 million euros ($165 million) for Serbia out of special reserve funds. Some $66 million will go for energy, and the rest for food, medicine, schools and support for the news media. But even that aid cannot flow until after a European ministerial meeting on Nov. 20.
The United States is offering a total of $100 million for this year (nearly three times the $35 million given last year), but the first $10 million, to be used urgently to buy electricity, is being held up by Senator Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican who wants assurances on American policy toward possible independence for Montenegro.
Congress has also put conditions about Belgrade's cooperation with the Hague tribunal on war crimes on the use of the aid after March 31. Washington has authorized an extra $20 million in emergency food aid to be distributed by the World Food Program, aimed at pensioners and internally displaced people in Serbia -- which now has more refugees from its wars than any other country in Europe -- and the Europeans have done the same. The average salary here is now about $40 a month, down from $100 in 1997.
But most of the American aid will not arrive until next year.
To get started quickly, the European Union resurrected a program devised last year to help cities then ruled by the anti-Milosevic opposition to get oil. The first shipment arrived at the border of Bosnia and Serbia on Saturday, with 10,000 tons of fuel, worth some $1.5 million, arriving over the next 20 days for those seven cities.
"It's not enough," Mr. Graham said. "But it takes a strain off the system."
Serbian officials have been scrambling, with Bulgaria supplying extra electricity in return for promises of money from the United Nations mission in Kosovo, which owes Serbia $19 million for electricity used last year. Even the Serbian republic in Bosnia has been providing extra electricity to Belgrade.
Mr. Kostunica went to Moscow to get promises of natural gas supplies, vital to heat large parts of Serbia, but the Russians, already owed nearly $300 million, are offering only about a month's supply, and that on credit. Mr. Labus is grateful, given Moscow's own financial problems, but more negotiations are necessary.
There have also been offers of aid from individual European countries, including Italy (some $50 million), Germany ($25 million), Greece ($7 million for electricity imports) and Norway ($9 million and a loan vital to Belgrade's reentry into the International Monetary Fund).
The British are offering just $1.75 million over the next two months, half of that for energy. In general, Mr. Labus said, promises of aid total about $455 million, "but timing is everything."
Still, opinion polls show that Mr. Kostunica and his allies are widely popular, while Mr. Milosevic's Socialists are scrambling to redefine themselves. Despite the economic problems and internal squabbling, the democratic coalition is expected to hold together long enough to win the elections next month and form a government.
"But then the real problems begin," said Jurij Bajec, a respected economist. "There are 10 years of isolation to fix," with a painful process of economic change and market transition that will inevitably create further unemployment, inflation and political unhappiness.
"People will vote for DOS, but after a few months they will ask, legitimately, for real improvement in their lives and their wages," Mr. Labus said. "I need to boost economic activity in the spring, and right now I really don't have any instruments to do it."
Serious aid for reconstruction will not arrive until mid-2001, he said. "But what do I do between February and June?"

HEADLINE: Illegal Tobacco Traffic

 BODY:
For years now European authorities have been trying to combat the growing black-market trade in American cigarettes in Europe. Earlier this month the European Union's executive commission filed a damage suit in federal court in New York against the Philip Morris Company and the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. It charged the cigarette makers with money-laundering and taking other fraudulent actions to pursue a "massive, ongoing smuggling scheme." The European officials estimate that they lose more than $1.5 billion annually in cigarette tax revenues as a result of smuggling operations.
The lawsuit, which accuses the companies of violating federal racketeering law, will no doubt face jurisdictional challenges by the defendants over the use of American courts to collect another country's taxes. But the filing of the suit is not surprising. More than two years ago, European authorities sought help from the United States on the contraband problem. They have long believed that American companies knowingly sell billions of cigarettes to dealers who supply criminal rings. The lawsuit accuses the defendants of facilitating, through their distribution routes and mechanisms, the smuggling of cigarettes into Europe. 
 Experts estimate that perhaps as much as one-fourth of the billions of American cigarettes sold overseas end up in the contraband pipeline. In the last decade, the volume of smuggling has nearly tripled. Tobacco executives have insisted they have no knowledge of smuggling. But it is hard to imagine that manufacturers could sell shiploads of cigarettes without knowing where the product was going. Besides, their failure to cooperate with foreign authorities shows they have no interest in destroying a lucrative market.
Over the past decade, American tobacco companies have set their sights on increasing their market share abroad, particularly as they faced staggering lawsuits and public hostility at home. The European Commission's suit contends that supporting and encouraging smugglers was done to lure new customers to American brands by helping them evade high taxes and import duties.
The tobacco industry record in this area has been highly suspect. In 1998 a subsidiary of R. J. Reynolds pleaded guilty to criminal charges and paid $15 million in penalties for its involvement in a scheme to smuggle cigarettes into Canada. Canadian officials long ago concluded that their cigarette makers, affiliated with American and British tobacco companies, were aware of smuggling rings that evaded high Canadian cigarette taxes.
The Canadian government sued R. J. Reynolds in federal court in Syracuse for $1 billion for its involvement in smuggling. That suit was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds, and Canada is appealing the ruling. Meanwhile, Colombia has filed a smuggling lawsuit against Philip Morris.
The tobacco companies deny that they direct or condone illegal traffic. But there is no doubt they benefit enormously from it. Foreign governments are right to take action to crack down on American contraband. The companies should be made liable for their failure to prevent a large percentage of their products from entering the illegal pipeline.

HEADLINE: Bodies and Questions in an Austrian Tunnel

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: KAPRUN, Austria, Nov. 12

 BODY:
Evacuation workers struggling through the night in a dark and cold Alpine tunnel began extracting the bodies of about 155 people, including eight Americans, who perished on Saturday when a cable car they were riding to a ski run was destroyed in an inferno of flames.
Officials said the bodies of those killed in Austria's worst Alpine disaster were so badly maimed that they could be positively identified only by DNA testing, which is expected to begin on Monday. 
 The rumble of rescue helicopters could be heard through the day over this mountain village, population 3,500, as about 80 rescue workers entered the tunnel to begin carrying out the bodies on stretchers. The bodies were then transported by helicopter to a tent at the foot of the cable car rails, which stretch about two and a half miles to an Alpine glacier favored by skiers.
On Saturday morning, the cable car, which can transport as many as 180 people, wormed its way through the tunnel that pierces the Kitzsteinhorn mountain. Skiers and snow boarders, many of them teenagers and younger children, were traveling to the snow-dusted glacier for a morning of skiing. But as the cable car moved through the mountain, fire broke out, transforming the tunnel into a chimney of fierce smoke and flames.
The Austrian government declared a state of mourning, and in Vienna, the capital, dignitaries including the Austrian president, Thomas Klestil, joined thousands of people at a service in the city's cathedral. Public buildings, including the Vienna State Opera, were draped in black, and flags flew at half staff.
The deaths "leave us speechless, since nothing more now can be done," the chancellor, Wolfgang Schussel, said at an ecumenical service here, near the foot of the cable car tracks. "Consolation can come only from our faith and our church."
The accident has sent Austrians into a frenzy of soul-searching. The Alpine region lives increasingly on tourism revenue, and the question of just how safe its winter sport facilities are has been cast into stark relief. Mr. Schussel, at a news conference in a local gymnasium, said Austria spent millions of dollars annually to ensure "an extremely high level of safety" in its skiing centers. But he said experts would search to find out what more should be done. The Kaprun cable car, he said, would not be put back into service until the cause of the accident had been determined and corrective steps taken.
The accident is certain to fuel discussion of the safety of Alpine tunnels in general. In May 1999, a fire in the Tauern auto tunnel in Salzburg Province killed 12 people. Earlier last year, a raging fire in the Mont Blanc tunnel that connects France and Italy left 39 people dead.
Emergency crews could begin entering the Kitzsteinhorn tunnel only this afternoon, after the tunnel had cooled and toxic gases formed by the fire had dissipated. Electrical lighting had to be assembled so workers could pick their way through the burned and twisted wreckage, strewn with the bodies of the victims.
An Austrian police officer overseeing the evacuation, Maj. Franz Lang, described the inside of the tunnel as "relatively dark, cold, with some smoke in some areas." He said that the exact number of victims was still unknown, but that it could be as high as 175.
Walther Thaler, a regional deputy to the Austrian Parliament in Vienna, said a rescue worker had told him the scene in the tunnel was "so horrific he did not want to describe it for the sake of the families."
Officials said the victims included more than 90 Austrians or Germans, 2 Slovenes, a Croat, 10 Japanese and 8 Americans from the United States Army's Leighton Barracks, near Wurzburg, Germany, who were members of a military ski club vacationing in Austria. Other members of the American group were apparently spared the disaster when they chose to go shopping on Saturday rather than ski, a member of the group said.
Maj. Drew Stathis, one of the American group, was quoted by The Associated Press as saying that among the Americans not accounted for was a family of four, including two children.
But Franz Schausberger, governor of the province of Salzburg, which includes Kaprun, said the identification of the victims by nationality was based only on circumstantial information, like tourist lists and indications from friends or family members, and thus had to be taken "with corresponding caution."
Positive identification of individuals will be possible, he said, only by means of DNA testing. Beginning on Monday, the bodies will be transported to forensic laboratories in Salzburg, about 60 miles northeast of here, and relatives of the presumed victims will be asked to supply material for genetic comparison.
As a cloudless sunny day gave way to a crisp cold night and full moon, many had no idea whether their loved ones had been found or removed from the tunnel. "The waiting, the waiting is awful," said the Rev. Peter Hofer, the local Catholic pastor, who celebrated a Mass of mourning for the victims today. In the Gothic chapel of St. Margaretha, perched above the tiny village of chalets straddling a mountain stream, townspeople came through the day to light candles and pray.
Along the streets, residents placed candles in front of their homes. .
Wolfgang Poiger, a dairy technician in his 30's who had come from the neighboring resort of Zell am See with his wife and two children, said he first realized something was wrong on Saturday when helicopters passed through the Alpine valleys with increasing frequency. His wife said they were awaiting news of the 8-year old daughter of friends, who was believed to have been aboard the cable car.
Like many villages in the Austrian Alps, Kaprun subsisted from farming until after World War II. To spur the economy, the government erected a major hydroelectric plant nearby after the war. But it was not until the region discovered its full tourism potential based on hiking in summer and skiing in winter that it gained in affluence.
Among the old Alpine farmhouses, with their peaked roofs and gingerbread balconies, are now cozy hotels created in similar style. Blessed with the presence of one of Austria's two or three glaciers, affording almost year-round skiing, the region attracts skiers from across Europe and beyond.
Mr. Thaler, the legislator, said Kaprun drew an estimated 100,000 skiers and other vacationers each year.
The cable car, more than 90 feet long, travels on rail tracks but is pulled up the tunnel by cable, much as San Francisco's cable cars are moved. It had gone about 600 yards into the two-and-a-half-mile tunnel when the fire erupted.
Officials said the cause of the fire was not yet known. But Mr. Schausberger, the governor, said that "we are assuming that the fire spread with lightning speed," making the use of fire extinguishers or other emergency measures aboard the cable car impossible. Other officials said a metal stairs of more than 10,000 steps went the length of the tunnel as an escape route, but were also impossible to use.
Major Lang said the bodies of victims had been found behind, in front of and underneath the charred and twisted remains of the cable car.
Twelve passengers escaped the inferno, when a man described as a burly Bavarian smashed a cable car window and urged others to follow him through the window and down the tunnel to safety.
Others not even in the cable car were less lucky. The driver of a cable car that was descending the tunnel at the same time was burned to death by hot smoke and flames sucked up the tunnel by the draft. Three people waiting for the next cable car at the station atop the line were similarly burned to death.
Mr. Schausberger said the rescue workers were entering the tunnel from above and through an emergency shaft that leads into the tunnel about a third of the way down its mountain course. Other workers, he said, were seeking to secure the remains of the cable car.
Because of possible damage to the cable, it was feared that the twisted remains could break loose and race down the track to the base, causing further damage, he said.

HEADLINE: 2 Weeks Starting Today to Argue Fine and Crucial Details of Cutting Greenhouse Gas

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
After four years of tortuous negotiations, a treaty aimed at curtailing global warming faces its greatest obstacles yet in the next two weeks as officials from around the world meet in the Netherlands to tussle over the fine print.
The pivotal talks, which begin today in The Hague, come on the heels of new scientific reports with the strongest evidence so far that people, mainly through the burning of fossil fuels, have contributed substantially to a warming trend that could disrupt weather patterns, ecosystems and agriculture around the world. 
 The treaty, called the Kyoto Protocol, requires industrialized nations to reduce releases of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the atmosphere. It has been signed by representatives of more than 100 countries, including the United States, but cannot take effect until a substantial number of the industrial nations ratify it.
So far, none have done so. Most important would be the approval of the United States, far and away the world's largest producer of heat-trapping gases, and without whose participation, specialists say, the effort is bound to falter.
Even if the details can be worked out over the next two weeks, the presidential election may have further clouded the accord's future.
Gov. George W. Bush has questioned the science pointing to a warming trend caused by human activity, and he opposes the treaty, which bears the imprint of the Clinton administration -- and particularly of Vice President Al Gore, who flew to the pivotal session in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997 to prod feuding delegates into agreement on key points.
Mr. Bush has said, however, that he would support a requirement of some reductions in carbon dioxide emissions from power plants.
If Mr. Gore wins, some treaty experts say that in a few years he might be able to build sufficient support in the Senate to approve the treaty, but it would be an uphill fight, requiring the consent of 67 of 100 members of the Senate, which with the current election is close to evenly divided.
In other countries, negotiators say, there is a great enough sense of urgency to give the sessions at The Hague a chance of success.
Pressure for action in Europe to reduce fuel use has intensified partly because of recent spikes in already high fuel prices and a string of devastating floods and storms that have been cited as a taste of what may lie ahead if the world's climate is disrupted. Other countries are feeling pressure, too, if indirectly.
"It's the bottom of the ninth, and the bases are truly loaded," said John W. Ashe, a negotiator and ambassador to the United Nations from Antigua and Barbuda, a Caribbean country of 67,000. Island nations, which are vulnerable should the melting glaciers and polar icecaps raise sea levels, have been some of the most passionate proponents of the treaty. "It's time for countries to step up to the plate."
If enacted, the treaty would commit industrialized nations over the next 8 to 12 years to reduce their emissions by at least 5 percent below the levels of 1990, the year chosen as the benchmark.
Developing countries, including giants like China and India, would pledge to seek emissions limits in the future, but would not be legally bound to do so. These countries emit far less greenhouse pollution than industrial nations now, but are expected to surpass many of them within two decades. Many American senators say this lets the developing nations off the hook.
Even as negotiations over the treaty have dragged on, emission levels of many of the world's big producers of greenhouse gases have continued to rise, particularly as economies have grown. This in turn has increased the pressure on negotiators for cheap solutions that are the least politically risky.
The United States, for instance, is producing nearly 22 percent more warming emissions now than in 1990, while under the treaty it would be required to reduce those gases by 7 percent below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012.
In fact, energy experts say, of the 34 industrial nations involved, only Germany and Britain have a good chance of meeting their emissions targets, and they are likely to do so because of policies that are being pursued in any case. Britain, for instance, is closing obsolete coal mines, and Germany is dismantling the grime-belching factories left behind during Communist rule in the east.
As a result, private environmental groups say there are many efforts under way to increase loopholes in the proposed treaty. "They are trying to renegotiate the meaning of the numbers, making it easier to meet the targets," said Alden Meyer, director of government relations for the Union of Concerned Scientists, a private environmental group in Washington. "The result could be we'll have a treaty, but the atmosphere would still be suffering."
As it stands, even the current treaty is seen by many climate experts and ecologists as baby steps toward addressing the effects of a century in which fuels were burned with abandon. And much remains to be done before it can take effect.
The United States disagrees sharply with other countries on central points of the accord -- like how to penalize nations that fail to reach targets and whether to give credit for shifts away from coal and oil that involve alternatives like nuclear plants, hydroelectric dams or new systems that burn a dirty fuel, coal, with fewer emissions.
The United States, which potentially stands to face the greatest economic cost from cutting emissions, is one of several countries that think nothing should be rejected out of hand. It, for instance, along with Australia and other countries with lots of open space, prefers allowing more credits for efforts to sop up carbon dioxide by planting trees, while more crowded European countries want to limit this option.
Such disagreements and the politics surrounding the conference, many participants in the negotiations say, are helping to make the forthcoming sessions in The Hague a make-or-break effort.
The thousands of delegates and observers gathering in the Netherlands represent agendas as varied as the geography, economies and cultures of the countries from which they come.
There are Washington lobbyists representing oil-producing kingdoms who have succeeded for years in slowing the treaty with challenges aimed in part at compensating their clients once the world begins to wean itself away from petroleum.
There are European lawyers representing low-lying island nations and those of other poor countries seeking a range of payments to help fend off rising seas and to absorb other effects of climate change.
There are environmental campaigners who plan to build a dike of sandbags around the conference hall to illustrate the threat of future flooding.
And in the middle of all this are more than 160 national delegations, many of which have formed negotiating blocs.
The list of differences over differences and details is enough to dizzy the most seasoned negotiator, participants said.
The 15 nations of the European Union, pressed by an influential Green movement, are insisting on strict limits on how much credit a country can gain by investing in emissions-cutting projects abroad. Their goal is to have most cuts occur on home soil, through increased energy efficiency or by replacing old coal-fired power plants with clean-energy sources like windmills.
By contrast, the United States seeks to be able to spend money on emissions reductions wherever they can be done most cheaply, and to harness market forces through a global trading system for carbon dioxide similar to an American system for reducing sulfur pollution that causes acid rain.
Another key dispute is over how much forests can be used to gain credits for absorbing carbon dioxide. Environmental groups and the Europeans oppose large-scale use of this tactic, saying that planting trees where others have been cut down results in no net carbon reduction and that preserving one forest may simply prompt the cutting of another forest somewhere else.
Also, critics say, forests are not a secure repository because the carbon dioxide can easily be freed up d by fires, assault from pests or as climate shifts occur.
The United States, in turn, has criticized the European position on penalties for failure to meet targets. Europe proposes a simple cash payment for each ton of carbon dioxide missed. But American negotiators, and some environmental campaigners, say this would allow nations simply to buy their way out of legal obligations.
"Some rivers in Europe have schemes where you pay to pollute," said Fred Krupp, the executive director of Environmental Defense, a private group. "On this point," he said, "they are for ripping the teeth out of" the treaty.
The United States has proposed penalties in the form of larger subsequent cuts in greenhouse gases -- essentially payment with interest. But critics say that this would simply put off the emissions reductions.
To take effect, the protocol must be ratified by any combination of industrialized countries with combined 1990 greenhouse emissions of 55 percent of the industrial world's total. This could happen without the United States, which accounted for 36 percent of total emissions in 1990.
The European Union, with 24.2 percent of emissions, has said that it might seek an alliance with Russia, at 17.4 percent, and Japan (8.5 percent), and so reach the threshold for the treaty to go into force. Still, many participants say, the effort is bound to falter if the world's largest source of greenhouse pollutants does not sign on.
For now, at least, the leader of the American negotiating team, Frank E. Loy, under secretary of state for global affairs, said he is committed to seeking changes in The Hague that produce real cuts in greenhouse gases that are affordable and fair, and thus acceptable to the Senate.
In an interview last week, Mr. Loy said that the strengthening scientific evidence behind the greenhouse effect will help build support for the treaty in Congress, as will recent decisions by companies like Ford, Shell, Polaroid and DuPont to press ahead with cuts in greenhouse gas emissions and efforts to create new pollution-free technologies.
"With the increasing clarity of the science and increasing participation of the business community," he said, "it gets clearer and clearer that no administration is going to be able to ignore this issue."

Another Difficult Week Looms for Weary Israelis
When a hijacked Russian passenger plane landed in Israel, it heightened a prevalent feeling among Israelis that this tense period is bound to be defined by unpredictable and unsettling events. The incident temporarily diverted Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who was en route to Washington for talks with President Clinton. Israel later learned that Yitzhak Rabin's widow, Leah Rabin, had died. A1 

Mr. Barak met with President Clinton at the White House for what promised to be a sober accounting of what the two men could achieve -- or prevent -- in the short time the president, and perhaps the prime minister, remain in office. A10
 
Leaders of the world's Muslim nations attending the meeting of the Organization of the Islamic Conference bitterly condemned Israel and promised the Palestinians their full political and financial support. A10
 
Aftermath of Horrific Fire
The Austrian government declared a state of mourning, and workers began extracting the bodies of about 155 people, including 8 Americans, who perished in Austria's worst Alpine disaster when a cable car was destroyed in a tunnel inferno. A1
 
Tommy Suharto Still on the Run
Hutomo Mandala Putra, the youngest son of former President Suharto of Indonesia, has remained free through legal maneuvers and mishaps six weeks after being sentenced to prison on corruption charges. The failure to capture the fugitive, known in Indonesia as Tommy, is raising questions about the government's commitment to establishing a new rule of law. A12
 
Plea for Aid After Milosevic
The people of Serbia have suffered prolonged electric shortages and soaring inflation rates since former President Slobodan Milosevic was overthrown in October, and officials say they need $500 million in support to get through the winter. A3
 
Investigation of Fujimori Funds
Peru's state prosecutor ordered an investigation after a magazine reported that Pablo Escobar, the slain Colombian drug baron, gave $1 million to President Alberto K. Fujimori's now fugitive intelligence chief, Vladimiro Montesinos, to contribute to Mr. Fujimori's first electoral campaign. A8
 
NATIONAL A14-27
 
Battle for the Presidency Continues as Fronts Shift
As lawyers prepared to square off in federal court over Gov. George W. Bush's efforts to block hand recounts of Florida's disputed vote tallies, election officials in at least two counties conducted manual recounts and spokesmen for Mr. Bush and Vice President Al Gore again took to the airwaves in sharp disagreement over how to end the deadlock. A1
 
Many prominent Republicans and party operatives are questioning Mr. Bush's strategy in the last days before the election, saying the campaign's top advisers were so confident that they made mistakes that probably cost Mr. Bush a comfortable victory. The biggest complaint is that Bush strategists were so certain that they had locked up many swing states that in the closing days of the campaign they sent the candidate on a victory lap to states he had little chance of winning, like California and New Jersey. A1
 
Immediately after the hand recount in four precincts in Palm Beach County, Fla., ended, the Palm Beach County Canvassing Board approved an unprecedented recount of all 462,657 presidential ballots, saying it was the only way to determine the true intent of all the voters. A20
 
In Broward County, Fla., 6,686 voters handed in ballots seemingly without marking a choice for president. The Republicans say they believe the counting machines. The Democrats say a hand recount will prove that it is a matter of poorly set equipment that refilled holes punched by voters. The dispute might be resolved today when county officials plan to inspect a sampling of ballots. A17
 
A full day behind schedule, after tangled legal wrangles, serious deliberations over what color pens to use and squabbles over such grave matters as the passing of notes, human hands finally got to work to manually recount the ballots in Volusia County, Fla. A19
 
DNA Takes On Boston Strangler
Two parallel efforts are under way to determine if the woman known as the infamous killer's youngest and last victim, 19-year-old Mary Sullivan, was in fact killed by the man who long claimed to be the Boston Strangler, Albert DeSalvo. The efforts offer two chances that DNA evidence will finally lay to rest the most terrifying crime mystery ever to strike Boston. For years, some have argued that the strangler, or stranglers, might still be out there. A14

Teacher Talks Turn Tense
The contract for New York City's 78,000 public school teachers expires on Wednesday, and labor negotiations have become tense as the city seeks major changes that could reshape its schools, including merit-based raises for teachers, a longer school day and and faster, easier ways to dismiss incompetent teachers. City officials are looking to these negotiations as a rare opportunity to win sweeping changes to improve New York's troubled schools and loosen contract restrictions, like tenure protections, that they view as impediments to better education.

Talks on Global Warming Treaty
After four years of tortuous negotiations, a treaty aimed at curtailing global warming faces its greatest obstacles in the next two weeks as officials from around the world meet work out the fine print. The talks, which begin today in The Hague, come on the heels of new scientific reports showing the strongest evidence yet that the burning of fossil fuels has contributed substantially to a warming trend that could disrupt weather patterns, ecosystems and agriculture.

HEADLINE: The American Role in Mideast Peace

 BODY:
A new round of White House visits by Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, has ended without any clear schedule for resuming peace talks. The two sides even seem to disagree on how future negotiations should be structured. The Palestinians have expressed a desire for increased international involvement, complaining that Washington has abandoned the neutrality required of a mediator. Israel rightly resists any shift to a more international format. Only the United States has sufficient authority and credibility with both sides to help them bridge their remaining differences.
On Friday, Mr. Arafat pursued his quest for a greater international presence by asking the United Nations Security Council to dispatch a 2,000-member armed international force to protect Palestinian civilians. Israel strenuously objects to this misguided proposal, which should be the end of it since, as a rule, the U.N. only sends forces into a conflict when all sides agree. The more practical way to protect civilians is for Mr. Arafat to put the truce arrangements he has repeatedly agreed to into effect and for Israel to carry out the commitments it made. 
 Once that happens, a return to serious bargaining would be the best safeguard against renewed fighting. Ideally, the two sides should start talking to each other directly. That is how the original Oslo peace agreement was reached. But given recent violence, outside diplomatic help will probably be needed.
Several world leaders have worked hard in recent weeks to urge an end to the bloodshed, among them the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, and Egypt's president, Hosni Mubarak. But the recent history of Mideast diplomacy suggests that only Washington can supply the consistent and effective leadership needed to secure an agreement. Years of American steadfastness have earned it the trust of Israel. Nearly a decade of diplomatic engagement with the Palestinians, including significant financial assistance, has given Washington a good working relationship with Mr. Arafat as well, despite his current protests.
If a peace agreement is eventually reached, Washington's help will be indispensable to making it work. Generous additional American aid will be needed to help Israel finance construction of roads, possible relocation of some settlers and security arrangements and to revitalize the Palestinian economy. The Central Intelligence Agency will continue to provide communication and coordination between Israeli and Palestinian security forces.
Many uncertainties cloud the immediate future, including the final outcome of the American presidential election and the political survival of the current Israeli government. But Mr. Arafat and Mr. Barak both assured President Clinton that they look forward to an eventual resumption of peace talks. Whenever negotiations resume, American leadership will be needed to help bring them to a successful conclusion.

NEW YORK
 
BROOKLYN: SUBWAY CONDUCTOR ATTACKED
A passenger attacked a subway conductor yesterday on an N train bound for Coney Island, the police said, apparently after a dispute about an announcement. The passenger, Rafael Stern, 64, of 381 Central Park West in Manhattan, was charged with assault and criminal possession of a weapon after the scuffle at 11:35 a.m. near the 53rd Street station in Sunset Park. The conductor was walking from one car to another when he was confronted by a man who punched him in the cheek and stabbed him in the abdomen with a sharp object, possibly an ice pick or carpenter's awl, the police said. Other passengers restrained the man. "The dispute was about directions, but that's all we know at this time," said Sgt. Brian Burke, a police spokesman. The conductor, 33, whose name was not immediately disclosed by the police, was listed in stable condition at Lutheran Medical Center in Sunset Park. (NYT)
 
ALBANY: BRUNO REJECTS TAX RISE FOR TRANSIT
With 51 percent of state voters having rejected the $3.8 billion transportation bond act last week, state officials are trying to figure out how to pay for transportation projects. The State Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, left, ruled out tax increases, saying the current state budget appeared to have a surplus. "I, for one, do not see myself while in office voting for tax increases," he said. Bernard Brooks of the conservative fiscal group Change-New York, which opposed the bond act, contended that the surplus and the taxes already collected under budgets that increased state spending beyond the rate of inflation should cover the transportation projects. (AP) 

NEW YORK: CIGARETTE SALES TO MINORS
Vendors in New York City are less likely to sell tobacco to minors than are stores nationwide, the Department of Consumer Affairs reported yesterday. Jane Hoffman, the consumer affairs commissioner, said that of the more than 7,800 inspections conducted in the five boroughs, just over 1,300 violations were found. Ms. Hoffman said the city's 83 percent compliance rate surpassed the average national compliance rate of 71 percent and the New York State average of 74 percent. The sale of cigarettes is prohibited to those younger than 18, and sellers are required to request photo identification from customers who appear younger than 25. (AP)
 
SUFFERN: ARREST IN CHURCH ARSON
A man was arrested Saturday and charged with setting a fire on Friday at the Presbyterian Church of Suffern, the police said yesterday. The man, Andrew Z. Gardner, 28, of Spring Valley, a part-time security guard and artist's model, was charged with arson and burglary. Detective Craig H. Long, a police spokesman, said Mr. Gardner was also suspected in attacks at two other churches and a synagogue. In each case, the attacker left graffiti, including, at the Presbyterian church, "Satan rules the earth," the detective said, and someone who knows Mr. Gardner noticed similarities in the writing. No one was hurt in the latest attack, which caused about $40,000 in damage. The fire appears to have been caused by an accelerant, not a firebomb as first reported. (NYT)
 
HAMILTON: 4 STUDENTS DIE IN CRASH
Four college students were killed and two were injured when a Jeep driven by a student the police say was drunk slammed into two trees on Colgate University's campus early Saturday. Three of the dead were hitchhikers who had just been picked up at the campus entrance. The dead were identified as Kevin King, 20, a student at Hudson Valley Community College in Troy; Emily Collins and Rachel Nargiso, both 18-year-olds from Norwich attending Hobart and William Smith Colleges; and Katherine Almeter, 18, a Colgate freshman from Norwich. All except Ms. Almeter were tossed from the vehicle after the driver, Robert Koester, 20, a Colgate junior from Troy, lost control around 1:45 a.m. No one was wearing a seat belt, the police said. (AP)
 
NEW JERSEY
 
PATERSON: INFORMATION ON YOUTH GANGS
The police are urging teachers to watch their students for signs of gang activity and pass the information to officials. Educators have been told to notice when students gather in groups, and to look at clothing and notebook doodles. Some educators, civil libertarians and politicians question the effort, saying it turns teachers into a tool of law enforcement. The police estimate that six major gangs there have 1,000 members total. (AP)
 
WILLINGBORO: YOUTH DIES IN GARAGE FIRE
The authorities were investigating an explosion and fire at a home here late Saturday that killed one teenager and seriously injured another. The explosion at the one-story house happened shortly after 11:30 p.m., starting a fire that was brought under control about 45 minutes later, officials said. The police said seven young people were in a converted garage that was heated by propane space heaters when one of the fuel lines came loose and the gas began to fill the room. A 15-year-old Willingboro boy was killed in the fire. A 13-year-old boy who suffered burns to his face and arms was in critical condition yesterday. Officials said the fire was accidental. (AP)
 
CONNECTICUT
 
HARTFORD: MAN SHOT BY POLICE
A Hartford man was being treated yesterday at St. Francis Hospital and Medical Center after being shot at least twice by police officers. The man, Clifford Gamble, 25, was shot Friday by two officers responding to a 911 call about a confrontation between him and a woman in a parking lot at 881 Garden Street, officials said. Mr. Gamble resisted arrest and escaped an officer's grasp, said Lt. Mark Pawlina, commander of the major-crimes division. He said Mr. Gamble then pulled a knife from his shirt, held it against the woman's throat and stabbed her several times. He was advancing toward one officer when he was shot, Lieutenant Pawlina said. The woman's name and condition were not immediately released. A hospital spokesman would not disclose Mr. Gamble's condition. (NYT)
 
NEW BRITAIN: ELECTRIC HYBRID VEHICLE
The city is joining a growing number of Connecticut municipalities that are relying on vehicles powered by alternative fuels. New Britain is applying for a state grant to offset the purchase of a Toyota Prius sedan that would be the city's first gasoline-electric hybrid vehicle. The state would supply about $7,000 of the $20,000 price tag. (AP)

HEADLINE: Walls Talk, But Their Story Has Changed;
A Home to Immigrants Now Draws Trendsetters

BYLINE: By TINA KELLEY 

 BODY:
If the walls of 96 Orchard Street could talk, they would speak at least 10 languages. If they could share their stories, they might tell of 3 people sleeping on a couch, or 16 sharing a single toilet, or of dark rooms shut off from fresh breezes.
But those are the old stories, from around the start of the 20th century, when the blocks of the Lower East Side were among the most densely populated in the world. 
 Now there are new stories at 96 Orchard Street, of students moving to the Lower East Side to practice their music, of young architects and makeup artists who wanted to live in a neighborhood they knew was vibrant, historic and talked about.
Immigrants who moved in at the turn of the century paid $6 to $15 a month for a 325-square-foot apartment and got the first month's rent free as an incentive. (It was not unheard of for the tenants to move out after the first month and find another building to get a similar deal.) Today, residents pay almost $5,700 ($1,500 for the first month's rent, $1,500 for the security deposit and $2,700 for the broker's fee) for roughly the same apartments, four to a floor.
A biography of the building, a tenement like so many others in the neighborhood, sheds light on how a changing city houses its residents, sometimes in buildings that do not change much at all. One thing has remained surprisingly constant since the five-story brick tenement was built more than 130 years ago: the sense of new beginnings people have as they move in, whether they are immigrants, trendsetters or trend followers.
Orchard Street was named for the dirt road that led from the house to the orchard of the 300-acre Delancey farm, on what is now known as the Lower East Side. During the American Revolution the land was confiscated from the Delanceys, who were sympathetic to the British, and distributed among various landlords, including John Jacob Astor.
The lot was purchased in 1865 by a man named Adam Stumm. The building was built in 1867, and was designed in the Italianate style by Louis Berger, an architect, said Andrew S. Dolkart, a professor of architectural preservation at Columbia University.
The 1870 census showed that 23 people lived in the building. Eight of them were born in New York. The oldest was 53, the youngest was 2, and the breadwinners included a cooper, a watchman, a cabinetmaker, a steamboat steward and a doctor. Everyone was white, all but one of the adults had foreign-born parents, and only two were unable to write. (The census also asked if there were deaf, dumb, blind, insane or idiotic people living in the building; there were none.)
Twenty years later, the population of 96 Orchard Street had more than tripled, reaching 85, most having lived there only two or three years, and 34 of them were children. None of the 1870 residents, mostly from Ireland, Germany, Scotland or France, remained. In 1890, there were many more people whose names ended in -vich or -stein, signifying a shift to immigrants from Eastern Europe.
By 1900, there were 122 people shoehorned into the tenement, half of whom had arrived in the previous 10 years. Most were from Russia, with a few from Austria and Romania. There was a preponderance of tailors, as well as a carpenter, a diamond seller, a cigarmaker, a buttonmaker, a waiter, a plumber and a doctor.
After 1901, a new law, part of a movement to improve conditions in tenements, required a toilet for every two apartments. Later, it was required that the toilets be ventilated, usually via an air shaft.
In 1903, according to a tenement inspector's report, there were 2,200 people living in the block formed by Orchard, Allen, Broome and Delancey Streets, or 1,000 people an acre. The building at No. 96 was bought by Mayer Brauner in 1905, and sold to M. B. Helpern Realty in 1919 for $60,500. The Helpern family kept the building until the late 1990's, when, after a series of deals, it was finally sold to 96 Orchard Inc. for $570,000.
By 1920, census reports suggest, the number of residents at 96 Orchard Street had decreased to 56; they spoke five native languages -- Yiddish, Russian, Spanish, Greek and Italian. One tenant worked as a peddler in a moving-picture house. Another was a repairman at a chandelier factory. A third was a piano teacher.
Judging from the restored decor of the Lower East Side Tenement Museum across the street, the hall was probably papered in burlap and decorated with medallions painted with pastoral scenes. (When No. 96 was being renovated, the curator of the museum, Steve Long, tried to rescue the medallions, but workers threw them out before he could recover them.)
In 1936, after a law was passed requiring that tenement buildings have a staircase made of metal rather than wood, the upper floors of No. 96 were closed off and used for storage, which was apparently more economical than making the required renovations and heating the apartments.
At that point, the basement floor of the building held a retail dress shop and a shoe store, and the stoop floor had a ladies' dress store and a retail gift store. A jewelry wholesaler on an upper floor had to stop operating, and the windows above the second floor, front and rear, were boarded up. The upper floors of No. 96 stayed shuttered until 1996.
Serge Hoyda, the building's current owner, remembers what it was like to open up those floors again, and to try to make them habitable.
"It was like any other building that had been abandoned for the past 50 years," he said. The roof was leaking and there was virtually nothing salvageable.
But Mr. Hoyda said he felt the neighborhood was becoming ripe for revitalization. It had lots of ready-to-renovate housing in historic buildings, all in a convenient location. Mr. Hoyda became one of the first people to start rehabilitating buildings in the area.
"After doing a few properties, a lot of people followed," he said. "The area is extremely exciting today," with discount stores operating by day, and a hipper crowd filling new bars and restaurants at night.
He said the old-time merchants along Orchard Street, famous for its bargains, would probably not be able to afford the higher rents that come with new leases.
"The old type of stores, really unfortunately, is dying," Mr. Hoyda said. "They cannot survive. They're still there, but it's a question of time before, unfortunately, they're going to be out of there."
Next door, 94 Orchard Street is in the middle of a gut rehabilitation project. Chris Tomassi, a building management consultant with Brownstone Management, which will be renting out the building, said many owners in the neighborhood are renovating.
"For years they kept them empty, but now that it's profitable for them to rent them, they're doing it," he said. "Many people own them outright, and it pays for them to get construction loans, renovate them top to bottom and turn them into something profitable."
By 1999, 96 Orchard Street's total market value was assessed at $1 million, although the grandmothers of many of the current tenants might shake their heads at the thought.
In January, one loft-style condominium three blocks away from No. 96 sold for $1.1 million. Some nearby studios rent for up to $3,000 a month.
Downstairs at 96 Orchard Street, Cougar Men's Fashions sells shoes made of ostrich belly and alligator skin for up to $1,200. A store manager, who would not give his name, said he regretted not buying the building for $400,000 several years ago, when he had the chance. Now he pays $32,000 a month in rent.
Several of the building's tenants come from families with roots on the Lower East Side. Peter Scalettar, 22, a filmmaker, pays $1,500 for a two-bedroom apartment. "For down here, now, that's good," he said, although he added that his living room had no windows and could get unbelievably hot.
His grandmother was born two blocks to the south in 1927. "She was pretty excited when I moved down here," he said.
His next-door neighbor, Jay Goldberg, 40, said his father had also grown up on the Lower East Side, and was born and raised a couple blocks away.
Another tenant, Deborah Augustine, 30, said she visited the Tenement Museum and was interested to see that its floor plan was identical to No. 96, down to the window, required for ventilation, between the living room and the bedroom.
"I thought it would be really fun to see how eight people lived in a place this big," said Ms. Augustine, a furniture designer. "Now there are just two of us, and we think it's too small."
But more people are eager to try fitting into a neighborhood once known for its crowded masses. A poster on a lamppost outside the building recently described a professional single male, without pets or a roommate, looking for a studio or one-bedroom apartment in the area for up to $1,300 a month. The reward, said a sign punctuated with dollar signs and exclamation points, was $800 in cash.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about population change in the former tenements of the Lower East Side referred imprecisely to the rental income at 96 Orchard Street. The owner says it totals about $32,000 a month for the entire building, not just for the storefront.

HEADLINE: Yes, America, Clean Air Begins at Home

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The United States is by and large opposed to the most efficient way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (news article, Nov. 13), through raising prices of carbon-laden fuels. With recent United States Congresses ruling out regulations or efficiency standards, and with no one likely to accept shipping billions of dollars to Russia and Ukraine to buy the emissions rights those countries won't need, the world's greatest emitter doesn't have many options, and the rest of the world knows it. 
 And few believe that by aiding "clean development," America's interests can even account for a few percentage points of its emissions reduction pledge. So the United States must look at its own domestic options carefully.
Cleanliness begins at home, and it's time America's politicians and population were told that. No one has to give up a sport utility vehicle today, but everyone has to think about which vehicle to buy next time, and next time is around the corner.

HEADLINE: Public Hires Director To Oversee Finances

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
Fran Reiter, a former deputy mayor in the Giuliani administration, will become executive director of the Joseph Papp Public Theater today in a move to strengthen the theater's business operations, the Public's chairman said yesterday.
The nonprofit theater and its producer and creative leader, George C. Wolfe, have been criticized in the theater industry for two consecutive expensive Broadway flops, "The Wild Party" and "On the Town." These projects lost about $14 million for the Public. 
 The chairman, Kenneth B. Lerer, said Ms. Reiter's appointment had nothing to do with curbing Mr. Wolfe's spending. Rather, he said, the Public is in the best financial shape in its history, and its $50 million building-improvement plan, which includes the construction of a new 499-seat theater at its Lafayette Street base in the East Village, requires full-time oversight. Mr. Wolfe, he said, needed to be allowed to concentrate on the artistic side of the operation: producing and directing.
"The goal was to free George to do what he really wants to do: he wants to produce and he wants to direct," Mr. Lerer said. "This lets him do that. We won't succeed at this next long-range plan unless we have someone like Fran Reiter in house. It's just too much."
Mr. Wolfe, in his eighth year at the Public, said he welcomed the help. "I think it's great," he said. "It makes it easier for me to do what I do and at the same time allows the institution to grow."
As to whether he felt his degree of control had been compromised, Mr. Wolfe said: "I don't feel diminished. As a matter of fact, I feel enhanced by the possibilities."
Founded by Joseph Papp in 1966, the Public Theater has been a leading cultural center in New York City, prominent not only for generating commercial hits like "A Chorus Line" under Mr. Papp and "Bring In da Noise, Bring In da Funk" under Mr. Wolfe, but also for advancing the work of voices that might otherwise remain marginal.
Recently many theater devotees and professionals have expressed disappointment in the Public's offerings, arguing that under Mr. Wolfe the theater has generated few exciting projects and too often left some of its five theaters dark.
The Public's board has stood by Mr. Wolfe. When "Wild Party" was losing money on Broadway, the Public put up an additional $1.1 million to keep it running, although Mr. Lerer also put three board members in charge of overseeing the show's finances.
Mr. Lerer would not disclose Ms. Reiter's salary but said it was close to Mr. Wolfe's, which is $210,000. She will focus on finance, development and fund-raising, marketing, capital projects and board relations, Mr. Lerer said. Although she was selected after a yearlong search, Mr. Lerer said, Ms. Reiter was his first choice. "She has great business experience, she has great City Hall experience, and she has great political experience, and she has great theater experience," he said. "She had all the characteristics of the person we needed."
In her three years as deputy mayor for economic development and planning and for community relations and planning, Ms. Reiter, 46, got high marks for helping the city's cultural institutions.
"She was an absolute soldier," said Gordon J. Davis, the new president of Lincoln Center Inc. and a member of the Public's board.
Ms. Reiter then served for 19 months as president and chief executive officer of NYC & Company, formerly known as the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau.
She left that post to explore a bid for the mayoralty in 2001, a move she decided against last winter. She runs her own consulting firm through which she recently served for three months as interim chief executive of the Dance Theater of Harlem.
Although Ms. Reiter has not worked in the theater recently, it was her focus earlier in life, she said. Growing up in the East Village, she regularly attended productions at the Public.
She majored in drama at the High School of Performing Arts, attended Boston University's School of Fine Arts as a directing major and went on to work as a director and stage manager at regional, summer stock and Off Off Broadway theaters. Her new job, she said, "represented the opportunity for me to go back to something that I loved."
When asked how she viewed the Public's last two experiences on Broadway, Ms. Reiter said she respected its decisions.
"If either of those productions had been big hits, George would have been a genius," she said. "Whatever process they went through, I don't think it's going to change any. Some of the things we do will be financially successful, some of them won't."
Despite the forceful hand of Mr. Wolfe at the Public -- and the fact that Mr. Wolfe's previous business counterparts have not lasted long, though they were not invested with comparable authority -- Ms. Reiter said she was not concerned about his ability to share power.
"I have the highest regard for him as an artist," she said, "and to be partners with him is a great opportunity."

RUSSIA: AMERICAN LOSES COURT ROUND -- A court rejected an appeal by an American accused of spying to call additional experts to determine whether documents about torpedoes that he received were top secret, as prosecutors allege. The American, Edmond Pope, was arrested in April and charged with trying illegally to obtain plans for the torpedo. He says the information had already been sold abroad. (Associated Press) 

MONTENEGRO: YUGOSLAV CURRENCY DROPPED -- Montenegro, Serbia's partner in the Yugoslav Federation, abolished the dinar as legal tender and replaced it fully with the German mark, thus ending the dual currency system started on Nov. 1, 1999. Victor Homola (NYT)
 
GERMANY: PROTEST OVER EXECUTIONS IN U.S. -- Germany called on the International Court of Justice to rule that the United States had violated international accords by executing two German brothers in 1999. Karl and Walter LaGrand were condemned to death in 1984 for killing a bank manager in Arizona in 1982. Germany accuses the United States of violating the 1963 Vienna Convention by not informing the brothers of their right to consular assistance when they were arrested. A verdict is expected within four months. Victor Homola (NYT)
 
TURKEY: PLAN FOR CYPRUS REJECTED -- Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit rejected an appeal by the European Union that Turkey support a United Nations proposal to resolve the dispute over divided Cyprus. In its blueprint for opening membership talks, the Union suggested last week that Turkey back the plan, which calls for a two-zone federation, a central administration and greater integration between the Greek and Turkish sides. Turkey and Turkish Cypriots favor a confederation with far less integration. Mr. Ecevit said Turkey would not accept a link between Cyprus and membership in the European Union. Douglas Frantz (NYT)
 
EUROPEAN UNION: 'MAD COW' TESTS -- The European Commission wants to test all beef cattle in the European Union above a certain age for "mad cow" disease before they are sent to slaughter, and has called a meeting with veterinary experts tomorrow to fix the details. The Commission is expected to cover up to half the cost, about $65 a head, said a Commission spokeswoman, Beate Gminder. Paul Meller (NYT)
 
BRITAIN: S-H-H-H-H -- Queen Elizabeth II has ordered her staff not to carry mobile phones, Buckingham Palace announced. "No one wants phones going off during a banquet," a spokesman said. Only staff members who must have mobiles, like press officers, will be allowed to have them. There was no response to a question whether the queen has her own mobile phone. (Reuters)

ZIMBABWE: BLACKS MOVED ONTO WHITES' FARMS -- Government officials moved thousands of landless blacks onto white-owned farms over the weekend, despite a Supreme Court order banning the resettling. The government has promised to confiscate 3,000 farms and give them to blacks. But the court ruled Friday that the plan violated land reform laws. Despite the ruling, black families were escorted onto at least 50 farms across the country, according to the Commercial Farmers Union, which represents 4,000 farmers. (Associated Press)
 
IVORY COAST: SUPPORT FROM DEPOSED GENERAL -- Gen. Robert Guei, the former dictator who went into hiding after being toppled in a popular revolt last month, emerged in the capital, Yamoussoukro, and met with President Laurent Gbagbo. The general, left, called on soldiers to return to their barracks and support Mr. Gbagbo. The president hinted that he would not pursue the general, under whose rule many human rights violations were committed. General Guei plans to live in his home village, Kabacouma, in the southwest.

UGANDA: EBOLA HITS 3RD TOWN -- The dealy Ebola virus has spread to a third community, linked to a woman who fled a hospital in Gulu for Masindi, her hometown, once she suspected she had the virus. The woman and three relatives in Masindi have died, raising the toll since mid-October to 110. The earlier oubreaks were in Gulu, 225 miles north of Kampala, and Mbarara, 175 miles southwest of Kampala. Masindi is on the Nile, 100 miles south of Gulu. (Associated Press)

HURDLE FOR TRADE TALKS -- Foreign and trade ministers from Pacific Rim countries ended two days of contentious meetings in Brunei with a basic agreement to open a new round of global trade talks.

KYRGYZSTAN: MOVE AGAINST PRESIDENT -- Eight lawmakers began a court action to oust President Askar Akayev on the ground that he is serving an illegal third term. Mr. Akayev was re-elected for a third five-year term last month, but the deputies argue that the Constitution limits the president to two terms. The constitutional court ruled in 1998 that Mr. Akayev was eligible to run again last month because the Constitution was adopted after his first election. (Agence France-Presse)

CANADA: ELECTION GAP NARROWS -- Two televised debates last week by party leaders, one in French and one in English, improved the electoral chances of the conservative Canadian Alliance party in the Nov. 27 election, according to two polls by the Ipsos Reid group. The gap between the Alliance and the ruling Liberals narrowed to 12 percentage points, from 18, the polls showed. In one completed Saturday of 1,050 Canadians, support of the Liberal Party of Prime Minister Jean Chretien fell to 40 percent, while support for the Alliance party of Stockwell Day rose to 28 percent.

HEADLINE: Philippine Congress Impeaches President on Graft Charges

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, Nov. 13

 BODY:
Without a formal vote, President Joseph Estrada of the Philippines was impeached by his country's House of Representatives today on corruption charges centering on millions of dollars in payoffs from illegal gambling.
The bill of impeachment now goes to the Senate, where wavering members are sampling the political winds in advance of a trial that could end in Mr. Estrada's removal from office. 
 To shouts of protest from Mr. Estrada's supporters, witnesses said, House Speaker Manuel Villar asserted that no vote was necessary because more than the required one-third of the 218 House members had already signed a petition supporting impeachment.
"It's official now that the impeachment rap is with the Senate," Mr. Villar said after gaveling it through. "We have indicted the president."
Mr. Estrada is the first Philippine president to be impeached, though impeachment motions have been raised unsuccessfully against others. Removing him from office requires a two-thirds vote of the 22-member Senate.
The Senate trial promises to be lurid, with plans to call a variety of Mr. Estrada's cronies and possibly some of his mistresses, whose homes he is said to have acquired through questionable means.
He has reacted to the charges by rallying his base, the poor majority of Filipinos, playing once again the role that made him a heartthrob as a movie actor: the simple, scrappy guy who faces down the powerful elite.
"My conscience is clear," he said today in a nationwide radio broadcast shortly before the House acted. "I did not become president to rake in money."
He was impeached on four charges involving bribery, corruption, betrayal of public trust and culpable violation of the Constitution.
They grew out of allegations by a provincial governor who is a crony of the president that Mr. Estrada accepted nearly $11 million in payoffs from illegal gambling as well as a cut of provincial tobacco taxes.
Mr. Estrada repeated today his assertion that he had not received "a single centavo" from illegal gambling. Last week he did acknowledge that he had been offered what he called a $4 million bribe from the governor, Luis Singson, but he insisted that he had refused it.
After the initial accusations a month ago, Mr. Estrada has come under intense pressure to resign. The powerful Catholic Church and much of the business community have called on him to step down, and key members of his party in the House and the Senate have turned against him.
His opponents -- including his two immediate predecessors, Fidel V. Ramos and Corazon C. Aquino -- have held huge rallies calling for his ouster. A coalition of his opponents, ranging from millitant labor unions to mainstream business associations, scheduled a nationwide general strike for Tuesday.
In his radio address today, Mr. Estrada sounded like a man pursued by a pack of hounds. "I appeal to you not to go through with it," he said of the strike. "We have a crisis. Let's join hands and pull out of this, for the sake of the nation."
But as a barometer of the national mood, the stock market and the currency do not favor the president. Whenever word passes around that he might step down, the market and the currency strengthen; when it seems that he will hang tough, they plummet.
When he dug in his heels two weeks ago, the peso fell to an all-time low of 51.95 to the dollar. Today, as it appeared that the impeachment battle might drag on for weeks or months, the stock market sagged by 2.2 percent.
That volatility grows out of a mounting unhappiness with Mr. Estrada, who is seen to have allowed the economic gains of the Ramos administration to slip away. Among investors and businessmen, the Estrada administration has acquired a reputation for mismanagement, corruption and cronyism.
Political analysts in Manila said Mr. Singson's allegations might not have gained momentum if they had not underscored a growing sense of dismay over Mr. Estrada's leadership.
"It's been building up," said Paulynn P. Sicam, editor in chief of an online newsmagazine called Dyaryo. "I think mainly it's shame. It's terrible when your moral standards begin to accommodate this person's lifestyle. We've lowered our standards of propriety and morality till we realize we've been wallowing in it. It just feels so dirty. This has got to stop."
Still thrilled by their "people power" ouster of President Ferdinand E. Marcos in 1986, many Filipinos are working energetically to recreate the passionate political theater of their great moment.
Before the House session today, opposition congressmen prayed and lit candles near a Philippine flag. They wore peach-colored ribbons on their shirts signifying, naturally, "impeachment."
Mr. Estrada's fall has been precipitous. In May 1998 he was elected by one of the largest margins of any president in history. But his support came largely from the poor, who loved his persona as a tough man of the people when he was an actor in cheap popular movies.
The political and business elite was mortified by the image of a shambling, mumbling, confessed drinker and womanizer who looked less like a president than, indeed, like an actor in cheap movies.
What the Philippines saw was what it got as president -- a lackadaisical leader with little interest in economic management, famous for his karaoke-style "midnight cabinet" meetings and his late-morning arrivals at his office.
It is said that when a group of business leaders held a luncheon for Mr. Estrada soon after his election, he asked to see the kitchen staff, saying he wanted to meet some people who had actually voted for him.
His accuser, Mr. Singson, was a participant in the president's happy hours, where among other things Mr. Estrada recently admitted that they had played mah-jongg for millions of pesos.
An illegal gambling lord himself, Mr. Singson said he had turned on the president when he was cut out of the profits of a new legalized form of gambling. He cheerfully asserted that he was part of a falling-out of thieves.
Mr. Singson presented a Senate hearing with lists of payoffs that he said he had made to Mr. Estrada and members of the president's family. Those included $8.6 million in profits from an illegal but highly popular numbers game called jueteng, as well as $2.8 million in provincial tobacco taxes.
Despite the public clamor for Mr. Estrada's removal, preparations are under way for a hard-fought battle in the Senate. Mr. Estrada's allies still hold majorities in both houses, and they moved today to replace the House speaker and the Senate president, who broke ranks a week ago.
Mr. Singson said today that he felt vindicated by the impeachment. "If President Estrada is ousted, I want it to serve as a lesson to all public officials," he said.
That might possibly include himself.
When asked recently whether he might be incriminating himself with his testimony about Mr. Estrada, he said, "It would be an honor to go to prison with the president."

HEADLINE: Dot-Coms Intrude in the Land of Needle and Thread

BYLINE: By GUY TREBAY 

 BODY:
Jack Ratusch knew something was amiss when he ran into his friend the button man, prowling Midtown with a real estate agent. Bad news is often no news in the garment business. But Mr. Ratusch, who is president of the Garment Center Congregation, a conservative synagogue on West 40th Street, has been around the rag trade for more than 50 years. That's long enough to know that while coat men come and go and better dresses can be fly-by-night, buttons are forever. Or at least they used to be.
"I asked him, 'What are you doing walking around?' " Mr. Ratusch said. "He explained, 'I'm paying $10 a square foot all these years and now the landlord wants $35. I can't pay that kind of money on buttons.' I asked what happened. And he said, 'You know who's coming? The dot-coms. There's no protection anymore.' " 
 Small guys are the garment center's mine canaries -- button vendors in shoe-box showrooms, jobbers in upstairs lofts, street-level retailers who make a living selling the amazing stuff that doesn't merely clothe the world, but keeps it from looking dowdy. According to local wisdom, if the small guys fall, the end is near. And while it's been evident for some time that the garment center's hold on its precious chunk of Midtown was shaky, the district now seems increasingly tenuous, threatened by manufacturing trends favoring offshore labor, the successful redevelopment of Times Square, the planned renovation of the 34th Street corridor and an influx of advertising agencies and Internet companies drawn to loftlike industrial spaces and rents that, in relative terms, are cheap.
Although the garment industry remains the city's largest industrial job source, both its manufacturing and employment figures are down considerably. Citywide, employment in the apparel and textile portion of the industry has fallen to 78,200, according to the Labor Department, well below a 1991 total of 104,415. More alarming, perhaps, are figures indicating that fashion industry employment now represents, for the first time in the area's history, less than half the overall jobs in the center's core.
What is that core? Roughly, it extends from Ninth to Fifth Avenue, from 34th to 42nd Street, with the densest concentration between 37th and 40th Streets, Seventh to Eighth. The actual area is somewhat larger, however, and extends beyond any boundaries demarcated by ZIP code or census blocks. One good way to characterize the area is the simplest: you know it when you're in it. It is a cultural geography whose landmarks are street-level windows crammed with shoulder pads or bridal lace or buckram hat forms or dress dummies. Like notches in a cliff wall, the layered strata of immigration and labor history are revealed along its streets.
"So many people trace their roots in this country back to someone who started in that industry," said Linda Dworak, executive director of the Garment Industry Development Corporation, a nonprofit consortium of business, government and labor. Even today, the garment center is the portal to the work force for immigrants and working women, mainly from Asia and the Caribbean basin. "If those jobs disappeared," Ms. Dworak said, "I don't know where those people will get work."
With the jobs go the traditional kosher dairy restaurants, the immense cafeterias like Dubrow's, the tony, members-only dining rooms like the 500 Club. The button and trimmings wholesalers, too, are fast disappearing. Even houses of worship have been affected, like the Millinery Center Synagogue on Sixth Avenue, which was once so well attended that workers scheduled their arrival in shifts. "This you wouldn't believe," said Edward Ginsburg, president of the William N. Ginsburg Company, a 75-year-old novelty trim and braid company on West 38th Street. "They're selling bed sheets now in front of that synagogue."
It was not long ago that "there were no trendy retail ground-floor restaurants," said Susan Cowell, vice president of the Union of Needletrades, or Unite. "It was just garmento places." Those were the days when a side-street takeout order was more likely to be a corned beef sandwich and an egg cream than a Kathleen's cookie with a double mocha skim latte (no foam.) "The culture is vulnerable," said Ms. Cowell, referring not just to the district's traditionally Jewish and Italian immigrants, but to the Chinese and Korean Americans who followed them. "The people are vulnerable."
Just how vulnerable is made plain in the locutions of property brokers. "We talk about it as a new garment center," said Faith Hope Consolo, vice chairman of Garrick-Aug Associates, a commercial leasing firm. Characterizing the old garment center as "rinky-dink, run-down and ugly," Ms. Consolo said, "The whole profile has changed out there." In an area that had been a real estate "black hole," its street-side trade characterized by immigrant shoppers, hot-dog stands and menacing garment racks, Ms. Consolo now points to the arrival of global advertising firms like Bates USA, which occupies five floors at 498 Seventh Avenue. She says businesses not related to fashion will give the area a "new face." A new name, too, may be in the offing. Some newcomers, eager to shed the old label, have already begun to call the western edge of the district NEChe -- pronounced NEECH-ee -- for Northeast Corner of Chelsea.
"All these things conspire," said Eric Hertz, executive director of the Fashion Association, a trade group. "There's a tremendous amount of consolidation of large organizations. The business is decentralized. The smaller manufacturers don't have the resources. It's a very, very different business from what it was 20 or 30 years ago. A little trimmings guy can't hold out against a high-tech company."
Despite rarely enforced zoning regulations enacted in 1987 to protect the garment center by restricting space conversions on side streets from apparel to other uses, the reality, said Ms. Cowell of the garment workers' union, is that virtually any national corporation "is paying a lot more than showrooms can pay."
"It would be disastrous for the apparel industry if it disappeared as a center," she added. "Buyers come from all over the world. And it's not one buyer, it's a thousand buyers."
Mel Cohen, president of B&J Fabrics, a bustling three-story emporium that has been on West 40th Street for the last 42 years, said: "A lot of these dot-com people come from higher-rent areas and drive out our people. And they don't relate to our industry at all."
"You can special-zone something," Mr. Cohen added, "but if people who are going to remain can't afford to pay the rents, how can you keep them there?"
The desire to maintain unified business precincts is not merely a matter of nostalgia. Garment manufacturing continues to generate an estimated $9 billion for the local economy. Although many manufacturing jobs have been relocated to the outer boroughs, the garment center remains a hub. As in the meat-packing district, Wall Street or the diamond district, being close to related businesses serves a number of subtle functions. "It's a tremendously efficient way to operate," said Adam Friedman, executive director of the New York Industrial Retention Network, a citywide nonprofit group. "There are all kinds of competitive advantages that industry enjoys when production, sales and design are clustered."
Those advantages, Mr. Friedman pointed out, are not lost on the arrivals to Silicon Alley, who, despite being in the business of universal access to information, he said, "make it their first initiative to gather in a single neighborhood."
Essentially, Mr. Friedman said, the dot-com people reap the same benefits from proximity that the garment district types have always enjoyed: "You run into someone," he said, "and find out what's happening that's plaid this year."
An unreleased study conducted by the New York Industrial Retention Network and Unite suggests that while part of the garment center remains intact, the nature of the district is, as Mr. Friedman said, "down to the core." That core still accounts for more jobs than Youngstown and Akron, Ohio, combined, even after three decades of competition from foreign manufacturers. Yet the strongest threat to the garment center doesn't originate offshore. "It's real estate pressure," Mr. Friedman said.
When Mark G. Rubin's father opened an Eighth Avenue branch of Arnold Hatters, a retail chain, in 1960, no bareheaded gent in any profession could consider himself properly dressed. The natty types in the garment center were especially good customers for hats. A time traveler from the Eisenhower era would still find plenty of finery with which to attire himself at Arnold Hatters, which is on Eighth Avenue at 41st Street. Next to the popular Kangol caps in the windows sit derbys and such Fred and Ginger anachronisms as collapsible silk toppers. But the bulk of the store's customers, said Mr. Rubin, are from the theater.
"People don't wear hats like they used to," said Mr. Rubin, 29, who has worked at the store since he was 12. Even dedicated clients have been forced to move on under pressures that, in their own way, are not unrelated to the forces of real estate. "I miss the pimps from the old Times Square," Mr. Rubin said, surveying a display of leopard-print borsalinos and burnt-orange bowlers. "I mean, who else wears a hat like that?"

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Stocks Regain Most Losses On Late Buying

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
The tug of war between bears and bulls intensified yesterday as financial markets plunged early on fears of slowing economic growth before regaining most of their losses on late-day buying from investors seeking value in beaten-down stocks.
For the fourth consecutive session, the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index led the markets lower, falling 62.27 points, or 2.1 percent, to 2,966.72. The Nasdaq ended the day below 3,000 for the first time since Nov. 2, 1999. 
 Other indexes also slid. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 14.72 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,351.26. The Dow Jones industrial average, hurt by a drop in Hewlett-Packard, which reported lower-than-expected earnings, fell 85.70 points, or 0.8 percent, to 10,517.25. Hewlett-Packard fell $4.44, to close at $34.81.
After five years of strong growth and little inflation, the United States economy has cooled drastically since the summer, and further slowing is possible if consumers rein in their spending in response to the stock market's decline. Skeptics warn that the average public company may show little or no growth in earnings next year, shocking investors and analysts, who are expecting profit gains of 12 percent.
"We're getting what we asked for, which is a slowing of worldwide economic growth," said Duncan W. Richardson, who runs the $7 billion Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Growth Fund. "If the world slows, the best companies in the world must slow relative to expectations."
Mr. Richardson said he expected that technology stocks would remain extremely volatile over the next year and that the Nasdaq could fall as low as 2,000 or rise as high as 4,000. He noted that optical networking companies, which have fallen furiously since September but remain very expensive by all historical measures, "could be cut in half and still be expensive."
Indeed, many technology companies seesawed 5 percent or more yesterday. The optical equipment maker Juniper Networks ranged from $154.50 to $179 before closing at $164.55, a loss of $6.39, while Cisco Systems traded as high as $52.38 and as low as $48 before closing at $50.38, a 31-cent gain. Dell Computer ranged from $22.38 to $25.47 and closed at $24.13, a $1.13 gain.
But bulls counter that many nontechnology stocks are already depressed and have room to rise. Many leading companies are trading at less than 15 times their expected 2000 earnings, with Chevron trading at 11 times earnings, Bank of America at 9 times earnings, and Goldman Sachs at 14 times earnings. Although information technology companies are still expensive, even they are more reasonably priced after the 40 percent decline in the Nasdaq since March, bulls say.
"For the first time in a while, we're buying some tech stocks," said Doug Phillips, president and chief executive of Trusco Capital Management, which is based in Atlanta and manages $50 billion. Mr. Phillips said he believed that the Federal Reserve had managed a "soft landing," slowing growth and the risk of inflation without sending the economy into recession.
Now, with inflation under control, the Fed has the flexibility to cut short-term interest rates and bolster the economy and corporate profits, which will help stocks, Mr. Phillips said. "The next step by the Fed is to reduce rates, rather than raise them," he said.
Michael Strauss, managing director for Commonfund, which manages $25 billion, said he was cautiously optimistic. Mr. Strauss expects the United States economy to grow 3 percent next year, corporate profits to rise 7 to 9 percent, and the Federal Reserve to begin lowering interest rates by mid-2001. Under those circumstances, stocks should perform solidly next year, he said.
But if that economic growth does not come, the market's rocky ride could continue into 2001, Mr. Strauss said. Though the S.& P. 500 has fallen 8 percent this year, it still trades at about 23 times expected earnings for 2000, well above historical averages. "The market still isn't cheap by historical standards, if you're worried about the momentum of the economy," he said.
Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist for the Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial Services Group, which manages $230 billion, said he thought that economic growth next year would be the lowest since 1996 but that the risk of a recession was low. The Federal Reserve will act quickly to lower interest rates if the economy loses too much momentum, he said.
Under those circumstances, the S.& P. 500 is "perhaps below fair value," Mr. Hoffman said.

Treasury Prices Rise
By Bloomberg News
Most bonds rose yesterday as the unresolved presidential election drove investors to the haven of government securities.
"You have the equity market taking a long walk off a short pier and that's traditionally when people will load up with Treasuries," said Mitch Stapley, who invests the $3.5 billion in fixed-income assets at the Kent Funds in Grand Rapids, Mich.
The price of the 10-year note rose 7/32 , to 99 31/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.75 percent from 5.78 percent on Friday. The 30-year bond rose 15/32 , to 105 27/32 . Its yield fell to 5.83 percent from 5.87 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Expanded Logging Ban Is Proposed for National Forests

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13

 BODY:
The Forest Service recommended today that President Clinton expand the scope of a planned environmental initiative by banning virtually all commercial logging from the remaining roadless areas of the national forests.
The new proposal would extend that ban even to the Tongass National Forest in Alaska, which is the nation's largest national forest but had been exempted from a draft proposal made public last May. Altogether, it would broaden what was drafted as a ban on road building alone to put a total of 54 million acres of national forest off limits to all but extraordinary timber sales. 
 The revised approach, which now awaits Mr. Clinton's approval, follows the more ambitious outline that Vice President Al Gore spelled out in his presidential campaign as the surest way to protect public lands from development. It runs sharply counter to the approach advocated by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who had criticized the administration's initial blueprint as an excessive use of federal power.
Mr. Clinton vowed last year to make the protection of the roadless areas his most important public-lands legacy, and environmentalists who had criticized the earlier draft plan said today that the new proposal came closer to making good on that vision.
"This is a real breakthrough, and it moves a long way toward delivering on the historic promise that the president delivered a year ago," said Nathaniel Lawrence, director of the forest project for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.
Altogether, the new proposal would extend a ban on road building and virtually all logging to more than 58 million acres of national forest, about 30 percent of the total. The earlier plan, which excluded the Tongass, had covered 43 million acres.
Although the plan would allow some logging under narrow circumstances, administration officials said that if put into effect, it would bring about a 93 percent reduction in timber sales within roadless areas from the level now anticipated.
Most of the prohibitions would take effect immediately if Mr. Clinton accepts the Forest Service proposal. Under the plan, however, the restrictions on the Tongass would not be imposed until 2004, in a bow to pressures from Alaska's congressional delegation and others who have said a continuation of logging there is vital to the region's economy.
In a further effort at conciliation, the Forest Service plan calls for $13 million to $20 million in spending over the next four years to create jobs and industries in Alaskan communities that now depend heavily on timber operations in the Tongass forest.
Matt Zencey, director of the Alaska Rainforest Campaign, criticized the proposed four-year phase-in period for the Tongass forest and warned that the delay would allow Alaska Republicans and a potential Bush administration to scuttle any protection for the forest.
"There still is no good reason to discriminate against the nation's largest national forest and deny it full protection," Mr. Zencey said.
The revision of the Forest Service plan comes after a public comment period that included some 300 public meetings and generated more than 1.5 million letters and pieces of electronic mail in response to the initial proposal. The timber industry and loggers have taken a strong stand against the initiative, but administration officials have said the overwhelming public reaction has been positive.
Ken Rait, who as director of the Heritage Forests Campaign has been a leader in pressing for broader protection for roadless areas, said today that the Forest Service had moved "toward a common sense and responsible policy of wild forest protection."
But Mr. Rait and other environmental activists also said any final policy must include strict limits on what kinds of logging might be allowed under the loophole proposed by the Forest Service, which could allow timber to be cut in roadless areas for fire prevention and other "stewardship" purposes.

HEADLINE: Rise in Health Care Costs Rests Largely on Drug Prices

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13

 BODY:
Prescription drugs accounted for 44 percent of the increase in health costs last year, researchers said today.
In a report published in the journal Health Affairs, the researchers said overall health costs for services covered by private insurance rose by 6.6 percent last year, while drug spending increased by 18.4 percent. The study did not separately examine costs for people without insurance. 
 Paul B. Ginsburg, an author of the report, said prescription drugs accounted for more of the 6.6 percent increase in health costs than either hospital care or doctors' services.
"Drug spending is growing much faster than other components of health care," said Mr. Ginsburg, an economist who is president of the Center for Studying Health System Change, a private research institute. "Drug costs are having a bigger and bigger effect on overall health costs."
Inflation is back after several years of low growth in health insurance premiums, said Mr. Ginsburg, a former director of health care studies at the Congressional Budget Office. The higher premiums mean higher costs for employers and, in many cases, for employees, he said.
Another author of the report, Jon R. Gabel, said the resurgence of health care costs was alarming.
"It appeared that health costs were under control from 1993 to 1997, and even into 1998," said Mr. Gabel, a vice president of the Health Research and Educational Trust, a nonprofit group affiliated with the American Hospital Association. Christopher Hogan, a health policy researcher, helped write the report.
Judith H. Bello, executive vice president of Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said she had not read the study and could not comment. But she insisted, "Prescription drugs are often the most effective and least costly way" of treating an illness.
The rise in prescription drug costs has stimulated interest in proposals to rein in drug prices or add drug benefits to Medicare, the federal health insurance program for the elderly and disabled.
Representative Tom Allen, Democrat of Maine, has introduced a bill that he said would make prescription drugs available to Medicare beneficiaries at the prices negotiated by large government purchasers like the Department of Veterans Affairs.
Mr. Allen and other Democrats complain that elderly people often must pay far more for prescription drugs than do the drug companies' most favored customers, like health maintenance organizations.
But a federal appeals court last week upheld the right of pharmacies to charge higher prices for drugs sold to people who are uninsured.
The decision, by the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta, involved Rite Aid drugstores in Alabama. The court said that retail pharmacies had no duty to disclose whether they charged higher prices to uninsured consumers than to insured customers. It said such disparities did not constitute fraud and did not violate the law.
"Variable pricing is the norm in many industries," said the opinion, by Judge Charles R. Wilson. "Airlines frequently charge different groups of consumers different rates for the same seat, hotels often charge different rates to different consumers for the same room and car dealerships sell identical vehicles for a variety of prices, depending upon the identity (and savvy) of the consumer."
The report in Health Affairs said that about one-third of the increase in drug spending last year was attributable to higher prices. The remainder, it said, was attributable to a higher volume of sales, reflecting the advent of new medicines and the increased use of existing drugs.
While prescription drugs accounted for 44 percent of the increase in health costs last year, the report said, doctors' services accounted for 32 percent, and outpatient hospital care accounted for 21 percent, while inpatient hospital care was responsible for only 3 percent.
Spending at hospital outpatient clinics grew "at a consistently high rate throughout the 1990's," the report said. By contrast, it said, per capita spending for inpatient services declined in 5 of the last 10 years.
"The period from 1994 to 1998 was a time of record-low rates of growth in health insurance premiums and in the underlying medical expenses that are covered," the article said.
The premium for a typical private health insurance plan grew an average of 2 percent a year from 1994 to 1998 -- less than the increase in per capita gross domestic product, the output of goods and services, the authors said. Premiums this year rose an average of 8.3 percent for all businesses and 7.5 percent for companies with 200 or more workers.

HEADLINE: A Nascent Internet Takes Root in Vietnam;
Gleaning Lessons Of What Is Called The 'People's War'

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam

 BODY:
Ask Truong Gia Binh whom he looks to for inspiration in running Vietnam's largest technology company, and he doesn't name William H. Gates, Steve Jobs or any other Silicon Valley warrior.
Mr. Binh instead cites some real warriors -- the retired Vietnamese army generals who vanquished France and the United States in two of the 20th century's most remarkable military victories. 
 His perspective is a personal one: Mr. Binh, 44, is the son-in-law of Vo Nguyen Giap, a confidant of Ho Chi Minh and the general who masterminded Vietnam's campaigns against the French and the Americans.
"Business and war have different objectives," Mr. Binh said, "but the North Vietnamese army has much to teach software developers. We're applying the lessons of the People's War to the computer business."
At the moment, Mr. Binh's company, the Corporation for Financing and Promoting Technology, has just 750 employees, $50 million in sales, and is controlled by the Ministry of Science and Technology. Like other companies in emerging markets, F.P.T. began in outsourcing -- pumping out software for clients like the International Business Machines Corporation and Olivetti of Italy.
By harnessing the principles of guerrilla warfare -- among those used in Vietnam, nimble versatility in the face of a more powerful opponent and the willingness to endure a long struggle -- Mr. Binh hopes to transform F.P.T. into a diversified technology company that produces its own software, installs and maintains computer networks and provides Internet access, as well as online programming.
Jumping up from his seat to illustrate this novel management theory on an erasable markerboard, Mr. Binh seems utterly at ease -- even enthusiastic -- in drawing parallels between the new economy and an old war. But his comments would raise almost as many eyebrows here as in the United States.
Twenty-five years after North Vietnamese troops marched into Saigon, people speak little about the Vietnam War, or as it known here, the People's War. It is rarer still to hear such talk from the relative of a former official, particularly one in a business as future-oriented as technology.
To be sure, many sons and sons-in-law of Communist Party and military leaders have emerged as business leaders in postwar Vietnam. But most of these "princelings" say little about their forebears, even if these family ties are responsible for much of their success.
Of his father-in-law, however, Mr. Binh says: "I learned so much from him. That was a huge advantage for me."
People who know Mr. Binh said his candor reflected a self-confidence not unlike that of General Giap. They say he also has an unswerving belief that F.P.T. will become Vietnam's first global technology player.
"He's the only Vietnamese businessman I know of who thinks in those terms," said Greig Craft, an American entrepreneur who has lived in Hanoi for 11 years. "He's ambitious, and he doesn't hide it."
The most obvious sign of his ambition is in Vietnam's nascent Internet business. In 1997, the Vietnamese government granted F.P.T. one of five licenses to sell Internet access to businesses and consumers. Today it is Vietnam's second-largest and fastest-growing Internet service provider, with 30,000 subscribers, almost one-third of the country's minuscule market.
With aggressive marketing, solicitous service and discounts for students, Mr. Binh has transformed F.P.T. into one of Vietnam's few genuine brand names. Next to the stodgy Internet service provider owned by the Vietnam Post and Telecommunications Corporation, F.P.T. seems positively user friendly.
Mr. Binh hopes to burnish that image by hiring 25 people to produce news, sports and entertainment for the Web. If the Vietnamese government were to relax its curbs on the Internet, Mr. Binh said his annual growth in subscribers would jump from its current rate of 40 percent to 70 percent.
That is a big if. Like their counterparts in China, Vietnamese officials view the Internet as an unruly child in need of discipline. While Vietnam has licensed five Internet service providers, the government allows only the Vietnam Post and Telecommunications Corporation to connect the country to the outside world.
This allows the state to monitor -- and often restrict -- data traffic for political, social or cultural reasons. Through a system of firewalls, Hanoi blocks access to sites that it deems subversive.
The tight grip of the Post and Telecommunications Corporation also makes Internet access expensive and slow. The single international connection, with a capacity of 15 to 20 megabits a second, is shared by all 100,000 Internet users, which translates into glacial transmission speeds during peak times.
And because of its monopoly on international traffic, the Post and Telecommunications Corporation charges the other four Internet access providers high monthly rates for leased lines, fees that they pass on to users. The hourly access rates of 86 cents to $1.71, in a country with an annual per capita gross domestic product of $350, put the Internet out of reach of most of the population.
At the Emotion, an Internet cafe in Hanoi that was originally backed by Mr. Binh, the clientele on a recent afternoon consisted mainly of expatriates and Western tourists who were checking their messages from home. A few local customers logged on for some hurried moments to check for e-mail.
"To most Vietnamese, it is too expensive to do anything more than that," said Do Kim Linh, a 26-year-old teacher who considers herself lucky that she can afford to go online for about 20 minutes a day.
The combination of high prices and slow transmission speeds has kept the Internet a novelty in Vietnam. With a population of 79 million and barely 100,000 users, the penetration rate lags far behind that of China or Indonesia, let alone that of more developed neighbors like Thailand or Malaysia.
Government officials defend the high costs, saying the Post and Telecommunications Corporation had to invest heavily to wire the country. But even they acknowledge that the growth of the Internet here has been sluggish.
"In the Western world, the Internet developed without regulation," said Tran Quang Cuong, policy director of the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications. "In my country, the Internet is regulated from the top down."
Still, Mr. Cuong said Hanoi was determined to lift Vietnam's Internet penetration, now about 0.1 percent, to the global average by 2010. Given that Vietnam presumes that this figure will be 10 percent, Mr. Cuong acknowledged it would be a huge stretch. To reach for that lofty goal, he said the state may license additional private Internet service providers, as well as allow other companies to establish international connections.
Some issues might be forced by a trade agreement that Vietnam and the United States signed in July, but that Congress has yet to ratify. Under the terms of the deal, American phone companies will be allowed into the Vietnamese market, starting three years after it takes effect.
For his part, Mr. Binh said he had detected a shift in the state's attitude toward the Internet, even in the last month.
"The government is starting to talk about the new economy, starting to talk about software development," he said. "They view the Internet as a powerful tool to lead Vietnam into the new economy."
But Mr. Binh is a realist. He says he thinks it will be another three years before the state throws off enough fetters to allow the Internet to flourish. In the meantime, he will grind away at his outsourcing business.
Patience is a virtue born of necessity for Vietnamese of Mr. Binh's generation. His own journey into business began in 1985, when he returned to Hanoi after earning a Ph.D. in mathematics and physics in Moscow. Mr. Binh said he and several friends wanted to start a company, but at the time Vietnam was in ruins economically. They had no money, no office and no prospects.
"All we had was a room to sit together and drink tea," Mr. Binh said, laughing ruefully at the memory.
In 1988, however, his family connections paid off. Mr. Binh won a coveted government stamp, which permitted him to start a company. He wanted to break into high technology, though he was not sure what kind of technology to pursue. At the time, the government was heavily focused on agriculture. A senior official suggested that Mr. Binh call his company Food Processing Technology, or F.P.T.
Mr. Binh quickly refocused F.P.T. on computers, winning a contract in 1990 to build a reservations network for Vietnam Airlines. Soon, F.P.T. had won an outsourcing contract from Olivetti of Italy. When President Clinton lifted the United States trade embargo on Vietnam in 1996, his company signed a deal with I.B.M.
Today, F.P.T. accounts for 20 percent of Vietnam's information technology market. Mr. Binh is scouting for an office in the United States. By 2002, he said the government would privatize the company. And in two years, Mr. Binh hopes his company will be listed on the stock exchange in Ho Chi Minh City, the former Saigon.
Despite his country's meager resources, Mr. Binh is convinced that F.P.T. will be able to take on much larger global companies. This is where he draws on the example of the North Vietnamese Army. Noting that the North Vietnamese were badly outgunned by the Americans, Mr. Binh said the Vietnamese responded to the superior force with flexibility, agility and adaptability.
Mr. Binh has invited several retired generals, though not his father-in-law, to speak to his employees on the importance of these qualities -- as well as having unanimity of purpose -- in dealing with larger rivals.
Striding to the markerboard, Mr. Binh drew a matrix with the North Vietnamese Army and the present-day American economy in one column, and the Vietnam-era United States Army and the present-day Vietnamese economy in the other.
"The U.S. economy is like the Vietnamese military was during the war," he said. "And the Vietnamese economy is like the U.S. military."
Far from forgetting Vietnam's war-torn past, Mr. Binh says he believes his country's future depends on embracing it.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
Remaking Baseball Diamonds in the Rough

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN 

 BODY:
SHOCKED and outraged!" shouts Richard A. Kahan, shirt sleeves rolled up above his elbows as if there's manual labor that needs doing, as he competes with the rush hour din emoting upward from Madison Avenue into his donated office space at the Loews Corporation. "I couldn't have lived without baseball. No kid should have to," adds Mr. Kahan, 54, who has appointed himself official restorer of New York City's diamonds -- public school baseball diamonds, that is.
What has rendered Mr. Kahan, president of the Urban Assembly and former chief executive officer of the New York State Urban Development Corporation shocked and outraged is the nightmarish condition of the city's public school playing fields. Football fields with pothole-size divots. Baseball diamonds decomposing into the landfills that they were built on. Swimming pools with gang graffiti where the water ought to be. Zero dollars in the budget for fixing the woebegone fields at 50 city schools. 
 He gets red in the face just thinking about it. And inspired. The last time he felt this way he had just quit an uninspiring position as chief executive officer of the Continental Management Group and hopped a plane to South Africa -- on impulse -- to be in on history when Nelson Mandela left prison. Trouble was, he found that his expertise (urban planning and development) wasn't required, so after a month he came home and helped to found the Urban Assembly.
"It took me until 1990 to realize my happiest times were in public service; I was never happy in real estate," says Mr. Kahan, grateful nonetheless for the "bricks and mortar education" he received from the builder Samuel J. Lefrak. (It's why Mr. Kahan can build anything.)
Through the Urban Assembly, Mr. Kahan turned his attention to education, a subject "that used to make my eyes glass over, but then we opened our first New Visions School, the Bronx School for Law, Government and Criminal Justice, and I was hooked. When I walked out of there after opening day, I said to my wife, 'Now I can get hit by that proverbial 250-ton truck, because I've finally done something that really matters with my life.' "
But he isn't finished with the feel-good projects.
This year Mr. Kahan and some deep-pocketed philanthropists including Preston Robert Tisch, the co-chairman of Loews and co-owner of the New York Giants, formed Take the Field Inc., a nonprofit organization dedicated to reconstituting fields needing face lifts. For every $1 the group provides, city government has agreed to pledge $3. So far, $16 million has been raised, with seven projects set for completion by July.
The first, a $2 million revamping of the fields at George Washington High School in Washington Heights, is almost finished. (Today, Mr. Kahan and his group will receive $600,000 from the State Assembly toward its second project, rebuilding fields at Seward Park High School on the Lower East Side.)
Next year, Mr. Kahan said, his group intends to double its workload and budget.
THIS field of dreams thing goes back a long way with Mr. Kahan. Ask him why gave up the piano for baseball when he was 14 and he'll say that his mother made him do it. There he was, in uniform and cleats, dutifully seated at the instrument in his Mount Vernon, N.Y., living room, trying to squeeze in a 15-minute practice session before his night game. His mother insisted he practice longer. He refused. She told him to choose between piano and baseball. Guess what he picked?
He was too short to play first base beyond junior high but too resilient to quit, so he settled for being a decent outfielder in high school, then switched to wrestling and the martial arts at college, where his little-boy dreams of becoming a major league slugger were replaced by a curriculum mouthful that Mr. Kahan calls International Diplomatic History. Then that was replaced by urban policy, and instead of going off to China to be a trade lawyer, Mr. Kahn stayed home. And got deeply into real estate, public and private.
He never quite became "the next Robert Moses" the way he says The New York Daily News predicted he might when he was 32 and juggling the development of Battery Park City and the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center with one hand and concocting a preservation strategy for Radio City Music Hall with the other. Burnout intruded. As for his 1998 gubernatorial bid, he didn't make it onto the Democratic primary ballot, much less win what he calls his dream job.
But Mr. Kahan, who confesses he has had a problem deferring to authority figures since kindergarten -- hence his preference for being one -- has always been a master at coming up with new missions that make a public statement.
He graduated from Columbia Law School but has never practiced law: there's been too much else to do. Now he is back to baseball. Not playing it himself (along with the bum shoulder that saved him from the draft and Vietnam, there's a rebuilt hip and cornea trouble that limits his boxing to bouts with the speedbag), but raising $100 million so children in public school can.
As a capitalist, he concludes that he has been a flop: "I liked money, but I didn't care enough about it. When I was at the U.D.C., I woke up each day and felt like I could chew through a wall. We were on a mission."
Here he goes again.

HEADLINE: Lawyers Give Plan to Split Auction-Case Settlement

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
The lead lawyers representing the more than 100,000 buyers and sellers in a recently settled class-action lawsuit against the Sotheby's and Christie's auction houses have detailed for the first time how they propose to divide the $512 million settlement.
In court papers that were filed on Friday and made available yesterday, the lawyers, from the firm of Boies, Schiller & Flexner, proposed that the buyers and sellers, who say they were victims of a scheme to fix commissions on the part of the two houses, receive proportionate amounts of money based on their purchases and sales. 
Using a formula developed by Jeffrey Leitzinger, a pricing and markets analyst retained by the firm, sellers would receive about 1 percent of the sales price of their offerings. Buyers would receive 5 percent of the sales price on each purchase of $50,000 or less and a flat $2,500 for each purchase above $50,000.
The figures represent the increases in the buyer's premiums that Sotheby's and Christie's instituted in 1993. Increases in seller's commissions, which were more variable, were computed through the use of economic models.
The papers, submitted in a motion for preliminary approval of the $512 million settlement filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, did not disclose the amount set aside for legal fees, which were arrived at in a proposal the firm filed months ago with Judge Lewis A. Kaplan.
The class-action suit stemmed from a far-ranging federal investigation of the two auction giants that moved into high gear when a former chief executive of Christie's delivered papers that documented years of collusion between two companies. Christie's received conditional amnesty from prosecution in exchange for cooperating. Last month, Sotheby's pleaded guilty to violating antitrust laws as did Diana D. Brooks, its former president and chief executive.
In September, Sotheby's and Christie's agreed to pay $512 million -- $412 million in cash and an additional $100 million in coupons -- to settle the claims by the customers represented in the class action.
The documents filed on Friday state that the settlement is 1.79 times the amount buyers and sellers were overcharged, which was estimated at $286 million by Mr. Leitzinger. He estimated that the auction houses overcharged buyers $201.2 million during the period from Jan. 1, 1993, through December 1999. Of the $201.2 million, $89.2 million is from Christie's and $111.9 million from Sotheby's. Mr. Leitzinger also estimated that the auction houses overcharged sellers $85.3 million, with $49.7 million of that from Sotheby's and $35.5 million from Christie's.
Within 30 days of preliminary approval by the court, Sotheby's and Christie's would each deposit in an escrow account $100 million in cash. An additional $106 million in cash would be deposited within 30 days of the final approval by the court. Each house would also deposit another $50 million either in cash or discount certificates within 30 days of the final court approval. Boies, Schiller & Flexner is to submit a plan of allocation on Nov. 27 that will provide more details of the distribution.
Also on Nov. 27, Sotheby's and Christie's will present to Judge Kaplan further details about the payment of the $100 million worth of certificates to clients wishing to use them as credit against seller's commissions and certain consignment-related charges.
No hearings have been set on the motion for preliminary approval or on final approval of the settlement.
As is typical of most class-action cases, members will have a certain number of days, still to be specified by the court, to opt out of the class.
A separate class-action suit filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan by the law firms of Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld & Toll of Washington and Milberg, Weiss, Bershad, Hynes & Lorach of New York seeks to represent foreign buyers and sellers although no class has been certified by the judge.

HEADLINE: Weyerhaeuser Bids for Willamette

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
The Weyerhaeuser Company disclosed yesterday that it had made a $5.3 billion, $48-a-share cash offer to purchase Willamette Industries, setting the stage for a hostile takeover battle.
Weyerhaeuser, the nation's third-largest forest products company, said it made its offer in a Nov. 6 letter from its chairman and chief executive, Steven R. Rogel, to Duane C. McDougall, Willamette's president and chief executive. 
 Willamette's board met last week to consider the offer, but has not reached a decision.
In a letter on Sunday to William Swindells, Willamette's chairman, Mr. Rogel said that as a result of the board's failure to act, "We are forced to assume that we must consider other alternatives to consummate a transaction."
The offer that was disclosed yesterday is not the first time Weyerhaeuser has approached Willamette about a possible combination. The company said it held such discussions with Willamette two years ago.
Willamette, based in Portland, Ore., said in a statement that its board continued to review the proposal, "and will respond in due course."
"It is unfortunate that Weyerhaeuser chose to make its proposal public at this time," the statement added.
With the industry in the throes of consolidation, Wall Street analysts said the combination made good sense.
"This is a great fit," said Linda Lieberman, a senior managing director at Bear, Stearns. "It gives Weyerhaeuser a nice add-on in most of the businesses they are in."
Investors reacted by sharply bidding up the price of Willamette's stock, which gained $11.06 a share, or 32 percent, closing at $45.81 on the New York Stock Exchange. Weyerhaeuser, whose shares have been slumping since December, closed at $41.69, down $1.19.
Weyerhaeuser's offer represents a 38 percent premium over Friday's closing price of $34.75 for Willamette's shares. In addition to the cash offer, Weyerhaeuser would assume $1.7 billion in Willamette debt.
Chip Dillon, a paper and forest products analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said the bid, while attractive, might need to be sweetened to be accepted by Willamette shareholders. But Mr. Dillon also said a competing bid from another forest products company was unlikely.
"There has never been a deal I have seen where all cards were put on the table at once," he said. "Since at least 75 percent of Willamette's stock is in institutional hands, the company will have to come to the table. We are assuming that Weyerhaeuser will end up paying about $50 a share" to complete the acquisition.
Mr. Dillon said that International Paper and Georgia Pacific, two potential bidders for Willamette, were busy absorbing companies they had recently purchased, and that European paper companies were not likely to express an interest.
"I don't think you will see any other bidders emerge," he said. "That is one reason Weyerhaeuser is being so bold."
Mr. Rogel, who was the chief executive at Willamette before moving to Weyerhaeuser in 1997, said in a telephone interview that his company had lined up financing to pay for the acquisition.
"This is a good value for Willamette shareholders," he said. "We would hope their board will sit down and work on these issues. Working together, we can reach a conclusion rapidly."
Ms. Lieberman of Bear, Stearns said that adding $7 billion in fresh debt to Weyerhaeuser's existing debt of about $5 billion would not put the company in a terribly difficult position.
"As you are going into an economic slowdown, any debt is a burden," she said. "But Weyerhaeuser has assets they could monetize if they wanted to take down debt fast. Would it be prudent to take down some debt immediately? Yes, it would be."

HEADLINE: Lawsuits Block Path of a Catskills Casino

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
In the seven months since Park Place Entertainment Corporation announced that it would build the largest casino resort in the world in the Catskills, the project has attracted more lawsuits than gamblers.
Rival developers and others have challenged what they described as the deception and bare-knuckled tactics that Park Place, the world's largest casino company, used in trying to seize control of Indian gambling in New York State. 
The resulting fray has worried many residents of Sullivan County, who had thought that after 30 years of effort, gambling -- and the hundreds of thousands of visitors it would attract -- was finally going to come to their economically depressed corner of the state.
Yesterday, one such rival, Catskill Development, filed suit against Park Place in United States District Court in Manhattan claiming that the gambling company had wrongfully engaged in a secret, seven-month campaign to persuade the St. Regis Mohawks to scuttle the tribe's longterm contract with Catskill Development to build a $500 million casino at the Monticello Raceway.
Catskill Development's plan gained federal approval on April 6, but eight days later, the Mohawks abruptly signed a deal with Park Place, giving the company exclusive rights to develop tribal casinos in New York in return for a $3 million loan.
The suit contends that Park Place intended to eliminate "competition to its Atlantic City casinos; or, it would steal the rights to develop and manage what would become the most profitable casino in the world," in order to monopolize New York casino gaming.
Thomas P. Puccio, a lawyer for Catskill Development, said: "There was a concerted effort on the part of Park Place to undermine our deal with the Mohawks in a way that violates state law. They induced the Mohawks to break their agreement with us."
Clive Cummis, general counsel for Park Place, refused to comment, saying he had not seen the lawsuit. Park Place has insisted that it is going forward with plans to build a casino resort called the Anawana Club at Kutsher's Country Club, a 1,400-acre property about five miles north of Monticello.
But word of the lawsuit sparked dismay in Sullivan County, where many of the area's once vibrant hotels and resorts lie in ruins. Anthony P. Cellini, the supervisor of the town of Thompson and a member of the county's gambling committee, said he still held out hope that Park Place would cut a deal with Catskill Development. But he said he feared that the opportunity for gambling was waning.
"It's not looking real promising today," Mr. Cellini said yesterday.
The suit comes a month after secret negotiations between the two sides fell through. In early October, Arthur Goldberg, chief executive of Park Place, was seeking a deal to buy out Catskill Development for $300 million and build a casino and hotels at the Raceway. But the deal appeared to hit a snag on Oct. 16 and Mr. Goldberg died three days later.
A dissident group of Mohawks has filed a separate suit in tribal court against Park Place, claiming that the company duped the Mohawk chiefs into breaking its contract with Catskill Development. The dissidents say that Park Place wanted to stop any casino project in New York to protect the company's three casinos in Atlantic City. A default hearing is scheduled for Nov. 17.
"We don't believe Park Place will ever open a casino for the Mohawks and never had any intention of doing so," said Michael Rhodes-Devey, a lawyer for the dissident Mohawks.
In another lawsuit filed in state court in Nassau County, Ivan Kaufman, whose company ran the Mohawk's small, money-losing casino on the Akwesasne Reservation, contended that Park Place doublecrossed him by ruining his relationship with the Mohawks and reneging on a $30 million deal to take over the Akwesasne casino.
To further muddy the waters, the Appellate Division ruled last week that a lawsuit challenging Gov. George E. Pataki's right to approve Indian gambling without the State Legislature's consent could proceed in State Supreme Court. Gambling advocates fear that as a rule, casino gambling would not get legislative approval.
Governor Pataki has long said he favored Indian casinos in former resort areas like the Catskills. But after Park Place began battling with Catskill Development in May, he said he would take no further action until the Mohawk situation was clarified.
The confusion has not prevented other proposals from surfacing. David Flaum, a developer from Rochester, has said that he is putting together a deal with the Seneca-Cayuga tribe of Oklahoma for a casino on the Shawanga Lodge property south of Monticello in Mamakating. And Catskill Development recently told county officials and the town of Monticello that it plans to substitute the New York Cayuga tribe for the Mohawks for a casino at Monticello Raceway.
But Kevin Gover, an assistant secretary of the Interior Department in charge of the agency's Bureau of Indian Affairs, has made it clear that they would all have to file applications and wait for two years or more. He said Federal approval of the Mohawk casino at the Raceway could not be transferred to either Kutsher's Country Club for Park Place, or to the Cayugas for Catskill Development.
The Catskill Development lawsuit also claims that Donald J. Trump, who also owns casinos in Atlantic City, lobbied against Indian gambling in New York while he was cooperating with Mr. Goldberg, who secretly wooed the Mohawk chiefs. Catskill Development said that Mr. Goldberg had turned down its earlier offer to make him a partner in the Monticello casino. Instead, the suit states, Mr. Goldberg got the Mohawks to kill its deal with Catskill Development by linking his commitment to salvage the tribe's nearly bankrupt Akwesasne casino to an exclusive right to develop and build casinos for the Mohawks in New York.

Weyerhaeuser Makes Offer For Willamette Industries
The Weyerhaeuser Company, the third-largest forest products concern in the United States, disclosed that it had made a $5.3 billion, $48-a-share cash offer to buy Willamette, which could lead to a hostile takeover battle. Willamette's board met last week to consider the offer, but has not reached a decision.
Investors reacted by bidding up the price of Willamette's shares, which gained $11.06, or 32 percent, to $45.81. Weyerhaeuser, whose shares have been slumping since December, closed at $41.69, down $1.19. Page C2.

HEADLINE: COUNTING THE VOTE: THE REPUBLICAN RESPONSE;
For the Most Part, the Republicans Close Ranks Behind Bush After a Defeat in Federal Court

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13

 BODY:
With rare exceptions, Republicans backed Gov. George W. Bush's approach to Florida's murky election returns today, even after the Bush campaign's suit to block further recounting by hand was thrown out by a federal judge in Miami.
Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, for example, said the campaign's lawsuit was necessary because many Republicans felt "we were not defending our position well enough and whatever the Democrats were doing, we ought to be doing more of it." 
 Republicans seemed to be more united behind their candidate today, after the legal setback, than Democrats were last week when many criticized the campaign of Vice President Al Gore for even talking about suing. One friend of Mr. Gore sarcastically put it today, "I guess all the statesmen are in our party."
Representative David Dreier of California, chairman of the House Rules Committee, complained of the Gore campaign seeking "recount after recount -- to push for recounts until you get the outcome you want."
Mr. Dreier said he supported today's decision by Florida's secretary of state to enforce a Tuesday evening deadline for certifying the results of last week's voting in the state.
But there were some Republican dissenters. Former Senator Warren B. Rudman of New Hampshire, who was a supporter of Arizona Senator John McCain during the primaries, said: "I think everything should be done to establish the real vote. I think artificial deadlines are a mistake. The electoral college doesn't meet until December."
Mr. Rudman added, "If you want to be fair to the American people, then there ought to be a very careful recount of all the ballots. The American people ought to have full confidence that the winner is the winner."
Representative Peter T. King of New York said he disagreed with the Bush campaign's attempt to prevent a hand recount. But, he said, "there should be one all over the state."
Reflecting the view of many of his colleagues, Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania said: "If you go to a hand count, it will take an interminable amount of time and there will be an enormous amount of controversy. Judges will be looking at ballots and there will be appeal after appeal. It's a bottomless pit."
Others argued that hand recounts were inherently suspect. "The lack of a uniform standard in this hand recount ought to be raising real big flags for all of us," said Representative Nancy L. Johnson of Connecticut.
Bill Brock, a former Republican Party national chairman, said, "The reason most of us have gone to machines is that they are more accurate." And he ridiculed the idea of following arguments made by William M. Daley, the Gore campaign chairman, who lives in Chicago where, Mr. Brock said, vote fraud was made into "a new art form."
Representative Dick Armey, the House majority leader, said he could not imagine "how somebody discerns the will or intention of the voter in a hand count."
But Senator George V. Voinovich of Ohio said he felt the Bush camp should not have gone to court first. "If I were in their position, I probably wouldn't have done it," he said.
Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio said he was not sure if filing a federal lawsuit was a mistake because, "It's inevitable that the courts will intervene in this process." Representative Sherwood L. Boehlert of New York defended the decision, "There is so much at stake that they have got to protect what they think they earned -- the required number of electoral votes."
Mr. Armey said, "Neither side can just sit down and let the other side walk away with the presidential election based on partial results." An upstate New York colleague, Representative Amo Houghton, even sympathized a bit with the Gore campaign, saying "If I were behind, I would try to pick over the votes as long as I could." But he said a quick end was needed.
Hardly anyone agreed with Mr. Rudman's view that there was no real hurry. Representative Christopher Shays of Connecticut said, "I think both sides should say 'By Friday, one of us will concede and one of us will be president.' " But he said he did not know "which of these two candidates will provide a selfless moment."
Representative Mark Sanford of South Carolina said, "For a society that's used to getting a Big Mac within 15 seconds, this is not at all what we have grown accustomed to."
Representative Ray LaHood of Illinois, said: "We need to move on and decide. I don't think people will stand to have much more of this recounting going on. I think at some point one of them will quit."
Without prompt closure, warned Senator Gordon H. Smith of Oregon, "we will have an aftertaste that will never go away."
Several lawmakers warned of the consequences of delay.
"A great many people are underestimating the threat to our system of government the longer this goes on," Mr. Boehner said. "The people of Rome never thought their government would ever collapse. The Greeks never thought they'd lose it. Americans, being the great pollyannaists of the world, I don't think realize the great threat."
A less apocalyptic set of concerns was offered by Senator John W. Warner of Virginia, who said he hoped both candidates realized that electoral indecision "might lead someone who wants to strike at the United States to do so," someone who failed to understand "that we're strong, that the chain of command is strong." He said he also hoped they understood that delay "could be the cause of undermining the economy and loss of confidence."
While there was little dissent from the position taken by their party's candidate for president, a number of Republicans declined to discuss it. They included Representatives Phil English of Pennsylvania and Constance A. Morella of Maryland.
Others said they simply did not know what should be done in Florida. Senator Warner was one of them. So was Representative Shays, who said, "I think it's a state issue."
Representative Jim Leach of Iowa said: "I'm personally staying out of this. This could come to Congress and I want to be open-minded about it."
While several lawmakers had precise solutions, calling for deadlines like Tuesday or Friday, others acknowledged that the situation was not simple. "Getting it right is easier said than done," said Mr. Boehner.
The most upbeat view came from Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska.
"I actually think -- and maybe because I am an optimist -- that this might in fact force the next president to deal with some of the urgent challenges and issues of our time and develop a coalition agenda, a bipartisan agenda," Senator Hagel said. "It might in a strange way unhook us from the special-interest groups."

HEADLINE: Rate Commission Clears Way for Penny Rise in Price of Stamp

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13

 BODY:
Mailing a letter in the United States will probably become a cent more expensive in January.
The Postal Rate Commission, an independent agency that sets rates, today granted a United States Postal Services request to raise the price of one-ounce first-class mail to 34 cents from 33 cents. 
 The increase will take effect by Jan. 7 at the earliest. The Postal Service Board of Governors, which normally approves such measures, must vote on the proposal.
Commission officials said the increase, which is expected to bring an additional $2.5 billion in revenue, was needed to offset rising costs. It falls short, however, of the $2.8 billion requested by the Postal Service in January.
Other plans include a 30-cent increase in the one-pound Priority Mail service, to $3.50 from $3.20; a 50-cent increase for 8-ounce Express Mail service, to $12.25 from $11.75; and a 50-cent increase in certified mail, to $1.90 from $1.40. Postcard postage will remain 20 cents.
Magazine publishers succeeded in lobbying for a somewhat lower rate increase than first proposed for periodicals, a category that includes most consumer magazines. The Magazine Publishers of America fought a proposed increase of 15 percent. According to the publishers, that would have cost the industry $300 million over the next two years. The commission called for an increase of 9.9 percent.
Nina B. Link, president of the publishers' group, said today that she was pleased that the commission had met the group's goal but added that the group would continue to fight steep increases.
Christopher M. Little, president of the Meredith Publishing Group, said the increase was too high.
"I appreciate that this has come down all the way from 15 percent, but this is still significantly higher than the rate of inflation," he said. "I think the magazine industry has to maintain the same level of intensity and effort going forward to never let this happen again."

SIGNS OF A SLOWING ECONOMY

BYLINE: By Leslie Eaton 

 BODY:
New York City's torrid economy could be on the verge of a slowdown, according to a report released yesterday by economists working for Alan G. Hevesi, the city comptroller. Their report found that help-wanted advertising, a traditional indicator used to forecast economic conditions, declined slightly in the third quarter. Another indicator, initial unemployment claims, rose; many temporary government workers lost their jobs in the third quarter as the federal census was completed. On the other hand, private-sector job creation was still strong, the unemployment rate fell and income tax collections rose.

HEADLINE: Documents Shed Light on Assassination of Chilean in U.S.

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS and DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13

 BODY:
A month before the assassination of a Chilean diplomat and an American colleague in downtown Washington in 1976, the United States government ordered its envoys in Latin America to try to avert a plot to murder leftist opponents of the region's governments, documents released today show.
But the American ambassador in Chile, David Popper, refused to convey what Washington had learned of the plot or even the government's concerns to the leader of Chile's military junta, Gen. Augusto Pinochet, saying he did not want to offend the general by associating him with the plot, known as Operation Condor, the documents show. "He might well take as an insult any inference that he was connected with such assassination plots," Mr. Popper said in a cable to Washington. 
 General Pinochet's secret police chief, Gen. Manuel Contreras, was later convicted in Chile of ordering what was, up to that time, the worst act of foreign-sponsored terrorism on American soil: the bombing on Sept. 21, 1976, of the car in which Orlando Letelier, a former confidant of the deposed Chilean president, Salvador Allende, was traveling to his job at a Washington research institute along with two colleagues. He and Ronni K. Moffitt were killed; her husband, Michael Moffitt, survived the blast.
While there is no evidence that an American warning to General Pinochet or General Contreras would have thwarted the attack on Embassy Row here, critics of the American government's role in Chile during the 1970's said today that it represented, at a minimum, a lost opportunity.
"An extraordinary tragedy," said Peter Kornbluh, senior analyst at the National Security Archive, a private clearinghouse for declassified documents. "Such a meeting might well have prevented that act of assassination from taking place."
The information came to light today as the Clinton administration released more than 16,000 documents on America's relationship with Chile from the years before the 1973 military coup in which the junta deposed President Allende to 1991, after the country's transition to democracy. It was the final release in a declassification project ordered in February 1999 by President Clinton.
The documents, including more than 450 on covert operations that the Central Intelligence Agency earlier sought to withhold, support those who argue that General Pinochet was complicit in the assassination conspiracy, Mr. Kornbluh said.
While critics of United States policy in the region have long said that the Letelier murder could not have been carried out without General Pinochet's knowledge, the documents released today include a State Department cable showing that he called President Alfredo Stroessner of Paraguay asking him for "an urgent favor." The favor was that Paraguay issue passports to two agents of the Chilean secret police, according to the State Department document, which was marked "secret" and apparently written in the summer of 1976.
The government of Paraguay complied, but the American Embassy there barred the agents from traveling to the United States, asserting that they had lied about their plans and their reason for going to the United States. The two later entered using Chilean passports.
Those two men, Michael Townley and Armando Fernandez, were convicted years later for their role in arranging the car bombing.
General Pinochet returned to Chile this year after being held under house arrest in Britain at the request of a Spanish judge who wanted him tried under an international torture treaty. But the general was released after he was ruled to be too ill to stand trial.
The newly declassified documents also show that General Pinochet's intelligence chief, General Contreras, tried to fend off demands for his extradition to the United States after he was indicted here for the Letelier murder with threats that he could implicate American officials in the killings. The documents provide no proof that General Contreras could produce such evidence.
In 1991, the documents show, the C.I.A. destroyed its file on General Contreras, who had been a paid informant for the agency.
Mark Mansfield, the agency's spokesman, said the documents "speak for themselves." But he urged people to "view them and the events they describe within their proper historical context."
"C.I.A. activities were conducted within the framework of U.S. foreign policy at the time," he said, "and covert actions were undertaken at the direction of the White House and interagency policy coordinating committees."
The outlines of Washington's role in Chile are known, including the Nixon administration's support of groups plotting to prevent Mr. Allende from assuming the presidency after his election in 1970, and its subsequent efforts to destabilize his socialist government.
In 1975 the Senate Intelligence Committee reported that from 1963 to 1973, the C.I.A. spent more than $8 million on disinformation campaigns, propaganda and financial aid to groups plotting a coup.
And this September, a C.I.A. report to Congress acknowledged that the agency had a relationship with General Contreras from 1974 to 1977, and that he received a one-time payment of an undisclosed sum in 1975.
A senior administration official said the new documents "reveal the evolution of U.S. policy quite well."
The documents released today show American officials moving from open enthusiasm for the coup that toppled the Allende government and brought General Pinochet to power, to reservations about his junta's human rights abuses, to support for the democratic opposition that unseated the general.
Minutes of high-level meetings released today show that President Nixon feared that the election of Mr. Allende could set off a drift toward Communism in South America. And he appeared determined to undermine the Allende government.
"We are going to cold turkey them on the economy," Mr. Nixon said, suggesting that the United States would flood world markets with copper to force down the price of Chile's main resource. His advisers warned that such dumping would be illegal.
After General Pinochet's coup, the junta arrested vast numbers of people they suspected of being leftists -- Chileans and foreigners living in Chile. Imprisoned in soccer stadiums, they were interrogated. Many were tortured and some 3,000 were killed, according to a investigation in 1990 by the Chilean National Commission on Truth and Reconciliation.
The documents reveal that one of the Americans killed at a stadium in Santiago, Frank Teruggi, had been labeled a subversive by the C.I.A.
Mr. Mansfield said the agency had "no prior knowledge" of the circumstances leading to Mr. Teruggi's death.
Documents declassified by the Clinton administration have shown that American officials were aware of plans for assassinations in foreign capitals nearly two months before Mr. Letelier's killing. In late August 1976, Philip Habib, then under secretary of state for political affairs, ordered United States ambassadors throughout Latin America to voice American disapproval.
But more than a week after the Letelier assassination, Mr. Popper, the American ambassador in Chile, cabled the State Department to reject approaching General Pinochet. Instead, he suggested that an intelligence official convey Washington's concerns to General Contreras.
Mr. Popper declined to comment on his actions then. "It was a long time ago," said Mr. Popper, who is 88. "I'm a very old man."

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about newly declassified United States government documents on the relationship with Chile in the 1970's and beyond misstated the date of a cable sent to Washington by an American ambassador in Chile. The cable, in which Ambassador David Popper rejected an order to convey Washington's displeasure with plans by governments in the region to assassinate opponents overseas, was dated Aug. 24, 1976. It was thus sent before -- not after -- Orlando Letelier, a former Chilean diplomat, was assassinated in Washington on Sept. 21, 1976.

HEADLINE: WINE TALK;
For the Thanksgiving Meal, An All-American Choice

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial

 BODY:
WE have always been a drinking nation; the rise and fall of Prohibition proved that. Even so, serving wine at the Thanksgiving table 50 years ago would have seemed somehow un-American, almost subversive.
In Norman Rockwell's classic Saturday Evening Post depiction of this holiday dinner, not a drop of alcohol is to be seen. But don't the ruddy cheeks of Rockwell's menfolk hint at an earlier pass or two at the communal jug? And Grandma's comely blush -- is that from kitchen heat, or the cooking wine? 
 Next Thursday, hundreds of thousands of us will pour some kind of wine with the most American of all meals. The wine may not yet have the cachet of the creamed onions, but we've come a long way.
What wine to drink? Certainly it should be American, as Thanksgiving remains an American festival -- unless the French appropriate it the way they have filched Halloween. And it should be moderately priced wine; Thanksgiving is not an elitist celebration.
Sadly, moderately priced is easier said than done. In going after the more affluent market, the American wine industry has brushed off the customer of limited means. There is no lack of low-price wine, but most of it is mediocre. The lower end of the market has been left to the French, the Chileans and the Italians.
Even so, there are some good American wines to be had at reasonable prices. I had hoped to come up with a list of good wines at $10 and under. I could do this only with chardonnays, and even in this category, raising the bar to $15 improved the picture markedly.
There are actually more white wines, even chardonnays, in the $10 range than there are reds. That is fortunate, because for many Americans, wine is chardonnay. My chardonnay list would include Estancia, Gallo Sonoma, Indigo Hills (another Gallo label), Meridian Santa Barbara, Kendall-Jackson and two from Washington State -- Columbia Crest and Hogue Cellars. All of them are 1998's and less than $10. I particularly liked a chardonnay called Morro Bay; it has good acid.
In the $15-or-less group, I liked Rodney Strong Chalk Hill, Edna Valley and Simi. They are worth the extra money. Don't expect Burgundian elegance from any of these wines, but they do offer interesting flavors and can stand up to almost any Thanksgiving meal.
This is mostly a search for red wines, however. When it comes to American reds, zinfandel is by far the most intelligent choice. First of all, it is the most American of the top varietals, even though, like most of us, it came from somewhere else. We are deluged with dull cabernets and merlots, one virtually indistinguishable from another, but somehow, zinfandel seems to cling to its individuality. What's more, its bright spicy flavors make any meal taste good.
A lot of thin zinfandels were made in 1997, but in fact, some were quite good. Particularly attractive is a 1997 from Rancho Zabaco, yet another Gallo label. This wine, which includes 12 percent petite sirah, is made from Dry Creek Valley grapes, and is $16. Dry Creek is one of California's premium zinfandel sources.
Gallo's own label, a zinfandel from the Barelli Creek ranch in the Alexander Valley, is outstanding. From the same appellation, Alexander Valley Vineyards' Sin Zin is a bit more smoothly textured and should appeal to people who like goofy names. Both are around $15.
The 1998 zinfandels, which, over all, are probably better than the 1997's, are also more expensive. Of the few I've tried, I can recommend Mother Clone from Pedroncelli Winery in the Dry Creek region in Sonoma. This is a good chunky wine with intensity. It's around $12. Seghesio Winery's Sonoma Zinfandel has good spice in the taste and bouquet. Seghesio has long produced fine zinfandels, and this is one of its latest at a truly reasonable price. These wines are in the $16 category.
The $10 cabernet sauvignon is still around, but it is in disguise. Lots of cabernets selling for $20 are the old $10 wines, unchanged except for the price. A few are more affordable. Beaulieu Vineyards' Rutherford, for example, is around $15, up from $9 a few years ago. But given the wild inflation of wine prices, it is still a good buy. Likewise for St. Francis, and it sells for a dollar or two less.
Both these wines are 1997's, as is the most recent release of R. H. Phillips's Toasted Head Merlot. R. H. Phillips is a winery in the northern Central Valley, in an area the Giguiere family, who own the place, call the Dunnigan Hills. This is an intriguing wine with touches of malbec, petit verdot and cabernet sauvignon. R. H. Phillips also makes an Australian sort of blend with 55 percent Mendocino cabernet sauvignon and 45 percent of its own syrah. These two wines sell for around $15.
R. H. Philips has another merlot, into which it tosses two different petite sirahs, some petit verdot and alicante bouschet. It is aged in oak for a year, then sold for around $9. At that price you can invite those cousins you haven't seen for years.
If you are still into merlot -- not everyone has switched to syrah yet -- consider one from Francis Ford Coppola's Diamond Series. This is not a wimpy merlot with no backbone. It comes from the same winery as Mr. Coppola's famous Rubicon.
If you're adventurous, there's Pelligrini's merlot from Long Island's North Fork. This is merlot in the St.-Emilion style. Elegant and delicious.

HEADLINE: House Approves Tax Measure to Avert Trade Conflict With Europe

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14

 BODY:
The House gave final Congressional approval today to legislation that alters tax breaks to American exports and that averts, at least temporarily, a potentially explosive trade conflict with Europe.
The House voted 316 to 72 to replace a law that gives tax relief to United States companies on some foreign sales with a plan that the Clinton administration says complies with World Trade Organization rules. The Senate passed identical legislation late last month, and President Clinton is expected to sign it into law shortly. 
 Passage of the legislation reduces the likelihood that a multibillion-dollar tax dispute between the United States and Europe will result in sweeping sanctions anytime soon. It also gives the Clinton administration the ammunition it sought to resolve or at least indefinitely delay outstanding trade conflicts with Europe during its remaining time in office.
Mr. Clinton, seeking to polish his record as one of the most pro-trade presidents in recent history, has pushed to settle festering trans-Atlantic battles over taxes, beef and bananas by the time Europe and the United States meet in December for their regular economic summit meeting.
Congress had repeatedly missed deadlines for completing work on the new tax legislation and risked giving Europe the right to impose sanctions immediately. But by passing the bill during its lame duck session, Congress appears to have guaranteed that Europe will not hit American exports with penalties during Mr. Clinton's term.
The new law allows the Clinton administration to fulfill its end of a diplomatic pact under which Europe agreed not to act to restrict trade until the World Trade Organization decides whether the revised law meets W.T.O. standards. The matter will not be decided permanently, however, until the trade organization reaches a decision.
Under trade organization procedures and the agreement between the United States and Europe on how to handle the sensitive issue, no sanctions are to be imposed until next June at the earliest.
This week, administration officials said, Europe is expected to introduce a claim for damages and a list of American products that it will use as targets if it gets the authorization to do so during coming trade organization hearings.
Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, said the new legislation "demonstrates the United States' commitment to abide by its W.T.O. obligations." She expressed hope that it would put the tax issue to rest.
Congressional Republicans also hailed the passage as crucial for United States companies. Bill Archer, a Texas Republican who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said the measure averted "the mother of all trade wars" with Europe.
American companies, including Boeing and General Motors, now save about $4 billion a year by channeling some foreign sales through offshore subsidiaries that are taxed at lower rates. After Europe complained about the tax breaks to the World Trade Organization, the tax breaks were ruled illegal export subsidies. That gave Europe the right to impose duties on American exports equal to the savings American companies derive from the law.
The new law actually offers more tax relief -- up to $6 billion annually -- to companies that export goods or manufacture them abroad. But companies would not need to channel sales through offshore subsidiaries, which are often situated in tax havens. They would get the tax breaks directly.
The Clinton administration says the W.T.O. will soon decide in its favor, ending the matter. The European Union maintains that the new law is merely an expansion of the old one and has said that it still plans to impose sanctions pending a fresh W.T.O. victory.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Forbes and Fortune are trying to bolster circulation among business movers and shakers.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
FORBES and Fortune -- the George W. Bush and Al Gore of business magazines -- are at it again.
The two publications, longtime competitors for circulation and advertising, are introducing campaigns aimed at generating additional dollars in both realms. The ads are as pointed as they are sophisticated, portraying the pursuit of success in business as a battle to be as fiercely fought as, say, an unresolved presidential election. 
 The campaigns arrive as the business category of the American magazine industry completes what is likely to be a record year. On Jan. 1, Fortune, published by the Time Inc. unit of Time Warner Inc., plans to raise its rate base, the circulation guaranteed to advertisers, to 830,000 from 810,000. Forbes, published by Forbes Inc., plans to raise its rate base that same day, to 900,000 from 850,000.
But uncertainty is beginning to cloud the outlook for 2001 with the dot-com shake-out threatening to dampen demand for ad space as well as subscriptions as laid-off readers no longer need to keep up with developments in a field in which they no longer work.
"We're certainly mindful of the competitive world we operate in," said Jack Haire, president of the Fortune Group unit of Time Inc. in New York, which publishes Fortune, Fortune Small Business and eCompany Now magazines.
"But the reason the competition's there," he added, "is that it's a great time to be covering business."
The competition for Fortune and Forbes now extends beyond their traditional rival, Business Week, which is in the early stages of a review for its account, with billings estimated at $10 million. Publications based abroad like The Economist are seeking American readers. And the new economy has spawned a spate of magazines specializing in coverage of technology, e-commerce and the Internet, the so-called Seven Dots: Business 2.0, eCompany Now, Fast Company, The Industry Standard, Red Herring, Upside and Wired.
"There's a growing body of readers interested in the tech world and not the broader businesses," said David Bunnell, editor and publisher at Upside in San Francisco, part of Upside Media.
Upside, too, is introducing a campaign, by a boutique agency in New York named Dirty Water. The print and outdoor ads, with a budget of more than $1 million, carry the theme "Venture voyeurism." They are intended to show Upside's reporters and editors as being "on the inside," Mr. Bunnell said, "and not part of the hype."
Hyped up and psyched up is an apt way to describe the personalities of Forbes and Fortune as displayed in their campaigns, which strive to present each magazine as an important tool for corporate warfare, as necessary as the newest cellular phone or personal digital assistant. Forbes's is by Merkley Newman Harty in New York, part of the Omnicom Group, and Fortune's is by Mullen Advertising in Wenham, Mass., part of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
The Forbes campaign, with a budget of $3 million to $5 million, carries an assertive theme, "Never settle." Print ads and a television spot celebrate the relentless pursuit of excellence, to paraphrase the old Lexus slogan, whether inside a cubicle or an executive suite.
"There's a sense of a strong emotional connection with our readers," said James S. Berrien, president of Forbes, "the movers and shakers who won't settle for anything less than a life well lived."
For instance, one print ad begins "You think your proposal is good," but ends by dismissing "good" as "only a half a block from average" while "great is all the way uptown."
The commercial strikes a similar chord, mocking "good" as "great without" intestinal fortitude, although the ad uses a vulgarism that has come to stand for such fortitude, especially among men. The commercial, vulgarism and all, has been running since last week on CNBC.
"We're talking about what drives people," said Marty Orzio, partner and executive creative director at Merkley Newman, "and that's something every reader of Forbes can relate to."
The Fortune campaign, with a budget of $2 million for the fourth quarter, carries a similarly pugnacious theme, "Business rules." Each print and outdoor ad uses photographs that have run in Fortune to illustrate a fanciful rule derived from its coverage of the economy, companies and well-known business personalities.
"The magazine brings you inside the room," Mr. Haire said, "with some energy, irony and fun."
For example, a photo of Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, appears in one ad to demonstrate "Rule No. 7," which is "Pay attention to the man behind the curtain." Another ad, for "Rule No. 5," which is "Be your biggest fan," shows an ornate painting of Donald J. Trump. A third ad displays a photo of William H. Gates to explain "Rule No. 1," which is "Do unto others until they can do no more."
The purpose of the campaign "is to suggest in a telegraphic way that Fortune takes you close to the people who make the decisions," said Edward Boches, chief creative officer at Mullen.
"If in fact business is about the people who run and rule the game," he added, "why not associate ourselves with those people?"
In an added twist, the people pictured in the ads, who also include John F. Welch, chairman at General Electric, and Jeff Bezos, chief executive at Amazon.com, are not identified.
"The campaign assumes Fortune readers know who they are," Mr. Boches said. "And if you don't, you could, so shouldn't you?"
Sounds like a revised version of the old Buick slogan: "Shouldn't you really rather read a Fortune?"

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Poses Risks To Economy, Panel Finds

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14

 BODY:
A prominent Congressional commission appointed to study the giant American trade deficit determined that the imbalance has become unsustainably large and dangerous for the economy, but mostly disagreed on what to do about it.
The assessment by the 12-member commission, split equally among experts appointed by Democrats and Republicans, reflects growing concern that the gap between what America sells abroad and what it imports from other nations has grown too large, from about $30 billion in 1991 to an estimated $450 billion this year, posing a risk to the record-setting economic expansion and the strength of the dollar. 
 But the 350-page report, compiled after a year and a half of research and testimony, also shows the deep partisan divide over trade policy that is likely to prevail into the next administration.
Commission members clashed, for example, on whether future trade agreements should set standards on social issues like labor and the environment as a way of eliminating some disparities in the global marketplace. Republicans leaned strongly toward allowing the market to solve most trade issues, while Democrats tended to favor government-led solutions.
The report serves mostly to illustrate the contours of the party-line split. Chapters on the causes and consequences of the deficit and recommendations for future trade policy elucidate how the Republican and Democratic appointees could not agree on much.
Even a news conference to announce the report today became a forum for grandstanding.
Murray Weidenbaum, a Reagan administration adviser who was chairman of the commission, accused Democrats of trying to "muddy the waters" of trade by insisting that new agreements set baseline standards for labor and the environment. He argued that developing nations so dislike the idea of labor and environmental standards that mandating them "threatens the whole enterprise" of expanding trade.
George Becker, a commission member and president of the United Steel Workers of America, responded by saying that some six million jobs have been lost because of America's one-sided trade openness to the world and that the deficit reflects the "lack of worker rights to share in the wealth they helped create."
But the report was notable for a few broad areas of concurrence.
The commission endorsed the view that increased international trade generally benefits the United States and that trying to halt globalization is futile. It also pushed for a new global round of trade talks like the ones that collapsed in Seattle late last year, though the commission members split over what the aim of those talks should be.
Both Republican and Democratic members said that the Commerce Department and the United States trade representative should hire more staff devoted exclusively to making sure that foreign nations grant all the trading rights to United States companies that they promised, a step they said could help narrow the deficit.
The panel sharply criticized previous failures to enforce the terms of trade agreements the United States has reached in the past, faulting the Clinton administration in particular for its drive to expand trade access without ensuring full compliance.
C. Richard D'Amato, a Democratic trade expert, said the Clinton administration had signed 300 trade agreements but had declined to enforce them, meaning that the United States "throws $1 billion a day out the window" as foreign countries take advantage of the United States.
The commission also took a unanimous stand in favor of relaxing export controls on high-technology goods and limiting the use of unilateral economic sanctions to punish nations that disagree with the United States. "The cold war is over," the report says.
The panel also concurred that the data on trade collected by the Commerce Department is so limited in scope that it is difficult to pinpoint the real causes and solutions to the deficit, calling on Congress to provide more financing for the effort.

GERMANY: U.S. APOLOGIZES IN EXECUTION CASE
The United States admitted that it violated international law for a decade by failing to provide access to consular officials for two Germans executed in Arizona in 1999 for killing a bank manager. James Thessin, a State Department legal adviser, told the International Court of Justice that the United States had apologized to Germany for not letting Karl and Walter LaGrand see a German consular official from their arrest in 1982 through 1992. But he said the United States rejected Germany's claim for reparations. Roger Cohen (NYT)
 
BRITAIN: FUEL PROTEST SPUTTERS
Truckers renewed fuel-price protests that brought Britain to a virtual halt in September, but the police barred their convoy of 350 trucks from downtown London and they had to settle for a rally in Hyde Park denouncing high gasoline taxes. The protest attracted little of its earlier widespread support and no promise that fuel taxes, the highest in Europe, would be reduced. Warren Hoge (NYT) 

SLOVENIA: NEW GOVERNMENT IN WORKS
President Milan Kucan asked a former prime minister, Janez Drnovsek, 50, to form a new government after his center-left party won parliamentary elections last month, an official said. Mr. Drnovsek struck a deal last week with three other political parties to form a coalition government that could be in place as early as next week, the news agency S.T.A. reported. The new coalition controls 58 of the 90 seats in Parliament, giving it a comfortable cushion over three opposition parties. (Agence France-Presse)

Orthodox, Islamic, Jewish and Buddhist leaders meeting in Moscow denounced what they called growing intolerance and extremism. They said in a statement: "Believers have a right to make their lives conform with their beliefs. But no one has a right to use their beliefs to take the lives or violate the rights of others. No religion allows for that." Russia forbids proselytizing by new groups, like Roman Catholics and Protestants. (Agence France-Presse)

Britain reopened its embassy in Tripoli last December, 16 years after it had been closed. The United States is expected soon to lift its ban on American travel to Libya. James Brooke (NYT)
 
COLOMBIA: REBELS CUT OFF PEACE TALKS
The guerrilla army FARC broke off peace negotiations with government negotiators, charging that President Andres Pastrana's administration has done nothing to control right-wing death squads opposed to the rebel forces. Talks aimed at ending a grinding 36-year conflict have made little headway since the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and the government agreed to negotiate in January 1999. The two sides finally decided last month to resume negotiations, but commentators in Bogota said the rebels were miffed that a top Pastrana official recently met with a paramilitary leader, Carlos Castano, to secure the release of seven congressmen kidnapped by his gunmen.

EGYPT: ELECTION VIOLENCE KILLS 5
The police clashed with opposition supporters, leaving five people dead and 40 injured during the final round of parliamentary voting. Fighting erupted in El Amar, 20 miles north of Cairo, when an independent candidate's backers broke into polling stations after they were not allowed to enter to vote, residents and the police said. Four were killed there, and one person died in fighting at Shubra el Kheima, in northern Cairo. Twelve people have been killed in this year's election-related violence. (AP)

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Shares Rise Sharply as Bargain Hunters Take the Field

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
Stocks rebounded broadly yesterday, ending the Nasdaq composite index's brief stay below 3,000, but analysts were reluctant to predict a prolonged rally.
While there was optimism regarding the resolution of the presidential election, questions remained about the health of the economy, corporate profits and the meeting today of the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee. 
 "We are months away from any easing by the Fed, not weeks away as the market seems to feel," said Thomas McManus, equity strategist for Banc of America Securities. "Corporate earnings, trends in sales growth and margins continue to disappoint in most industries. I expect those trends to continue for the next few quarters."
Yesterday, however, was a timeout from the recent declines -- worsened over the last week by the unresolved presidential election -- that have battered the main market gauges.
"It's more like water torture than an October 1987 type of correction," said Timothy M. Ghriskey, portfolio manager of the $2.7 billion Dreyfus Fund. "It's a water torture correction."
The Nasdaq composite index, a benchmark for the technology sector, gained 171.55 points, or 5.8 percent, to 3,138.27. On Monday, the index closed below 3,000 for the first time since Nov. 2, 1999, culminating a nearly eight-month retreat from its highs above 5,000 in March. Investors and money managers took the opportunity to hunt for bargains yesterday.
"We have been cautiously adding to some of our positions," said William V. Fries, manager of the $1.5 billion Thornburg Value fund, referring to the technology sector. "We bought a little Intel, a little Qualcomm since the end of the quarter. It's a valuation question." Of yesterday's rally, he said that "people got tired of selling."
"It's a function of a little confidence coming back into valuations," he added.
Though all the main indexes posted gains yesterday, Mr. Fries noted that there still appeared to be a continuation of the market's division between technology and telecommunications stocks on the one hand and, on the other hand, cyclical stocks and less glamorous sectors that fell out of favor last year. Though the Dow Jones industrial average rose 163.81 points, or 1.6 percent, to 10,681.06, that was far less proportionately than the Nasdaq's gain. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 31.69 points, or 2.4 percent, to 1,382.95.
The day began on an optimistic note after it was reported that Abby Joseph Cohen, the strategist at Goldman, Sachs who is known for her bullish outlook, wrote in a note to clients that "equity valuations are the most attractive they have been all year."
"Economic and profit growth are slowing to more moderate and sustainable rates," Ms. Cohen added. "Core inflation remains mild-mannered and the likelihood of Federal Reserve action to boost interest rates has lessened notably."
Mr. McManus had a different view.
"I would agree, except that the environment is worse than it has been in a year," he said, referring to Ms. Cohen's comments on valuations. "A year ago, the market outlook over the next 6 to 12 months was much better."
The technology sector's surge was helped by a 14.7 percent gain by Oracle, which announced that it had formed an alliance with Citigroup. Oracle's shares rose $3.63, to $28.38. Other big gainers included JDS Uniphase, which rose $7.63, to $75.63; Cisco, which climbed $2.75, to $53.13; and Intel, which was up $2.75, to $40.94.
Some slumping stocks were even granted a brief reprieve. WebMD, the online medical services company, gained 8.3 percent even thought it reported a wider-than-expected third-quarter loss after the market closed on Monday.
Some of the strongest moves came in the retail sector amid a spate of earnings reports that were, if not unfailingly positive, then not that bad either. And mixed news was good news for retail, Mr. Ghriskey said.
"I've never seen relative valuations in a sector as low," he said. "They are at such depressed levels, as long as things aren't deteriorating anymore, it's good news."
Home Depot and Wal-Mart, which gained 4.84 percent and 3.03 percent respectively after releasing earnings reports, had some of the biggest percentage gains on the Dow.
Still, most market watchers were looking toward today, trying to predict what the Federal Open Market Committee will do on interest rates.
"My sense is that they do little," Mr. McManus said. "Maybe there's a shade of relief, but I don't think they even change their bias."
Mr. Ghriskey of Dreyfus expected "a calming statement on the markets, an official neutral outlook on rates and a benign outlook on inflation."

Treasury Prices Rise
By Bloomberg News
 Bond prices rebounded yesterday on expectations the stock market will not extend its rally and that the presidential election may be nearing a resolution.
"The Treasury market is rationally saying it's not going to make too much of the stock rally because stocks are still down so much" even with yesterday's bounce, said Tony Crescenzi, chief bond strategist at Miller Tabak & Company.
The price of the 10-year Treasury note rose 4/32, to 100 1/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.74 percent from 5.75 percent on Monday. The 30-year bond rose 10/32, to 1065/32 . Its yield fell to 5.81 percent from 5.83 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of a 33-day cash-management bill:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
Price: 99.416
Investment rate: 6.50%
High rate: 6.37%
Low rate: 6.33%
Median rate: 6.36%
Total applied for: $36,160,225

HEADLINE: Poll Shows Palestinians No Longer Back U.S.-Led Talks

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG

DATELINE: RAMALLAH, West Bank, Nov. 14

 BODY:
Only 3 percent of Palestinians surveyed by a leading university here support the continuation of peace talks under American sponsorship, reflecting a widespread belief that the three-way peace effort has reached a dead end.
A majority still supports peace as a concept, although they believe that their living conditions have either worsened or not changed for the better since the Oslo interim peace agreement was signed in 1993. But they think that the United Nations or some other international organization should take over as broker. 
 In another reflection of rising anti-Americanism, which is palpable at demonstrations here, three-quarters of the Palestinians surveyed support military attacks against the American presence in the Middle East.
The public opinion poll, by Bir Zeit University, was conducted last week among 1,234 Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. That is the standard sample size for a Palestinian poll, and its margin of error is 3 percent. Released on Monday night, the results reflect the frustrations, anger and nationalism aroused by the current violent conflict.
"This is one of the most difficult periods that Palestinian society has ever lived through," said Dr. Nader Said, the research director, "and we were clearly tapping into some very strong emotions. There are four, five funerals a day. Israelis are bombarding Palestinian cities for the first time in decades.
"The West Bank is cut off from Gaza, both places from Jerusalem and all major Palestinian towns from each other. Unemployment is skyrocketing, and the economic situation is miserable."
Against that backdrop, three-quarters of Palestinians surveyed said they supported the current uprising against Israel. A solid majority supports the uprising with the belief that it is a war of independence, the poll says. But most object to children taking part in confrontations at the barricades.
Some 80 percent of those surveyed support military attacks, including suicide bombings, against the Israelis, compared with 44 percent in mid-1998. But most of them object to terror attacks inside Israel, which Dr. Said said he found surprisingly sober-minded, given the intensity of negative emotions. Those emotions have fed anti-Israeli feelings and positions that have been hardening after an initial softening that followed the Oslo agreement.
At the end of 1996 a poll showed that half of the Palestinian population was willing to accept Israeli sovereignty over West Jerusalem if East Jerusalem became Palestinian under a peace deal. Last week that proportion shrank to one-fifth, and 92 percent said peace was impossible if East Jerusalem did not become the Palestinian capital.
In interviews, Palestinian legislators who once accepted the terms of the Oslo accord -- considering only the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem to be the territory under negotiation with the Israelis -- now talk angrily about retaking cities in Israel like Jaffa and Haifa.
The university's research team found significant differences between university-educated Palestinians and a majority who did not continue school beyond ninth grade. Educated Palestinians tend to be far more critical of the Palestinian Authority, for instance, and far less supportive of a unilateral Palestinian declaration of statehood.
A majority of Palestinians surveyed think that new elections should be held for Palestinian National Authority president and for the legislature. The previous elections were held in 1996, and the terms were supposed to expire in May 1999 when the Oslo interim period ended.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Rose Slightly In October

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14

 BODY:
Retail sales rose in October as gains at department stores and building-supply outlets offset a decline at auto dealers, the government said today.
Sales increased 0.1 percent last month after a rise of 0.9 percent in September, the Commerce Department said. Excluding autos, sales rose 0.4 percent after a 0.7 percent gain in September. 
 Retailers like Wal-Mart Stores are still reporting increased sales, though the gains are lagging behind previous quarters as higher oil prices, falling stock prices and a series of interest-rate increases restrain spending.
"People are still out visiting the malls, it's just that they are spending a touch less money," said Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa. "Is this an indication of a major easing in consumption? Not really."
The Federal Reserve raised interest rates six times between June 1999 and May of this year to cool the economy. The rate increases are bearing fruit as consumer prices excluding food and energy have shown few signs accelerating.
The October rise in retail sales was led by an increase of 1.6 percent in building materials sales and a 0.4 percent gain at department stores.
Sales at auto dealers fell 1 percent in October after rising 1.6 percent a month earlier. The October decline was the biggest since a 1 percent decrease in April, the government's figures showed.
Vehicles sold last month at an annual rate of 16.9 million, the slowest pace in a year. That was down from a pace of 17.9 million in September and was the slowest since a 16.6 million rate in October 1999.
Sales at clothing and accessory stores rose 1 percent after rising 1.4 percent in September. October is a discount month for many stores as they make room for holiday goods.

HEADLINE: Growing Opposition To Free Drug Samples;
Ultimate Costs and Safety Are Cited

BYLINE: By MELODY PETERSEN

 BODY:
Worried about safety and rising drug costs, a small but growing number of hospitals, clinics and other health care organizations across the country are banning free samples of brand name prescription drugs, or limiting what samples their doctors can accept from drug companies.
Doctors have long used free drug samples to let patients try new treatments or to start patients on medications quickly while they are waiting for prescriptions to be filled. But now, doctors, administrators and pharmacists at hospitals in cities including Madison, Wis., and Everett, Wash., say they worry they cannot control the increasing amount of free medicines that are doled out by pharmaceutical representatives. 
 Health care administrators also assert that the samples are helping to inflate their drug costs because the drug companies tend to give out samples of the newest brand name drugs, which are often the most expensive. The companies rarely give away samples of lower-cost generic drugs. And if the sample medicine works for the patient, the administrators say, physicians will often prescribe the higher-cost drug, even though a generic drug may work just as well.
Even some hospitals that take care of many uninsured patients who could benefit from the free pills are limiting their use of the samples.
Dr. John B. Chessare, chief medical officer at one such hospital, Boston Medical Center, said that his hospital was strongly discouraging its doctors from accepting free drug samples. The drugs that sales representatives hand out, he said, are often those with the highest profit margins.
"They are not bringing us samples of things we need," Dr. Chessare said. "They are bringing us things they want us to know about."
Like consumer advertising, the handouts of sample-size medicines are a growing part of drug companies' marketing budgets. Last year, drug companies gave doctors free pills worth more than $7.2 billion at their retail price, almost 10 percent more than the year before, according to IMS Health, a company that tracks prescription drug information. By comparison, the companies spent $1.8 billion -- one-quarter as much -- on consumer advertisements. And the value of free samples continues to rise, up another 8.4 percent in the first half of 2000 compared with the comparable period a year earlier.
The actual cost of the free samples to the companies, however, is much less than their retail price because the expense of making the pills -- the raw materials and factory costs -- is often just 20 percent to 30 percent of their sales price, according to a review of the major drug companies' annual financial reports.
As the drug companies have increased their handouts of the samples to help increase their sales, the hospitals and clinics say the free medicines have become harder to control.
The doctors and pharmacists say that there is an increased risk that a doctor could give a patient a sample of pills that is later recalled by its manufacturer, and they would have no way of notifying that person. And, unlike prescriptions, where there are two people -- a doctor and pharmacist -- to serve as safety checks, samples pass directly from doctor to patient.
"This is a fallible system," said Lee C. Vermeulen, a pharmacist and the director of the Center for Drug Policy at the University of Wisconsin's hospital and clinics, which banned drug samples in April. "It has got to end. It is unsafe by design."
Many of the hospitals that are limiting the drug samples also say that they became concerned that they would be cited for not properly controlling the samples by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations. The commission does a survey of each hospital every three years and decides whether it meets the group's standards for accreditation.
Dr. Paul M. Schyve, a senior vice president at the commission, said that the group had increased its emphasis on medication safety in the last two years. As part of that, he said, the commission's surveyors have been making sure that hospitals properly control drug samples.
Mr. Vermeulen said that the University of Wisconsin banned samples at its hospital and clinics after being cited by the commission for lacking some controls over the sample-size medicines. And, Dr. Chessare said that he believed that many hospitals were responding to the commission's new focus on samples.
But many doctors have complained bitterly as the clinics' cabinets of drug samples have been emptied out. They say that they often depend on the samples to help patients who lack insurance coverage and cannot afford the expensive newdrugs. Some doctors say that they believe that their administrators are too focused on the bottom line.
"We're putting the interest of an H.M.O. ahead of that of patients," said Dr. Don Bukstein, a Wisconsin pediatric allergist and pulmonologist at Dean Health Systems, a doctor-owned group of clinics and managed care system in Madison.
Two months ago, Dean Health began barring drug sales representatives from visiting its 450 doctors and handing out free samples.
Before then, Dr. Bukstein often used sample-size medications to see if a drug would work for a patient before writing a prescription. He has also used samples of asthma drugs like inhaled steroids, he said, to help teach his patients how to use the drug inhalers.
"I've had a lot of patient complaints," Dr. Bukstein said. "The difficulty of not having samples in my area is a major problem."
And Dr. Finley W. Brown Jr., a doctor with his own family practice in Chicago, said that he could not understand why clinics and health care groups were deciding to ban both the free drug samples and sales representatives from their offices. Dr. Brown said that 10 to 20 drug salespeople, most of them handing out free samples, visited his office each week.
"It doesn't sound quite right that some clinics are not letting their doctors see the detail men," Dr. Brown said. "It is as if a doctor cannot be trusted to make a judgment."
For their part, the drug companies say that the free samples play an essential role in the health care system.
"They allow doctors to learn about the benefits of new drugs recently introduced to the market," said Dr. Bert A. Spilker, senior vice president for scientific and regulatory affairs at the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the industry's trade group, "and they allow patients to evaluate a drug's benefit before spending the money on a full prescription.
"At the same time, it is entirely up to doctors to determine whether it's appropriate to use drug samples," Dr. Spilker continued. "Doctors make decisions that are best for their individual patients' needs."
A spokesman for Pfizer said that companies did not often provide samples of generic drugs because physicians already understand how the older drugs work.
There have been no definitive studies of whether drug samples influence doctors to write prescriptions for those sample medicines. But at one large clinic in Washington State drug costs have declined since it banned samples, even as the costs rose for other medical centers in the area. The Everett Clinic in Everett banned drug samples and barred drug representatives from visiting its 185 doctors in 1998. Dr. Al Fisk, the clinic's medical director, said that the clinic had been worried about its rising drug costs and about trying to comply with the state laws governing the free samples.
Instead of relying on visits from sales representatives, Dr. Fisk said that the clinic's doctors now got their information on drugs from a clinical pharmacist who was hired to provide more balanced information about new drugs.
"I have been troubled by the fact that the major source of information that physicians use to educate themselves is from drug representatives," Dr. Fisk said. Often that information is "one sided," he said, and includes descriptions of the drugs' benefits, while omitting their drawbacks.
The Everett Clinic's drug costs declined 10 percent in 1999, Dr. Fisk said, after it banned the samples and took some other measures to control pharmaceutical expenses, including encouraging patients to split pills into smaller dosages. Drug costs at other health care organizations in Washington State rose about 15 percent last year, he said.
In Pittsburgh, Highmark Blue Cross and Blue Shield, a health insurer, said it was planning to begin giving doctors samples of generic drugs early next year so that they would have more samples to choose from than just the new brand name drugs. The insurer is working with Merck-Medco, a pharmacy benefit manager owned by Merck, to provide the generic drug samples.
Ann Smith, a spokeswoman for Merck-Medco, said that the company was working on programs that would make more generic drug samples available and increase the use of generic drugs. "It's a huge opportunity for us to drive down the cost of health care," she said.
Dr. Donald C. Logan, chief medical officer at Dean Health in Wisconsin, said that the group decided to bar sales representatives from visiting its doctors in July, after its drug costs soared by 25 percent last year.
"We were finding that the pharmaceutical reps were beginning to cause doctors to prescribe certain drugs," he said, "even though there were equally effective but less expensive medicines available."
Dr. Logan said that some sales representatives, knowing the importance of having samples easily accessible to doctors, were even reorganizing the clinics' cabinets of sample-size medicines so that the pills made by their respective companies were in a more prominent position.
While the sales representatives are no longer allowed to visit Dean's doctors, Dr. Logan said, the physicians can still use mail order to get most pill samples from the drug companies if they feel the medicines are beneficial.
Some doctors have tried to find ways around the bans on samples. At the University of Wisconsin, a month after the cupboards in its 90 clinics were emptied of samples, senior medical managers discovered that some doctors were still accepting the sample-size medicines from sales representatives, Mr. Vermeulen said.
The physicians wanted to keep supplying their needy patients with free samples of the expensive drugs, he said, and some doctors were found to be storing drug samples in their private offices, automobile trunks and homes.
To give the doctors and patients a replacement for the samples, he said, the university now provides doctors with vouchers that patients can use for a free prescription of a range of medicines, which are mostly generic drugs.
Mr. Vermeulen said that some doctors had become upset at meetings where he discussed the sample ban.
"If they would have had anything to throw at me," he said, "they would have."

HEADLINE: Global Trade Strengthens Economies, Greenspan Says

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan warned today that support for free trade and market-oriented policies could wither if the economy turned down.
Speaking one day before the Federal Open Market Committee meets to review interest rate policy, Mr. Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman, did not discuss the economic outlook in the United States or allude to the unresolved presidential election. And he gave no hint as to whether he thought growth had cooled sufficiently that the Fed might be able to sound the all-clear on inflation. 
 Most analysts expect the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee to hold its short-term interest rates steady at its meeting on Wednesday. But with the economy clearly having shifted into a lower gear in recent months, some investors have been betting that the Fed will go a step further and drop its policy stance that inflation is still a risk.
Mr. Greenspan's speech today, at a conference in Mexico City commemorating the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Bank of Mexico, amounted to a plea to his fellow economic policy makers around the world not to grow complacent at a time of prosperity.
The Fed chairman used the address to make a case that the benefits of globalization accrue to all nations that participate in it, "especially to some of the least fortunate within those trading societies."
Alluding to protests last year in Seattle against the World Trade Organization and this year in Washington and Prague against the International Monetary Fund, Mr. Greenspan acknowledged that the dislocation sometimes caused by global economic change is emerging as a powerful political force.
Any "notable shortfall in economic performance from the exemplary standard of recent years runs the risk of reviving mistrust of market-oriented systems, even among conventional policy makers," Mr. Greenspan said, returning to a theme he last addressed at a Fed conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo., in August.
"Thankfully, such views are not widespread, and most fall quickly to the force of reason," he said. "Still, the arguments against the global trading system that emerged first in Seattle and then spread over the past year arguably touched a chord in many people, in part by raising the fear that they would lose local political control of their destinies."
He stressed that the global economic system had been quite open once before, in the decades leading up to World War I, and that much of the last half-century has been occupied by recovering from the economic blow that nations inflicted on themselves by erecting trade barriers during the 1920's and 30's.
"To repeat that act would be a tragic act of foolishness and waste," he said.
Mr. Greenspan did not directly address the global financial crisis of several years ago, and he made no mention of the difficulties faced now by nations like Argentina that are struggling to meet the economic and financial standards demanded by international investors.
But he suggested that no nation had much of a choice but to pursue the policies needed to meet those standards, including using monetary policy to achieve price stability, and that the best argument against critics of globalization is to maintain strong economic performance.

HEADLINE: From a Captive Audience, Clients;
Law Firm Goes Mass Market With 1-800 Subway Ads

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS

 BODY:
Even before he joined his father's firm, Michael Wilens was planning its expansion into a new area of law. So, he explained, "I called my subway distributor."
Five years later, there isn't a subway-riding adult in New York who hasn't seen an ad for 1-800-DIVORCE, with the O formed by a diamond ring and a woman's hand to the side making a tossing motion. "When diamonds aren't forever," the poster says. There is also 1-800-INNOCENT ("when you're only allowed one phone call"), with two cuffed hands and a chain. 
 The Manhattan firm at the other end of the phones, Wilens & Baker, also has 1-800-IMMIGRATION and, as of last month, 1-800-BANKRUPT.
And it's been fun, Mr. Wilens said. But now, while the 1-800 posters will live on, he is trying something subtler, with dignified pastels and a simple logo designed to send a message to those who wonder: What kind of law firm rents subway space amid all those pitches to a public troubled by warts and hammertoes? What kind of client dials 1-800-DIVORCE?
The law firm is a business that practices economies of scale and computer technology. It has 17 lawyers; the kind who wear suspenders. Its offices at Seventh Avenue and 34th Street -- 13 subway lines within a block -- are all cool and spare, charcoal and beige, with nothing lavish. ("I didn't want my clients to pay for mahogany," Mr. Wilens said.)
The packaging and positioning of the firm were Mr. Wilens's work. Now 29, he started buying television ad time for the practice while he was still a student at Brooklyn Law School.
By his account, the firm is becoming the Citibank of legal services. "I don't want to be the cheapest lawyer in New York; I want to set the standard." That means volume -- basic legal services to a big base of clients -- and to Mr. Wilens, it also means advertising.
"You advertise and people have the idea of a mill," he said. "No. The concept is efficiency."
As he spoke, the earliest of the day's 200-plus clients were ushered into conference rooms. Just one, a woman dabbing at her eyes, sat in the waiting room. Five young women wearing identical black blazers (from the Gap) answered telephones at a reception bank.
"He has the correct and unusual approach to marketing by lawyers," said a not-unbiased Peter O'Hanlan, who as the owner of Legal Marketing Systems in Miami leases the rights to 1-800-DIVORCE. "Slowly, but slowly, the whole profession is coming to realize that doing things that set them aside from others in the profession is not unethical."
Mr. O'Hanlan licenses the divorce number in 95 markets around the country, mostly to small firms that pay a flat fee plus the cost of the long-distance calls, at $9 to $22 an hour. The calls are routed geographically to the individual law firms. Neither Mr. O'Hanlan nor Mr. Wilens would disclose the monthly fee paid by Wilens & Baker, which is the largest 1-800-DIVORCE licensee, but Mr. O'Hanlan said the typical fee was $75 to $100 a month.
Wilens & Baker also leases the rights to 1-800-BANKRUPT, but it owns 1-800-IMMIGRATION and 1-800-INNOCENT. (The calls go through when the first seven digits after the 1-800 are dialed.) The rights to the numbers the firm owns are possible sources of income down the line, Mr. Wilens noted.
Advertising by lawyers is hardly notable, but, at least in New York, it is the domain of personal injury lawyers. "There are a thousand lawyers advertising now, and 980 are personal injury lawyers," Mr. Wilens said.
Then, too, he said, his ads are emphatically not "the attorney in front of the bookshelf saying, "We'll explain your rights to you.' "
"The attorneys are so narcissistic they have to sit there themselves, in their suits. So let them do that. It's great for me."
His father, Lawrence M. Wilens, in practice 27 years, had to be talked into this new business model for his small immigration-law firm. So did his partner, Howard L. Baker.
"I was scared to death," Mr. Baker said, "thinking that our corporate clients would see our name in print and think less of us. El Diario or Haitian newspapers, O.K. But we were really afraid to advertise in English-speaking media.
"But then one human resources person for a large corporation we did work for said, 'Oh, I think it's so neat that our lawyers are on the train.' All my friends' kids who live in Manhattan love it," Mr. Baker said. "They think the one with the hand throwing the diamond ring is brilliant."
That poster, along with the 1-800-INNOCENT ad, has made Wilens & Baker somewhat famous.
The firm has granted permission for several film studios to use its posters. And a site planner from "Law and Order" scouted the offices as a film location, Mr. Wilens said, but the lawyers did not want crews tripping over bewildered immigration clients in the hallways.
Despite their success, the 1-800-DIVORCE posters are to be replaced in the new, more dignified campaign. The new posters are in a muted rose, the hand gone and the diamond ring looking like a grace note.
It is "more about corporate branding," Mr. Wilens said. "Will I lose business for not being so flamboyant on the subway? The answer is yes. But I want to be more respectful to my clients."
Mr. Wilens said the original ad with the diamond ring was created by a company in Florida. Now much of the work is done in-house, and some is his own, though he has a production house and free-lance designers and artists.
The marketing and design work is expensive, of course, coming on top of the cost of placing the ads on the subway. For $28,000 a month, the firm gets 1,240 posters, or about one in eight cars.
Mr. Wilens said he "absolutely" did look for the ads on his subway rides home and, to make sure they are placed on the right cars (any ending in a three or a five), also enlists friends to keep track of them. "I'm such a pain," he said. "I'm probably the only person in the United States who does that."
The lawyers say they do not know how many of their clients are responding to the subway ads, or to the firm's ads on radio and television, which focus on Spanish-language media.
Lawrence Wilens describes the clients as "the same blend as all of New York City," what you would find "walking into Macy's at 4 in the afternoon."
"My father says Macy's," Michael Wilens said, "and I say Citibank. You see people at Citibank using the A.T.M. who have $100 in their checking accounts and people who have $1 million in the bank upstairs. They don't have a problem standing on the same line."
Mr. Wilens said the clientele included some of the same immigrants who first came to the firm seeking green cards or citizenship papers and then moved on to divorces or bankruptcies. He said there are also bankers and stockbrokers -- "They're big on divorce" -- and more than once, among the 1-800-INNOCENT callers, doctors who had been arrested for soliciting prostitutes.
"They say, 'I was arrested. I saw your ad in the subway. Can you do a bail hearing?' "
In fact, Wilens & Baker can. The fee is $1,500 for two court appearances on a misdemeanor charge and $500 for each thereafter. An uncontested divorce is $500, plus court fees of $278. A bankruptcy is $800 plus $200 in filing fees.
The comparatively low fees are possible, Mr. Wilens said, because the lawyers in the firm's four departments see the same scenarios over and over and become specialists fast.
"That's very important when you do volume," he said, adding: "I have my number out there on the subway. If someone comes in and I don't have an answer, I'd be mortified."
Then there is the firm's hallmark, he said, holding an electronic scanner: each client's file has a bar code.

HEADLINE: Staples Reports Drop in Earnings

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

DATELINE: FRAMINGHAM, Mass., Nov. 14

 BODY:
Staples Inc. said today that its fiscal third-quarter profit fell 8.5 percent and fourth-quarter earnings would be lower than expected, as it cuts prices to compete with rivals and consumer spending slows.
Net income fell to $84.7 million, or 19 cents a share, from $92.5 million, or 20 cents, a year earlier, the company said. Analysts had been expecting 21 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 
 Fourth-quarter profit will match or exceed last year's 26 cents a share, the company said, but will fall short of analysts' 31-cent forecast. Staples and rival office supply chains like Office Depot Inc. and OfficeMax Inc. have been hurt by slowing computer sales and rising competition from discount stores.
Thomas Stemberg, chairman and chief executive, also said on a conference call that Staples expanded too quickly. Costs rose as Staples moved into new markets and opened a distribution center in Terre Haute, Ind., that is not yet operating at capacity.
"We frankly screwed up," Mr. Stemberg said.
The company also said that as it has added more technology items like cellular telephones to its product mix, its losses from shoplifting rose. And price cuts by Office Depot and OfficeMax also hurt.

HEADLINE: With U.S. Missile Defense, Russia Wants Less Offense

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 14

 BODY:
Unwilling to wait for a declared winner in the American presidential race, the Kremlin has mounted a diplomatic offensive to advertise its desire to make deep cuts in the nuclear arsenals of Russia and the United States as soon as possible after a new president takes office.
With a statement directed at Washington by President Vladimir V. Putin on Monday, followed by presentations today by a senior military commander and a top foreign ministry official, the Russian leadership chose this week of electoral chaos in the United States to make its case. 
 No matter who wins the election, the Russians said, Moscow is eager to move swiftly to eliminate the cost of maintaining large strategic nuclear forces a decade after the end of the cold war.
"What counts most now is that Russia and the United States start moving jointly or along parallel courses toward radically lowered ceilings on nuclear warheads without any holdups," Mr. Putin said before leaving for Mongolia and then Brunei for a summit meeting of Asian and Pacific leaders.
While in Brunei, Mr. Putin and President Clinton will meet for the last scheduled time before Mr. Clinton leaves office.
Russian officials hinted that Moscow might be ready to negotiate amendments to a treaty banning missile defenses, something Washington wants, if cuts in offensive weapons are deep enough.
The commander of Russia's strategic rocket forces, Gen. Vladimir N. Yakolev, warned Monday that Russia would find it "very difficult" to stop the political momentum in the United States for building a national missile shield to defend against attacks by rogue states and accidental launchings. Therefore, he said, Russia should make a new deal with Washington: trading any American buildup in missile defenses for deeper cuts -- perhaps deeper than Russia's cuts -- in offensive weapons.
The reason for the pressing Russian initiative, say analysts here and in the United States, has more to do with Moscow's domestic economic and security concerns than with American politics.
Saddled with an unfinished military campaign in Chechnya and a general deterioration of Russian conventional forces that may have contributed to the disaster that sank the nuclear submarine Kursk in August, Mr. Putin is pressing his military commanders to slash the still bloated Russian armed forces by a third or more. His goal is to build a smaller and more capable fighting force to defend Russia against threats of Islamic extremism in Central Asia and ethnic tensions loosed by the collapse of the Soviet Union.
To finance the modernization of Russia's conventional armed forces, Mr. Putin would like to avoid the large expenditures necessary to maintain several thousand strategic nuclear weapons and their delivery systems.
"Certainly we would like to save money on weapons that are never supposed to be used," said Aleksei G. Arbatov, a member of the defense committee of the Russian Parliament.
"Nuclear weapons are virtual weapons, designed and deployed never to be used," he said in an interview, "and this is the best area to seek economy while using our available resources for peacekeeping, or for countering ethnic or religious extremists and the destabilization which follows them."
In his statement on Monday, Mr. Putin said Russia was prepared "to consider even lower levels" than the 1,500 warheads presented by its negotiators in Geneva earlier this year at the outset of negotiations for a Start III agreement. Some officials said Mr. Putin would like to cut strategic arsenals to 1,000 weapons each.
Such a cut would require the incoming American president to issue a new directive to the Joint Chiefs of Staff to further reduce the list of targets in the highly classified plans for defending the United States in a nuclear conflict. Those war plans set a floor of 2,500 nuclear weapons necessary to cover all targets in current war plans.
Both presidential contenders have given Russia some hope that a compromise can be reached.
In May, Gov. George W. Bush declared that Russia "is no longer our enemy" and said that if elected he would order the Pentagon to conduct a new assessment "of our nuclear force posture" with a goal of significant further reductions, while also moving forward with a national missile shield even if Russia refused to amend the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972, which prohibits the deployment of nationwide missile defenses.
If elected, Vice President Al Gore has said he would seek to negotiate with Russia on amendments to the antimissile treaty to allow deployment of missile defenses, while also seeking further reductions in offensive weapons.
Ivo H. Daalder, an arms control expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said Mr. Bush's declaration demonstrated to the Russians that both candidates held out the promise of supporting much deeper cuts in the nuclear arsenals. Mr. Bush would support deep cuts while ignoring Russian concerns about missile defenses, thus freeing the Russians to take other steps to counter American defenses. But the net result would be fewer offensive weapons.
"The fact that the Republicans were the ones to break through the wall when it comes to going lower than 2,500 weapons provides the underpinnings" for a bipartisan American consensus to reduce offensive weapons, Mr. Daalder said.
Russia and the United States signed the Start II agreement in 1993, calling for cutting the superpower nuclear arensals in half -- to 3,000 to 3,500 weapons each -- and eliminating Russia's force of large multiple-warhead missiles.
But the struggle to win full approval for the treaty has carried over to this year. The Senate approved the treaty in 1996, but the Russian Parliament, dominated by Communist members, objected to its terms until April. It was approved after the election of a non-Communist majority.

HEADLINE: America Today, Through Vietnamese Eyes

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam, Nov. 14

 BODY:
Naturally, said Ngo Van Ha, the words "America" and "war" pop into the mind together. But that belongs to the history books. For him, as for many other Vietnamese, "talking about America means talking about freedom."
"What I mean," said Mr. Ha, 38, who sells cosmetics in a tiny shop here, "is that the way of life is more free. Relationships are not as limited. And of course in terms of politics, you have a multiparty system." 
 When President Clinton arrives here on Thursday -- the first American president to visit since the end of the war 25 years ago -- he will find a country that is fascinated by America: its freedom, its energy, its work ethic, its robust economy.
There are doubts -- about its freewheeling society and about its overpowering role in the world -- and there are still raw wartime memories.
But for a people who have been shut out of the world both by the postwar American economic embargo, which ended six years ago, and by their own suspicious government, the United States seems to shimmer like a vision of their own potential success.
Sometimes they can't contain their enthusiasm. "America is the best country in the world in many ways," said Pham Hien, 44, who owns a camera shop in Hanoi.
For Nguyen Thi Hanh Nga, 17, a high-school student in Ho Chi Minh City, "America is a very modern country, and we want to be modern too."
For Tra Van Luong, 47, who sells snakes for traditional medical potions, "America is rich! It's rich!"
In a score of interviews with ordinary people around the country, few mentioned the long-ago war unless they were asked. But there were criticisms -- fed by past experience, perhaps, but focused on the present -- about what some saw as its domineering foreign policy.
"America behaves as if it's the head of the family," said Le Mai Huong, 23, a recent law school graduate. "It won't listen to anybody and just does what it wants. It wants to impose its subjective ideas on the rest of the world. They keep talking about human rights but I wonder -- what America did in the war, was that an example of human rights?"
And there were questions over whether America's broad freedoms amount to license. Like their government at this time of social and economic transition, many people voiced caution over how and how much to embrace what they saw as America's no-holds-barred way of life.
"Maybe things are too free, culturally," said Pham Nhu Hung, 27, who works for a freight forwarding company. "As Asians we shouldn't copy too much of the American way of life, like relations between men and women and between children and their parents. Everything is so loose. I don't get the feeling that personal relationships are as deep and as sentimental as in Vietnam."
Or as Quang Bao, 34, an artist, put it: "You can find everything in America -- the most noble actions and the most inhumane. Americans are capable of anything. They can walk in the street naked if they want! That's really too much."
Or as Miss Huong, the law graduate, said: "I admire the way America protects the rights of its citizens; that is hard to find in many countries. But according to the Vietnamese press I've read, there is a lot of violence, too, and I wonder if American people walk around in fear for their safety."
There is a good deal more personal freedom in Vietnam -- even freedom of speech if not freedom of the press -- than its closed political system might suggest. In a Communist country with a controlled press, few of the people interviewed bothered to recite the party line.
And in a sign of increasing confidence, several people even raised the most sensitive of subjects in this one-party state, praising America's multiparty democracy.
"Here, there is just one party with one idea and there is no competition possible," said Nguyen Van Thanh, 70, a photographer and gallery owner. "Everyone is obliged to listen and to follow the decisions of the party."
Few people sounded much like the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Phan Thuy Thanh, for example, who said last month: "The sufferings and losses incurred by the Vietnamese people due to the United States war of aggression are very heavy and significant. Resolving the damages left by the war is a burning humanitarian issue."
But Dao Minh Hong, 40, a history professor at Vietnam National University in Ho Chi Minh City, did offer an insight into official attitudes toward the United States.
She said that she taught American history, beginning with the "capitalist revolution" of 1776, and that "I think in some ways I like America," particularly its blending of immigrant cultures.
It was after the two world wars that America began to throw its weight around, "acting so very 'smart' and overbearing," Ms. Hong said.
"Of course, when I teach my students, I also praise America for the way it organizes its society," she said. "It's very advanced. But that shouldn't give it the idea that it has the right to impose its will on everybody else."
As for President Clinton: "I like Bill Clinton a lot. I think of how young he looked when he became president and how all his hair has turned gray now. I have to say that women really like Bill Clinton."
On the other hand, she said, it was hard to watch him as his White House scandal unfolded.
"We sympathize with his wife and share her feelings in the awful position she was in," she said. "I think that if I were in her position I would have behaved the same way she did."
Admiration for Mr. Clinton is something the Vietnamese government and its people seem to share unanimously. It was he who lifted the postwar economic embargo in 1994 and opened full diplomatic relations the following year.
"I consider Clinton to be the American who has done the most to heal Vietnamese-American relations," said Nguyen Van Tu, 70, a retired accountant. What is known here as the "American war" has left a legacy of north-south divisions that have not yet fully healed. Attitudes toward the United States are sometimes sharply at odds between America's former allies in the south and people in the victorious Communist north.
"Deep in my heart, I still love America," said Le Trung Kim, 55, a southerner, speaking in perfect English. "I was there, you know. I had the good luck to have military training in San Antonio, Tex. And I have relatives who escaped there -- my cousin, my brother, my half-sister. They're living in California, from Sacramento right down to San Diego."

HEADLINE: Judge Leaves Open Amount Of Damages On Auctions

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL and CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
A federal judge in Manhattan ruled yesterday that a proposed $512 million settlement of an antitrust lawsuit against the Sotheby's and Christie's auction houses could be submitted for consideration to more than 100,000 auction buyers and sellers who have asserted that the companies colluded to keep their fees high. Either side could urge the judge to accept or reject the settlement at a hearing on its final approval, which the judge set for Jan. 8 .
The judge, Lewis A. Kaplan of Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York, wrote in another order, however, that he was considering whether the auction houses and the former chairman of Sotheby's had the ability to pay even more than the $512 million, after their guilty pleas last month in a related federal criminal case. 
 He gave all sides until Monday to object to his plan to appoint an expert witness to report on the economic ability of the two auction giants and the former Sotheby's chairman, A. Alfred Taubman, to pay up to three times the amounts lost by customers as a result of "the admitted and alleged conspiracies." He offered the defendants and the lead counsel for the clients, Boies, Schiller & Flexner, the opportunity also to nominate experts to study the question.
Judge Kaplan did not give figures. But one marketing specialist cited in recent court papers filed by the Boies firm put the amount of the overcharges by the auction houses at $286 million. Treble damages would equal $858 million, or $346 million above the proposed settlement. The judge cannot impose a settlement but can only accept or reject any agreement reached by the parties. If there is no settlement, the case could still go to trial.
The expert, Jeffrey Leitzinger, estimated that Sotheby's overcharged buyers and sellers nearly $162 million, and Christie's nearly $125 million from 1993 through 1999. The $512 million settlement figure is 1.79 times the overcharges.
Lawyers for Christie's and Sotheby's and for Mr. Taubman did not return calls seeking a response.
Judge Kaplan also said he would ask the Justice Department's antitrust division, which has been conducting a three-year criminal investigation into the fixing of client fees and other anticompetitive auction practices, for its views on a feature of the proposed settlement: that $100 million of the $512 million settlement be paid not in cash but in coupons redeemable toward commissions charged to sellers doing new business with Sotheby's or Christie's.
"In view of the highly concentrated nature of this industry, the court has substantial questions whether approval of this term of the proposed settlement is in the public interest," Judge Kaplan said in his orders, which were dated Monday but filed yesterday. He asked the antitrust division to submit its reaction by Dec. 15.
Judge Kaplan did not say what about the coupon arrangement might reduce competition or why he wanted the views of the antitrust authorities.
He also did not explain why he wanted an expert's report on the ability of the defendants to pay up to triple damages, but he may be seeking the information to help him make up his mind on whether to accept the proposed settlement.
In addition to the civil settlement, Sotheby's agreed on Oct. 5 to plead guilty to a federal criminal charge of conspiring to fix prices from 1993 to 1999 and pay a $45 million fine. But Judge Kaplan declined to accept the plea, pending submission of further information on the company's ability to pay.
Also on Oct. 5, the former president and chief executive of Sotheby's, Diana D. Brooks, pleaded guilty to price-fixing charges and agreed to cooperate with the investigation. She will be sentenced later.
Mr. Taubman remains a target of the investigation, government papers have said. He has denied any wrongdoing. He has agreed to pay $156 million of Sotheby's $256 million share of the total $512 million settlement, plus another $30 million to settle a stockholder's suit.
Christie's, which came forward first last January with evidence of collusion, is not facing criminal charges as long as it cooperates with the investigation.
Judge Kaplan ordered that auction house customers who do not wish to be part of the class of plaintiffs exclude themselves from the case in writing by Dec. 15.

Stocks Rebound Strongly, But Analysts Are Cautious
Stocks rebounded broadly, ending the Nasdaq composite index's brief stay below 3,000, but analysts were reluctant to predict a prolonged rally. While there was optimism regarding the resolution of the presidential election, questions remained about the economy's health and the meeting today of the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee. 
 The Nasdaq composite index, a benchmark for the technology sector, gained 171.55 points, or 5.8 percent, to 3,138.27. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 163.81 points, or 1.6 percent, to 10,681.06, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 31.69 points, or 2.4 percent, to 1,382.95. Page C18.

Polls Only Confuse Education Policy

BYLINE: By Richard Rothstein; E-mail: rrothstein@nytimes.com

 BODY:
WHEN the cold war raged and crime, inflation and unemployment seemed intractable, education barely registered in politics. But now, no public discussion seems complete without reference to schools.
Education can certainly benefit from closer scrutiny. But with the attention has come the politics, including specious public opinion polls, used shamelessly to build support for one proposal or another. 
 Citizens cannot be expected to balance complex educational alternatives in response to multiple-choice questions posed by pollsters. Sometimes, polls find majorities favoring contradictory positions, so advocates can claim popular legitimacy for either stance.
At other times, respondents lacking policy background may hesitate to choose unconventional answers. In this way, opinion can be molded by leaders with access to the media. "Public opinion" can be self-fulfilling if the same leaders then justify their plans by citing polls.
Consider how public opinion shifted early in the current school-reform wave. In 1973, 61 percent of Americans said schools were better than when they were children. By 1979, only 41 percent said so. Nothing in those six years diminished schools' true relative quality. Only poll results changed. Policy makers still had to determine whether, in fact, schools had declined.
Gallup polls now consistently find dissatisfaction with the nation's schools. But just as consistently, respondents report satisfaction with their own children's schools. This is not unlike other issues where people believe that their widely shared experiences are not typical. One example is that citizens hold Congress in low repute, but think highly of their own representatives.
Two months ago, the Business Roundtable, an association of corporate officers, said its polling showed the "strength of support" for ending social promotion. "Fully three-quarters supports requiring children to pass a reading and math test for promotion," the association announced.
But its poll also found that most people thought grades and teacher evaluations were better guides to promotion than standardized tests. Large majorities were more broadly skeptical of standardized tests: 80 percent said some students who know the material still test poorly; 71 percent said tests can't measure many crucial skills; and 65 percent said tests lead to dropping other important curriculums.
The Roundtable could just as well have said "nearly all Americans reject tests as the main basis for promotion." This interpretation, however, would have been as one-sided as the association's actual view.
More troubling are the reports of Public Agenda, a group whose board includes statesmen, executives and university presidents. The group polls on many issues and says it has no agenda of its own.
Last year, Public Agenda reported that few people understood charter schools, but that when charters were described, 68 percent approved. Pollsters explained to interviewees that charters are public schools with "more control over their own budget, staff and curriculum, and are free from many existing regulations."
But this succinct description had to omit nuances that policy makers can't avoid: while some charters excel, the phenomenon also includes corporate chains with cookie-cutter schools plans, private schools that convert to charters and get public money, church-sponsored schools and subsidies for home-schoolers. Knowing 68 percent would approve of charters, without these details, is more misleading than helpful.
An article by Michael Lewis in The New York Times Magazine on Nov. 5 described how opinions can now be collected from people clicking buttons at home. This, Mr. Lewis said, can make politicians less "elitist," and more democratic and responsive. But if popular opinion is not based on informed deliberation, the use of it by elites does not truly enhance democracy.
When President Truman's approval ratings dropped during the Korean War, he mused, "I wonder how far Moses would have gone if he'd taken a poll in Egypt?" The 18th-century British statesman Edmund Burke influenced the founding fathers by arguing that representatives should be chosen based on the values, judgment and experience that make them trustworthy to decide policy and ignore popular fashion.
A democracy does not elect leaders, from president to school board members, to be mouthpieces for the cliches of public opinion. Regular in-depth conversations with citizens are a better way to gauge sentiment than polls based on quick reactions to yes-or-no questions.
If we paid less heed to polling, we'd have more, not less, democratic decision making about education -- and, indeed, in all public policy.

HEADLINE: Clinton Asks $750 Million in New Assistance for Middle East

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14

 BODY:
President Clinton asked Congress today for an additional $750 million in emergency aid for Israel, Egypt and Jordan, a request that immediately drew a skeptical reaction from some influential Republican lawmakers.
The heart of the administration's request is $450 million to help Israel pay for the withdrawal of its troops from southern Lebanon and for countering long-range security threats from Iran and Iraq. Of that total, $250 million would go for the troop withdrawal and $200 million for military assistance, including the Arrow II antiballistic missile system. Prime Minister Ehud Barak has been pressing Mr. Clinton to help defray the costs of the troop pullout, and administration officials said he renewed his plea when he met with the president here on Sunday. 
 With Mr. Clinton on a weeklong trip to Asia and Congress preparing to adjourn until Dec. 5, administration officials said it was important to send the request to Capitol Hill today, to allow lawmakers time to mull it over before they return.
With the Middle East peace effort that Mr. Clinton has worked to broker now in shambles, administration officials have sought ways to mitigate the long-term fallout. "These requests will advance United States interests in the Middle East," Mr. Clinton said in a letter to congressional leaders.
A senior Senate Republican aide said that senators, including Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, had not seen details of the request. Administration officials are to visit Capitol Hill on Thursday to brief senior aides. But the package faced a barrage of questions from influential Republicans, particularly the aid to Egypt.
Representative Sonny Callahan of Alabama, who heads the House Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations, which oversees foreign aid, voiced skeptism over the thrust and timing of Mr. Clinton's request. "I applaud the President's untiring efforts to help bring about a lasting peace to this important region of the world," Mr. Callahan said in a statement. "That said, I remain very skeptical, especially in the waning days of the Clinton presidency, that a true, lasting peace agreement can be secured simply by promising even more money than has been promised before."
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Mr. Callahan's counterpart on the Senate Appropriations Committee, has long voiced caution over providing additional military aid to Egypt. "The question for Senator McConnell has been, What's the threat?" said one Republican aide.
In addition to the assistance for Israel, the administration requested $225 million in military aid for Egypt for port and coastal security, which could strengthen Cairo's counterterrorism efforts. Officials acknowledged that the aid also amounted to rewarding the government of President Hosni Mubarak for its role in promoting the peace effort.
Mr. Clinton also asked for $75 million for Jordan: $25 million to improve security along its borders with Iraq and Syria and $50 million to help the Mideast ally's beleaguered economy.
Congressional aides said it was politically unthinkable at a time of such roiling in the Middle East for the administration to request additional aid for Israel without also seeking extra assistance for Arab countries. Israel now receives $2.8 billion in annual aid and Egypt $2 billion, making them the two largest recipients of American assistance.
American aid to the Palestinian Authority is contained in separate legislation.

HEADLINE: Forest Legacy, Within Reach

 BODY:
President Clinton has already produced a stellar record of environmental achievement, but for sheer scope nothing quite matches the proposal he announced one year ago to ban road-building in millions of acres of national forests. On Monday the Forest Service released its final version of that plan, which Mr. Clinton is expected to approve in 30 days. It is a considerable improvement on the original. But it needs two important adjustments, which Mr. Clinton has the power to make.
Under the plan, nearly 30 percent of the national forests, 58.5 million acres altogether, would be placed off limits to new road-building and most commercial logging -- including 9.3 million acres of Alaska's Tongass National Forest. The original plan encompassed only 43 million acres, and did not explicitly ban logging and other activities like mining. This one does. In addition, the earlier version did not provide any protection for the Tongass, which is of great significance to biologists, in part because it is the closest approximation the country has to the old-growth forests that once blanketed the Pacific Northwest. 
 The revised plan, like the original, is in part a tribute to Mike Dombeck, the Forest Service chief, who has spent the last few years trying to acclimate Congress and indeed his own agency to the idea that the nation's forests are more than tree farms. But his work will be incomplete unless Mr. Clinton fixes two flaws. The first is an innocent-sounding but potentially disastrous provision allowing for so-called "stewardship" logging for fire prevention and other purposes. Past Congresses have used loopholes like this to justify widespread clear-cutting. The provision thus needs careful definition.
A far bigger flaw is that the Tongass protections would be delayed until 2004. This is largely a bow to Alaska's Congressional delegation, which argues that the economy of southeast Alaska needs time to adjust to lower levels of logging. But the plan would not eliminate commercial forestry in the Tongass, which already has 4,600 miles of permanent roads, giving logging companies ready access to plenty of usable timber without further decimating the old-growth. Meanwhile, the delay would leave plenty of time for unnecessary road-building, pleasing the Alaska delegation but severely compromising the biological integrity of the forest.
Mr. Clinton has nothing to lose by giving the Tongass the same protections that he intends to give every other national forest. But the forest has much to lose if he does not. George W. Bush, who could very well be the next president, is on record as saying that he regards Mr. Clinton's overall scheme to protect the national forests as an excessive use of federal power.

HEADLINE: State Seeks Plans for Neglected Brooklyn Area

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED

 BODY:
After a quarter of a century in which community opposition, lack of government financing and other obstacles thwarted the development of three prime patches at the edge of downtown Brooklyn, New York State moved yesterday to spur housing and retail projects on the sites.
State officials invited proposals from developers to buy and build on one of the sites, which now contain parking lots. Under bidding guidelines, projects must conform to criteria that community groups have called for to preserve the scale and character of the adjacent, brownstone-rich Boerum Hill neighborhood. 
 Boerum Hill is one of the districts forming a so-called brownstone belt around much of downtown Brooklyn's bustling commercial core. Some of the opponents of past proposals for the sites, originally part of an urban renewal project, contended that the previous planned developments would encroach on Boerum Hill's largely low-rise residential character.
The Empire State Development Corporation, which with a predecessor agency has owned the sites since 1974, issued a request for proposals yesterday from developers interested in building housing and stores on the smallest of the three sites, while adhering to restrictions that include a maximum building height of 140 feet, about 14 stories.
The site, 18,000 square feet fronting on Smith Street from Atlantic Avenue to State Street, is much smaller than the two other sites, for which the state agency's officials said they would probably seek purchase and development proposals next spring.
The officials said guidelines on building height and other characteristics were still being developed for those two sites, which total 160,000 square feet. One almost entirely fills the block bounded by Smith, Schermerhorn, Hoyt and State Streets. The other fills most of the block bounded by Hoyt, Schermerhorn, Bond and State Streets.
All the sites have been leased as parking lots since 1977, supposedly until long-term plans could be adopted. Over the years, proposals for housing fell by the wayside as opponents argued over the size of projects or over plans for subsidized housing, and as financing from government subsidy programs dried up. One proposal that went nowhere called for dormitory buildings for students at colleges in the area. Another called for a new courthouse at one site.
Two years ago, the borough president, Howard Golden, formed a task force of representatives of community groups and the local community board to recommend development guidelines for the sites. These guidelines have been incorporated into the request for proposals, Mr. Golden said.
Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, said that while the agency was "looking to get a market price" for the sites and to return the property to the tax rolls, the agency also wanted a "development acceptable to the community." He said a candidate's experience and access to financing would also be major considerations in selecting a bidder.
While government housing subsidies will not be involved, he said, his agency was seeking to encourage the construction of housing that would be "affordable to most people." Once a development company is selected, its plan would be subject to approvals by the City Planning Commission and the City Council.
Although the area is already starved for parking spaces, the request for proposals does not include a garage, to make up for the spaces to be lost when the first site is developed. Mr. Gargano said he would encourage more use of mass transit to travel to the area.

HEADLINE: Clinton, in Brunei, Warns That Backtracking Could Bring a New Asian Economic Crisis

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei, Wednesday, Nov. 15

 BODY:
President Clinton today began a five-day farewell tour of Asia, arguing that the summit meeting of Asian leaders he began in 1993 has begun to weave the region together for the first time in history.
But Mr. Clinton, in a speech to Asian business leaders in this steamy city on the northern coast of Borneo, warned that countries backtracking on economic reforms risk a return to the financial crisis of 1997. 
 Without referring directly to the political crises that have stalled those changes in Japan, the Philippines and Indonesia, he said "it would be a cruel irony indeed if the recovery stalled the changes that made the recovery possible."
In both what he said this morning and what he omitted, Mr. Clinton appeared to acknowledge that the bold agenda for Asia he set out in November 1993 -- when he summoned a reluctant group of Asia's political leaders to Seattle for their first-ever summit meeting -- has been only partly achieved.
Without question, the region has come together economically, and Mr. Clinton ticked off the statistics today about how much trade has increased and poverty and child mortality have declined among the nations that make up the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation group. The member nations vary dramatically in size and wealth, from Russia and China to this tiny sultanate, which amounts to a shopping mall built atop a family-owned oil field.
But his 1993 concept of a far more cohesive political region has not come to pass. The level of mutual suspicions between Japan and China, China and Taiwan, Australia and Indonesia, and other nations scattered across the Pacific have diminished little in the last seven years. For example, Taiwan's new leader, Chen Shui-bian, still cannot attend the gathering because China still regards the country as a renegade province. So instead Taiwan sent its central bank governor, participating as a member "economy."
This morning, though, President Clinton insisted that his efforts to use economic relationships to foster political change has made considerable progress. He noted Washington's recent trade accords with China and Vietnam, where he goes on Thursday night, and said they amounted to "declarations of interdependence" for Communist nations that once reveled in their self-sufficiency.
The results of those accords, he said, are predestined: "Dismantling command and control economies, giving their people more access to information and finally, I believe, giving people more freedom to use that information."
In what appeared to be a response to complaints that his attention to the region has been periodic at best, Mr. Clinton asserted today that his administration had demonstrated "that Asia is even more important to the United States after the cold war," and "there is no longer any doubt our connections to this region are permanent, not passing." That included, he said, large troop presences in South Korea and Japan.
He indirectly acknowledged, however, that Asia's trade agenda has slowed dramatically, especially after the 1997 financial crisis and the collapse of global trade talks in Seattle late last year.
He said those trade talks should get restarted "early next year," but offered no new ideas about how to bridge the bitter divide between developed nations and poor countries including many in Asia who pulled the plug on the negotiations. Those countries fear that the American insistence that countries adopt Western-style labor and environmental rules was simply a ploy to take away their competitive advantage.
He also noted that leaders in Asia have been only partly successful in translating their commitments here into economic openings and reforms at home.
Those commitments often run into strong opposition from domestic industries, from banks to telecommunications firms, which fear an onslaught of American and other foreign competition.
While such changes are difficult, he said, "surely it can't be as hard as living through another crisis."

HEADLINE: East New York Senses Promise In a New Mall

BYLINE: By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN

 BODY:
After years of false starts, East New York is pinning its hopes for economic resurrection on a 230-acre Brooklyn landfill. For decades, the land and scores of other vacant lots helped earn the battered Brooklyn neighborhood a reputation as a hard-luck ghetto, a place where nothing grew but weeds and the crime rate.
But now this huge tract of land may finally play a critical role in East New York's efforts to rebuild. Developers will break ground tomorrow on the Gateway Center, a $192 million shopping complex that is expected to create thousands of jobs in the neighborhood. It will be built on parcels of land owned by the state and the city that sit just off the Belt Parkway, east of Schenck Avenue. There will also be a 17-acre public park, which will have the city's first full-size public cricket field. 
 Once the mall opens in 2002, construction is to begin on Gateway Estates, a subdivision to be built in part with city and state financing. It will include housing for low-income people: 600 row houses, 400 single-family houses and 200 two-family houses.
Stores like Target, Home Depot, Marshalls and Bed Bath & Beyond have signed on as anchor tenants of the 640,000-square-foot mall. Shoppers looking for fast food or the requisite food court will have to look elsewhere. By design, Gateway will have only family dine-in restaurants, like the Olive Garden, a rarity in East New York.
"This will be an upscale retail center, not just another strip mall," said Jeff Blau, president of the Related Companies, the parent company of the mall's developer.
Related is also the developer of the 2.7-million-square-foot Time Warner Center, a complex of offices, stores, hotel rooms and luxury condominiums under construction at Columbus Circle. The company also builds, owns and manages residential housing.
"We spent an extra $3 million to make sure that it will have a look and feel that all New Yorkers can appreciate," Mr. Blau said of the mall.
Because of the mall's location off the Belt Parkway, developers and neighborhood groups say they believe it will attract people from outside East New York, including shoppers from Queens and Long Island.
And many neighborhood groups and residents also hope the mall will demonstrate to retailers a fact that many have been slow to accept: poor people have buying power, too.
"We're already spending our money at these stores," said Walter Campbell, the manager of Community Board 5. "But we've had to go all the way to Nassau County and Jersey to do it because people don't think of East New York as a place where people can afford nice things. They don't realize this is a community constantly doing renovations at home and trying to make life better."
Previous efforts to build at this site, known as Spring Creek, have fallen through.
In 1989, the land was turned over to the Starrett Housing Corporation, which planned to use it for a large development of mixed-income housing. There was talk of new parks and houses and possibly even a school, but the proposal was stalled as the city backed away and other groups began to compete for the land.
James Lima, an assistant city commissioner of housing preservation and development, said the project never got off the ground because it required more than $100 million in public financing.
Under the current plan, the developer is paying for projects like road improvements, the addition of a Belt Parkway exit and the creation and maintenance of the park and sewer lines for the new homes.
But even before the news of the mall, small yet tangible signs of improvement were sprouting in the neighborhood. While crime has been dropping all over the city, in East New York, that means drug dealers are not as brazen anymore and bullets do not fly as freely as they did in the late 1980's, when residents, especially children, feared being hit by stray gunfire, the police and church leaders said.
"This place used to be a shooting gallery," said Nicholas Tarulli, an officer in the 75th Precinct since 1987. Officers in the 75th and people all around the neighborhood say they are encouraged by the drop in violent crime. There has been a 70 percent drop in homicides since 1993. In 1999, there were 32 homicides, down from 41 in 1998. In a city list that ranked the precincts with the highest crime rates at the top, the 75th Precinct, once one of the worst, was 51st among the 76 precincts last year.
The neighborhood's economic health is harder to track. But a study by the City Council, called "A City of Contrasts: 2000," shows a place where people are still struggling. Of the 134,000 residents in Council District 42, which includes East New York, only 18 percent were homeowners in 1997, according to the latest data available, and only 49 percent of the adults that year were employed. In the 1998-99 school year, 89 percent of the school-age children were eligible for free lunches.
But there are some bright spots. Community leaders point to the renewed momentum of the Nehemiah houses, a 1980's program that won acclaim nationwide for helping to get poor people out of public housing.
The sponsor of the program, East Brooklyn Congregations, built 1,100 two- and three-bedroom brick row houses from 1987 to 1991, but stopped work after disagreements with the Dinkins administration on sites where it could build.
Four years ago, with help from the Giuliani administration, construction started on 700 homes west of Pennsylvania Avenue. About 500 of the houses have already been built, and thousands of people are on the waiting list for the next 200 units.
Even older homes in East New York are starting to catch people's eyes. Last year, the average price of a single-family home in East New York rose 8.4 percent, to $152,585 from $140,789. In nearby Midwood, housing prices rose to $301,729 from $299,231. And there are indications that prices could climb still higher as other businesses find their way to East New York. The mall alone is expected to create 2,300 construction and retail jobs.
Community development groups are scurrying to take inventory of the area's resources for businesses looking to relocate.
The Rev. Johnny Ray Youngblood of East Brooklyn Congregations, a coalition of churches, synagogues and community groups, is not surprised. Even at the height of East New York's problems, he said, he still believed that resurrection lay just around the corner. And he sees the reward of his faith, he said, on drives through Nehemiah Country, the nickname he has given to blocks where Nehemiah houses have been built. (Nehemiah was a biblical leader who rebuilt Jerusalem.)
"Sometimes I leave my office and I'm drained," said Mr. Youngblood, the pastor of St. Paul's Community Baptist Church. "But I'm rejuvenated because I can see families who are participating in the American promise."
The mall, Mr. Youngblood said, will make East New York more of a neighborhood for its newest residents. "The people who are moving here need reasons to stay here and spend here. You can't rebuild a community when people are forced to take their money elsewhere."
In East New York, Patricia Worthy says she has found her piece of the American dream: a brand-new home with a yard. For years, Ms. Worthy, 48, a retired correction officer, deferred her dream. Feeling the pinch of living on a partial pension of $1,800 a month -- $800 of which paid the rent on her apartment in Holliswood, Queens -- she thought her best chance to own a home lay in the slow, easy life of the South. She made plans to buy a small $60,000 house in Savannah, Ga., near relatives. But East New York and the Nehemiah houses made her a believer again.
By Thanksgiving, she will move into her new three-bedroom house on Hegeman Avenue, which cost about $110,000 to build. With a $505 monthly mortgage payment, before taxes, she expects to have a little extra cash in her pocket.
Nehemiah applicants typically earn $23,000 to $60,000 a year. Under the program, the city provides $20,000 toward the cost of the homes, which cost $102,000 to build and sell for roughly $80,000. Officials from the East Brooklyn Congregations help applicants secure mortgages with below-market interest rates.
"There aren't too many places left in this city for people like me on fixed incomes but who still want to live the dream of owning a home," Ms. Worthy said. "People have a lot of misconceptions about this place, but East New York and the Nehemiah program are changing lives, giving people their own yards, something to take pride in."
Lives are changing everywhere, it seems, except in the northern section of East New York, up along Shepherd and Atlantic Avenues and Berriman and Essex Streets. There, the struggle continues. Parishioners making their way to Mass at St. Rita's Roman Catholic Church are propositioned by prostitutes, said the church's pastor, the Rev. John Peyton, who has lived in the neighborhood for 37 years.
Scores of abandoned car shells that have been stripped down for parts are left on streets, Father Peyton said, and the neighborhood is home to too many auto body shops and salvage yards. More problematic, he said, are some of the members of his church who are too poor to dream of renting an apartment, not to mention buying a Nehemiah home.
A survey of 300 adult students in the church's basic education class drove the point home. "More than half of them are renting rooms," he said. "They're people with average incomes of $7,000 to $15,000."
Even so, Father Peyton said he was now more hopeful than ever about East New York. "We're still a long ways away from having the appeal of Harlem or Bed-Stuy, but you can see the people here digging in, taking the problems seriously," he said. "They have things here to be proud of now. It's a start."

HEADLINE: HOUSE PROUD;
Old Modern Houses With Futurist Ideals

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN

DATELINE: PALO ALTO, Calif.

 BODY:
ABOUT 50 years ago, the future touched down here in the form of a house and decided to make itself comfortable.
Back in the 1950's -- before they became the Bay Area's hot collectibles -- the architect-designed houses that Joseph Eichler built brought affordable Modernism to the masses. The houses' flat roofs, floor-to-ceiling windows, covered carports and toasty radiant heating embodied the constant search for happier, better living: postwar California optimism served sunny side up on a concrete slab. 
 But even Joseph Eichler, a retired butter-and-egg salesman who was inspired to begin a new career after living briefly in a Frank Lloyd Wright house, could not have foreseen the Eichler lifestyle, circa 2000, in which moneyed young techies fight over original Zolotone kitchen cabinets, and untouched Eichlers, built as low-cost starter homes, can go for $1.5 million.
"What we do in Silicon Valley is invent the future," said Christopher Dow, 35, a software designer who recently moved with his wife, Leslie, a molecular biologist, and three children into a frozen-in-time Eichler house here. "Unfortunately, you have to move into a 40-year-old house to be modern, because they don't build modern anymore."
Mr. Dow, who remembers watching the first moon landing from his grandmother's Eames lounge chair, is one of the new breed who have to have an Eichler. He and his wife were overjoyed to find a 1970's original, the dark brown carpet bearing the distinct silhouette of a water bed. It was perfect. "We wanted something that nobody had ruined yet," Ms. Dow said.
The couple restored much of the cathedral-ceilinged house themselves, decorating it with a reel-to-reel tape recorder and other antiques and mixing Ikea with items off eBay. Rare orchids now sprout in the atrium, where the family dines alfresco beside an orange globe-shaped barbecue.
The Dows belong to the Eichler Network, an Ann Landers-style support group with a newsletter and a Web site for the 11,000 or so owners of Bay Area Eichlers. (The San Fernando Valley, outside Los Angeles, also has Eichler communities; six Eichler houses will be on the Los Angeles Conservancy's "How Modern Was My Valley" tour, Nov. 18 and 19.)
The network -- where it's all Eichler, all the time -- counsels a new generation on taking care of quirky, aging Modernist houses, from ailing heat piping below the floor and taut, often-leaky roofs to kitchen cabinetry suspended from the ceiling and known affectionately as "the flying coffin." The network even provides tips on atrium gardening and recipes for Eichler-era appetizers like mini-meatballs.
Maintenance of Bay Area Eichlers is a $55 million-a-year cottage industry, said Marty Arbunich, the network's director. More important, perhaps, the network is becoming a political force, as the specter of monster houses dwarfing and even replacing unpretentious post-and-beam Eichler pavilions grows. The most crushing blow was the recent demolition of a custom Eichler in Atherton, a Silicon Valley town that is so exclusive the new owners paid $6 million for the privilege. Purists want to protect their Eichlers from being replaced by towering pink stucco palaces or ignobly transformed into haciendas.
Last month, the city of Cupertino adopted the R1-e rule (the "e" stands for Eichler), requiring a design review for any second-story addition to an Eichler. "We wanted to keep the neighborhood as Eichlerlish as possible," said Nancy Burnett, 69, who watched her 1961 dream house in the Fairgrove subdivision being built from the slab up. It was the house she had yearned for in Sunset magazine. "Before I'd ever seen one, I knew I wanted to live in an Eichler," she said.
The houses today are poignant snapshots of an era in which progressive design and planning were placed within reach of the average homeowner. "They spanned a breach rarely crossed between ordinary suburban life and avant-garde culture,"said Paul Adamson, an architectural historian. "Their ability to cross over is what makes them so compelling."
Joseph Eichler, a man fond of cigars and colorful language, took modern architecture -- the realm of custom clients -- and turned it into a merchant builder's product. His experience of living in one of Frank Lloyd Wright's small, economic Usonian houses during World War II inspired him to become a home builder committed to high design for ordinary people (including members of minorities, whom he welcomed). Although he started with generic designs, Mr. Eichler soon sought to distinguish his products in the booming postwar market, hiring top-flight Modernist architects like Robert Anshen, and A. Quincy Jones and Frederick Emmons. In now nostalgic-feeling Greenmeadow, built here in 1954, and Upper Lucas Valley, which went up in Marin County between 1961 and 1966 -- both still revolve around their own schools, swimming pools and community centers -- he broke away from the typical subdivision Cape Cod saltbox to forge a modern California style knit unassumingly into the landscape ("no meaningless brick," promised the sales literature, "no dinky chimney").
To original owners like Margaret and Jim Taylor -- she is now 77, he is 81 -- it wasn't a matter so much of style as the $3,500 down payment. "We thought it was quite a bit of room for the money," Mrs. Taylor recalled. "He was more than a contractor and builder. He had a vision of how he wanted people to live."
Somewhat nondescript on the outside, the houses' real innovations were in inner space: glass walls facing private outdoor living areas, including atriums, two bathrooms (with doors to the outside so that dirty children could be plunked directly into the bath), clerestories and an open kitchen (to allow "the lady of the house to share the fun and companionship of the family and friends as she works").
In model homes, Eames and Bertoia furniture mingled with hanging salamis and the aroma of roasting turkey, making modernism homey. "We weren't selling, we were educating," said Catherine Munson, a Marin County real estate broker who has sold some 3,000 Eichlers since 1958. She began as an Eichler hostess, demonstrating the pull-out swivel tables and giving prospective buyers' children chocolate milk.
Today, Eichler homeowners are divided among purists, realists willing to make some changes and people bent on turning their Eichlers into anything but. Nothing torments purists more than an Eichler decked out with Victorian cut-glass doors, lace curtains and picket fences. "Would anyone seriously consider putting carriage lamps and running boards on a sleek convertible?" asked K. C. Marcinik, an architect who, with her husband, Mark, specializes in saving Eichlers.
New owners like Chris and Kristen Loew are determined to right past wrongs. Three years ago, Mr. Loew, 37, an industrial designer, and Ms. Loew, 33, a graphic designer, purchased a rare, all-steel prototype Eichler here designed by the progressive Modernist architect Raphael Soriano. Shingles had been applied to the exterior, a la 70's hippie house, and an ungainly second story had been added. "From the outside it looked like a bat cave," Mr. Loew recalled. "I was about to storm in to tell the owners how they had ruined it, but then I walked in and was speechless."
What he saw was an interior space with "unbreakable logic," a Modernist gem with steel pillars and fluted ceiling, a glass wall overlooking a courtyard and a concrete block fireplace with an exposed cylindrical flue. The couple plan to remove the shingles and rescue the kitchen, once open but now a dark galley ("completely deviant," in Ms. Loew's words).
The Marciniks advocate the creation of hyper-Eichlers, much like their own house in Greenmeadow. Replacing the original subdued hues, which bore names like Dawn Grey, Thatch and Bark, they painted each area a vibrant color, with contrasting white stripes in the grooves between the redwood wall planks.
At their own house and in houses for clients like Kurt Taylor, 43, and B. J. Olson, 48, the Marciniks preserve the spirit but not the letter of Eichlers, reconfiguring kitchens and replacing Philippine mahogany or redwood cabinetry with zoomy concrete counters and luxurious African wood. "When I go into other people's houses that aren't Eichlers," Mr. Taylor observed, "I'm struck by how dark most houses are."
The blessing and curse of Eichlers is that many happen to sit in the heart of Silicon Valley, where tastes among the newly rich often run to freshly built Tuscan villas and medieval chateaus. With their single stories and simple roofs and entrances, Eichlers are particularly vulnerable to the tear-down syndrome. Some neighborhoods have longstanding architectural controls, and five Eichler neighborhoods here prohibit second-story additions. Other communities, like Balboa Highlands in the San Fernando Valley, are considering similar rules.
Not everyone approves of such newfound glorification. "Eichler had integrity, but his houses were indifferent to the street," said Daniel Solomon, an architect and professor at the University of California at Berkeley. "They are single-use, low-density houses oriented toward the car. They shared many characteristics of suburban sprawl but gave it a mantle of respectability."
Even those who have rediscovered them find a certain irony in rhapsodizing about a subdivision. "If you had told me 15 years ago that I'd be living here, I would have told you you were crazy," said Peter Schlosser, a 40-year-old architect. He and his wife, Alison Hart Schlosser (also an architect), and children live among rolling golden hills in Upper Lucas Valley, where strict architectural controls judge everything from exterior paint colors to rooftop air-conditioners (prohibited). "But Eichlers are unique," he continued. "They have a common flavor but aren't cookie-cutter."
High in the hills of San Mateo, Anna-Lise Pedersen, 77, owner of the X-100, a radical all-steel house built as an Eichler promotion in 1956, is on intimate terms with the future. She tends it daily, whenever she waters her seven indoor flower beds, or steps onto the pebbled circle-patterned floors, or parts the leaves of her Formica dining table to reveal two pristine Thermador burners perfect for grilling steak.
She hangs her laundry outside among the primrose-colored steel beams and takes evening showers as the moonlight peers through the clerestories. "I wouldn't change a thing," she said of the house. "You
feel like you're all alone in a big world."

As critical talks on a treaty to fight global warming entered a third day here, the Department of Energy issued a study that addresses a main point of contention: whether the United States could do more to reduce its addiction to fossil fuels.
In the study, Energy Department analysts say that fairly simple, inexpensive changes in American energy policies -- some already embraced by both presidential aspirants -- could go a long way toward cutting emissions of carbon dioxide, the dominant greenhouse gas. 
 The analysts conclude with three ways that energy use, and thus emissions of carbon dioxide, could be substantially reduced, with almost no harm to the economy: raising standards for energy and fuel efficiency; increasing spending on government and private energy research; and adopting a national trading scheme for carbon dioxide cuts that gives companies a financial incentive to surpass required reductions.
The payoff would come not only in reducing greenhouse gases, said a chief author, Dr. Marilyn A. Brown, but also in lower energy bills, less dependence on imported oil and a reduction in power plant and car emissions, which contribute to smog and acid rain. Dr. Brown is deputy director of the energy efficiency and renewable energy program of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
She added, "There are lots of low-cost and no-cost opportunities that are a great investment."
Dr. Brown was planning to present the work on Thursday for negotiators gathered to debate a proposed international treaty to curtail global warming. But word of the study was already out; the focus was on its contrasts with the negotiating position of the American delegation.
Under the treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, by 2012 industrialized countries would cut combined emissions of greenhouse gases more than 5 percent below emissions measured in 1990. So far more than 100 countries have signed the treaty, but no industrialized countries have ratified it.
Many countries and environmental groups have complained that the United States has strongly resisted commitment to a gas reductions goal on its home turf. Instead, American negotiators have pressed for industrialized countries to get credit toward emissions targets in exchange for investments made wherever in the world the biggest reductions can be found for the least cost.
The United States has felt growing pressure to commit to reductions at home because it is widely perceived as the 800-pound gorilla in the global greenhouse. With 4 percent of the world's population, the United States produces nearly 25 percent of heat-trapping gases.
The Energy Department study seemed to offer evidence that plenty could be accomplished at home, negotiators and observers here said.
"This shows us that there are huge opportunities to achieve real domestic pollution reductions," said Dr. Daniel A. Lashof, a senior scientist for the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private group in New York. "It shows us there's no reason for the United States to demand loopholes as part of these negotiations."
He added that momentum was building for a core component of the Energy Department proposal: a national system for requiring cuts in carbon dioxide and letting companies that surpass those targets sell the excess credits.
This is the same kind of trading system that has sharply -- and without great cost -- lowered emissions of sulfur pollution from power plants over the last decade.
Referring to the two combatants still locked in the presidential race, Dr. Lashof said, "Both Bush and Gore have supported limits on carbon dioxide from power plants with emissions trading."
The analysis, Scenarios for a Clean Energy Future, offered several ways the United States could reduce pollution from fossil fuels. For example, it could encourage utilities to produce at least a small percentage of their electricity with nonpolluting technologies like wind power -- in the way that California now requires car manufacturers to sell some models that produce nearly no pollution.
American negotiators said here today that they were all for aggressively cutting greenhouse emissions domestically. But any treaty that forced countries to achieve most cuts at home "would only increase costs, reduce incentives for innovation and substantially complicate efforts to move forward," said David B. Sandalow, an assistant secretary of state for environmental affairs.
Still, some American environmental experts thought the United States would pursue domestic cuts.
"I can't imagine the United States Congress sending huge amounts of money to Russia or elsewhere to buy emission reductions when there are cost-effective reductions at home," said Eileen Claussen, president of the Pew Center on Climate Change, based in Washington. "It only makes sense to do those things first."

HEADLINE: An 'Untouchable' Says Caste Is Truly a Human Rights Issue

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 15

 BODY:
A leader of India's Dalits, the "untouchable" underclass of more than 160 million people whose campaign for an end to discrimination is rarely heard in the West, is being honored this month by two major American human rights organizations seeking to raise awareness of the issue.
On Tuesday in New York, Martin Macwan, a lawyer who founded the National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights, was named by Human Rights Watch as one of five outstanding human rights defenders around the world this year. And in Washington on Nov. 21, Mr. Macwan will receive the 2000 Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award. 
 Last year, Human Rights Watch published the first book-length report on the conditions of the Dalits and the organization is now also lobbying to put the cause on the agenda of the United Nations' first international conference on racism and discrimination next summer.
"The fact that we're honoring a Martin from India reminds us of yet another Martin from the U.S. who fought racial discrimination in this country," said Stephen Rickard, director of the R.F.K. Center for Human Rights, which will give Mr. Macwan his award in Washington.
In an interview today, Mr. Macwan, 41, described the lives of people who are deprived of land ownership, required to drink and eat from separate utensils, barred from wells and temples, forced into bonded labor and made to clean latrines with their bare hands and carry human waste away from the homes of caste Hindus.
The untouchables, literally outcasts, are also vulnerable to violence at the hands of upper-caste Hindus and the police, he said.
Dalits who convert to other religions, to escape the Hindu caste system, face double jeopardy in an era of Hindu nationalism, said Mr. Macwan, who is a Christian.
Mr. Macwan, who was born into a Dalit family in Gujarat, said in an interview today that as a student he watched the beatings and sometimes the killings of fellow untouchables, and decided to establish an organization to help them. He called it the Navsarjan (New Creation) Trust. More recently, he formed the National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights, linking similar organizations in 14 Indian states.
India has given opportunities to Dalits -- the country's president, K. R. Narayanan, was born an untouchable. It also has laws forbidding discrimination, and has introduced affirmative action programs to bring Dalits into politics and educational institutions. But for a majority of the most disadvantaged, abuses continue.
"The Indian government has been very successful at manufacturing an image as the world's largest democracy with a very progressive constitution and many progressive laws on the books," said Smita Narula, who wrote the 1999 Human Rights Watch report, "Broken People: Caste Violence Against India's 'Untouchables."
"We don't dispute any of this," she said, "but none of the laws are implemented and the Constitution is not enforced."
Mr. Macwan described caste discrimination as an "institutionalized" system that has allowed, for example, the highest Brahmin caste, with 3.5 percent of the population, to hold 78 percent of judicial positions and about half of parliamentary seats.
He said the Indian government has argued that caste -- a complex division of society with religious, cultural and economic roots -- is a domestic issue. Mr. Macwan disagrees.
"We say that India did support the U.S. civil rights movement in the 1960's, and also the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa," he said. "In this era of the globalization of markets and of human rights, no country can claim that it's a domestic matter. It's a universal concern."

HEADLINE: Dow Jones Drops Wall Street Journal's Regional Editions

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
Dow Jones & Company abruptly ended a seven-year experiment in regional business journalism yesterday, announcing that it would immediately halt publication of six special weekly editions of The Wall Street Journal.
The four-page weekly regional editions of The Journal appeared to be victims of the main paper's success in attracting national advertisers. They were started in hopes of landing new business from companies too small and local to pay the premium nationwide advertising rates. 
 The Journal has traditionally positioned itself as a high-end advertising vehicle, capable of delivering an exceptionally wealthy and well-educated group of readers to advertisers. But in 1993, with the economy recently out of a recession and Dow Jones executives looking for a way to expand ad revenue, the regional concept was seen as a way of attracting a second tier of advertisers, without jeopardizing the nationwide edition's sterling price structure. The first regional edition, which covered Texas, appeared that year. By 1998, there were five more, covering Florida, California, the Southeast, New England and the Pacific Northwest. The editions appeared as special sections in 800,000 copies of The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, said Richard J. Tofel, a Dow Jones spokesman. The remaining one million of The Journal's 1.8 million copies had no regional news sections.
Mr. Tofel said the regional editions offered small and local advertisers the chance to buy access to segments of The Journal's prized readership at substantially lower ad rates. An advertiser in the Pacific Northwest edition, for instance, could buy 13 full-page ads for $9,000 a page; each ad would be seen by 64,000 subscribers. A full page in the main edition of The Wall Street Journal, by contrast, costs $155,000.
Mr. Tofel called the regional editions "marginally profitable."
As the economic expansion has accelerated over the last few years, however, Dow Jones executives discovered a growing pool of national advertisers flush enough to buy space in The Journal's main edition, at top-of-the-line prices -- enough, according to insiders, to sell out the paper without devoting four pages to less-profitable regional advertising.
Advertisers have flocked in particular to The Journal's special reports on technology and its weekend section, which appears on Fridays and is oriented toward coverage of wines, expensive real estate, shopping and other living trends.
With advertisers willing to pay top dollar, Dow Jones executives saw little business sense in paying the salaries of the 34 reporters and editors, plus one ad representative, who worked for the less-profitable regional sections. Paul Steiger, managing editor of The Wall Street Journal, notified regional staffers yesterday that their jobs would end on Dec. 31.
In a memo, he told the affected workers that they could write news for the main edition until that date, and that they were also invited to apply for openings at The Journal, its international editions and the Dow Jones electronic publications. The company's union contract does not promise to relocate the displaced workers to new jobs, but Mr. Steiger made an oral commitment to do so in a staff conference call yesterday.

HEADLINE: 2 Reports Provide New Signs Of a Cooling U.S. Economy

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
American industrial output weakened in October and businesses grew cautious about stockpiling goods, according to two reports released today, adding to signs of a gradually cooling economy.
The Federal Reserve's monthly report on industrial production showed that output by mines, factories and utilities fell 0.1 percent last month after an upwardly revised gain of 0.4 percent in September. 
 It was the first drop in monthly output since a 0.2 percent fall in July and only the second since the beginning of 1999. Manufacturing stalled while the output at utilities fell.
The second report, from the Commerce Department, showed that business inventories in September were growing at their slowest pace in nearly two years. Production to build inventories is generally a source of economic strength, unless faltering sales cause an oversupply that forces sharp cutbacks.
Inventories edged up 0.1 percent in September, to $1.207 trillion -- the smallest rise since January 1999 -- after a 0.7 percent climb in August. Sales rose 0.4 percent, to $905 billion, matching the gain in August.
Mark Vitner, an economist with First Union in Charlotte, N.C., said that over the last three months there had been a faster rate of inventory buildup than of sales.
The trend "suggests that production will need to be scaled back quite a bit in coming months to bring inventories back in line with slower sales," Mr. Vitner said.
There were signs in the Fed's report that some companies had begun trimming their production in anticipation of a reduced pace of business activity ahead.
Output weakened during October in several industries, from household appliances to autos, showing that the six interest rate increases from mid-1999 to May 2000 were reining in spending on costly items.
New-vehicle output fell to an annual pace of 12.2 million from 13.1 million in September, accounting for much of October's decreased output. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, industrial output rose 0.3 percent after gaining 0.4 percent in September.
The report on industrial production showed that businesses operated at 82.1 percent of their capacity last month, down from 82.5 in September. It was the lowest rate since 82 percent in April and indicated there was little danger of production bottlenecks at factories of the sort that might lead to sharp price increaes.

HEADLINE: A Growing Corporate Challenge: the Empty Executive Suite

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON

 BODY:
Faced with an unforgiving stock market and a harsh business environment, many companies are experiencing another stark reality: a lack of management depth. As more and more chief executives are being rushed out the door by disappointed investors and impatient boards, companies are finding that there is a shortage of obvious candidates to fill these spots, according to executive recruiters and management experts.
Boards will be forced to reach out more broadly for candidates than they have in the past, they say, which may mean that women will be able to move up in these organizations more quickly. The current shortage of managers may also cause companies to rethink how they are grooming future executives. 
 "Companies have been developing talent on a slower timetable than they should be," said Thomas J. Neff, the chairman of Spencer Stuart, an executive recruitment firm in New York. As companies waste no time in ousting executives who stumble, the escalating demand may mean that companies have difficulty finding replacements. "It's not like there is an unlimited supply of talent to run all these companies," Mr. Neff said.
Chief executives are clearly being held to much higher standards today, and the turnover at the top appears to be unprecedented. Lloyd D. Ward at the Maytag Corporation, Richard A. McGinn at Lucent Technologies and Michael C. Hawley at Gillette are among the chief executives at some of the country's best-known companies that have recently left after they failed to deliver the performance that investors wanted.
In the last three months, 350 chief executives in the United States have left their jobs, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a Chicago-based firm that helps newly unemployed executives find new positions.
Increasing the pressure on companies is the need to find better candidates than they have had to in recent years, when a buoyant stock market and a booming economy made the choice of a chief executive less critical. "Good times mask mediocre management," said Gerard R. Roche, the senior chairman for Heidrick & Struggles International, an executive recruiting company based in Chicago.
While some recruiters say there are plenty of future executives who will one day be considered as successful as Jack Welch, the head of General Electric, they acknowledge that companies are unlikely to find people who have already proved they are up to the job. "They have already done their job and are tired of it or are doing a good job where they are," explained Russell S. Reynolds Jr., an executive recruiter who is now the chairman of the Directorship Search Group in Greenwich, Conn.
Unless boards are willing to consider a less-obvious choice, someone who has never been a chief executive, for example, the market looks narrow, said Rakesh Khurana, who is an assistant professor at the Harvard Business School and who is writing a book on the chief executive labor market.
As a result of the downsizing that went on during the 1980's and 90's, "there was a significant thinning of management ranks," he said. Companies have also been reluctant to invest in developing future executives because managers are now unlikely to spend their careers at any one company.
In general, the development of talent within companies has been "a much lower priority," agreed Arthur Resnikoff, a consulting psychologist with Hagberg Consulting Group, which is based in Foster City, Calif. "Companies are not willing to put their money to work in that way," he said.
There are exceptions, of course. General Electric is an oft-cited example of a company that takes great pains to develop future chief executives, even when Mr. Welch appears to be in no hurry to leave. And I.B.M. is likely to choose a successor to Louis V. Gerstner Jr., its current chief executive, from among its top officers.
The high rate of turnover among chief executives will force many companies to look more widely for candidates, both inside and outside their organizations. A result may be greater opportunity for female and minority managers, who have traditionally had difficulty reaching the executive suite, according to Andrea Redmond, a recruiter for Russell Reynolds Associates. She is aware of three chief executive searches being conducted by her company that include candidates other than white men.
"There are a number of women with very substantial titles, ergo experience, and a certain degree of readiness," said Sheila Wellington, the president of Catalyst, a nonprofit research and advisory group in New York that studies women in business.
But while Catalyst's most recent census among Fortune 500 companies, released earlier this week, identified about 1,600 female corporate officers, only 28.6 percent of them had the kind of responsibility that made them likely candidates for the top job, she noted. About twice the percentage of male corporate officers have such responsibility for profits or a direct relationship with clients.
"As one looks more carefully, there is somewhat less reason for optimism," Ms. Wellington said.
And some management experts wonder whether companies have been looking for the right candidates for chief executive, given the rapid changes within Corporate America. Boards have erred in trying to find the candidate that is most like their last success, said James O'Toole, a business professor at the University of Southern California and an adviser to Booz-Allen & Hamilton, a management consulting firm. Directors "are looking for the safest person, and someone they're comfortable with," he said.
Instead of looking for the next Jack Welch, Mr. O'Toole said, directors should try to find someone who can create an environment where there is an abundance of managers who can move up. At Enron, for example, Kenneth Lay, the chief executive, has made a concerted effort to recruit managers and give them substantial responsibility, he said. While some of those people will fail or leave for other jobs, it adds to the company's overall management strength. Mr. Lay "has simplified his role," Mr. O'Toole said.
Boards may be slow, however, to recognize the need to find a different kind of candidate, even as they move quickly to replace someone who is struggling. Many have taken the unusual step of filling the executive suite temporarily by bringing back the company's former chief executive even when that executive may bear some of the responsibility for the company's current woes.
"It's almost going in the wrong direction," said Michael Useem, a management professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, who said he also believed that today's chief executives must possess a different set of skills than their predecessors.
Boards "haven't quite identified the problem yet," he said.

HEADLINE: Still Vigilant, Fed Maintains Steady Rates

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
Citing clear evidence that the economy has shifted into a lower gear, the Federal Reserve voted today to hold interest rates steady, but with unemployment low and energy prices high the central bank said it was not yet ready to proclaim that inflation was no longer a threat.
The Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee did not allude to the uncertainty over the outcome of the presidential election or to the recent uncertainty in the stock market, but instead projected a business-as-usual tone in a statement that stressed the gradual cooling of the economy. The statement said economic growth appeared to have slowed to a rate below what most economists consider its noninflationary speed limit of about 4 percent a year. 
 The Fed imposed six rate increases, totaling 1.75 percentage points, between June 1999 and May of this year, in an effort to bring economic growth into a range that would diminish inflation pressures.
But the committee stressed that it still saw "a risk of heightened inflation pressures" stemming from the low rate of joblessness -- 3.9 percent in October -- and the rise earlier this year in oil prices.
As a result, the committee said, it would remain on alert for inflation, a signal to Wall Street that it is not yet ready to contemplate reducing interest rates.
Some investors had been betting that the Fed would sound the all-clear on inflation, and the outcome of today's meeting led to a broad fall in stock prices from their levels just before the committee's statement was released about 2:15 p.m. The Dow Jones industrial average, which had been up 115 points, dropped into negative territory after the Fed announced its decision. The Dow later recovered somewhat, closing at 10,707.60, up 26.54 points.
Analysts said that if the economy remained on its current path, the Fed could consider dropping its policy bias toward raising rates as soon as its next meeting, on Dec. 19, and shift to a neutral policy that assumes the risks of inflation are no greater than the risk of the economy slowing too much.
The committee's statement contained "clear signs that the Fed is beginning to think that the conditions necessary to prompt a change in its stance might not be too far away," said Ian Shepherdson, an economist at High Frequency Economics, a consulting firm in Valhalla, N.Y.
The statement was a classic of the on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand genre. It gave something both to hard-core inflation fighters within the Fed and those at the central bank who say they believe that a surge in productivity, the basic measure of business efficiency, will permit the economy to continue running at a brisk pace with little risk of inflation.
"The utilization of the pool of available workers remains at an unusually high level, and the increase in energy prices, though having limited effect on core measures of prices to date, still harbors the possibility of raising inflation expectations," the committee said in a statement. "However, softening in business and household demand and tightening conditions in financial markets over recent months suggest that the economy could expand for a time at a pace below the productivity-enhanced rate of growth of its potential to produce," the statement said. Nonetheless, it continued, "the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future."
Today's decision left the Fed's benchmark federal funds target rate on overnight loans among banks at 6.5 percent and its discount rate on loans to banks from the Federal Reserve system at 6 percent. This is the fourth consecutive meeting at which the Fed has held rates steady, since raising both rates by half a percentage point in May.
As they met this morning, Fed officials got more evidence that the slowdown was real. Industrial production declined 0.1 percent in October, the Fed said, with production of consumer goods down 0.5 percent, in part because of a drop in output of cars and trucks.
The industrial production figures came on top of a raft of other statistics in the last few months showing that economic growth appears to be slowing. After growing at a 4.8 percent annual rate in the first quarter and a 5.6 percent annual rate in the second quarter, the economy expanded at a 2.7 percent rate in the third quarter.
Although unemployment remains near a 30-year low, the pace of job creation has slackened, and if the economy continues to grow at a rate below its noninflationary potential, the unemployment rate would probably rise. And although consumer confidence remains at high levels, retail sales appear to be softening, in part because the stock market is no longer generating as much wealth.
"The evidence that the Fed called tentative and preliminary for a couple of meetings is now fairly conclusive: the economy's rate of growth has slowed," said Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at the PNC Financial Services Group in Pittsburgh.
But it is not yet clear that the slowdown will eradicate the inflation pressures that have kept the Fed on alert. There is some tentative evidence that the tight labor market may be starting to push up compensation costs at a pace exceeding gains in productivity. And the surge in oil prices has put upward pressure on broad inflation gauges, though increases in most consumer prices have remained restrained.
There are also enough risks lurking at home and abroad that analysts are reluctant to pronounce without caveats that the economy has achieved a "soft landing" in which growth can be expected to continue at a moderate but healthy rate and inflation would remain dormant.
Among the risks is a sharp decline in the stock market, which has been particularly jumpy lately because of earnings disappointments and the uncertainty over the outcome of the presidential election.
Other risks include the possibility of economic difficulties abroad, especially in Latin America, where Argentina is struggling to keep its economy and financial system on an even keel, and in Asia, where Japan's recovery remains lackluster and other nations are being hit hard by higher oil prices.
To some extent, the outlook depends on how well productivity growth holds up as the economy slows. If the improvement in productivity fades, any downturn could be worsened, and could lead to continued inflation pressures even as the economy throttles back. In such a case, the Fed might be handcuffed, unable to stimulate the economy with lower rates.

HEADLINE: Clinton to Try to Juggle Past Horrors and Future Hopes on Vietnam Visit

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam, Nov. 15

 BODY:
When President Clinton arrives here on Thursday to open a new chapter in postwar relations with Vietnam, the policies he will emphasize will include agendas of the past and of the future that appear to be at odds.
The first president to travel to Vietnam since Richard M. Nixon visited the troops in 1969, Mr. Clinton will see Hanoi, wartime capital of Communist North Vietnam, and Ho Chi Minh City, the former Saigon, in what was South Vietnam. 
 The theme of the visit, repeated by the president and his spokesmen, is, "Vietnam is a country, not a war." But in large part, what that means is that Vietnam is now a business opportunity -- the most laggardly and tempting marketplace in Asia.
Mr. Clinton's agenda for the future is to keep trying to persuade Vietnam to open its markets and carry out a new bilateral trade agreement that would clear obstacles that have frustrated foreign investors.
In a signal of hope for the future, executives of more than 50 American corporations will be coming too, including representatives of giants like Boeing, Citigroup, Coca-Cola, General Electric, General Motors, Nike and Procter & Gamble.
At the same time, Mr. Clinton has already begun reciting the American mantra, unchanged since the end of the war 25 years ago, that Washington's main priority in Vietnam is a continuing search for the remains of service members missing in action.
"Over the past decade," Mr. Clinton said last weekend in Washington, "we have moved, step by step, toward normalized relations with Vietnam, based on one central priority, gaining the fullest accounting of American prisoners of war and Americans missing in action in Southeast Asia. Continuing cooperation on these issues is on the top of my agenda for this trip."
If that is so, one expert said, Washington is tethering its future policies to an artifact of the past that has little bearing on current national interests. "Relations between America and Vietnam will not be normalized by Clinton's visit, because he continues to say that the M.I.A. issue is the top priority," said Carl A. Thayer of the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies in Honolulu. "There is no final answer here. What is a full Vietnamese accounting?"
No matter how much Vietnam cooperates, Mr. Thayer said, it will still be up to Washington to determine whether that cooperation is satisfactory. As long as that policy is in place, Mr. Thayer said, relations will remain on an unequal footing that is directly related to the war, no matter how much Mr. Clinton asserts that he is closing the door on the past.
A total of 1,992 Americans are listed as unaccounted-for from the Indochina war, including 1,499 in Vietnam. That overall number is down, from 2,583 in 1973, when the United States withdrew from Vietnam, two years before the Communist victory. Nearly half the recoveries have occurred during Mr. Clinton's terms.
In a recent interview, the American ambassador, Pete Peterson, praised Vietnamese cooperation in the search for missing service members and called it a model for cooperation in other fields.
Nobody knows how many Vietnamese soldiers are missing from the war. The common estimate is 300,000. In contrast with its intensive efforts to help locate America's missing, the government has no formal program to account for its own lost soldiers. More than 58,000 Americans and an estimated three million Vietnamese died in the war.
 During his stay here, which extends through Sunday, Mr. Clinton is widely expected to spend most of his time in Hanoi, departing for Ho Chi Minh City on Saturday. But he will also visit one of the sites where American investigators are continuing to search for remains, and he is expected attend a ceremony at which remains recovered at a recent excavation will be repatriated.
Pressing his agenda for the future, he is expected to meet with business leaders and to tour a container-loading complex in Ho Chi Minh City to underscore the importance of American hopes for increased trade.
When Mr. Clinton lifted a postwar trade embargo with Vietnam in 1994, foreign businesses rushed in to take advantage of new opportunities. Foreign investment reached a peak in 1996 and 1997 with pledges of up to $8 billion and an incoming cash flow of $2 billion a year. But red tape, corruption, capricious rules and a lack of transparency soon caused many of those businesses to give up hope. Foreign investment fell to a seven-year low last year, at $600 million.
The United States, where trade has been the great engine of growth for most other Asian economies, is the 10th leading investor in Vietnam, with two-way trade last year totaling less than $1 billion.
The signing of the trade agreement with the United States in July was a symbolic second chance. In return for access to American markets with the same low tariffs enjoyed by most other nations, Vietnam agreed to a painful series of free-market changes. They include a sharp reduction in trade barriers and increased protection for United States investment and intellectual property rights. The changes are scheduled to be instituted incrementally over seven years, an agonizingly slow pace for impatient investors.
But in principle, at least, the step has been taken. "The bilateral trade agreement, if carried out to its full extent, does in fact take them to a new threshold in the open market concept," Mr. Peterson said.
Those American businesses that have stuck it out in Vietnam voiced a new, slightly weary hope. "O.K., it's a seven-year time span for full implementation," said Sesto Vecchi, a corporate lawyer with long experience in Vietnam, "But there it is in black and white, and the clock is ticking."
The full installation of the changes may still be difficult, given what seem to be continuing doubts in the leadership here about the country's course. And Vietnam's record in fulfilling economic agreements has not been good.
"We are renovating, but we are determined not to change color," Le Kha Phieu, general secretary of the Communist Party, said this year.
The signing of the trade agreement is not necessarily a sign that reformers have won out and that the political course will be more liberal, said David Marr, a professor of history at Australian National University.
"Everything else I see in Vietnam would suggest otherwise," Professor Marr said. "That the moderates are not in the ascendancy and that security-minded people are still very strong at the top."
As Vietnam continues to try to reinvent its system, it struggles with the concern that a more open economy could threaten the Communist Party's grip on political control.
"The government's continuing anxiety in the face of dissent is in part a response to the pressures caused by opening up the economy to foreign investment," Human Rights Watch, the American rights group, said in a recent statement.
Mr. Clinton is generally expected to raise issues of human rights and religious freedom while he is here. In anticipation of that, the government has already rolled out its response -- that the United States has to do more to help overcome the effects of the war, including Hanoi's contention that thousands of people still suffer the effects of Agent Orange, the toxic defoliant.
But there seemed to be a pro forma tone to the sparring. Both sides seem eager to begin a new and more productive relationship.
Mr. Clinton's words today, on the eve of his visit, could have been spoken just as easily by an official here in Hanoi: "I don't see this so much as coming to terms with the past as moving toward the future."

Agency to Vote on Web Domain Names

BYLINE: By CHRIS GAITHER

DATELINE: MARINA DEL REY, Calif., Nov. 15

 BODY:
With the number of desirable Web addresses growing scarce, the board that administers Internet names prepared to issue the first viable competitor to the .com suffix in more than a decade today.
The board, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, known as Icann, is expected to select several proposals for new suffixes, called generic top-level domains, and the private companies that will manage them, on Thursday. Top contenders for new domains include .biz and .web. 
 Icann's board will also consider releasing new domains for personal use, like .i, and special-purpose use, like .union or .museum. Under the plans being considered, for example, a physician named John Doe could start a personal Web site at johndoe.nom and a site for his private medical practice at johndoe.health.
The decision by Icann, an agency created by the Clinton administration in 1998 to oversee the Internet's structure, will begin the largest structural change to the Internet since the late 1980's, when the last top-level generic domains were issued. While other domains, like .org and .net, were created to differentiate organizations, the distinctions have largely been lost as groups, commercial and otherwise, have rushed to stake out property in cyberspace. The .com domain is by far the most popular, with more than 20 million names already assigned.
As a result, a wide range of interest groups have descended upon the board meeting in this Los Angeles suburb, seeking to benefit from the registration rush that is expected to follow a new suffix release.
"People want something beyond .com," said Esther Dyson, chairwoman of the Icann board.
Applicants to manage the new domains, who are seeking to make millions of dollars registering domain names, came to pitch their business plans. Lawyers representing large corporations arrived to argue that their trademarks should receive special protection within the new domains. And consumer watchdog groups came to ensure that free speech and individual Web users were not forgotten.
Trying to placate these groups is Icann, which, since its creation, has faced a barrage of criticism over the way it makes decisions and elects its board.
A main issue for the board is whether the new domains will offer so-called sunrise periods, during which the companies seeking to protect their brands get the first choice to register.
Warning that it would select "only a few" domains, Icann solicited proposals for new suffixes in August and September. Nearly 50 companies paid the $50,000 required to submit applications. A team of technical, financial and legal advisers determined that 14 plans deserved consideration.
Among the companies that passed the first hurdle are Afilias, a consortium of 19 registrar companies that proposed .web and .info, and Novell, which proposed .dir as a directory of Web sites and e-mail addresses.
 The only domain hailed by the advising team as "interesting and innovative" was .geo, proposed by Stanford Research International. The domain would give companies domain names based on their geographic location.
Karl Auerbach, a Cisco Systems researcher, was recently elected to the Icann board, yet remains one of the agency's most vocal critics. Mr. Auerbach, whose term begins after the vote Thursday, asserted that Icann is trying to replace market competition, which should determine which domains succeed and fail.
"They're just suppressing innovation," he said in an interview. "If the Internet had to go through this process in 1974, it wouldn't have made it this far."
No matter what new domains are selected by Icann, the boundaries have already become hazy as a number of nations have turned their two-letter country-code domains into money-making commercial enterprises.
Economic Solutions, a St. Louis-based company, owns the rights to Belize's domain, .bz. The company recently asked a federal court to grant an injunction that would prohibit Icann from issuing .biz, arguing that the similarity of the two names infringes upon Economic Solutions' intellectual property rights. The court refused, but the threat of lawsuits still hangs over any decision Icann makes.
"This is really more complex than we all wanted to acknowledge," said a board member, Amadeu Abril i Abril. "But we need to make a decision tomorrow, and I think there are enough elements on the table."

HEADLINE: REPORTERS' NOTEBOOK;
An Oil Barony Knows How to Entertain Important Visitors

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei, Nov. 15

 BODY:
After hitting a rough patch for a few years, the sultan of Brunei is feeling pretty good again.
Oil prices are back up, bringing smiles throughout this corner of Borneo, where people were talking for a while about finding another line of work. Sure, Bill Gates may still hold the sultan's old title -- world's richest man -- but the plunge in Microsoft stock has not exactly gone unnoticed here. 
 And it appears that the courts are finally settling all those cases involving the sultan's playboy brother, Prince Jefri, who managed to spend $2.7 billion of the family's cash on aircraft, yachts, fancy cars and jewelry. Along the way he generated some rather unpleasant headlines and was sued by a former Miss America who said she had been held against her will in the Royal Palace, which she described as a 1,700-room bordello.
But all that was forgotten this afternoon as the sultan, known among his subjects as His Majesty Haji Hassanal Bolkiah, bounced on his toes and, one by one, welcomed the leaders of more than half of the world's people to his modest land.
He looked like a salesman who couldn't believe his luck: all of his best customers had just dropped in, and tonight they were coming over for dinner. There was Bill Clinton and Vladimir Putin, chatting in the hallway of a huge meeting center that the sultan had built just for the occasion, an Asian summit meeting with the thinnest of agendas. Over in the corner was China's president, Jiang Zemin, and the latest winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea.
Most dignitaries pulled up in some of the 493 luxury cars purchased for the occasion by the sultan's nephew, who is planning to resell them afterward.
It proved once again that this is first and foremost a family business, one that counts among its assets a farm in Australia that is larger than this country itself and hotels from Rodeo Drive to Park Avenue to Park Lane. Oh, and a seat at the United Nations.
 
This Isn't Florida
"I can safely predict that this will be my last APEC summit," President Clinton declared this morning, using the acronym for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. "I just don't know who will be here next year."
That did not stop many of his fellow leaders from asking, including several who probably feel a lot better today about holding one-party elections, or no elections at all. Mr. Clinton said late this afternoon, at the beginning of a meeting with Mr. Kim, that "I told them it would all be worked out." Presumably that was easier than explaining in detail the laws governing recounts in the state of Florida.
Most of Asia's leaders seemed satisfied with Mr. Clinton's vague optimism -- at least in public. Except, of course, for the Malaysians. They have resented American lectures about Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's treatment of those who challenge his power, starting with his jailing of the former finance minister and deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim.
Dr. Mahathir's sharp-tongued trade minister, Rafidah Aziz, who once called Vice President Al Gore "disgusting" for his support of pro-democracy protesters in Kuala Lumpur, couldn't resist inserting the needle.
"We are very puzzled how the great democracy can get into such a mess," she said. "Maybe we, all developing countries, should send an election watch every time they have a presidential election."
Of course, elections are not a pressing problem for the sultan. His family has been running this territory, which is roughly the size of Delaware, for 600 years.
To avoid challenges to his power, he turned the country into what Asian neighbors call the "Shellfare state," because Shell Oil is one of the many oil companies whose operations here pay for the country's universal health care system. Prescription drugs included.
 
Polo, Anyone?
Not surprisingly, Prince Jefri is nowhere to be found this week. But the summit meeting is a tribute to his profligacy.
When President Clinton spoke this morning inside the gleaming Empire Hotel, he looked around in marvel. "Now this is an amazing place," the president said of the marbled hotel, which has a soaring six-story atrium and floor-to-ceiling windows that offer a sweeping view of the deep-blue sea.
Bruneians use the same adjective, but not happily. Prince Jefri spent $800 million on the hotel -- ripping out the marble floor after he decided he didn't like the color, according to some accounts -- before the sultan pulled the plug.
But there is a silver lining in all that waste: without it, there is no way a country this small could hold a summit meeting this big. Reporters are being housed in a sports complex the prince helped build for the 1999 Southeast Asian Games.
He also constructed a vast polo club, with a vaulted gold ceiling. It will serve on Thursday as the site of a "leaders' retreat," a nice place to paper over the leaders' widening disagreements on a new round of global trade negotiations.
 
It Takes a Sultan
Asked this morning about his plans after Jan. 20, Mr. Clinton made a strong case for his need to start producing some serious revenue flow. "Now I have a United States senator to support," he said. "I understand that's an expensive proposition."

HEADLINE: Peru Opposition Picks Successor for Fujimori's Ally in Congress

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, Nov. 15

 BODY:
Two days after ousting a head of Congress loyal to President Alberto K. Fujimori, opposition lawmakers named their candidate today to lead the legislature, threatening to undermine further Mr. Fujimori's fading hold on power.
Also today, the police used tear gas to disperse hundreds of leftist-led construction workers who were demonstrating outside the Government Palace. The protesters carried an effigy with two heads, Mr. Fujimori's and that of the former spy chief, Vladimiro Montesinos, in a cage. Tear gas canisters flew after some protesters, carrying wood poles and shouting, "There is no president!" charged at the police. 
 The demonstration was held after opposition parties agreed to put forward Congressman Valentin Paniagua to replace Martha Hildebrandt, who was voted out as president of Congress, 64 to 51. Mr. Paniagua will face Congressman Ricardo Marcenaro, the candidate for Mr. Fujimori's Peru 2000 Party, in a vote scheduled for Thursday. If the opposition gains control of Congress, that would will be the first time since 1992 that Mr. Fujimori did not dominate the body.
A representative of a small opposition party said Mr. Fujimori had applied for political asylum in Malaysia after his arrival today in Brunei for the meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group.
Second Vice President Ricardo Marquez, who is now in charge of the government, denied the allegation, by Jose Barba Caballero, a leader of the Avancemos Party.
Agriculture Minister Jose Chlimper told a radio station, Radioprogramas, that Mr. Fujimori was planning to fly home early from Brunei to end the uncertainty. Mr. Chlimper said he had called Brunei and spoke to Mr. Fujimori's personal military attache, who said the president was resting, but gave specific instructions to deny the asylum rumor. Mr. Chlimper said Mr. Fujimori was planning to return through Tokyo. His arrival time was not specified.
Mr. Fujimori announced in September that he would step down in July after new elections in the wake of a corruption scandal that erupted around Mr. Montesinos. But pressure is building for Mr. Fujimori to step aside sooner as reports of Mr. Montesinos's misdeeds mount. The scandal surrounding Mr. Montesinos, who remains a fugitive, began with a leaked videotape in September that showed him apparently bribing an opposition congressman.
Mr. Montesinos is under investigation for laundering at least $58 million in foreign bank accounts. He faces criminal complaints here that include directing state-sponsored death squads and skimming profits from the narcotics trade in his 10 years as Mr. Fujimori's top aide.
Mr. Paniagua, a moderate, said if he became leader of the 120-member legislature, there would be no rush to force Mr. Fujimori from office on grounds of "moral incapacity," as permitted by the Constitution.
"That is a theme that must be played out with the utmost caution," he said, "taking into account the grave repercussions that this can lead to in the political stability of any country."
Two of Mr. Fujimori's top ministers said he might not remain in the presidency until July. Finance Minister Carlos Bolona was widely quoted in newspapers as saying the crisis would make it difficult for Mr. Fujimori to remain until July.
Prime Minister Federico Salas agreed, saying in a radio interview, "The political scene is so unstable in Peru that I would not rule out anything at this moment."

Is the Jazz Really Jazz in Harlem Without the Locals?

BYLINE: By LYNDA RICHARDSON

 BODY:
Around midnight, the jazz was live and straight-up in the Zebra Room of the Lenox Lounge, the legendary Art Deco nightclub in Harlem. Cocktail glasses clinked around tiny candle-lit cafe tables. The jazz vocalist, leaning against the baby grand, hushed the room with a big soprano voice that was like a soft, strong wind.
These should be heady days for the club's owner, Alvin M. Reed Sr. Since the lounge reopened in April after eight months of renovations, the night spot has been featured in national magazines like The New Yorker and Esquire. The club appeared in this summer's remake of "Shaft." And on weekends, a steady procession of jazz patrons makes its way past the bustling bar to the back room, with its black-and-white hide walls. 
 Yet Mr. Reed is upset. The owner, who is African-American, is wondering how in the world he can persuade local residents to visit his club in the heart of Harlem, in the trumpeted capital of black America, to listen to jazz. He says he is not hurting financially, but he is hurting in his heart.
"It's been 100 percent white on certain nights," said Mr. Reed, who was born in Richmond, Va., in 1939, the same year that the original Lenox Lounge was built, but grew up and was married in Harlem. "I thought I was bringing jazz back to Harlem for black folks. I thought I would bring out a lot of locals. I don't want to become a tourist place."
As Harlem has spruced up storefronts and streets in an economic rebirth that has been called its Second Renaissance, Mr. Reed's problem reflects in many ways the neighborhood's hopes and anxieties. Though the nightclub owner wants very much to attract outsiders -- and their dollars -- to Harlem, he does not want his club to lack authenticity, to become a kind of "Harlem lite" joint that has no soul.
There is no simple explanation for the jazz crowd's makeup at the Lenox Lounge. Economics is probably part of it. (The lounge's cover charge for jazz is $15 on Friday and Saturday nights.) It also may be an issue of marketing and promotion.
Lloyd A. Williams, president of the Greater Harlem Chamber of Commerce, is convinced that some Harlem residents may be wary of the club's location on Lenox Avenue between 124th and 125th streets, a stretch that he said was no longer treacherous.
"It was predominated by drugs until very, very recently," Mr. Williams said. "The Europeans and the Asians who are coming don't know any of that. So what we need to do is to reach out to the people in our community and say, 'Hey, it's happening again.' "
Still, many jazz musicians, bartenders and club owners in Harlem say the links between jazz and blacks have diminished, even as much of the best jazz continues to be made by black musicians.
Musicians like Bill Saxton, an African-American saxophonist who played on a recent Friday night at St. Nick's Pub in Harlem, is surprised that Mr. Reed is surprised.
"If it wasn't for white people, we wouldn't be able to work at all," said Mr. Saxton, navigating the smoky basement club and its racially mixed audience to the small stage, where a large portrait of Miles Davis was draped like a national flag. The saxophonist said many black jazz patrons turned to other music forms with the advent of bebop in the late 1940's. Dance halls gave way to intimate clubs and smaller jazz bands, geared for listening instead of dancing as in the preceding big-band era.
"When jazz became art music in the late 40's and early 50's, we lost a lot of black people to rhythm and blues," Mr. Saxton said.
David Levering Lewis, the author of "When Harlem Was in Vogue," (Penguin, 1997), said jazz appeared to have taken on a patina similar to classical music's. "It's so established and so mannered," he said. "It just may not have the grab. But it's a tribute to the art form that it belongs to nobody and to everybody."
Michael Henry Adams, a historian and preservationist in Harlem, has been a harsh critic of some revitalization efforts there. He derides the new shopping plaza on 125th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard called Harlem U.S.A., which includes a Magic Johnson multiplex, a Disney store and an HMV record store, as "Las Vegas imported to Harlem."
Yet, Mr. Adams is sanguine about the Lenox Lounge. He said that the Harlem Renaissance, the explosion of cultural life that began in the 1920's, could not have been accomplished without the patronage of whites who flocked nightly to Harlem.
"Even if the Lenox Lounge becomes a venue where busloads of whites come nightly, ultimately that kind of popularity is going to cause more black people to come, as well," Mr. Adams said. "It's nothing very different from the whole history of Harlem, particularly entertainment in Harlem."
On a recent weekend at the Lenox Lounge, the audience for jazz was about 60 percent white on Friday night and 85 percent white on Saturday. The customers came from as far away as Istanbul, Berlin and Japan.
At times, the owner said, white patrons and tour guides have grumbled about the complexion of the crowd.
"A lot of whites are very disappointed because they are coming for our culture," said Mr. Reed, a retired police officer and postal worker who bought the club in 1988. "They want to see how we pop our fingers and get with it, and they get in here, look around and it's nothing but white folks."
The irony is not lost on Mr. Reed. The Lenox Lounge was conceived as a fancy place for white patrons when it opened in 1942, though famous black entertainers and celebrities frequented it. Billie Holiday had a regular table. Louis Armstrong stopped by. So did Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Ella Fitzgerald and James Baldwin.
"It was the bar for the elite," said Dominic Greco, 81, who was a young bartender when the lounge opened and a nephew of Ralph Greco, who was then the owner. "They were the only ones who could afford the prices."
The Lenox Lounge has operated nearly nonstop since its grand opening more than half a century ago. Mr. Reed resurrected jazz at the club three years ago, after it went through a hugely popular disco phase. Now, with Harlem's night life heating up and the crime rate down, Mr. Reed wants his neighbors to embrace his labor of love. (He invested $200,000 and got a loan for $550,000 from the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone.)
Observing the late-night scene, a glass of chilled chardonnay in hand, Mr. Reed said he was considering knocking on doors in Harlem and asking, "What gives?" He said he might start at Lenox Terrace, an apartment complex about 10 blocks north at 135th Street, where a number of leading black politicians and professionals live in luxury high-rise buildings.
"Is it that you don't go out anymore?" Mr. Reed said he would ask. "Is it a financial thing? Are younger blacks not into jazz history? I want some questions answered. You don't have to come. Just explain to me. I am confused."
The other evening, the jazz vocalist Melba Joyce, in a glittery caftan, was raising the microphone high and scatting in the tradition of Sarah Vaughan. But Ms. Joyce's voice had to compete with the jukebox in the boisterous bar, which was cranking out James Brown and other rhythm-and-blues tunes.
The lounge's bar and the Zebra Room are like two distinct clubs, separated by swinging glass doors. The bar has mostly black customers.
Mr. Reed is not convinced that the $15 cover charge accounts for the makeup of the crowd in the Zebra Room. He said he had watched some bar regulars, who profess to love jazz, run up bar tabs of $60 to $70, without so much as a peek into the Zebra Room.
He has his theories. He is embarrassed to say that his 35-year-old son, Alvin Jr., the lounge's general manager, told him that he disliked jazz; he's into hip-hop. (Mr. Reed told his son to keep it to himself.)
Between sets the other night, Mr. Reed was joined at a table by Ms. Joyce, a Harlem resident, who performed once with Louis Armstrong and appeared in the Broadway musical "Black and Blue."
"I think we take our music for granted," said Ms. Joyce, shrugging. "The music belongs to black people. We're born into it."
At another table, an elegant young black couple, Pascally Toussaint and Edward Davis, were settling into their chairs. They, too, were struck by the large number of whites. Ms. Toussaint, an aspiring Haitian-American singer in her mid-20's, said she had only recently learned of the Lenox Lounge from Ms. Joyce, who was her instructor at a gospel singing workshop. Ms. Toussaint suggested that the club get a better promoter, perhaps bring in a jazz-inflected hip-hop performer like Erykah Badu, and lose some of the jazz standards.
"Maybe they should do a spoken-word night," offered her friend, Mr. Davis, an African-American record producer and musician whose long dreadlocks were bundled inside a knit cap. "A lot of blacks are into that."
A burly bass player, Wayne Batchelor, from the jazz trio pulled up a chair during a break. He said the jazz scene in Harlem was a novelty for many whites, but not for blacks.
"If you have lived in Harlem all of your life and jazz has been on your corner, it just blends into the whole landscape," said Mr. Batchelor, a black Londoner. "In general, the black population has turned away from what was culturally theirs in the first place."
In a darkened corner of the Zebra Room that night, Tommy Tomita, a tour guide, swayed to the jazz, his eyes closed. Mr. Tomita, who lives in Harlem, takes small groups of Japanese tourists on what he calls "Harlem Soul Tours." The Lenox Lounge was just one stop. The tourists listened appreciatively and snapped pictures of one another before moving on.
Mr. Tomita said his group did not expect to see so many white customers. "The image is maybe all black people," he said. But he had a few other places in mind. He mentioned a little soul food restaurant at 116th Street, between Lenox and Seventh Avenues, called Amy Ruth's, where there would be a sea of black faces.

HEADLINE: Presidential Journey to Vietnam

 BODY:
The last American president to visit Vietnam was Richard Nixon, who traveled to the South Vietnamese capital of Saigon in 1969, at the height of a war that eventually took 58,000 American and three million Vietnamese lives. Today, Bill Clinton begins a three-day trip to Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, as Saigon is now called. Mr. Clinton's visit is striking evidence of how far the two countries have moved beyond the rancor of that conflict. But if a healthy new relationship is to be built, Hanoi must ease bureaucratic restrictions on foreign investment and show greater respect for the civil and religious liberties of its people.
Mr. Clinton's itinerary inevitably looks back to war-related issues, like repatriating the remains of Americans lost in action and helping remove land mines still buried in Vietnamese soil. But he should also use his visit to press for a faster pace of political and economic reform. 
 Much has changed in Vietnam over the past three decades. Most of its 79 million people have been born since the war ended, and younger Vietnamese, in particular, look admiringly upon American prosperity and personal freedoms. While the Communist party still jealously monopolizes government power and public political debate, ordinary Vietnamese are no longer afraid to talk about politics in private.
But anyone who speaks out for more accountable government or wider freedom faces stern repression. Hanoi continues to jail open critics, persecute religious believers, censor newspapers, restrict the Internet and otherwise suppress dissent.
 It routinely violates provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which it acceded in 1982, guaranteeing freedom of expression, association and religious belief and prohibiting arbitrary detentions.
After a disastrous decade of trying to impose North Vietnam's austere and repressive Communism on the more freewheeling South, the country's leaders reversed course in the late 1980's and began encouraging Southern style entrepreneurship. But over the past three years, Vietnam's program of market liberalization has stalled as the country's political leaders have grown concerned about decentralizing economic power. Foreign investors have become frustrated with the Vietnam's bureaucratic hurdles and have taken their investments to China and other Southeast Asian nations.
When Mr. Clinton talks to university students in Hanoi on Friday he should speak plainly about the merits of human rights, democracy, free markets and the rule of law, as he did during his 1998 trip to China. He also needs to raise these issues in his discussions with government and Communist Party leaders as well.
 Establishing firm legal protections for Vietnamese-Americans who want to return home to do business should be an important part of his agenda. He would also do well to follow the advice of Senator John McCain and others and seek to expand legal exchange programs to cover press and human rights issues as well as commercial law.
By opening Vietnam's markets, the Clinton administration believes that it is paving the way for eventual steps toward greater political freedom. The president's visit is an excellent opportunity to press for a faster pace of change.

HEADLINE: Tolls May Rise For Rush Hour Across Hudson

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is considering a plan that could double the basic fare on the PATH train to $2 from $1 and increase tolls at several bridges and tunnels to $7 from $4 during rush hours, officials said yesterday.
The increases, which would be the first for the PATH train since 1987 and the first for the bridges and tunnels since 1991, have been discussed by top officials in both states since at least the summer, when Gov. George E. Pataki of New York and Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey settled a longstanding feud over the operations of the Port Authority, a fight that had stalled billions of dollars in projects for both states. 
 One of the sticking points in that dispute was a contention by New York officials that the Port Authority had oversubsidized the PATH train for too many years, providing a disproportionate benefit to New Jersey residents, who are its primary users. And that benefit, New York officials said, was just one example among many of how New Jersey received more than its share of funds from the bistate agency.
The proposed increases, which could be subject to extensive changes after they are presented to the Port Authority's board members for the first time today, would affect the Holland Tunnel, Lincoln Tunnel, George Washington Bridge, Bayonne Bridge, Goethals Bridge and the Outerbridge Crossing, where round-trip tolls are now $4. The agency collects about 350,000 tolls at its bridges and tunnels each weekday.
According to the proposal, the bridge and tunnel tolls would rise to $7 during rush hours, which could end up being defined during the morning as 6 to 10 a.m. The tolls would then drop to a slightly lower price, except for the evening rush hours. E-ZPass users would also get some type of discount. And trucks, which pay substantially more than cars at the tollbooth, would be given large discounts for traveling late at night, in an effort to relieve the grinding congestion that trucks can cause at the Hudson River crossings during the day.
The proposal would also double the PATH train fare to $2 for passengers who pay with cash, but for those who use the QuickCard, which allows multiple trips, the fare would be $1.50 or slightly less depending on the number of trips on the card. There are about 240,000 riders each weekday.
The extra money from the increase would be a welcome infusion for New York State, where voters rejected a bond issue on Election Day that would have paid for several huge transportation projects. But yesterday it was hard to find a commuter who thought the plan was a good idea.
"I think that's a pretty big increase," said Bethany Grohs, 30, who was on her way home to Westfield, N.J., last night at the PATH station at the World Trade Center. "So many other things are overpriced, it's nice to have something like this that's only a dollar."
Joe Garcia, who was driving a van at the Canal Street entrance to the Holland Tunnel, said: "You're kidding. That's crazy. That's a terrible idea."
His passenger, Eric Acevedo, leaned over and said, "It's going to be congested regardless of how much you pay."
The main purpose of the increases would be to help the Port Authority pay for its ambitious capital plans, which could cost as much as $13 billion over the next five years for a range of projects that include buying new PATH trains, repairing bridges and tunnels and making extensive rail, port and airport improvements.
"When you're talking about a major five-year capital plan, obviously a critical part of the discussion is, 'How is this going to be financed?' " said Charles A. Gargano, vice chairman of the Port Authority, who confirmed yesterday that the agency would present a toll and fare increase plan to the board. It is unknown how much support for the plan exists in the two governors' offices, but it is unlikely that the proposal would have advanced this far without some agreement in principle.
Another idea behind the plan is to try to use the increases creatively to fight congestion, which officials from both states estimate costs the region several billion dollars a year. A related goal is to try to bring both the tolls and the PATH fare more into parity with what is charged for tolls and mass transit elsewhere in the metropolitan region, officials said. For example, the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority charges $7 for a round trip on its bridges and tunnels around the city, including the Triborough Bridge, the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge, the Queens-Midtown Tunnel and the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel.
The standard subway fare in New York City is $1.50, with discounts for MetroCard users. And Port Authority officials said structuring the fare increase the way they have proposed for the PATH could lay the early groundwork for combining MetroCard and QuickCard so that one card would work in both transit systems some day.
That kind of merging of regional transit systems is one that many economists and transportation experts have been urging for more than a decade. "This would be long overdue," said Robert Yaro, executive director of the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit group specializing in transportation and planning issues. "We see this as a regional transportation system and having a big difference on one side of the river really doesn't seem to make any sense."
Port Authority officials stressed yesterday that any increases would be considered by the Port Authority's 12-member board only as part of its overall discussions about the agency's capital plan. If the capital plan eventually adopted by the board were trimmed, the political justification for fare and toll increases would be weaker and the increases would probably be less, the officials said.
Under one scenario, the toll and fare increases would generate an extra $120 million a year for the agency, which would be split so that New York State would receive something more than half.
That would be good news for New York State officials, who are trying to find the money to pay for several projects that would have been aided by the failed $3.8 billion transportation bond act. Among the projects that bond money would have gone to support was a connection to Grand Central Terminal for the Long Island Rail Road and initial work on a Second Avenue subway line.
Michael McKeon, a spokesman for Governor Pataki, said the administration had not been briefed on any toll or fare increase proposals, and he stressed that any plan was, at this point, something that existed only on a Port Authority staff level. "We can't comment on what we haven't seen," Mr. McKeon said.
Laura Otterbourg, a spokeswoman for Governor Whitman, said last evening that Mrs. Whitman has "neither been briefed nor signed off on any toll increase." Robert E. Boyle,
the executive director of the Port Authority, did not return a call to his office seeking comment.
While the fare on the PATH train can be raised by a vote of the authority's board, the bridge and tunnel toll increases require public hearings before any vote. Officials said those hearings could be held in December and January if the board agreed to pursue a toll increase.
Board members will meet today only to get the plans for an increases and to discuss them, not to vote. But Mr. Gargano said that while Port Authority board members had not seen the proposal, he believed that they all understood the need for some kind of increases.
"These things have been too low for too long," he said.

MANHATTAN: TAX CUT APPROVED -- The New York City Council voted 39 to 3 yesterday to approve a reduction in the city's personal income tax that would save taxpayers an average of $52 a year. The cut is much smaller than the one proposed by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani nearly a year ago. It was scaled back by the mayor and the Council because of concern that the larger cut might have left the city with budget deficits. It would take effect in January.

BROOKLYN: REDEVELOPMENT DRIVE -- High costs and a shortage of available office space are hurting Brooklyn's economic development, Mark Green, the public advocate, left, said yesterday. Overall business costs are lower and incentives are higher in northern New Jersey than in Brooklyn, said Mr. Green, who plans to run for mayor. To encourage economic growth, Mr. Green recommended a wide-ranging development corporation. He also called for a technology zone in which private companies would receive tax incentives to create jobs and businesses. He said state and local officials should cut taxes, provide incentives for residential development, and build a trolley loop to connect downtown Brooklyn with other neighborhoods.

MANHATTAN: BUS LINE SUES CITY -- New York Apple Tours has filed a lawsuit charging city officials with trying to destroy the company. The tour company asserts in the suit, filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, that since the summer the city has harassed the company through selective and unfair law enforcement while trying "to inflict maximum harm." Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the city's Department of Consumer Affairs, the State Department of Motor Vehicles and 10 "John Does" who are city and state employees are named as defendants. The company's court papers say the city's actions stem from an accident on May 22 in which a pedestrian was killed by an Apple Tours bus. (AP)
 
MANHATTAN: SUIT IN DISAPPEARANCE -- The father of Etan Patz, who disappeared in SoHo as a 6-year-old in 1979, plans a wrongful-death civil suit against the prime suspect in the case, Jose A. Ramos. A search of a Lower East Side apartment in June failed to link Mr. Ramos to the disappearance. Yesterday, Mr. Patz signed legal papers in preparation for a suit in civil court. Brian O'Dwyer, Mr. Patz's lawyer, said a criminal indictment of Mr. Ramos was "becoming less and less likely." (NYT)
 
WHITE PLAINS: NOT GUILTY PLEAS -- Patrick Baxter, 31, pleaded not guilty yesterday to 15 counts of second-degree murder in the deaths of three young women in Westchester County more than a decade ago. He was also accused of sexually assaulting all three victims and robbing two of them, said Jeanine F. Pirro, the Westchester district attorney. Mrs. Pirro said there was no obvious motive for the slayings, which were only recently linked to Mr. Baxter by DNA tests. Mr. Baxter, imprisoned for an unrelated offense, would have been eligible for parole next year. David W. Chen (NYT)
 
HAUPPAUGE: SWINDLING INDICTMENT -- Christopher Rocancourt, the confidence man who spent the summer in the Hamptons posing as a Rockefeller and who is accused of swindling the well-to-do out of nearly $250,000, was indicted in absentia in Suffolk County Court yesterday. Mr. Rocancourt left the country last month, and the judge issued a bench warrant for his arrest. Mr. Rocancourt's aide, Dante J. Daniello, was in court and was charged with 13 crimes, including grand larceny and false impersonation. Bail was set at $1,500. According to the indictment, Mr. Daniello, 52, helped Mr. Rocancourt defraud investors.

MANHATTAN: FINAL N.Y.U. UNION VOTE -- When the National Labor Relations Board counted votes last week to determine whether graduate students at New York University wanted the United Auto Workers as a bargaining agent for a new union of teaching and research assistants, some ballots were in dispute. On Monday, N.Y.U. and the students agreed to count 155 of the 295 disputed votes. Yesterday, a final tally showed the winning margin for the auto workers had narrowed from 179 votes to 68. The final tally is 619 to 551. Karen W. Arenson (NYT)
 
NEW JERSEY
 
ELIZABETH: SCOOTER LAW PASSED -- Elizabeth has become the third town to require kickboard scooter riders to wear a helmet, nearly two months after a 6-year-old boy was killed when he rode his scooter into traffic. The City Council approved the measure Tuesday night, and Mayor J. Christian Bollwage has said he will sign it. The measure, which applies to adults and children, was introduced Sept. 12, 10 days before the boy, Andy Pino, died after being struck by a car outside his home. He was not wearing a helmet. (AP)
 
JACKSON: TIGER AREA THREATENED -- Joan Byron-Marasek, left, known as the Tiger Lady, is fighting a possible government shutdown of her tiger preserve. Valter H. Must, her lawyer, said yesterday that he would fight a violation order filed last week by the State Department of Environmental Protection for unrefrigerated deer carcasses and failure to prevent tigers from breeding. The state has been trying to shut down her tiger preserve in Jackson Township since last year, when the state contended that one of her tigers escaped. The state had given Mrs. Byron-Marasek until Saturday to file a plan for the removal of her 20 tigers, or face closure of her preserve. But Mr. Must said he would seek a stay from an appellate court. Maria Newman (NYT)
 
ATLANTIC CITY: CAESAR'S CHIEF RESIGNS -- Two days before a hearing on his license renewal application, Gary DiBartolomeo, the president of Caesars Atlantic City Hotel Casino, announced his resignation. Investigators recommended last month that the State Casino Control Commission reject the renewal application of Mr. DiBartolomeo, who has acknowledged being a compulsive gambler. He had promised not to gamble, but then posted $389,000 in gambling debts in one 18-month period. In a statement, Mr. DiBartolomeo said he wanted to be treated for his gambling. Caesar's owner, Park Place Entertainment of Las Vegas, named as a successor Paul Henderson, president of Atlantic City Hilton Casino Resort. Steve Strunsky (NYT)
 
CONNECTICUT
 
STAMFORD: SKAKEL SEPARATION -- Michael C. Skakel, the Kennedy relative charged in the 1975 murder of Martha Moxley, has separated from his wife, Margot, who filed to divorce him last month after nine years of marriage. A Juvenile Court judge in Stamford is now deciding whether Mr. Skakel, 40, will be tried for murder as an adult. He was 15 years old when Miss Moxley, his neighbor, was found bludgeoned to death in Greenwich. Mr. Skakel's defense lawyer, Michael Sherman, made no mention of the marital separation at a court hearing late last month, but confirmed it yesterday after it was reported in The New York Post. Mr. Sherman said the Skakels, who have a 2-year-old son, were working toward an amicable settlement.

NORWICH: DEVELOPMENT PLAN SET -- A Boston-based development company will market the former site of a state mental hospital to corporations around the world as the Brewster Point Corporate Center. The company, Spaulding & Slye Colliers International, which has been hired by the state to lure high-tech businesses to the 470-acre site, presented its marketing plan on Tuesday.(AP)

Navajo Birth Is a Surprise For a Jew

BYLINE: By Neil Genzlinger

 BODY:
With more dot-coms dropping into the dustbin every day, it's nice to get an occasional reminder that the Internet isn't completely useless, and "The Lost Child," Sunday's movie on CBS, provides one.
As it has for many others, the Internet lets Rebecca, the centerpiece of this tale, find someone with whom she had lost touch. The someone is herself: she grew up in a Jewish household on the East Coast but learns through a Web posting that she is a Navajo and has an extended family in Arizona. 
 The premise might sound improbable except that "The Lost Child" is inspired by a true story, the autobiography "Looking for Lost Bird," written by Yvette Melanson with Claire Safran. In fact, from snippets of dialogue in the film we learn that stealing and selling Indian children was not uncommon just after World War II.
But "The Lost Child" is not a documentary, and anyone wanting to know more about this tantalizing subject will have to look elsewhere. So will anyone craving one of those adoptee-reunion tales that end with the separated family members' finally meeting and sharing a joyous hug. The reunion is just the beginning of this story, which tells what happens when Rebecca, nicely played by Mercedes Ruehl, tries to return to her Navajo roots and drag her skeptical family with her.
Karen Arthur, the director, and Sally Beth Robinson, who wrote the teleplay (taking considerable latitude with Ms. Melanson's book), try to walk a precarious line between compelling story and sentimental mush, with only partial success. The dialogue frequently veers toward the maudlin with phrases that ring as if they were plucked from a "1,000 lines you can use in your screenplay" book. ("When my mother died, I couldn't cry." "I don't know why I walk the path I walk; I only know I have to.") Drippy music adds to the problem.
Yet there are intelligent decisions in evidence as well. One was to make Rebecca's Jewish upbringing a minor factor once she reaches Navajo land; there are no silly scenes of her trying to teach the Indians to braid a nice challah.
Another was to take an oblique, understated approach to the well-known problems of American Indian life, like alcoholism and unemployment. It would have been easy to have a stereotypical Indian drunk stagger through a few frames. Instead there is a quick, telling scene between Jack (Jamey Sheridan), Rebecca's very white husband, and Eddie (Michael Greyeyes), her newfound brother-in-law. Jack, who was a bartender in his younger days, is embarrassed because he has failed to recognize Eddie even though they have already met once. "Sorry," Jack says, "I'm lousy with faces; must be getting old, I guess. I used to remember everybody's name, everybody's face, everybody's drink." His look as he stops himself short, realizing his gaffe, and the glare that Mr. Greyeyes gives him say all that needs to be said.
It's too bad that such moments of honesty are matched by ones not as credible. Rebecca's father (Ned Romero) and aunt (Tantoo Cardinal) are pleasant to listen to at first, but after a while it's like a two-hour session with Yoda; they speak in nonstop aphorisms that surely misrepresent the way older American Indians actually communicate. Similarly, although the film bravely dashes Rebecca's idyllic initial impressions of Indian life -- Navajo, it turns out, have their own racist and sexist streaks -- in the end a cute horse makes everyone forget all their troubles.
Still, for those with a high tolerance for sentiment, "The Lost Child" has enough rewards to be worth the trip, not the least of which is the chance to watch American Indian actors in substantive roles. It's an educational exercise as well, assuming that the depiction of Navajo life is somewhat accurate. It's even humorous at times: "Mom," Rebecca's elder daughter (Julia McIlvaine) complains after being dragged out of bed to experience a sunrise, "we are only half Navajo, and the white half needs more sleep."
In fact, an enterprising network executive could do worse than to jettison some of the junk on the current prime-time schedule and turn this into a series. When "The Lost Child" is over, viewers are left thinking it would be interesting to check in on Rebecca and family at some future date to see how their grand experiment is progressing.

'A Class Act' Is Moving Up

BYLINE: By Jesse McKinley

 BODY:
After more than a decade in the works, the ascent of "A Class Act" to Broadway appears to be complete.
Producers of the musical, which opened to generally good reviews at the Manhattan Theater Club on Nov. 9, said this week that they would move the show to Broadway in February, probably to the Ambassador Theater. Previews are to begin on Feb. 14, with an opening in March. 
 Marty Bell, who has been associated with the musical since the beginning, said the decision was made almost immediately after the opening. "We feel the critics said the kind of things we wanted them to say," Mr. Bell said. "And we think there's a place out there for this show."
"A Class Act" is based on the life and times of Ed Kleban, the Tony Award-winning lyricist of "A Chorus Line," who died of cancer in 1987. Mr. Bell said that on the very day Mr. Kleban died, he approached the writer's longtime girlfriend, Linda Kline, and told her, "We're going to get Ed's music out there."
That promise did not reach fruition quickly. The piece, which is directed by Lonny Price and stars him, worked its way through several incarnations before picking up steam in recent years. Arielle Tepper and Chase Mishkin joined Mr. Bell on the production team.
Detractors might say that the producers' love of Mr. Kleban and his story has clouded their judgment, since the show's reviews were good but not perfect. Typical was the one in The New York Times, in which Bruce Weber called the musical "a polished, frequently charming work" but questioned its appeal beyond aficonados of quirky theatrical tales.
Mr. Bell dismissed those concerns. "It's a very emotional show," he said. "And we think that anyone who sees it, feels it."
 
'Bells' Tinkling
 "Bells Are Ringing" is thinking smaller. The musical revival, starring Faith Prince as a muselike switchboard operator, had been scheduled to open at the 1,752-seat Broadway Theater, home of the soon-to-close "Miss Saigon." But now the musical is headed to the 1,079-seat Plymouth, home of the soon-to-close "Jekyll and Hyde."
The economics of the move are intriguing. "Bells," directed by Tina Landau, faces a much lower potential gross at the Plymouth because it has fewer seats. Producers of "Jekyll" cited the limited capacity last week in explaining their struggles to recoup that show's $7 million investment. (Mind you, the show also received unflattering reviews.)
Mitchell Maxwell, the lead producer, said he was unconcerned by the smaller house and added that the move had lowered the show's capitalization to some $5.8 million from $6.6 million because the scale of sets and other design elements would shrink. He said the transfer also made creative sense. "The show was originally conceived to be in a more intimate home," he said.
Mr. Mitchell also confirmed that Marc Kudisch would join the cast as Ms. Prince's love interest. Mr. Kudisch is now in "Thoroughly Modern Millie," another musical headed for Broadway, at the La Jolla Playhouse in California. Rehearsals for "Bells" are to begin in January, after "Millie's" California run ends.
The shift to the Plymouth may open the door at the Broadway for a possible run of "Blast!," a brassy musical revue of the miracles of the marching band, though a spokesman could not confirm that.
 
Liev Schreiber's Roles
When Liev Schreiber was growing up on the Lower East Side, he was a self-described Shakespeare geek, the "obnoxious kid who raised his hand to read in English class."
That may not have won him fans back then, but Mr. Schreiber's more recent efforts at acting, as the heartstruck seducer in a revival of Harold Pinter's "Betrayal" at the Roundabout Theater Company, are winning him some of the best reviews of the season. Not that he has seen them; Mr. Schreiber says he tries not to read reviews until the run is over.
"I love to read them later," he said in a interview at the American Airlines Theater. "But I can kind of tell how they went by the way the cast reacts to me when I come in." (With that, a press agent shouted "Congratulations!," and Mr. Schreiber said, "Thanks," and shrugged.)
The son of a part-time actor and an artistic mother who sometimes drove a cab, Mr. Schreiber attended Brooklyn Tech High School before being accepted by the Yale School of Drama. After graduation he returned to New York City, appearing in a few Off Broadway plays.
It was in another Pinter play, the Roundabout's 1995 production of "Moonlight," that Mr. Schreiber broke through, getting strong reviews for his portrayal of a layabout son. That role coincided with several film roles, including a memorable turn in the low-budget 1997 cult flick "The Daytrippers." (Greg Mottola, the film's director, remains one of his good friends.)
And while his film work continues -- "I try to sell out on a regular basis," he jokes -- he remains proudest of his work in productions of "The Tempest" (1995), "Macbeth" and "Cymbeline" (both 1998), and last year's "Hamlet," all for the New York Shakespeare Festival.
"I go after good texts; I get amped by good plays," he said. "And wherever I can find that text, that's where I want to be."
 
'Jitney' on the Road
"Jitney," August Wilson's acclaimed drama playing the Union Square Theater, looks to be taking the show on the road. Negotiations are under way for the play to transfer to the West End of London early next year, said Richard Kornberg, a spokesman. The production, to be presented in conjunction with the Royal National Theater, would include the American cast.
That would mean that the Union Square, considered one of Off Broadway's more desirable theaters, would become available soon, and shows are already circling. Among those waiting in the wings are two light-theme musicals.
One is "Reefer Madness," a musical version of the 1930's scare film about the danger of marijuana. The second possibility sounds even more far out: "Bat Boy: The Musical," a comic musical by Larry O'Keefe, Brian Fleming and Keyth Farley based on the freakish character from the tabloid newspaper The Weekly World News. Scott Schwartz, son of composer Stephen Schwartz, is to direct.

HEADLINE: In Yugoslav Misery, Investors Knock

BYLINE: By PETER S. GREEN

 BODY:
Just over a month has passed since Yugoslavia's emerging democrats sent President Slobodan Milosevic packing and Western countries began lifting sanctions. Already, foreign investors are sifting through the physical and economic wreckage for investments and markets in Yugoslavia, a country they say should be the engine of Balkan recovery.
Trade delegations from Greece, Austria and the Czech Republic have visited. American and European companies are considering investing or reviving dormant links, and some that weathered the storm have expansion plans. 
 "My client list has doubled since the changes," said Benoit Junod, a former Swiss diplomat in Belgrade whose Geneva-based consulting firm, A&S, is scouting Serbia on behalf of foreign clients, particularly construction concerns.
In 1989, Yugoslavia was the wealthiest and most open country in the Communist world. Ten years of ethnic hatred, economic mismanagement and war have left its economy devastated and its infrastructure in tatters. But where many citizens see misery, investors see opportunity.
With eight million people in Yugoslavia, plus or minus two million Kosovars and two million Serbs in the diaspora, it is one of the Balkans' biggest and most important markets. Brand-conscious consumers with a surprising amount of money are thirsting for a better life. Labor is cheap, and the country sits astride the main road, rail and river routes linking Europe and the Balkans.
The economic reformers behind Yugoslavia's new president, Vojislav Kostunica, say speedy privatization is a high priority. Crucial assets for sale include the huge tobacco factory in Nis; electric, oil and gas companies; cement factories; and the government's 51 percent stake in Telekom Srbija.
The possibilities have piqued interest. An Austrian construction company, Bau Holding Strabag A.G., is exploring the loans and grants promised to Serbia for rebuilding by the European Union and others. "We are looking at projects like reconstruction of bridges over the Danube, highways, etc.," said Bau's chairman, Roland Jurecka.
Svetozar Janevski, managing director of the Pivara Skopje brewery in Macedonia, said he hoped to recapture Serbian markets lost when Macedonia seceded from Yugoslavia in 1992. "We have to think that Serbia is a market of 10 million people, and we can't cover that with one brewery in Skopje," Macedonia's capital, he said. Pivara Skopje, 51-percent- owned by a joint venture of the Dutch brewer Heineken N.V. and the Greek Coca-Cola bottler, the Hellenic Bottling Company, will be looking at some of the 10 major breweries in Serbia and at mineral water bottlers.
The Austrian bank Raiffeisen Zentralbank Group, a leading lender across the former Austro-Hungarian Empire, is moving to set up in Yugoslavia. "We have already made contacts with several Yugoslav banks to become their correspondent partner, and the second step would be to open our own operation," said a spokesman, Andreas Ecker.
Experts say the key is whether the government that emerges from the December elections can push significant reforms through the regional parliaments in Serbia and Montenegro and whether the governments can hold together through the pain of reforms. Serbia makes up 95 percent of Yugoslavia's population; Montenegro, its tiny sister republic, constitutes the rest.
Statistics show that average incomes are under $50 a month and unemployment is over 50 percent, and the economy is shrinking at over 7 percent a year. But that is not the full story, said Srdjan Bogosavljevic, director of the Strategic Marketing and Media Research Institute, a privately owned concern in Belgrade.
"There is no gas, but people are driving cars everywhere," he said. "There are no visas, but people are traveling. There are no salaries, but the restaurants are full."
Vastly skewed official statistics and a thriving gray economy help explain the apparent paradox. And remittances from Serbs abroad, Mr. Bogosavljevic said, are an estimated $100 million to $150 million a month.
So with even a small sign of recovery, markets for consumer goods in particular are likely to take off. "The future looks very bright," said Ephram Jeffy, general director of IBP Beograd A.D., the authorized Coca-Cola bottler in Yugoslavia. IBP operated during the Milosevic regime.
Anti-American sentiment during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia last year did not dent sales, he said; Coke sold 24 million cases of soft drinks in Yugoslavia and he expects to double that in two years.
"The war has shifted into subconsciousness," said Srdjan Saper, chief executive of the I&F McCann Erickson Group, an advertising agency in Belgrade. Mr. Saper says he is already hiring to meet an expected advertising boom.
Vladimir Joksic, the deputy general manager of the agency, a unit of the Interpublic Group, added: "One of the huge potentials here is the mindset of Yugoslav consumers. They know how to read advertising, and most of the Western brand goods were already here -- they were present on the black market."
The McDonald's Corporation has 16 restaurants in Yugoslavia. At the height of economic sanctions, it was able to obtain locally some 80 percent of its supplies and keep operating. That loyalty to the local market has built customer loyalty. "A lot of people will be surprised how fast this market will pick up," said Branimir Lalic, vice president for purchasing at McDonald's Central Europe operations, who is looking at sites for new restaurants on Serbia's highways.
Other businesses are already reaping the benefits of President Kostunica's arrival. ICN Pharmaceuticals of Costa Mesa, Calif., whose chairman, Milan Panic, is a former Yugoslav prime minister and opponent of Mr. Milosevic, won back control of its Belgrade pharmaceuticals factory, which had been confiscated by the Milosevic government. The company sees the Belgrade plant as crucial to winning export markets in the Caucasus and Turkey.
Yugoslavia's open past should help it avoid the slow learning curve that has dragged down development in other former Communist nations.
"We are at the center of the Balkans here, and have many people who for 20 or 30 years have been doing business with the West," said Dusan Mitevic, general manager of ICN Yugoslavia. "If the government assures stability, this country has the resources and the people, so it can very quickly rejoin the world."

HEADLINE: Russia to Seek Easier U.S. Rules for Steel Exports

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 16

 BODY:
Russia plans to ask Washington next month to change trade rules that have reduced steel exports to the United States by as much as 90 percent since 1998.
Russian government officials met today with 26 of the country's largest steel producers to map out a strategy for easing quotas and revising the way minimum prices are calculated and give Russian metal better access to the vast American market. 
 Last year, amid concern that its producers would be shut out of the United States, Russia agreed to quotas on hot-rolled steel just one-tenth of their 1998 volume. The agreement also set a minimum price, which currently exceeds the United States price by 30 percent.
"It would be very difficult to explain domestically if this agreement is continued," said Maksim Medvedkov, deputy minister of trade and economic development. "We want to compete freely and we want intervention to cease."
The old Soviet Union was the world's largest steel maker, producing more than 160 million tons a year for its heavy industries. But after the Soviet collapse in 1991, demand declined, and steel producers sought buyers in foreign markets like the United States. By 1997, Russian producers were exporting 60 percent of what they produced -- compared with zero in Soviet times.
Mr. Medvedkov said that next month's talks might not produce quick results because of opposition from American steel companies. The Americans say Russian steel makers have an unfair advantage in their low costs and remaining state subsidies. But Mr. Medvedkov said they no longer had access to government loans or big wage arrears that gave them competitive advantages.

HEADLINE: Japan Asks for an End to Debate on U.N. Security Council's Shape

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 16

 BODY:
Japan, which is campaigning for a permanent seat on the Security Council, called today for an end to the inconclusive debate on whether the Council should be expanded and asked that major nations, especially the United States, come to concrete agreement on its future shape.
As a starting point, Japan's ambassador to the United Nations, Yukio Satoh, formally recommended that the Council be expanded to 24 members from the current 15, and suggested that the Japanese would support restrictions on the five permanent members' use of the veto, a position popular with developing nations. 
 In an interview after his speech to a General Assembly session devoted to Security Council reform, Mr. Satoh said his next step would be to negotiate with the new American administration for specific, acceptable new numbers of permanent and nonpermanent members. He said that 155 of the organization's 189 member nations had now committed themselves to a larger council, and that debate should be considered closed. Mr. Satoh and Japanese Foreign Ministry officials who have worked on Japan's campaign say that they are increasingly frustrated by the General Assembly's inability to move beyond endless debate. Japan now pays 20 percent of the United Nations budget -- more than the combined contributions of all permanent Council members excluding the United States. But it lacks any official voice in Council decisions.
Speaking in the same debate, Ambassador James B. Cunningham of the United States reaffirmed American support for permanent Council seats for both Japan and Germany, based on their economic and political power. But he ruled out any change in the veto, which Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States, as permanent members, can use to block any Council action.
At the end of the day, while numerous speakers repeated the call for change, there was no agreement on what the next steps would be, only the familiar deadlock that has stymied a working group of member nations for seven years.
"What is taking so long?" Mr. Cunningham, a career diplomat and deputy chief representative of the United States, asked in his speech. "There is not yet, regrettably, even an emerging consensus on how to proceed. We are not surprised."
He pointed to some of the problems: regional competitions for proposed new seats, disagreements between rich and poor nations about how to strike a balance among them, and the final shape the Council should take. There have also been disputes over whether new permanent members would get veto powers.
When a proposal was made several years ago to add five members to the Council -- permanent seats for Germany, Japan and three developing countries -- it was soon apparent that there would be no consensus in Africa, Asia or Latin America behind a single candidate from each region.
Nigeria, Egypt and South Africa are all seen as potential African contenders for a permanent place. India wants a permanent seat, but in its own right, not as a representative of Asia. Several Latin American nations, among them Brazil and Mexico, are seen as contenders, too.
The United States, which for years held to an upper limit of 21 members, edged closer last April to the Japanese figure of 24, though Americans are concerned that expansion might make the group unwieldy and ineffective.

HEADLINE: By Deals With Burmese Junta, Minorities Thrive

BYLINE: By BLAINE HARDEN

DATELINE: KEKKU, Myanmar

 BODY:
Freedom's just another word for cutting a deal with the generals.
That is what the business manager of the Pao National Organization explained over a lunch of spicy chicken and avocado salad here in the rebel outback of a country that is a perennial contender for the title of world's most repressive state. 
 By agreeing to a cease-fire with the generals who run what used to be called Burma, the Pao, an ethnic minority of about 400,000 people in a country of 50 million, have won themselves civil rights and economic opportunities all but unimaginable to most Burmese.
A look at the semi-good life in Pao land explains why, in the last decade, at least 15 armed ethnic minorities in Myanmar have been willing to end decades of bloodshed and do business with the generals.
"It is not a perfect arrangement," said the Pao business manager, smoking a cigarette through a bamboo water pipe after lunch. "But it is better than war."
The Pao are prospering primarily as hoteliers, garlic farmers and jade miners. But other ethnic minorities -- the Wa and the Shan, in particular -- have used cease-fires to expand their interests in the heroin and amphetamine trades, according to the United States Drug Enforcement Administration. They have also been encouraged by the government to launder drug profits through the legitimate Burmese economy.
For the generals, ceding "contingent sovereignty" to groups like the Pao, Shan and Wa has been a win-win deal.
The agreements have, for the most part, ended a series of expensive insurgent wars that had become a way of life in the mountainous fringes of this country. Fighting continues against the Karen National Union, but that group has only 2,000 to 3,000 fighters, a fraction of its strength before the generals made deals with Karen subgroups.
Probably more important, cease-fires have freed the generals to focus state resources on saving their own skins. Since killing hundreds of pro-democracy marchers in 1988 and ignoring an election they lost in 1990, the generals have used an ever-expanding web of repression as the key to their continued rule.
The long, strong arm of that repression is an agency called Military Intelligence that locks up opposition leaders, spies on citizens and forces potential troublemakers like students out of cities.
The general in charge of Military Intelligence is the one who came up with the idea of making peace with the Pao and other rebel groups: Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt, who is often described as the brains behind the government. In its Orwellian argot, he is called Secretary One.
Secretary One is widely feared by members of the Burman ethnic group. They live in the lowlands and make up about 65 percent of the country's population. But among the hill people, Secretary One is not considered to be such a bad guy.
"He has a very sophisticated political mind, and he keeps his word," said the business manager of the Pao. Although he generally has good relations with Secretary One, he is somewhat afraid of him. To protect him, this article omits his name.
The business manager, though, was more than happy to explain how life is better in a world where the generals are no longer your enemy. "The most important benefit for our people is that they are no longer being forced to work as slaves for Slorc's army," he said.
Slorc is an acronym for State Law and Order Restoration Council, a name by which the junta was officially known until 1997. The generals then changed the name of their government to the State Peace and Development Council. But most Burmese continue to call the government Slorc.
Human rights groups and the State Department say forced labor has been and remains a common practice here, with Slorc forcing thousands of citizens to build roads and bridges and serve as coolies during military campaigns.
Besides freedom from forced labor, the business manager said the benefits of making peace with the generals include freedom to travel abroad without paying bribes for passports, to import cars without paying bribes for import licenses and to run businesses without generals' extorting profits.
For most Burmese -- the tens of millions who have not been able to fight the generals to a standoff -- all of these difficulties persist, along with a fear of being jailed and tortured by Military Intelligence.
One freedom the business manager enjoys, but did not mention, is the right to carry a gun. He hides an automatic pistol in his four-wheel rig.
As it turns out, the right to keep and hide weapons has been a primary guarantor of the cease-fire agreements that the Pao and most other ethnic groups have made.
"We keep our weapons, and we don't tell them where they are or how many we have," the Pao leader said. "If Slorc does not deliver on its promises for schools, roads and health clinics, we have the option of going back to war."
So far, he said, Slorc has mostly delivered.
What the generals buy with these expenditures, according to experts and diplomats, is the ability to isolate their primary political threat, the Burman majority, from their primary military threat, the well-armed minorities in the hills.
The deals that the ethnic minorities have made with the generals appear to have weakened the already weak hand of the country's primary opposition group, whose leader is Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. She is again under house arrest in the capital, Yangon, as she has been for much of the last decade since her party, the National League for Democracy, won an overwhelming victory in parliamentary elections.
For the Pao, as for many of the ethnic minorities here, Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi is not the saint-like, charismatic political figure that she is for many Burmese and for human-rights champions around the world.
"We are neither for her or against her," the business manager said. "What we are for is getting the best deal possible from the government so that we can have a maximum amount of political and commercial freedom."
Among the ethnic groups that have profited from peace, the Pao National Organization is probably the most successful in legitimate (that is, non-drug-related) business.
The organization owns two popular tourist hotels on scenic Inle Lake. With profits from the hotel, the Pao are investing in orchid farming and manufacture of commercial-grade dyes, and they are soon to open a tourist restaurant here in Kekku.
It was here at the restaurant, which offers a splendid view of ruins of medieval pagodas and Buddhist shrines, that the business manager made an international appeal for the commercial interests of the Pao.
"Tell people to come and visit us," he said. "The restaurant will be open to the public by January."

HEADLINE: New York-Presbyterian Begins Work on Hospital for Children

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
New York-Presbyterian Hospital broke ground for its new children's hospital in Washington Heights yesterday, becoming the third medical center in the region to begin construction of a children's hospital in the last few years.
The new center will be known as Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Children's Hospital of New York, reflecting the investment bank's gift of more than $55 million, which included donations from employees. The nine-story building, at 165th Street and Broadway, will replace the Babies and Children's Hospital, which will be renovated and turned into an outpatient center. The new hospital is expected to open in 2003. 
 Construction of the hospital comes at a time when the rest of the health care industry is scaling back many new projects and facing fiscal troubles. However, New York-Presbyterian and one of the other hospitals building a children's hospital, Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, both drew upon philanthropic donors for their projects. Montefiore hopes to complete its children's hospital in November 2001. Westchester County Medical Center plans to open a children's hospital in 2003.
Officials at New York-Presbyterian cited a strong need for hospitals devoted to the care of children.
"As tough as our economic position is," said Dr. Herbert Pardes, chief executive, "our intention is to do everything we can do to make our children's hospital top notch. We are here to do cutting-edge care, but you have to have the physical plant to do that."
While New York-Presbyterian's Babies and Children's Hospital has some of the best-known pediatric specialists and researchers in the world, the hospital itself is antiquated and crumbling. The oldest section of the hospital dates to 1928. The ceilings are about 12 feet high and cannot accommodate the wiring needed for the latest technology. Rooms are small and reflect a time when parents played only a minor role in their children's care -- almost all the rooms in the new hospital will be private, with sleeping areas for adults.
John J. Mack, president and chief operating officer of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, has been on the board at New York-Presbyterian since 1992. In 1994, he helped raise $3.5 million for a new pediatric intensive care unit. "Wall Street has been very fortunate in the last few years," Mr. Mack said yesterday. "We felt that if we could get people to focus on one good project they would look back later and be proud."
