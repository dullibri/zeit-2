HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Former L. L. Bean Official Named to Lead Lands' End

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON

 BODY:
Lands' End Inc., the catalogue merchant, announced yesterday that William T. End would succeed Richard C. Anderson as chief executive on Feb. 1.
In addition, the company said David Dyer, a merchandising and sales vice president, had been named a vice chairman. Mr. Anderson, who is 63, will remain a vice chairman and stay on as a consultant. 
 Analysts said the moves had been anticipated and should not result in major changes at the company, the nation's fourth-largest direct-mail merchant.
"These gentlemen were brought in and given more responsibility in the last nine months or so, so the succession was pretty clear," said Steven Ashley, a retail analyst with Cleary, Gull, Reiland & McDevitt in Milwaukee.
 
Lower Response Rates
 Even so, industry analysts said that Lands' End, based in Dodgeville, Wis., was facing hurdles like lower response rates to its catalogues, which could result in cost-cutting drives to lower inventory or staff. The mail-order retailer reported earnings of $5.5 million in its third quarter ended Oct. 30, down 5 percent from the year earlier.
"They've had tough times recently," Laura Christiana, editor of Catalog Age, a monthly trade publication, said, predicting weak fourth-quarter results. For example, according to Ms. Christiana, Lands' End mailed one of its Christmas holiday catalogues before the November elections and missed the upswing in consumer confidence that followed Bill Clinton's Presidential victory.
Lands' End was begun in 1963 as a sailboat equipment and hardware catalogue. Sailing apparel, like foul-weather gear, was added soon after and eventually outsold sailing equipment, so hardware was dropped in 1976.
 
Executive from L. L. Bean
 Mr. End, who is 45 and spent 15 years with the rival L. L. Bean catalogue, joined the company in 1991 and became president a year later. His name led to a bit of ribbing in the company newsletter, employees said. "Lands' End Lands End" was one headline.
Mr. Dyer, who is 43, was hired in 1989, helping the company introduce "Coming Home With Lands' End," one of its three specialty catalogues. Among bed and bath items, it features handmade quilts.
Mr. Ashley, the analyst, said it had been the goal of the company's founding chairman, Gary Comer, who is 64, to groom heirs to the chief executive's post who will perpetuate the company's culture. Mr. Comer is not expected to retire soon.

HEADLINE: U.S. SAYS ECONOMY GREW AT FAST PACE IN FOURTH QUARTER

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 28

 BODY:
The economy grew at a faster-than-expected annual rate of 3.8 percent in the final quarter of 1992, the strongest performance in four years, the Commerce Department reported today.
The encouraging report was issued as the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, offered a surprisingly strong endorsement of President Clinton's plans to cut the Federal budget deficit. He met with the President this morning, and afterward told Congress that Mr. Clinton's goal of reducing the annual deficit by $145 billion by the end of his term, from a projected $319 billion, seemed about right. 
Mr. Greenspan also suggested that if the effort weakened the economy, the central bank might cut interest rates to soften the blow. [Page D2.]
 
 
Possible Easing of Conflict
 The Fed chairman's endorsement of the deficit-reduction plan came a day after he gave his blessing to the Administration's plan for about $20 billion in Federal spending to stimulate the economy. His support signals that in contrast to the tug-of-war often waged in recent years between the Federal Reserve and the White House, the Fed will support the new Administration's fiscal policy and is prepared to take monetary steps to keep the economy strong should it falter.
Despite the unexpectedly strong report on fourth-quarter growth, investors pushed long-term interest rates down today, viewing the economic strength not as a harbinger of inflation but as one more reason for the Clinton Administration to keep its fiscal-stimulus proposals modest.
The growth was spurred largely by consumers, but the economy also benefited from a big jump in housing and increased investments by businesses in new plants and equipment, especially computers.
 
 
Help for Governments
 The faster economic growth of the last quarter will help raise tax payments, shrinking the Federal budget deficit and easing financial burdens on state and local governments. A higher gross domestic product also reduces the need for benefit payments associated with hard times.
 Although initial jobless claims rose slightly in the latest week, the number of jobless Americans fell to 9.28 million last month, from 9.98 million in June.
Most private economists were quick to contend that the October-December pace, the fastest of seven straight quarters of expansion, was too rapid to continue and that growth would soon slow.
"That kind of spending is not sustainable," said Thomas J. Moeller, chief economist for Chancellor Capital Management in New York. He referred specifically to a 4.3 percent rate of growth in consumer outlays in the fourth quarter, after a hefty 3.7 percent gain during the summer.
In a survey of leading economists earlier this month by Blue Chip Economic Indicators, an economic newsletter, the consensus was that growth would amount to 2.8 percent for the first quarter of 1993, followed by slight improvements in succeeding quarters that would raise growth for the year to 2.9 percent.
For the fourth quarter of last year, housing increased at a 29.1 percent annual rate and business investment rose 9.7 percent. Those gains more than offset declines in inventory; spending by Federal, state and local governments, and results in the import-export sector.
Consumer spending accounts for just over two-thirds of an economy that rose above the $6 trillion mark, in terms of current dollars, during the latest quarter. The growth in the fourth quarter was the strongest since a 3.9 percent rate was recorded in the fourth quarter of 1988, at the end of Ronald Reagan's Presidency.
But Mr. Moeller and other analysts point to lagging growth in jobs and incomes, as well as to related depressants -- a shrinking military establishment, poor conditions in commercial real estate and floundering economies abroad.
Indeed, the Labor Department today reported a third straight weekly increase in first-time claims for unemployment benefits, to the highest level since mid-November. Although the rise was only 2,000, analysts had been expecting a modest decline.
 
Greater Efficiency Seen
 What is happening, economists said, is that the gross domestic product -- the total output of goods and services within American boundaries -- is being swelled by improvements in corporate efficiency. "Growth is being staffed by more productive workers instead of just more workers," said William C. Dunkelberg, chief economist for the National Federation of Independent Business.
This ultimately raises living standards, but in the short run acts as a drag on the economy as idle workers -- as well as their relatives and neighbors -- cut their spending.
"We've got an awful lot of work to do," President Clinton said today as he met with advisers, mentioning "trouble about lost jobs."
One measure of the previously sluggish nature of the economic rebound was the fact that since the recession officially ended in the first quarter of 1991, G.D.P. has climbed only 1.6 percent above its pre-recession peak.
By contrast, said Carol S. Carson, head of the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis, G.D.P. during the first seven quarters of the preceding five expansions rose 5.8 percent above its pre-recession level.
Today's report also shed light on how consumers paid for their holiday shopping sprees. Credit-card issuers had reported a surge in customer charges, but the Government found that incomes rose as well, at least temporarily.
Current-dollar personal income surged $93.7 billion during the quarter, up from $33.1 billion during the July-September period, the report showed. An official said about $9 billion of the latest increase represented year-end bonus payments by Wall Street firms and automobile companies. Many such payments have been accelerated because of Mr. Clinton's expressed intention to raise taxes on the wealthy.
The nation's savings rate -- personal savings as a percentage of disposable income -- scarcely changed in the fourth quarter, edging down to 4.5 percent from 4.6, the report showed.
 
Inventories Decrease
 The drawdown of inventories subtracted $7.8 billion from the gross domestic product during the quarter, after growth in inventories added $7.2 billion last summer. The movement was considered a favorable sign because supplies will probably need to be replenished even if demand tails off. The department assumed a moderate $20 billion drawdown of inventories in December.
Other pluses for the economy are low inflation, low interest rates and competitively low foreign-exchange rates for the dollar, analysts said.

HEADLINE: Israel's Highest Court Upholds The Deportation of Palestinians

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Jan. 28

 BODY:
In a much-awaited decision carrying immediate implications for Israel's diplomatic standing and for the future of the Middle East peace talks, the Israeli High Court of Justice today unanimously validated the deportation of more than 400 Palestinians from the occupied territories to Lebanon.
Although the seven justices expressed reservations about some aspects of the Government action, they declared the mid-December mass expulsions to be legitimate and rejected appeals to bring the Palestinians back. 
 The ruling, welcomed by the Government and denounced by Palestinian leaders and Arab countries, is likely to put Israel squarely on a collision course with the United Nations Security Council, which has condemned the deportations as a violation of international law and is poised to do so again.
 
Question of U.N. and U.S.
 For Israeli leaders, a dominant question now is whether they can avoid United Nations sanctions, especially after Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali recommended this week that the council take "whatever measures are required" to enforce its demand that the banished Palestinians be returned.
The decision upholding the deportation disappointed the Clinton Administration, which was clearly hoping that the court might relieve it of having to choose between voting sanctions against Israel or antagonizing the Arab states. The Bush Administration has already voted to condemn Israel for the deportations. [Page A9.]
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin expressed confidence that the Clinton Administration would block any attempt at using sanctions to bolster the condemnation. The Palestine Liberation Organization, for instance, has circulated a draft resolution to ban Israel from human rights meetings and to prevent foreign companies from doing business with the Israelis in the occupied territories.
At the United Nations, the P.L.O. said it had asked the nonaligned members of the Security Council to sponsor its resolution, which has been endorsed by all Arab countries. But Venezuela and Pakistan, two nonaligned members of the Council, said they wanted to avoid a United States veto and would seek changes in the draft Arab resolution. The other nonaligned members are Cape Verde, Djibouti and Morocco. Brazil, a developing country that does not belong to the nonaligned movement, is also a Security Council member.
 
'The Struggle That Awaits Us'
 Mr. Rabin said, "It's hard for me to believe that an Administration and President in the United States wouldn't fight against sanctions." This has been American policy "for 35 years or more," he added.
Nonetheless, Gad Yaacobi, Israel's representative at the United Nations, cautioned that the court ruling "does not change at the moment the struggle that awaits us in the Security Council."
The court ruling also does not change uncertainties about immediate prospects for the American-brokered peace negotiations, which are on hold with no date set for new sessions.
Israeli officials have said repeatedly that they are sure that Syria and Jordan will show up. But Palestinian delegates insist they will boycott the talks until all the exiles are returned, not just the 19 who have been brought back in the last few weeks because of illness and mistakes in their expulsions.
While it is not the first time that the Palestinian representatives have threatened to stay away from the talks, all signs suggest that this time they mean it. If anything, the High Court decision reinforced the delegates' resolve. "We hold Israel responsible for the deadlock in the peace talks and for the total halt to negotiations," said Hanan Ashrawi, spokeswoman for the Palestinian team.
 
Exiles Are Adamant
 At their makeshift camp in southern Lebanon, the nearly 400 remaining Palestinian exiles denounced both the court and Mr. Rabin as "Nazis" and "terrorists." The banished men, most of them said by Israel to be members and sympathizers of the militant Islamic group Hamas, also rejected a High Court call for procedures that would make it possible for them to appeal their expulsions to a special military committee on an individual basis.
The Palestinians have said any appeal would give the deportations legitimacy, and they reiterated that they would remain where they are, between Israeli and Lebanese Army checkpoints, until they are returned to the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
"Do you have any other choice than return?" their leader, Abdul Aziz al-Rantisi, asked men gathered on a mountain slope near the tents.
"No! No! No!" they shouted.
Mr. Rabin rejected the Palestinians' assertions that the deportations, which had followed the killing of five Israeli servicemen by an armed wing of Hamas, were an obstacle to peace talks. The Israeli radio quoted him as saying that Israel "did not make continuing talks contingent on an end to terror" and that therefore "it was inconceivable that the Arabs should make continuation of the peace talks dependent on the cessation of the Government's legal activities."
Given the fallout from the deportations, some Israelis, both in and out of the Government, had hoped that the High Court might issue an order that could make diplomatic life easier for them. Mr. Rabin was decidedly not in this group, saying he did not seek any such assistance.
 
Rabin's Position Hardens
 In the last few days, his position has hardened, especially after Mr. Boutros-Ghali's call for new Security Council measures. Interviewed on television Wednesday night, the Prime Minister called it a "twisted and repulsive report," and complained that international criticism was one-sided because it had focused on the expulsions and not on the Hamas violence that had led to them.
"I am not surprised by the report," he said. "Boutros-Ghali is an Egyptian."
Essentially, the court did what it had done almost unfailingly in past deportation cases, which had never involved anywhere near as many people at one time as in this situation: It did not try to undo a Government action taken in the name of national security, and said Israel had the right to expel people according to emergency regulations left over from the British Mandate in Palestine, before the creation of Israel in 1948.
Among those once deported by the British in the 1940's was Meir Shamgar, the Chief Justice who announced the High Court decision today.
 
Protests Dismissed
 The judges dismissed protests from Israeli civil-rights lawyers that the expulsions were not valid because, among other things, the Palestinians had been summarily removed to Lebanon without first being able to appeal the orders to a military "advisory committee."
Those appeals can take place after the fact, the court said. Without elaborating on how it could be done, the court ordered the Government to enable the men to meet in safety with their lawyers. It is at those military committee hearings, the court said, that the Palestinians can make their argument that the expulsions violate the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, which lays out rules of conduct in occupied areas.
Mr. Rabin's office said that to speed the hearings, the Army had begun setting up 14 appeals committees. According to the Israeli radio, the army was clearing ground near a checkpoint in what Israel calls its security zone in southern Lebanon to create an area where lawyers and exiles can meet.
For now, however, this effort would seem beside the point because the Palestinians say they will not bring an appeal.
The one quarrel that the High Court had with the Government was with a special emergency order, written with an eye to eluding normal appeal procedures, that had authorized the expulsion of hundreds of people at one time by declaring it to be a "temporary removal" for no more than two years.
 
Consistent With Past Rulings
 The judges voided the order. But they added that as a practical matter it made no difference because the Palestinians had also been expelled as individuals, and those orders were valid. The finding was consistent with their past rulings that the Geneva Convention had in mind Nazi-style deportations of entire peoples and not the banishment of specific individuals deemed to be security threats.
Some civil-rights lawyers argued that the decision on the emergency order, while technical, amounted to a court warning against large-scale deportations in the future. "The illegality of the Government's actions was made clear, and no Government will be able to do this again," said Joshua Schoffman, who appealed in behalf of the Palestinians for the Association for Civil Rights in Israel.
Uri Dromi, director of the Government Press Office, acknowledged that "we got a strong indication from the court that this kind of mass deportation is not exactly an advisable thing."
But Leah Tsemel, another lawyer for the Palestinians, said the court did not rule out the expulsion of any number of people so long as each one receives an individual order. "What prevents the Army from issuing 4,000 individual deportation orders?" she said, calling the ruling a "catastrophe."

HEADLINE: Chinese Buy American Dream by the Inch

DATELINE: GUANGZHOU, China

 BODY:
Sooner or later someone was going to discover a way to make money on the Chinese craze for America. Now it looks as if someone has -- perhaps at the expense of thousands of naive Chinese.
All across the country, from the ice-glazed terrain of Harbin in the north to this moneyed metropolis in the south, Chinese people are talking about the chance to buy a "piece of America." 
 "I want to be a landowner in America!" said Bi Fei, a young financier who carries a cellular telephone and dashes around from luxury hotel to fancy restaurant. "How many Chinese people can say that they own American land?"
Driven by a belief that possessing land in the United States gives the owner the right to inspect the property -- and therefore obtain that sorely wanted visa -- tens of thousands of Chinese are rushing to buy tiny bits of America.
 
A $1,700 Gimmick
 In the United States, a "Deed of Land to the United States of America" is a deed to a square inch of terrain in each of the 50 states. It sells for $49.95 as a novelty gift, like a pet rock or canned air.
But in China, the deed represents a dream, and prices are going berserk. In Guangzhou, the price this month was $468, in Beijing $700. In Shanghai, the price once hit $1,700.
While the novelty was intended for sale primarily in the United States, 100,000 Chinese have purchased the deeds since they arrived on the market in China last November. That is twice as many as bought the deeds in the United States, where they have been available for more than a year.
The mania reflects the infatuation with most things American. But what really captures the Chinese imagination is the prospect that as American landowners, they will be allowed to visit their property. This is coupled with the fear that, as with real estate in China, there is not much around.
 
An Inch Here, an Inch There
 In fact there is plenty, according to American Acres Inc., which sells the product in the United States. The company, which says it has purchased an acre in each of the states, divided its holdings into 6,272,640 shares, one for each square inch. Three of the properties are in Saint Lawrence County, N.Y.; Danbury, Conn., and Oldmans Township, N.J.
About 250,000 deeds have been sold around the world, with China by far the largest market.
In Guangzhou, where enough people have hidden bank accounts that they can begin to appreciate the concept of buying novelties, a few business executives are thinking about the deeds as a collector's item or a speculative stock.
But for many Chinese the land offers a remote possibility: the chance to clinch that visa to America. Unfortunately, the Chinese are mistaken.
United States Embassy and consular officials deny that a deed will help obtain a visa. The calls and the questions, however, are still coming in.
The fine print is in English, and many buyers ignore it.
In a dilapidated Guangzhou office, a middle-aged engineer tells how he was sadly disappointed when the United States Consulate told him his property would not win him a visa.
 
The Fine Print
 "What we bought is not a piece of land at all," he complained. "What we have is just a piece of paper. We can't even resell the land on our own. The only thing we can resell are the pieces of paper."
The engineer said his company had purchased several hundred shares in the hope of reselling them at a profit. But after discovering that the deeds do not help to get a visa, the company decided to drop its plans and absorb the loss.
In fact, the deed states that owners shall not resell it as a security, but a secondary market has sprouted anyway in several cities. Many of the people who buy the deeds, even distributors who buy in bulk, cannot read English and seem to have little idea what they are buying.
 
The Real Estate 'Market'
 "The sellers tell us to buy now, when the price of land in America is low, and then sell later, when the economy and the real estate market rises," said a Chinese reporter who covers business and the economy.
The main distributor in China is the Haiwang Group, an influential company based in Shenzhen, next to Hong Kong. Haiwang plans to arrange for new property owners to visit the United States to "inspect" their land, a marketing strategy that seems to have contributed to the confusion over visas.
Haiwang representatives refused to comment when reached by phone in Shenzhen. "I'm sorry, I can't answer your questions," said a staff member who answered the phone and would not give his name. "Our officials are on vacation. They cannot be contacted."
Scott Moger, the president of American Acres, which is based in New York, said the marketing in China was handled by Haiwang. He said he was concerned that buyers may be misinformed, and he added that he had given interviews to the BBC and Voice of America, which broadcast to China, explaining that the deeds are novelties rather than investments.
"I know nothing about China," Mr. Moger said in a telephone interview. "We sell it at one price. The subdistributors seem to be trying to mark it up."

But in China, they are selling wildly in hopes that the investors will be granted visas in order to inspect their "property" in the United States. (Suzanne DeChillo/The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Dinkins to Propose Using Unpaid Taxes To Get a Bank Loan

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
To help close a projected $2.1 billion budget gap in the next fiscal year, the Dinkins administration plans to borrow $215 million from Chemical Bank, using as collateral unpaid property-tax debts, senior officials said last night.
The unusual plan would allow the administration to use the funds on the first day of the fiscal year, July 1, instead of waiting until delinquent taxpayers finally get around to paying up. 
 The bank will lend the city the $215 million at about 5 percent interest, according to city officials, taking $400 million in unpaid property-tax obligations as collateral. The city will repay the money in the following fiscal year, when some of the delinquent taxes are finally collected.
The plan was revealed as Mayor David N. Dinkins prepared to unveil today his budget for the 1994 fiscal year. It was immediately denounced by state fiscal monitors and other budget experts, who said it was simply a scheme for deficit financing and an effort to avoid making hard budget choices now.
The borrowing plan is one in a series of financing proposals that the administration wants to use to close next year's budget gap. Those plans, amounting to more than $415 million, also involve stretching out bond payments, refinancing bonds and revising some debt.
But by far the most creative part of the package is the Mayor's plan to borrow money from Chemical Bank against property taxes that the city does not expect to collect until the next fiscal year.
Because it often takes years to collect back taxes, the city each year issues tax bills, deducts from the total due what historically taxpayers have failed to pay in a given year, then adds the delinquent taxes that it expects to collect from previous years. That is the amount of revenue usually put in the budget plan.
But under the Mayor's proposal, the city would borrow from Chemical Bank against property taxes that will be levied next year but that are not likely to be paid until the fiscal year that begins in July 1994. As collateral, the bank would get $400 million in unpaid tax obligations, on the assumption that at least $215 million of that amount will be collected eventually. Theoretically, if the city was not able to collect that much, the bank would be left to try to collect the rest on its own, though city officials said that was highly unlikely.
In essence, the move would allow the city to spend money in the next fiscal year that it would not collect until the following year, fiscal experts said. "It's like selling bad credit-card accounts," explained a senior mayoral adviser who spoke only on the condition that his name not be used.
 
Plan Criticized
 But fiscal experts -- many of whom gave the Mayor grudging respect last year for his budget effort -- assailed the plan. They said Mr. Dinkins -- who has promised not to raise taxes or lay off workers -- was borrowing against uncertain revenues to avoid making tough decisions in an election year.
Allen J. Proctor, the executive director of the State Financial Control Board, which oversees city finances, called the idea "the howler of the financial plan."
"All it does is make 1995's problem bigger," Mr. Proctor said. "It's nothing but pure putting off until tomorrow what you don't want to do today.
"They are borrowing against future income," he added. "It's literally like a cash advance on your credit card."
Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, said the plan would not be viewed with favor by Wall Street bond raters and other fiscal monitors.
"They are in a sense auctioning off money that could be coming in next year," he said. "That's what makes it not kosher. That's what makes it like deficit financing."
Officials at Chemical Bank could not be reached for comment last night, nor could officials of the two main bond-rating agencies, Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's.
The city's budget director, Philip R. Michael, said that although the bank would own the $400 million in debt under the deal, the city would continue to collect the taxes and would retain the power to foreclose on the property. But the bank would be able to claim the first $215 million in delinquent taxes collected in fiscal year 1995, plus about 5 percent interest.
 
2 to 4 Percent Uncollected
 City officials said that as far as they knew, this was the first time New York had ever borrowed against uncollected property taxes. In Chicago, unpaid property-tax obligations have been sold to private collection agencies, but that arrangement differs from the Dinkins proposal because New York City would remain the collector and would retain the right to foreclose.
Mr. Michael said the city historically fails to collect in a given year between 2 and 4 percent of the property taxes it is owed, with each percentage point being worth about $100 million. The amount going uncollected has been growing in recent years because of the recession in real estate, he said.
Mr. Michael dismissed the notion that the city was borrowing against future revenues, saying that the plan was a way to even out over the long term the peaks and troughs in the real-estate market. When the market improves, he said, tax revenues will rebound and further borrowing will become unnecessary. "This is something we would envision every year," he said.
Fiscal monitors were less charitable. They said it amounted to borrowing from the future in an election year to avoid raising taxes or cutting services. "The process of dealing with problems has come to a grinding halt," Mr. Proctor said. "His administration has lost all of its energy. It's basically going on hold until the election."

 DINKINS PLANS $215 MILLION LOAN
To help close a projected $2.1 billion budget gap in the next fiscal year, the Dinkins administration plans to borrow $215 million at 5 percent interest from Chemical Bank, using as collateral unpaid property-tax debts, senior officials said. The unusual scheme would allow the administration to use the funds on the first day of the fiscal year instead of waiting until delinquent taxpayers get around to paying up. A1.

HEADLINE: Court Ruling Leaves Clinton With Uncomfortable Choices

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 28

 BODY:
The decision by the Israeli High Court upholding the deportation of more than 400 Palestinians disappointed the Clinton Administration, which was clearly hoping that the court might relieve it of having to choose between supporting United Nations sanctions against Israel or antagonizing the Arab countries that are likely to seek sanctions.
In any event, the continuing impasse over the deportees jeopardizes the Middle East peace talks. No date has been set for their resumption, but at any rate they are now threatened by an Arab-wide boycott. 
 President Clinton has pledged that making progress toward peace is one of his highest foreign policy priorities, but he now finds that unless there is an early break over the deportees, there may not be talks in February.
 
'We Don't Think It's Time'
 Although the Bush Administration voted in favor of a Security Council resolution that unanimously condemned Israel for deporting the Palestinians and demanded their immediate return, the Clinton Administration has indicated it will oppose any initiative to enforce the resolution with even limited sanctions.
"We don't think it's time for a debate in the Security Council on sanctions," the State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, said today. But he declined to say whether the impasse was a setback to the peace talks, and repeated over and over that the United States was consulting with Israel and other governments to resolve the issue.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher will probably plead for more time when he visits Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali at the United Nations on Monday. He will accompany Madeleine Albright on her first day as the chief United States representative to the United Nations.
Mr. Boutros-Ghali recommended on Tuesday that the Council take "whatever measures are necessary" to force Israel to comply with the Council's demand to re-admit the Palestinians.
 
Top Spot on Agenda
 If the issue is not resolved in the next few weeks, Mr. Christopher will find the deportees at the top of his agenda when he travels to the Mideast in the second half of February as part of his first foreign trip. He is also to meet with his NATO counterparts in Europe and with Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev of Russia, State Department officials said.
The Palestine Liberation Organization today garnered support for sanctions against Israel from at least 22 Islamic nations and is seeking broader backing from "nonaligned" members on the 15-nation Security Council. Some of these members were ready to begin an informal Council debate on Friday, but the United States was seeking to stall it, according to diplomats at the United Nations.
Administration officials had urged key Arab governments to block the P.L.O.-drafted resolution until the Israeli High Court ruled.
Richard N. Haass, the senior official on the Middle East at the National Security Council during the Bush Administration, said, "The Administration could be forced to choose between some sanctions against Israel -- which would clearly be a major departure and sets a dangerous precedent for pressuring Israel -- and seeming to employ a double standard when it comes to taking a tough line against those who do not conform to Security Council resolutions."
 
No Relief From Justice
 Until today, the Administration had gambled that the Israeli High Court of Justice would break with precedent and rule against the deportations, thus providing Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin with a face-saving way to take back the Palestinians, perhaps in stages, and comply with the Security Council resolution.
Despite the Security Council vote in favor of the immediate return of the deportees, neither Mr. Clinton nor Mr. Christopher explicitly repeated that demand when they spoke with Mr. Rabin in separate telephone conversations last weekend, according to Israeli officials.
When Mr. Clinton telephoned Mr. Rabin Saturday, these officials said, Mr. Clinton merely expressed the hope that the deportee matter would be solved as soon as possible. Mr. Christopher was somewhat more specific during his 30-minute conversation on Sunday, saying that he hoped the matter would be resolved quickly so that the two sides could once again focus on the peace process.
 
The Diplomacy Route
 As part of its diplomatic efforts, Mr. Christopher prepared tonight what State Department officials described as a tough message to Mr. Rabin, but they declined to discuss its content.
The United States Ambassador to Israel, William C. Harrop, met with Mr. Rabin today in Israel, and in Washington Assistant Secretary of State Edward P. Djerejian met with Lebanon's Ambassador, Simon Massoud Karam.
Mr. Karam said in an interview that Lebanon would accede to the United States request that it not push for sanctions immediately, despite the fact that the deportees are trapped in an area of southern Lebanon that Israel in effect occupies and calls its security zone.
"From the beginning we have stressed that unless this is solved, no one can count on resumption of the peace process," Mr. Karam said.

HEADLINE: 1992 Unemployment Rate Hit a 15-Year High

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. LYONS

 BODY:
New York City's average unemployment rate last year was the highest in 15 years, according to Federal statistics released yesterday.
The city's unemployment rate rose to 10.8 percent from 8.6 percent of 1991, according to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, the highest level since the end of the city's last fiscal crisis in 1976. 
 The total number of New Yorkers employed last year fell to 2,952,000 from 3,023,000 a year earlier, the first time in six years that the city's annual employment level fell below 3 million, the figures showed.
Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the Regional Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said there is some evidence that employment is starting to pick up locally.
"This is not a statistical glitch," Mr. Ehrenhalt said in an interview. "New York City has gone through an economic downturn second in recent decades only to the great economic crisis of the early to mid-70's." But he added, "We see a flicker of light at the end of the tunnel because, while unemployment continue ins the double-digit range, we have seen the downturn bottom out in the last quarter of the year."
The preliminary data released yesterday noted that the grim unemployment statistics were spread across all demographic groups studied by the Department of Labor.
The impact was particularly heavy on blacks and Hispanics. The rate for blacks last year rose from 10.4 percent in 1991 to 14 percent, while that for Hispanics climbed from 10.4 percent to 15.9 percent.
In New York State, the average 1992 unemployment rate of 8.5 percent contrasted with a national figure of 6.7 percent. In 1991, the state figure was 7.2 percent, while the nation rate was 6.7 percent.
Officials of the state-administered Unemployment Trust Fund said that because of the high unemployment rate, the fund is expected to run out of money next month, triggering an automatic increase in the amount employers in New York will have to contribute.

Bond Prices Close Up in Seesaw Day

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Prices in the bond market rode a roller coaster yesterday, rising, falling and then rising again at the end of the day. The ride revealed a market that has become more and more driven by public comments surrounding the development of President Clinton's economic plan.
Comments on Sunday by Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen drove the yield on the 30-year bond down to 7.20 percent on Monday, a six-and-a-half-year low. Yesterday, a prominent Senator's proposal of a minimum price of $25 a barrel on imported oil quashed a morning rally that had pulled the yield on the long bond a notch lower, to 7.19 percent. 
 But later in the day comments by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman, revived the market, sending prices higher again and yields lower. These remarks, which included an endorsement of Mr. Clinton's deficit-reduction goals, helped to push the yield on the 30-year bond from 7.24 percent back down to 7.20 percent by the end of the trading day in New York. And the yields on Treasury notes fared even better, ending at their lows for the day.
"This is what we are going to see for a long time to come," said Joel Kazis, managing director for government trading at UBS Securities. "There is a lot of discussion going on inside and outside the Administration that will drive our market around. We will be tossed around here until we get some real word out of the President."
As trading began in New York yesterday, the Commerce Department reported that the nation's economy grew at a 3.8 percent annual rate in the last quarter of 1992, the best performance in four years.
 
Growth in Economy Slow
 But traders and investors seemed to dismiss the data quickly, focusing on other recent reports indicating that the economy has been growing at a slower pace. A report that initial jobless claims rose for the third week in a row added to this argument. The jump was just 2,000, but analysts had been expecting a decline.
In addition, the report on the gross domestic product showed that the rate of inflation had remained low.
This all helped to send bond prices higher. But later, Senator J. Bennett Johnston, Democrat of Louisiana and chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, proposed a floor price of $25 a barrel for imported oil. The suggestion rocked the petroleum markets; the price of oil for March delivery jumped to close at $20.41 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The higher oil prices caused inflationary jitters in the bond market and prices fell sharply. But then Mr. Greenspan came to the rescue.
Prices of Treasury notes and bonds moved higher again after Mr. Greenspan said that Mr. Clinton's goal of cutting the Federal budget deficit by $145 billion by 1996 was not "off base"; that if deficit reduction put a drag on the economy the Fed would consider cutting short-term interest rates, and that credible deficit reduction would quickly bring down long-term interest rates.
In late trading in the secondary market, the price of the 30-year bond was up 17/32 to 105 6/32 to yield 7.20 percent, down from 7.24 percent Wednesday. The price of the 10-year note was up 14/32 , to yield 6.38 percent, down from 6.45 percent.
And, as Mr. Kazis noted, Mr. Greenspan's remarks bolstered shorter maturities because they allowed investors to conclude that the Fed would not raise short-term rates soon and could even cut them again if the economy stumbled. The price of the two-year note jumped 7/32 as the yield dropped to 4.14 percent, from 4.25 percent on Wednesday.
The discount rates on Treasury bills also fell sharply, with the rate on the three-month bill down 5 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 2.85 percent. This brought it below the Federal funds rate, which is the interest charged on overnight loans between banks.

Catalogue Plant To Close

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Jan. 28

 BODY:
One of the first ripples from Monday's huge restructuring of Sears, Roebuck & Company surfaced today, when the R. R. Donnelley & SonsCompany said it would close the Chicago plant that had printed the Sears catalogue for 80 years.
The Donnelley facility, the oldest of its 140 plants worldwide, employs 660. The company said it would take a one-time charge of $60 million in the first quarter to cover the cost of shutting the facility. Meanwhile, Donnelley, the world's largest commercial printer, today reported record sales and earnings for the fourth quarter and the year. 
 The closing "is the beginning of the secondary reactions that will be felt as a result of the Sears's decision," said John Skorburg, chief economist and director of government affairs at the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce.
Sears plans to close its ailing $3.3 billion catalogue unit, shut 113 stores and take other steps that will result in the elimination of 50,000 full-time and part-time jobs nationwide. About 4,000 jobs in Illinois will be cut.
Mr. Skorburg estimated that another 6,000 employees would be laid off at Illinois companies that do business with Chicago-based Sears, especially companies that have the Sears catalogue as a customer, like photographers and paper suppliers. Mr. Skorburg, estimating that each job accounts for annual income of between $50,000 to $60,000, said the economic impact on Illinois could reach $600 million.
Jan M. Grayson, director of the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs, said the planned job losses "are a blow to state, no doubt about it." But, he added, "The state economy is viable and rich enough that we can absorb it."
The plant to be shut is a landmark on the city's near South Side. The 1.1-million-square-foot building was completed in 1928 and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.
Because of the building's age and unusual design, it can not operate economically without the Sears catalogue work, said Diane M. Dunne, Donnelley's manger of corporate communication. Ms. Dunne said that Donnelley was studying ways to relocate the work when Sears announced its plans to end the catalogue.

HEADLINE: Major Powers Back a Fund For Soviet-Design Reactors

BYLINE: By MARLISE SIMONS

DATELINE: PARIS, Jan. 28

 BODY:
After months of bickering among themselves, the United States and six other major industrial nations have agreed to create a multimillion-dollar fund to improve the safety of nuclear reactors in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
The results of a secret meeting in London on Wednesday were disclosed today by French and German officials, who said at a joint news conference here that an accord had been reached unexpectedly and that the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development would manage the fund. 
 The ministers also announced today that France and Germany together had pledged to pay $80 million into the fund over the next three years. The United States has not yet committed itself to any specific amount, but officials close to the negotiations said that American as well as Japanese negotiators had dropped past objections and agreed to go along.
 
Disaster Prevention
 The money going into this nuclear safety account will generate a great deal of business for Western manufacturers. It will be spent in the first place on measures to prevent disasters like the one at Chernobyl in 1986 and to make other improvements that will guarantee an energy supply to the faltering economies of Eastern Europe, Russia and Ukraine.
Western experts have long expressed alarm over dilapidated conditions at many of the 60 Soviet-designed reactors operating in the former Communist nations, and since the end of the cold war, Western countries have repeatedly said they would need to help.
At their Munich summit last July, the Group of Seven industrial nations -- which includes the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan -- proposed a nuclear energy assistance program that would need a minimum of $700 million. But their plan has since failed to get off the ground because the seven could not agree on what aid to provide and who should be in charge of managing it.
"The United States and Japan were very reluctant to go along with a multilateral program, but now they have agreed," said a spokesman for the German government, which has led the drive for the fund. "The consultations have been long and difficult." Officials of the Clinton administration could not be reached for comment
 
An Issue of Control
 A major stumbling block was that the United States and Japan wanted to give direct, bilateral aid in order to keep more control over the money and to retain more leverage in getting business contracts, officials close to the negotiations said.
As part of her confirmation process, Energy Secretary Hazel R. O'Leary told a Senate committee last week that she intended to make assisting the civilian nuclear power industry in Russia and the Baltic states a "priority." But department officials say there is no money in their 1993 budget for dismantling Soviet-design nuclear plants.
European countries, and France and Germany specifically, have pushed hardest to get the nuclear safety program going because the region is so exposed to fallout in case of a major nuclear disaster in the former communist countries, as it was in the case of Chernobyl.
Another issue that has slowed down talks, experts said, is the absence of clear legal liability in those countries.
 
A Need for Clarity
 "If Western manufacturers go in there and people get hurt by something that has a Western piece bolted to it, this can have all sorts of repercussions," said a specialist at the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna. "Western companies are very eager to go and get the business, but their legal departments are very nervous."
The first countries to receive funds, experts said, will be Bulgaria and Slovakia, both of which operate some of the least safe reactors, the first generation of pressurized water reactors known as VVER-440 type 230.
Bulgaria's only plant at Kozloduy, which has three types of reactors, is in the worst shape, in the view of Western nuclear specialists. The European Community has already spent $13 mmillion on maintenance work and staff training at Kozloduy.
Slovakia is known for better workmanship, but its reactors of three different generations suffer the design faults criticized by Westerners.
Ukraine and Russia will also receive money from the fund. But it is still not known which of the types of Soviet-built nuclear plants in the former Communist bloc will be fixed up.

HEADLINE: Post Buyer Says He'll Restore Some Pay

BYLINE: By RONALD SULLIVAN

 BODY:
The prospective new publisher of The New York Post told about 100 applauding but chary newsroom employees late yesterday that he would restore half of the 20 percent pay cut they agreed to last week as soon as he receives the required permission of the Federal Bankruptcy Court.
Steven Hoffenberg, the chairman of the Towers Financial Corporation, who has signed a letter of intent to purchase The Post and has put up a $2.5 million line of credit to back it up, said a 10 percent restoration would cost The Post about $75,000 a week at a time when its financial condition is regarded as extremely precarious. 
 Under an agreement with the unions at The Post, Mr. Hoffenberg was not required to restore the salary cuts until Feb. 20 or until he buys the paper from Peter S. Kalikow, its bankrupt owner.
But he said he was moving more quickly than required "because these people cannot pay their bills, they cannot pay their rent and they did not become employees of The Post to become lenders of first resort."
In a telephone interview, Mr. Hoffenberg conceded that his largess to The Post unions would go a long way in countering a series of negative stories that portrayed him as a streetwise wheeler-dealer with a long history of what critics describe as questionable business transactions.
"But streetwise I admit to, and I'm proud of it," he said yesterday. "I'm not Maxwell or Murdock," he said, referring to Robert Maxwell, the former owner of The Daily News and Rupert Murdoch, a former Post owner. "I'm just a guy from the corner who's worked all his life and who's trying to save this newspaper."
 
Applause and Cynicism
 At The Post, reporters who heard Mr. Hoffenberg's offer to restore half of their pay cut reacted with applause and considerable cynicism.
Karen Phillips, a Post court reporter in Brooklyn and an official of the paper's unit of the New York Newspaper Guild, which represents news, advertising and circulation employees, said of Mr. Hoffenberg's promise, "I'll believe it when I see it."
In the interview, Mr. Hoffenberg also said he would restore all employee deductions for employee retirement fund, known as 401(k) account, that were missed during the financial upheaval that preceded his agreement to purchase the newspaper.
At The News, meantime, seven reporters met yesterday's deadline to resign and accepted a severance deal offered by the newspaper's new publisher, Mortimer B. Zuckerman.
The pay cuts at The Post and the resignations at The News reflected the shaky financial structure and lingering animosities at the two newspapers that many experts say will someday result in one killing off the other in an anticipated newspaper circulation and advertising war that would also include New York Newsday, the city's third tabloid.
The reporters who resigned at The News were Donald Singleton, Tom Robbins, Serge Kovaleski, Salvatore Arena and LynNell Hancock and two columnists, Juan Gonzalez and Jerry Capeci, both vocal members of the guild's opposition to Mr. Zuckerman's stormy tenure at The News.
 
Guild Supporters
 When The News dismissed 182 guild-represented employees on Jan. 7 as part of a staff cutback that Mr. Zuckerman said was necessary to save the newspaper, the seven reporters were offered jobs and stayed on.
But Mr. Capeci said his decision to leave yesterday was a response to Mr. Zuckerman's continued actions against the guild. "I'm not happy with the way things progressed under Zuckerman, and I support the guild's boycott of The News," he said.
The News was also hit with what the guild said was its first full day of pamphleteering. Handbills distributed at most of New York City's major transportation centers called for a boycott of The News and of Mr. Zuckerman's weekly magazine, U.S. News & World Report.
As for Mr. Hoffenberg, he said that as well as being a "$1 a year" publisher of a feisty newspaper that he said takes pride in its underdog position, he would back up his plan to trade advertising space at The Post for merchandise at a time in the city's economy when he said everyone is short of cash.
"You won't see me behind some big publisher's desk," he said. "You'll see me in discount-merchandizing outlets selling the very stuff we took in for advertising that day."
"As you see, I don't stand on a lot of privilege," he said. "You want pants, I got pants."

HEADLINE: Fed's Chief Also Likes Clinton Plan on Deficit

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 28

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, gave another endorsement to President Clinton's economic plans today, calling the Administration's goals for deficit reduction about the right size and suggesting that if the effort weakened the economy, the central bank might cut interest rates to soften the blow.
Hours after he met with Mr. Clinton this morning, Mr. Greenspan appeared before the Senate Budget Committee and signaled a surprisingly cooperative spirit with the Administration, endorsing the President's promise to cut the annual budget deficit $145 billion by the end of his term. 
 "I don't find that the number the President Clinton has indicated to be off base," he told the Senators. For Mr. Greenspan, known for speaking indirectly, the remark was a ringing endorsement.
Further, he said, if a large-scale deficit-reduction plan undercut economic growth in several years, the Federal Reserve would take that weakness into account when setting interest rates.
Mr. Greenspan predicted that long-term rates would fall quickly in response to such a "credible deficit-reduction package." He added that "there is no stronger stimulus to this type of economy," not even a short-term stimulus program involving increased deficit spending.
"Observing the bond markets over the last few weeks," he added, "I think there is very clear indication that the markets are ready to move if there is a really credible reduction in the deficit."
The Fed chairman even held out the possibility that short-term interest rates would soon be cut if long-term rates were to fall quickly, in response to a major plan on the deficit.
"To the extent that in the short run there is a significant decline in long-term interest rates," Mr. Greenspan said, "obviously monetary policy would adjust to that fact, as well."
 
Logic of the Marketplace
 Federal Reserve officials often say the reason they have not cut short-term rates further is that the financial markets, fearing future inflationary pressures, have kept long-term rates high.
Officials at the Clinton White House seemed to signal a new spirit of cooperation with the Federal Reserve, after the tension between Mr. Greenspan and their predecessors in the Bush Administration.
"We've had good discussions with the Fed," George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director, said today. "We're all committed to the same goals." He listed these as "getting growth in this economy, holding inflation down and really bringing up job growth."
Mr. Greenspan, in an appearance on Wednesday before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, seemed to give his approval to the Administration's plans for a modest stimulus package of about $20 billion, saying that both he and the President favored "maximum sustainable growth" rather than a "stop-go" economic policy.
By that, Mr. Greenspan indicated he did not think that the Administration's plans to stimulate the economy threatened to speed up growth at such a pace that it would set off new inflationary pressure. Such pressure could cause the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates, a move that would slow growth.
Some Administration officials worry, however, that the bonhomie between Mr. Clinton and the Fed chairman could disappear before long because the Administration favors faster growth than the Fed and because the President is so eager to reduce unemployment.
Senator Jim Sasser, Democrat of Tennessee and chairman of the Budget Committee, began today's hearing by pressing Mr. Greenspan to embrace easier monetary policy.
"An anemic economic recovery is Public Enemy No. 1," he said, not inflation. "No action, more baby steps, or worse, monetary contraction, will without a doubt in my mind lay a killing frost over the economic spring that President Clinton is trying to force."
 
Spending More Than Taxes
 Mr. Greenspan gave the Senators -- and indirectly the President -- some advice about how to cut the deficit. He suggested that they focus on reducing spending, saying that tax increases alone would not be sufficient because spending is increasing considerably faster than the tax base.
He warned that for the financial markets to take any deficit-reduction package seriously, the proposals should not be "just a set of goals, or caps, or various other procedural elements." Instead, he said, Congress should enact specific, line-by-line legislation to cut the deficit.
The Fed chairman said that with inflation as low as it is, long-term interest rates -- now a little above 7 percent for 30-year Treasury bonds -- were about two percentage points higher than they should be because bond buyers worry about a projected series of $300 billion deficits.
He said that the negative effects of deficit-reduction measures on growth -- tax increases or spending cuts -- would "be offset by the major impact coming from" the decline in long-term rates that he foresees in reaction to a deficit package.

HEADLINE: A.T.& T. Reports $1 Billion In Record Quarterly Profits

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
A.T.& T. yesterday reported record fourth-quarter earnings of $1 billion, or 75 cents a share, up 57.5 percent from a year earlier, when it earned $635 million, or 48 cents a share.
Quarterly revenue of A.T.& T., the world's largest telecommunications company, which has been struggling in an increasingly competitive industry, totaled $17.5 billion, up 6.3 percent from a year earlier and about equal to the gross domestic product of Morocco. 
 The company, whose earnings were within analysts' expectations, was helped mainly by large increases in sales of telecommunications equipment, but also gains in its Universal credit card as well as a reduction in operating expenses brought about by prior reorganizations and work force reductions.
The earnings gain also appeared large because of reduced 1991 earnings, stemming from a sharp drop in the value of A.T.& T.'s holdings in Compagnie Industriali Riunite of Italy, which owns the Olivetti office-equipment company and other concerns. The value has been successively cut from $348 million to $131 million to $63 million. A.T.& T. took a charge of 14 cents a share in 1991 and a charge of 3 cents in the most recent quarter.
Analysts say that in view of the Riunite reduction and restructuring charges, a more realistic comparison in the quarter would be 78 cents a share versus 62 cents, a gain of about 26 percent.
American Telephone and Telegraph shares are the most widely held in the country, with more than 1.3 billion shares outstanding. In trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, A.T.& T. shares fell 12.5 cents each, to $53.125.
A.T.& T.'s quarterly performance was aided substantially by more than $900 million in increased sales of expensive telephone switching and transmission equipment and undersea cable systems.
Such purchases by the world's telephone companies, mostly huge state-owned carriers, have more to do with modernizing and expanding aging telephone networks than any general turnaround in the global economy. Regional Bell companies in the United States were especially large buyers, said Charles W. Schelke, an analyst at Smith Barney.
 
Long -Distance a Disappointment
 But such purchases tend to encourage increased domestic and international calling, which still makes up 60 percent of A.T.& T.'s annual revenue. Long-distance traffic growth has been somewhat disappointing. A.T.& T. told analysts that growth in telephone traffic was about 5 percent, about 1 percent lower than Wall Street had expected. MCI and, to a lesser extent, Sprint, have been taking market share from A.T.& T.
Revenue from telecommunications services, mainly domestic and international long distance, totaled $9.72 billion in the quarter, down less than a percent from the $9.79 billion in the corresponding period a year ago.
Full-year earnings totaled $3.8 billion, or $2.86 a share, compared with $522 million, or 40 cents a share, in 1991. Results for the prior year were hurt by restructuring charges and a recessionary economy. Full-year revenue totaled $64.9 billion, up 2.9 percent from $63.09 billion a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Mandatory Goals Urged for Integration

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WEST HARTFORD, Conn., Jan. 28

 BODY:
The plaintiffs in a lawsuit challenging the racial and economic segregation of Hartford's schools presented their last witness today, an expert who testified that a meaningful integration plan must cover the entire metropolitan area and set mandatory goals and deadlines.
Little has been accomplished without mandatory goals for addressing segregation, because "everyone knows it's there and no one ever wants to take responsibility for doing anything about it," said the expert, Gary Orfield, a Harvard professor of education and social policy. 
 A metropolitan plan, he said, would eliminate a major incentive for white flight: the ability to escape integrated schools by moving to the next community.
"The best kind of desegregation remedy involves the entire housing market, so a line is not drawn somewhere that says segregation will exist outside this line, and integration will exist inside this line," he said.
 
Provoking White Flight
 As the plaintiffs' last witness, Professor Orfield, a nationally known researcher on desegregation, surveyed the dos and don'ts of integrating schools, with an eye toward a major point that the state, in its defense, intends to raise: that court-ordered plans provoke white flight.
He discounted the chief evidence on flight that the state will present, research by Prof. Christine Rossell of Boston University, saying that she had not studied metropolitan plans like the one the plaintiffs are seeking.
Nearly all court-ordered desegregation plans have involved either single cities, or cities and suburbs linked by a common county school system. The plaintiffs, in contrast, have proposed linking Hartford with 21 suburbs that have their own school districts.
When Alfred Lindseth, an Atlanta lawyer assisting the state in its defense, challenged him on the flight issue, Professor Orfield explained a chart showing that whites have left virtually all central cities over the last 30 years, whether or not their schools have had court-ordered desegregation plans.
The losses have been smallest, he said, where court-ordered plans existed and covered entire metropolitan areas.
While the plaintiffs in the case, known as Sheff v. O'Neill, have not specified what they want in a court order, Professor Orfield described several elements that he considers essential.
One goal, he said, should be schools that "look like the overall community, and the overall community is the larger economic reach and housing market of the urban community." In 1991, Hartford and the 21 towns specified in the suit reported 93,791 students, 63.4 percent of whom were white, and 33.8 percent black or Hispanic. The rest were Asian or American Indian.
 
A Reasonable Rule
 A reasonable rule, he said, is that schools have racial balances within 10 percentage points of the region's average; magnet schools, which typically offer programs to attract suburban students to city schools, often are permitted a 50-50 balance.
Under those guidelines, suburban schools would be in compliance if their enrollments were 23.8 percent to 43.8 percent black and Hispanic.
But other goals are also important, he said. Similar balance should also be reached among teachers, administrators and staff members. And city children should improve academically, as measured in higher test scores, lower dropout rates and more graduates going to college.
"It's not reasonable to ask schools to solve everything and it's not reasonable to ask that it be done instantly," Professor Orfield said. "But it is reasonable to expect progress."
A plan, ideally, should be designed not by a judge, but by local authorities acting under goals and deadlines set by a court, he said. What must be mandatory, he said, is that the state and the communities participate.
Once goals have been set, he said, they can be achieved flexibly. While almost any plan is likely to require that some children be reassigned to schools away from their neighborhoods, parents can be given some choice. Areas that have achieved stable integration in their housing could be exempted, so that residents regain their neighborhood schools.
"The point of a desegregation plan is not to transport students, but to get them into integrated schools," he said. "If they're in a position to walk to such schools, so much the better."
Early deadlines are crucial, Professor Orfield said, because delay can cause racial division. The great danger, he said, is "political exploitation of racial fears," and that is highest between the time a court orders a plan and the first day of school under the plan.
How soon any desegregation order could be carried out in the Hartford region is, in a sense, moot, because both the Sheff lawyers and the state have vowed to appeal a decision against them.
Some positive steps could be taken while appeals are pending, Professor Orfield said. The quickest would be an immediate expansion in September of Project Concern, a voluntary busing program that sends Hartford children to suburban schools. While more than 500 children applied to join the program next September, he said, it has places for only 85.
The state could also block the continued spread of suburban segregation by banning the construction of new public schools unless they offer interdistrict programs or are built in integrated neighborhoods.

Dow Chemical Co. (N)

 BODY:
The Dow Chemical Company said yesterday that its fourth-quarter loss resulted from a $433 million pretax charge against earnings and the adoption of two new accounting changes. In the corresponding period of 1991, Dow lost $94 million, because of a $370 million pretax special charge.
Dow said its $496 million loss for the year was a result of the special charge, which reflected plant shutdowns, work force reductions and the accounting changes regarding retiree health-care costs and the method used to calculate income taxes. 
 "Results for the year were disappointing despite progress in restoring margins for our U.S. businesses," said Frank Popoff, the company's chairman and president. "Improvement in the U.S. was more than offset by deteriorating economic and business conditions in Europe."
Mr. Popoff added that "the first quarter of 1993 will include a gain from selling our interest in Dowell Schlumberger, thereby strengthening our cash flow position for the year." He said, "We are counting on our increased productivity to help us achieve earnings to help us achieve earnings improvement, while looking forward to an upturn in prices."

HEADLINE: Blanche Bernstein, 80, Official Who Criticized Welfare System

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Dr. Blanche Bernstein, a welfare expert and former government official known for her criticisms of the welfare system, died on Wednesdayat Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 80 and lived in Manhattan.
She died of lung cancer, said Barbara Rulnick, a niece. 
 Dr. Bernstein argued that the welfare system's major failing is fostering continued dependency for people receiving aid, instead of guiding them off the welfare rolls to independence.
"Reduction of dependency is the greatest unmet need in social policy today," she once said. "We have not gotten to the heart of the problem."
Her pronouncements often provoked opposition from other experts and advocates. They accused her of being unsympathetic to poor people, which she denied. Supporters said her aim was to help the truly needy while paring others from public assistance. She was a firm proponent of measures to eliminate ineligible recipients from welfare and to reduce erroneous overpayments.
She recounted her battles and explained her policies in "The Politics of Welfare: The New York City Experience" (Abt, 1982), which Fortune magazine called "wonderfully instructive."
 
High-Ranking Posts
 Dr. Bernstein's opinions were not merely academic. She held high-ranking welfare posts in both New York City and State government.
She headed the nation's largest local welfare agency when she served as the city's Human Resources Administrator in 1978-79, with more than a million residents receiving aid. Mayor Edward I. Koch appointed her when he came into office.
For two years before that, she was the State Social Services Department's deputy commissioner for income maintenance, under Gov. Hugh L. Carey. She was in charge of public assistance, food stamps and welfare job programs.
An economist by training, Dr. Bernstein earlier held policy posts in the State Department, worked for charities, was an educator and researched a wide array of social problems.
Among the issues she studied were foster care, the effect of welfare on family stability, obstacles to drug treatment for addicts, impoverished Jews, day care, obstacles to employment for welfare recipients, mental health services, welfare spending, family budgets and deterrents to prenatal care.
 
Director at New School
 Dr. Bernstein focused increasingly on the growing and entwined problems of teen-age mothers, single-parent families, poor education, school dropout and unemployment. Unless society "breaks the cycle of dependency and poverty," she said, "we are in danger of creating a permanent underclass."
On leaving government in 1979, she became the director of the Social Policy Research Institute at the New School for Social Research. The institute studied welfare, housing, health care, child neglect and abuse and services for the aged.
After retiring from the New School, she remained active in education as a trustee of the City University of New York.
Dr. Bernstein was born in New York City. After graduating from Hunter College, she earned a master's degree and a doctorate at Columbia.
Early in her career she was the chief of program and planning for Europe in the Foreign Operations Administration from 1951-53 and the research director for the Community Council of New York from 1953-61.
From 1961-68 she served as the chief of the State Department's office dealing with the United Nations on housing, health, children, welfare, urban affairs, development, education and job training. From 1969-75 she was the New School's research director on urban social problems and also editor of the City Almanac.
Her survivors include a brother, Hilliard, of Manhattan.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Mixed Trading for Dollar Despite U.S. Economic Data

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar ended mixed yesterday, as the currency markets paid little attention to a barrage of United States economic reports as well as comments from German officials defending high interest rates.
Gold prices rose 60 cents on the Commodity Exchange in New York, where bullion for current delivery settled at $330.50 an ounce. A late quote from the Republic National Bank said spot gold rose 50 cents, to $330.35. 
Technical factors exerted the most influence on the choppy market. Dealers said many players were more intent on squaring their month-end books than on taking new positions.
"What we're seeing is a distraction from dollar buying," John Lyman, senior customer dealer at Bank of Tokyo, said. "The market is not getting interest rate cuts out of Europe, so that triggered some selling." But he added that the dollar's relative strength yesterday in the face of hawkish comments on German interest rates suggested that the dollar "may be getting to the end of its correction."
 
Dollar: 1.5860 Marks
 In New York, the dollar settled at 1.5860 marks in late afternoon trading, barely down from 1.5869 marks Wednesday. Earlier in London, the dollar rose to 1.5860 marks, from 1.5838 marks Wednesday.
The dollar barely moved against the yen. In Tokyo, the dollar ended at 124.15 yen, slightly above the 124.00- yen level of late Wednesday. In London, it ended at 124.14 yen, up from 124.05 yen Wednesday. In New York, the dollar dipped to 124.15 yen, from 124.20 yen late Wednesday.
In London, the British pound recovered somewhat against the German mark but weakened against the dollar to settle at around $1.5100, down from $1.5130 late Wednesday. In New York, the pound rose to $1.5170, from $1.5119 Wednesday.

USX Sees Steel Back In Demand

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH, Jan. 28

 BODY:
The USX Corporation's chairman and chief executive, Charles A. Corry, said today that the company's steel orders had been rising sharply, up nearly 50 percent from the third quarter of 1992.
Steel orders are running in the mid- to upper-40,000 tons a day, compared with 26,000 to 27,000 tons a day in the third quarter, USX officials said. 
 At a news conference, Mr. Corry said the stronger orders, combined with a general pickup in the economy, an improvement in the diversified energy business and the imposition of duties on imported steel, would lead USX to a better year in 1993.
USX on Tuesday reported a loss of $1.83 billion for 1992. The company said its steel and energy subsidiaries were hit by a weak economy and by $1.66 billion in accounting charges. Overall sales slipped, falling to $17.84 billion from 1991's $18.83 billion.
Mr. Corry said his optimism for the steel sector was strengthened by a round of steel price increases last week, even though most earlier attempts to raise prices ultimately failed.
"I'm considerably more confident that they will stick," he said. "When you have that kind of demand for product and you have rather a fixed capacity to deliver it, that typically leads to stronger market prices for the products."
Steelmakers have repeatedly tried to raise prices for their products in the last two years, but they failed to win any increase until the beginning of this month, analysts said.
Two of the company's three separate stocks closed higher today. The USX-U.S. Steel Group gained 50 cents, to $37.125; USX-Marathon rose 62.5 cents, to $17.375, and USX-Delhi, the natural gas unit, was unchanged, at $16. All are traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

Ah, Heaven: A Big Game, A Jug of Beer and Thou

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV

 BODY:
SPORTS fans, you're in luck. Life sometimes is like a beer commercial.
Happy, handsome young people, cheerful and affectionate, engaged in friendly competition over a few brews, winners and losers united by the spirit of the game. No sore losers here. Waiter, bring us another round! 
 Such is the world of sports bars, those temples of spectator sports where life's little miseries can be forgotten in a sea of 19-inch video monitors and 6-foot projection televisions. The old tavern on the corner still exists, with its quirky television set perched up above the bar and tuned at the whim of the bartender, but in this era of specialization the place to go to catch the game (or games) is the sports bar. And with the Dallas Cowboys playing the Buffalo Bills in the Super Bowl on Sunday, this is a busy weekend for sports bars.
Probably any bar with more than one television can call itself a sports bar. But to really qualify, a sports bar must have at least one set visible from every single seat, and preferably more. That's because these are not simply Knicks fans flocking to these bars every night, but Rangers fans, St. John's fans, Michael Jordan fans, football fans of every stripe as well as sports fans who might, shall we say, have more than a rooting interest in a particular game.
But lest anybody be shocked -- shocked! -- that gambling is going on, it should be clear that sports bar patrons are not all sports nerds of the type that populate radio phone-in shows.
In fact, while most patrons seem to fall into that prosperous 25-to-40-year-old-male niche that beer advertisers so covet, many women also turn out, looking just as prosperous and having just as rowdy a good time.
Although television is important, there's more that goes into the true sports bar. There's food, there's drink, there's history and mythology, there's music, and there's religion.
First, the food. We're talking excess: Buffalo chicken wings, fried everything from mozzarella to calamari to potato skins, huge tureen-size salads complete with kitchen sinks, giant club sandwiches. We're talking burgers, burgers, burgers. Ribs, chili, shrimp and, for the faint-of-stomach, an occasional pasta dish. We're talking Mississippi mud pie, apple pie covered in gooey caramel, slabs of cheesecake and hot fudge sundaes with double helpings of whipped cream. We're talking antacids.
Perhaps easing the digestive process is the beverage of choice, beer. Most sports bars have a wide-ranging selection, from Budweiser to top imports to regional American brews. Precious little white wine drinking goes on in sports bars, thank you, although an increasingly gallant nod is made in the direction of those who prefer no alcohol. Prodding the appetite and fueling the competitive instinct at many sports bars are participant side shows: pool tables, basketball hoops and other games. The whoops and yelps of happy players abound.
All this is served up in an atmosphere of reverence for America's sports past. Framed photos of Hall of Fame ballplayers, cute autographed caricatures, witticisms (Yogi Berra and Damon Runyon are favored sources), old pennants. And then there are the shrines, homages to American sentimentality and economic clout. Behind bulletproof glass lies the bat used by Choo Choo Coleman to ground into a triple play in the hapless days of the New York Mets: yours for only $850! A basketball autographed by the assistant trainer of the New Jersey Nets: $120. A baseball jersey worn -- and apparently mended -- by Billy Martin when he played for the New York Yankees: priceless.
Treasured above all else, sacred in the culture of the sports bar, is anything touched by Mickey Mantle. Old Mantle baseball cards, old Mantle magazine covers, any Mantle newspaper picture, they all find there way onto the wall of sports bars. It's no coincidence that the classiest sports bar in New York is Mickey Mantle's.
Take this simple test: If somewhere -- in an old shoebox, in your childhood bedroom, in your den or car, even in your wallet -- you keep an old Mickey Mantle baseball card, any of these Manhattan sports bars are for you.
 
Sports on Broadway
 2182 Broadway, at 77th Street, (212) 874-7208. Open Mondays  through Thursdays, 5 P.M. to 1 A.M.; Fridays, 5 P.M. to 2 A.M.; Saturdays, noon to 2 A.M., and Sundays, noon to midnight.
This huge, black, cavernous bar was made for spectators. From one of the long tables in the middle of the open main room, you can watch two huge projection televisions. Behind the long black wood bar, six sets are lined up, as in a television producer's control booth, each tuned to a different event. Such an arrangement is a balm for fans suffering hand pain through overuse of the remote-control clicker, although the head-swiveling necessary for keeping track of a half-dozen different events may pose a new hazard: sports bar whiplash.
In the back, a stand of individual chairs and tables rises like bleachers up to a second floor, giving single spectators an opportunity to survey the entire scene. This is sports saturation, drawing serious fans from thick-necked former jocks gathering after work to weedy collegiate types.
From the second level, shouts from pool players and basketball shooters echo over the raucous atmosphere of bluff, back-slapping heartiness, interrupted only by those discordant moments when the Rangers fans cheer a goal just as the Knicks fans groan over a missed shot.
As far as the menu goes, the simpler the better. A simple shrimp cocktail ($7.50) was not simple enough. The four big shrimp were cold and tasteless, as if they hadn't been completely defrosted. Far better was the hamburger ($7.50), thick, juicy and cooked to order with crisp bacon, served with thick, fresh cottage fries, the skin sides fried to a tasty crisp. For dessert, pecan pie ($4.50) comes very sweet and very cold.

 381 Park Avenue South, at 27th Street, (212) 685-3636. Open Sundays through Thursdays, 11:30 A.M. to 1 A.M., Saturdays and Sundays, 11:30 A.M. to 4 A.M.
This new preppy fantasy, which opened just two months ago, caters to the golf and sailing set. Enter through a vestibule past what is to become a pro shop, selling equipment and memorabilia. Walk down a corridor past a private dining room and two simulated 18-hole golf courses, where players tee off into a computer projection of, say, the 18th hole at Pebble Beach. Pass the putting greens and pool tables. Pass the horseshoe-shaped bar, packed with a good-looking young crowd, and enter the vast, open dining room carpeted with artificial turf. Leroy Nieman-style scenes of golf, sailing and hunting are scattered about on the white walls.
The wooden tables, with form-fitting plastic garden chairs, are set wide enough apart to overcome the room's rowdy buzz. Projection televisions hang on the walls, while clusters of smaller sets are scattered around the room. Personable, jaunty waiters in polo shirts and shorts stride between the bar on one end and the open kitchen on the other.
The ubiquitous Buffalo chicken wings ($5.95) made a fine, thirst-inducing starter, meaty and nicely spicy with a mellow blue-cheese sauce. Spinach salad ($7.95), with mushrooms, bacon and hard-boiled egg, was as big as a spinnaker but needed a good dressing to meld the ingredients. A hamburger ($7.95) was decent enough but marred by those old bugaboos, a soggy roll and soggy fries. Sliced London broil bordelaise ($10.95), with delicious, buttery mashed potatoes, suggested the kitchen might be getting fancy, but, while the meat was tender enough, it was encased in a sauce more mushroom soup than bordelaise.
A thin slice of apple pie covered in caramel ($4.95) was surprisinglygood. The Park Avenue Country Club, unusual among sports bars, offers a nice selection of nonalcoholic cocktails.
Perhaps carrying the country club analog too far, this may be the only sports bar with restroom attendants. Yes, they expect tips.
 
Runyon's
 932 Second Avenue, at 50th Street, (212) 759-7800. Open daily, 11:30 A.M. to 4 A.M.
This relatively sedate spot -- a sports restaurant, as it bills itself -- draws an older crowd. In the spirit of its name, Runyon's is a joint. The walls are decorated haphazardly with newspaper clippings of sports favorites -- the Knicks, the Yankees, the Mets, back to the Brooklyn Dodgers -- they're all there.
No projection televisions or ear-splitting soundtracks here. Rather, there are low ceilings, tables with rattan chairs and vinyl banquettes, and small television monitors, with the sound turned off, placed so that no table is without a view.
Runyon's is the kind of place where everybody sitting at the long bar in front seems to know the bartender. Not everybody is here for sports. A group of women in the dimly lighted dining room compare notes on their jobs and love life, ignoring the television. An older man keeps one eye on the television, the other on a newspaper. A young man eats while reading a book. Two beer-drinking hockey fans quietly exult when the Rangers score.
The menu ranges beyond chicken wings, to include pastas, salads, veal dishes and seafood. The friendly, efficient waitresses even carry peppermills. Nonetheless, it's the atmosphere and the company that draw people to Runyon's; the food is incidental. A house salad ($2.75) is constructed of stiff, icy iceberg lettuce and prefab croutons. A hamburger ($7.95) was big but overdone, served with soft, soggy french fries. Linguine with white clam sauce ($9.50) was soupy and nondescript. Key lime pie ($4.50), though, was mellow and rich as cheesecake. Draft beer is served by the pint, and if they run out of beer there is another Runyon's right around the block.
 
The Sporting Club
 99 Hudson Street in TriBeCa, (212) 219-0900. Open daily, 11:30 A.M. to, depending on sporting events, 10:30 P.M. or later.
Immediately on entering this dark, packed bar, you are enveloped in pounding music. The Sporting Club, a sports bar with a disk jockey, is not a place to listen to a game.
It is a place to keep track of point spreads, though. On one wall is a huge electronic scoreboard, listing every game in any conceivable team sport. Dedicated bettors will keep one eye on the board, the other on one of the three projection television screens. Smaller monitors are placed strategically so that there are two games visible from every seat.
The dark paneled walls are covered with the usual sports memorabilia. The 1970's Yankees seem to be special favorites, with numerous portraits, including an oil of Billy Martin discreetly tucked into a back wall. The shouts of pool players, circled around two tables on one side of the bar, are occasionally heard over the music.
The house salad ($3.95) is huge but bland, with piles of lettuce, tomato, onion and mushrooms and good toasted croutons. One starter that sounded promising, shrimp brochette in a spicy Thai sauce ($7.95), was overcooked, with shrimp tough, vegetables soggy and a sauce of sesame oil and soy that was hardly spicy. A burger ($6.95) was big and beefy, as befitting a dish called "the George Steinbrenner." Key lime pie ($4.50) was light and tart, with a crunchy graham crust. Service was congenial despite the ear-splitting conditions.
 
Mickey Mantle's
 42 Central Park South, near the Avenue of the Americas, (212) 688-7777. Open daily, noon to 11 P.M., the bar until 1 A.M.
With its handsome blond wood floors and booths (pinstripe upholstery, naturally), marble tables, bright lighting and exuberant service, Mickey Mantle's is as much restaurant as bar. No video games, no shooting hoops.
Mantle's is the artiest crowd. Naturally, Mantle paraphernalia dominate the walls, with silkscreens, paintings, portraits, old uniforms and bats hanging everywhere. Unusual for sports bars, Mantle's also pays its respects to women's sports, with a large, prominent photo of the track stars Florence Griffith Joyner and Jackie Joyner-Kersee.
Small television sets, discreetly placed, are visible from each seat. Mantle's does a thriving tourist business, with fans of all ages coming to pay their respects, hoping to happen on sports celebrities, who do in fact show up from time to time. How many of them order the matzoh ball soup ($4.95), which seems as out of place in a sports bar as Wade Boggs does in a Yankee uniform? The wan chicken soup was a match for the bland baseball-size matzoh ball, which was still cold on one side.
An aberrant dish, one hopes, because the hamburger ($11.95) was pretty good, juicy and cooked to order with a helping of peppery waffle fries. A fudgy chocolate pecan bourbon pie ($5.25) was dessert overkill.
 
Play-by-Play
 4 Penn Plaza (at Madison Square Garden), (212) 465-5888. Open Mondays through Fridays, 11:30 A.M. to 2:30 P.M., and at various times for ticket-holders after events at the Garden.
The Play-by-Play is a special case, sort of a secret sports bar hidden in the Madison Square Garden complex. It is open to the public for lunch, to Madison Square Garden ticket-holders on event nights, and only to certain ticket-holders on nights when the Knicks or the Rangers are playing.
By day, the Play-by-Play, a handsome two-level bar and restaurant with a circular motif that mimics the garden, is a pleasant lunch spot. Video screens replay recent games or fights, or show tennis matches live from half way around the world. By night, after a Knicks game, however, it becomes a vibrant, splashy bar, pulsing with post-game excitement. Celebrities and athletes show up for a post-game television interview show, "Live From the Play-by-Play," that originates here.
While the requirements of the television show force audience participation at night -- producers mingle, calling for applause and appropriately rambunctious behavior -- it is all high-spirited fun, abetted by good bar food. Babyback ribs ($6.50 a half rack) are tender and meaty, dripping with smoky sauce. The M.S.G. griller ($8.95), chicken, beef and shrimp, grilled in a sweet hoisin sauce and served as kebabs with onions and peppers, was well cooked. A hamburger ($7.75) was juicy and served on a bready hard roll with seasoned waffle fries. For relief, there's the "Thai Cobb" salad ($8.75), cool grilled chicken breast over a tumble of greens with crumbled blue cheese, bacon, tomato and avocado.
Desserts are all appropriately rich and, given the heat of the television lights, melty.

The Price of 'Angels'
Among the complicating factors in the negotiations over bringing Tony Kushner's "Angels in America" to Broadway was, on the one hand, the playwright's stated intention to make the play affordable (and thus accessible) to a less affluent, less-than-traditional downtown audience and, on the other hand, the economic risk involved in staging a long, challenging and expensive work about AIDS. 
 Budgeted at $2 million, the first part of the play, "Millennium Approaches," is to open on April 29 at the 945-seat Walter Kerr Theater, a relatively small house. Part II, "Perestroika," is to begin rehearsals in July, with the same cast, and is scheduled to open, in repertory with Part I, in October. During part of the rehearsal period, the schedule of "Millennium Approaches" will be restricted to four performances a week.
This week, in what seems sure to arouse the ire of those who lament the cost of Broadway tickets, the producers announced the pricing plan intended to accommodate the conflicting needs. In addition to providing some inexpensive second-balcony seats -- $7.50 for Wednesday matinees; $15 on Monday through Thursday evenings, and $20 on Friday and Saturday nights -- to be sold only at the box office on the day of the performance, the plan includes a top price of $60 for seats on Friday and Saturday nights, the most expensive ticket ever for a non-musical Broadway show.
In addition, the producers said that for every ticket sold, $1 will be donated to Broadway Cares/ Equity Fights AIDS: about $8,000 for a week of sellouts. The show is also bound by agreement to provide discount tickets to subscribers of the New York Shakespeare Festival, which was originally scheduled to put on the play, and the New York Theater Workshop, which helped develop it.
"The economics of this show are onerous, to say the least," said Rocco Landesman, president of Jujamcyn Theaters, which owns the Kerr and is a producer of the show. "The appropriate price for this show would be $100, if the investors are going to have a decent shot at getting their money back."
Mr. Landesman said other measures had been taken to reward investors ("They should be called donors," he said) for their risk, including giving them 50 percent of the royalty pool instead of the usual 40 percent, and allowing them to recoup 120 percent of their investment before sharing profits with the producers. With all the discounting, the show will have a chance to recoup its investment in about 35 weeks, Mr. Landesman said.
Mr. Kushner said he was satisfied with these arrangements, which he hopes will regularly include discounted orchestra and mezzanine seats even after the obligations to the Shakespeare Festival and the Theater Workshop have been fulfilled.
"Basically, I don't think price should be a reason for anyone not to come see the show," he said. "The trick is to get the discount tickets to those who really need them, instead of to scalpers. That's what's still being worked out."
 
Will Success Spoil 'Anna Christie'?
 "Anna Christie," Eugene O'Neill's drama at the Roundabout Theater, starring Natasha Richardson, Liam Neeson and Rip Torn, has sold out its limited run, which was extended through Feb. 28, but anyone so inclined has one more shot to see the show. This week the producers announced a special benefit performance at midnight on Feb. 18. Proceeds for the "midnight matinee," as it's being billed, will go to Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS. Tickets are $75 and $100. Information: (212) 869-8400 or (212) 719-9393.
Meanwhile, the show's success may have its costs. Tickets have been in such demand that many Tony voters have found themselves sitting in the last three rows of the theater, and some are grumbling.
"I've never been treated this way in all my years as a voter," said Mort Mitosky, a longtime theater investor and a voter for 15 years. "There's no way you could involve yourself in the stage." Asked if he thought the seats would affect the awards, Mr. Mitosky, who said he left "Anna Christie" after the first act, answered: "Absolutely. If you can't engage yourself with the play, how can you vote?"
Byron Goldman, an investor who is another longtime voter, was less angry but no less disappointed. "I imagine that Ms. Richardson and Mr. Neeson will be nominated," he said. "It would be nice to be able to see their facial expressions so you could tell what you're voting for."
Of course, there are a lot of opinions out there. Asked if the seat assignment irritated him, the producer Morton Gottlieb replied: "In that theater, the farther up you go, the better it is. I always ask for seats in the last three rows."
 
Life in 'The Boiler Room'
 Reuben Gonzalez, a 40-year-old New Yorker, lives in Los Angeles now, where he's making a living tapping out contracted scripts for the movies. A playwright and a fiction writer, he admits he's seeking a medium for his realistic but hopeful tales of the Hispanic urban underclass, admits he's been frustrated by an unwillingness of publishers and theater and film producers to take on what he calls "my stories." But perhaps the tide is turning. At the moment, he's involved in talks with the producer Martin Brest ("Scent of a Woman") and the young director Matty Rich ("Straight Out of Brooklyn") for a film about a rehabilitative labor camp for young criminals. And his play, "The Boiler Room," is currently up at the Puerto Rican Traveling Theater at 304 West 47th Street. (Performances are in English Wednesday through Friday nights, in Spanish Saturdays and Sundays, matinees and evenings.)
A frankly autobiographical story, the play is about the travails of a Puerto Rican family in New York -- a mother, her borderline-hoodlum teen-age son and an upwardly aspiring daughter in her 20's -- trying to hang on after the death of the father, who had been a building superintendent. They live in the titular digs, where the boiler itself (frighteningly grandiose, in the current production) commands their lives. Indeed, it's the symbolism of the thing (along with a complicated, winning performance by Miriam Colon as the mother) that holds the play together.
"There's a line in the play that truthfully describes my life," said Mr. Gonzalez, who grew up in the Bronx and Spanish Harlem. "When the mother says, 'Twenty years I followed that man from basement to basement,' that's how it was. Once, we got a ground-floor apartment, and we thought we were in heaven. Of course, in retrospect it was a dump."
A seventh-grade dropout -- "I was suspended for two weeks, but after two weeks no one came looking for me, so I never went back" -- Mr. Gonzalez, like the young boy in the play, broke into cars, snatched purses, spent some time in jail. But eventually he saw life on the streets as a dead end.
"You get older, and the judges don't fool around with sentences," he said. "Either that or I was going to die."
So at age 21, he picked up, moved by himself to Weehawken, N.J., took a job as a stock clerk and set about reclaiming his life. Six years later, he walked into Fordham University, told his story to an admissions officer, passed an entrance exam and won a full scholarship.
"I don't know," he said. "I think I'm a pretty good role model."
A handsome, soft-spoken man with gray-streaked hair and a sense of perpetual befuddlement about him, Mr. Gonzalez said that his mother was much like the lost-seeming, vain but forcefully maternal character Ms. Colon brings to life in "The Boiler Room." His mother, who has returned to Puerto Rico and remarried, hasn't seen the play There's a videotape of it in Spanish, he said, but he's been hesitating about sending it.
"What do you think?" he said. "Should I?"
 
Comings and Goings
 Kevin Spacey and Frankie Faison are to appear in "Playland," the Athol Fugard play that will complete Manhattan Theater Club's Stage II season; it opens May 18. From March 22 through May 2, Stage II will present two one-actor plays in repertory: "Jenny Keeps Talking," by Richard Greenberg, starring Leslie Ayvazian as two estranged sisters, and Charlayne Woodard's "Pretty Fire," an autobiographical series of stories, presented by the author.
It looks as though "Jeffrey," Paul Rudnick's play about sex and love and gay men in the age of AIDS, already extended at the WPA Theater until Feb. 14, may have an afterlife. Kenneth Frankel, who, along with Steve Baruch and Tom and Jack Viertel, acquired the rights to the play before rehearsals began, said Wednesday that the four had made a contract offer to move the play to the Minetta Lane Theater in early March.
Meanwhile, David Henry Hwang's "Face Value," which has been homeless since it was determined that "Five Guys Named Moe" would not be vacating the Eugene O'Neill, is headed for the Cort Theater of the Shubert Organization.
The other possibility for "Face Value" had been the Brooks Atkinson, a Nederlander house. However, James M. Nederlander, president of the Nederlander Organization, confirmed his commitment to staging Lanford Wilson's play "Redwood Curtain," at the Atkinson this spring, though producers of the show have yet to fix an opening night.
Finally, David Mamet said this week that Treat Williams would replace William H. Macy as the harassing and/or harassed college professor in the playwright's "Oleanna" when Mr. Macy's contract expires three months from now. A spokesman for the show, Jim Randolph, said that Mr. Williams had expressed interest but no commitments had been made.
"It'll happen," Mr. Mamet said.

The play, the American premiere of Howard Barker's "Scenes From an Execution," runs through May 9.

Building on the Pain of a Past in China

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:

Bone
 By Fae Myenne Ng
 194 pages. Hyperion. $19.95.
"Remembering the past gives power to the present," says Leila Leong, the narrator of Fae Myenne Ng's incantatory first novel. "Memories do add up." Our memories, she continues, can't bring back the dead, "but they count to keep them from becoming strangers." 
 Moving backward in time like Harold Pinter's "Betrayal" or the Stephen Sondheim musical "Merrily We Roll Along," "Bone" is a memory-novel, a novel composed of Leila's memories of her family, and her family's memories of their past lives in China and their new lives in the United States. It is a meditation upon the circumstances surrounding the mysterious suicide of Leila's sister Ona and the endless reverberations that that death has had on the entire Leong clan.
As Leila tells us, she is the oldest of the three Leong daughters: Ona was the middle sister; Nina, the youngest. Leila's own father disappeared before her birth, and she regards Leon -- her mother's second husband, and the father of Ona and Nina -- as her own father.
All of the Leongs blame themselves for Ona's death. Leon thinks he's brought bad luck on the family by failing to honor a promise he made to his adoptive father to return his bones to China. Mah, the mother, worries that her own sins -- having an affair with her boss, Tommy Hon -- have doomed the family to unhappiness. And Leila berates herself for not having paid more attention to Ona's problems, for not figuring out that something was wrong.
All three sisters, we learn, have had a difficult time straddling their parents' circumscribed world in San Francisco's Chinatown and the bustling, contemporary world beyond. They feel at once suffocated by Mah and Leon's provincialism and guilty about the freedoms and luxuries they take for granted as young American women; at once resentful of their parents' enslavement to the past and wistful about the history that eludes them here in the United States.
"We're lucky, not like the bondmaids growing up in service, or the newborn daughters whose mouths were stuffed with ashes," Leila says. "The beardless, soft-shouldered eunuchs, the courtesans with the three-inch feet and the frightened child brides -- they're all stories to us. Nina, Ona and I, we're the lucky generation. Mah and Leon forced themselves to live through the humiliation in this country so that we could have it better. We know so little of the old country. We repeat the names of grandfathers and uncles, but they have always been strangers to us. Family exists only because somebody has a story, and knowing the story connects us to a history."
Each of the Leong daughters has tried to make her own separate peace with her past. Leila has remained at home, working as a counselor at a local school and keeping a watchful eye on her parents. Nina has fled Chinatown altogether: she has moved to New York and taken a job as an airline flight attendant. Ona has found herself stuck midway between the old world and the new: she works as a hostess at Trader Vic's, and dates Osvaldo, the son of her father's former partner and current nemesis. Under fierce pressure from her parents, she breaks off with Osvaldo, an event that will play a pivotal role in her eventual suicide.
The Romeo and Juliet story of Osvaldo and Ona isn't the only melodrama in the Leong family saga. As Leila unpeels the layers of her family's past, we learn that her parents' lives, too, have been fraught with passion, anger and sadness. Summarily abandoned by her first husband, Mah married Leon, knowing his job as a merchant sailor would keep him traveling a good part of the time: such a marriage, she reasoned, would enable her to calibrate her emotional commitment and protect herself from further hurt. Instead, there were loneliness and days and weeks of waiting, and Mah soon fell into an affair with her employer.
When Leon discovered the affair, he moved out of the house on Salmon Alley and took a shabby room at a nearby boarding house. There, he passes the time dreaming up get-rich-quick schemes and silly new inventions: electric sinks, cookie-tin clocks, cash registers with intercoms.
Though a rapprochement of sorts had been arranged, Leon and Mah have recently been estranged again by the very losses that should have made them partners in grief: their life savings in a failed business venture, and Ona, who leaped off the 13th floor of a nearby housing project.
Having grown up in San Francisco's Chinatown herself, Ms. Ng conjures the immigrant world of Mah and Leon with the affectionate knowledge of an insider and the observant unsentimentality of an outsider. She conveys to the reader the incredible hardship of these characters' lives: the long years spent in sweatshops and kitchens and laundry rooms, the hours and hours spent waiting in lines for Social Security and unemployment compensation. We are made to see, through the eyes of Leila, both the remarkable perseverance of her parents in the face of so much difficulty, and the degree to which that perseverance has been built, in equal parts, on naivete and genuine courage.
Blessed with a poet's gift for metaphor and a reporter's eye for detail, Ms. Ng writes with grace, authority and grit. The reader eagerly awaits her next book.

N.Y.R.A. Warns of Enormous Deficits

BYLINE: By JOSEPH DURSO

 BODY:
Officials of the New York Racing Association, renewing their proposals to restructure horse racing in the state, predicted yesterday that the sport could produce a deficit of $58 million a year within five years unless changes were made.
Specifically, they called for the merger of the state's six Off-Track Betting corporations under the racing association's control, the reduction of the state's tax on bets and the suspension of racing in New York for six weeks each winter. 
 The prediction was made Wednesday in testimony during a closed meeting of the Governor's Commission on Racing in the 21st Century and was made public yesterday at Aqueduct race track by Gerard J. McKeon, president of the N.Y.R.A.
For the last year, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has been criticizing the association for its business practices and demanding that it reduce costs and increase profits transferred to the state. Lately, he has been calling for private ownership of the racing business. The Governor appointed a nine-member commission last fall to conduct hearings on the structure of racing, and it is expected to report back to him in the spring.
Vincent Tese, the state's director of economic development and chairman of the Governor's commission, said through a spokesman that the commission had no comment at this time on the N.Y.R.A. proposals.
"We have no reaction yet," said the spokesman, Steve Villano, vice president of the commission. "We're still in the process of reviewing the materials they offered so that we can complete our report to the Governor."
The racing association, created in 1955, operates under a state franchise to conduct racing at Belmont Park, Aqueduct and Saratoga. The franchise expires in the year 2000, but bids will be taken starting in 1997 from groups interested in operating thoroughbred racing in the state.
 
$3 Million Loss in '92
 Officials of the association testified last Nov. 10 in a public hearing, and again on Wednesday in executive session. At his briefing yesterday, McKeon said: "Our presentation in November was philosophical, not tactical. The commission asked us to follow it with a business plan. This is it."
"We agree with Governor Cuomo," he said, "that racing should be run by a private corporation. Government should not be in the racing business."
But he emphasized that the racing association fits the Governor's definition, and warned that racing was already costing the state money and would cost even more unless basic changes were made in the pattern of taking and taxing bets. During 1992, he said, the combined operations of the racing association and the Offtrack Betting corporations resulted in a deficit of $3 million.
"We project that by the year 1997," McKeon said, "if the current structure is held intact, combined N.Y.R.A. and OTB operations will lose $58 million, versus the $46 million earned 10 years earlier. And that doesn't even assume any proliferation in casino gambling or Keno."
McKeon proposed several strategies to achieve a "turnaround of $100 million in five years." They involved the takeover of OTB and the closing of many OTB shops, a new emphasis on home-telephone and teletheater betting and a drop in the takeout on bets from 17 percent to 14 percent to return more money to the bettor and the horsemen.
"Most OTB stores in Brooklyn and Queens are unprofitable because they don't have TV pictures," he said. "Under our plan, we would eliminate many of the stores, but the rest would all carry races on TV. We offer a stage where the main players come. The horsemen and fans have not been faring well."

 BODY:
Thirty-five Hispanic women from government, corporate board rooms, small businesses and universities across the United States will meet in Washington next week to talk about ethnic and sexual barriers to career advancement.
The chairwoman of the conference, the National Hispanic Women's Summit, is MARIA ELENA TORANO, chief executive of META, a Miami environmental and management concern, who participated in President Clinton's economic conference last month in Little Rock, Ark. "All 35 have accepted invitations to the Feb. 6 summit," she said. 
 They include Dr. Elsa Gomez, president of Kean College in Union, N.J.; Miriam Santos, City Treasurer of Chicago, and Leticia Quezada, president of the Los Angeles school board. The conference speaker will be Maria Echaveste, deputy director of personnel for Mr. Clinton's transition team.
"The glass ceiling restraining Hispanic-American women is even thicker and harder to break than that holding back other women," Ms. Torano said. "By the time our summit ends, we'll have a plan to break through that ceiling."

HEADLINE: Stop the Porn Explosion

BYLINE: By Charles Millard; Charles Millard, Republican-Liberal, is a member of the New York City Council from the Upper East Side.

 BODY:
H ow do you explain to a child that the Doll House across the street is not for children but is a topless bar with lap dancing? Or that the movie "Edward Pe-nishands" is not an instructional toilet-training video?
Residential areas across the country have recently been inundated with adult video stores and topless and even bottomless bars. The problem is difficult: freedom of speech must be respected, but no one wants advertisements for "Debbie Does Dallas" plastered on neighborhood walls. 
 Americans have been taught a healthy respect for the First Amendment. We hesitate to express opposition to pornography and are loath to regulate it. But New York City should follow the lead of other municipalities by issuing zoning regulations to protect neighborhoods from the crime and quality-of-life problems that come with it.
Since 1989, sex businesses in midtown Manhattan have increased by nearly 40 percent. In Chelsea, community groups have demonstrated against a growing concentration of adult video stores; on East 53d Street, two such businesses opened within 30 yards of each other in the same month; a few blocks north, around the corner from an "upscale" topless bar, the owners of a soon-to-be vacated restaurant have received only three offers to occupy the space, each from a topless establishment; and in Queens, a topless bar stopped serving alcohol so it could ignore State Liquor Authority regulations and go bottomless.
Several factors are blamed for this explosion of sex businesses. Voyeurism and masturbation are forms of safe sex in the age of AIDS. People have VCR's. In recessions, landlords will rent to anyone who can pay. And in New York, cleanup of 42d Street has pushed these businesses to other areas.
Regulating the content of these businesses violates the First Amendment. To avoid such problems, some officials advocate trying to persuade sex businesses to operate more discreetly. But the voluntary approach rarely works. If getting rid of lurid signs and flashing lights were good business, owners would do it on their own. Prurience is profitable; sex sells.
Nonetheless, in Young v. American Mini-Theatres and in City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the use of zoning laws to restrict sex businesses. Paradoxically, it is not permissible to regulate these establishments simply because they are offensive -- though it should come as no surprise that businesses that degrade women and encourage misogynistic violence would generate an increase in crime and prostitution.
Rather, zoning codes are intended to address quality-of-life issues. They may impose reasonable time, place and manner restrictions on sex businesses if it can be shown that the businesses generate social problems. While zoning changes cannot prevent the blatant exploitation of women, they can address other negative effects. In Detroit, adult theaters cannot be within 500 feet of a residential area. In Buffalo, sex businesses must be 1,000 feet apart. And in Boston, these establishments can only be located in the infamous "combat zone."
Why does New York City lag behind other cities in efforts to combat the ill effects of sex businesses? The sex industry is powerful. It generates billions of dollars each year, and it benefits from the protection of not only the First Amendment but, occasionally, of organized crime as well. In addition, political correctness seems to demand an unthinking fealty to free expression without regard for its negative effects -- even when the Constitution allows us to regulate them.
A year ago, Councilman Walter McCaffrey of Queens and I introduced legislation to keep certain sex businesses 500 feet away from residentially zoned areas. Yet no progress had been made on the proposal in the City Council, nor has Mayor David Dinkins shown any support.
Instead, the Department of Consumer Affairs wants to get out of the business of regulating topless bars completely because the constitutional issues are so complex. Thus, while the department advocates a law against loud discos within 200 feet of a legal residence, nothing is done to address topless or bottomless dancing establishments, no matter where they are.
We are fortunate to live in a country that protects its citizens' rights, and the First Amendment is the paramount protection. But responsible lawmaking requires a careful, nuanced balancing of competing interests. So Debbie may do Dallas -- but not in New York City's neighborhoods.

HEADLINE: The People Are Heard, at Least Those Who Call Talk Radio

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

 BODY:
It is becoming a familiar rite of democracy in the talk show age.
An issue, usually one with visceral appeal, becomes the topic of the moment on AM radio. Within days, or even hours, the Capitol switchboard in Washington is flooded with calls . 
 This rite was performed to great effect last week, when Zoe Baird was forced to withdraw her nomination to be Attorney General. Now it may be under way again.
Earlier this week, on talk radio stations across the country, the issue of homosexuals in the military was the No. 1 topic. By Wednesday, a near-record number of callers had phoned the Capitol to register their opinions.
To be sure, there is no way to draw a direct connection between the message that goes out over talk radio and the message that is delivered to Capitol Hill. Indeed, some right wing Christian groups, which have made opposition to gay rights the main focus of their grass-roots organizing, say their efforts have generated the outcry against President Clinton's position. And some issues simply strike such an emotional chord with the public that people act on their own.
 
Gathering Strength
 But among politicians, there is a sense that the talk shows are increasingly potent in American politics.
"Congress believes in the interactive phenomenon," said Michael Deaver, a former top aide to President Reagan. "They feel the people feel this may be their new franchise."
Senator James M. Jeffords, Republican of Vermont, said that during his 18 years in Washington the number of calls and letters he receives had drastically increased. He called talk radio a significant factor.
"Rush Limbaugh is a factor now," he said. "No question he generates calls and letters." Mr. Limbaugh's syndicated program has by far the largest following of any talk show nationally.
There are now more than 800 radio stations in the country that have a talk or talk-news format, practically double the number there were just five years ago and four times as many as there were in the early 1980's.
In part, the rise of talk radio is a product of economics: AM stations are looking for ways to compete with FM stations, which, with better sound quality, have taken over music radio. But the phenomenon also seems to reflect a growing disenchantment with the so-called establishment media.
Since the beginning of the week, the issue of homosexuals in the military has been the hot topic among radio talk show hosts of all political persuasions. Such is the fast-burning nature of debate on talk radio, though, that by yesterday there already was a sense that the topic had started to cool.
"It's still topic A," Michael Harrison, said who has a talk program on WTIC in Hartford. "But it won't be for long." On his Wednesday night program, he said, one out of five calls "were protest calls against the topic being this big."
While the calls to Congress have been overwhelmingly opposed to lifting the military ban on homosexuals, those on the talk shows seem to have been somewhat more mixed.
Barry Young, at KFYI in Phoenix, who opposes lifting the ban, said his calls had been heavily against the President. But Mr. Harrison, who favors lifting the ban, said his calls had been roughly even.
"There's a difference between that which is true, legitimate public opinion and that which is activist zealots overwhelming the air waves," Mr. Harrison said. In the case of opposition to homosexuals in the military, he said, "I don't think it's so clear which it is."
An informal survey of talk radio shows across the country yielded a wide range of opinions among both callers and hosts, couched in language that ran from calmly measured to wildly inflammatory.
Yesterday afternoon, Robert Namer, host of an afternoon talk show on WASO in Covington, La., opened a discussion of homosexuals in the military by saying: "This arrogant Clinton -- this guy is so insensitive. I have figured it out. Either his wife's a lesbian, or he is homosexual." He urged listeners to "get on the phone and call Washington and keep jamming" to protest the President's plan, and twice he read off the White House switchboard number.
In New York yesterday morning, former Mayor Ed Koch, host of a talk show on WABC, tried to steer callers away from the topic, as did Bob Grant, host of an afternoon show on the same station. But often even their own conversation drifted back.
Shortly after 3:30 P.M., a caller named Tom phoned Mr. Grant, wanting to talk about an incident from his own military career.
 
Talk Show Host's Nightmare
 "What incident do you have to share with us?" Mr. Grant interrupted him.
But then Mr. Grant went on: "I woke up this morning in a cold sweat, thinking that all of my listeners are World War II veterans who had to take a shower with a soldier who is double-gated. These old geezers call up and say, 'I don't want to have to fight in the foxhole with these people.' There are no more foxholes."
On Wednesday, Michael Jackson, a morning talk show host on Los Angeles's KABC, pointed out to his listeners that the military's ban on homosexuals had not become official policy until 1982. That prompted some callers to change their opinions.
"I was against the idea, but if the military tolerated them before 1982, they can tolerate them now," said one male caller, who did not give his name.
Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for Communications at the University of Pennsylvania and an expert on political communications, said that she was concerned that the radio talk shows were more than just communicating public opinion on the issue of homosexuals in the military: they were also helping to formulate it. And she noted that those who oppose homosexuals in the military may feel more strongly about the issue, and hence be more likely to call in about the topic, than those who feel the opposite, creating the illusion over overwhelming opposition.
"There's a phenomenon that moves people toward the consensus position," she said. "The danger is you may be creating a false consensus."

HEADLINE: At the Bar;
Prefering more red ink to more black eyes, the bar association hires an image maker

BYLINE: By David Margolick

 BODY:
During the inaugural festivities for President Clinton, Michael T. Scanlon Jr. walked into one of his favorite Washington restaurants. "Anybody here heard any good lawyer jokes recently?" he asked. There was silence. "See!" Mr. Scanlon declared. "It's working already!"
"It" is Mr. Scanlon's mission to burnish the battered image of the nation's lawyers. To him the problem was neatly reflected in the election, when the Democrats refrained from lawyer-bashing, he says, only because the Republicans had beaten them to it. Though the Republicans lost, a nevertheless chastened American Bar Association hired Mr. Scanlon as its first public relations guru. 
 At first blush, another high-priced bureaucrat is precisely what the bar group does not need. Even association leaders like R. William Ide 3d of Atlanta, the incoming president, admit that the 370,000-member organization is awash in apparatchiks. Moreover, battered by a bad economy and 3,850 resignations over its endorsement of abortion rights, the A.B.A. is facing a $4.3 million deficit in its current budget.
The financial problem has grown so serious that the organization has laid off dozens of staff members. It has also cut a variety of corners, from scaling back its use of Federal Express deliveries to serving hors d'oeuvres instead of a full meal at last year's Christmas party.
Thus, bringing in a media maven, and paying him $170,000 a year, did not sit well with some A.B.A. employees. But the bar group's president, J. Michael McWilliams of Baltimore, insists that the move will ultimately pay for itself, both in increased membership and in enhanced good will among a skeptical public. In recent years, the only time the public seemed to hear about the A.B.A. was when Dan Quayle came before it to attack the legal profession.
"I'd choose to describe it not as P.R. but a communications strategy to insure that members, nonmembers and the public have an accurate picture of what the A.B.A. stands for and the work that it does," Mr. McWilliams said. "It's amazing how, for a bunch of lawyers, what poor communicators we've been."
While Mr. Quayle's broadside did not prompt the A.B.A. campaign, which began last spring, Mr. Scanlon said it served as "a wake-up call" to the profession.
"In the short term it ruffled a lot of feathers," he said, "but in the long term it may serve as the low-water mark, and from here on out a rising tide might take place."
Mr. Scanlon, the son and stepson of lawyers, is a man with a mania for metaphors. After two months spent "climbing up the greasy learning curve," he said by telephone from the group's headquarters in Chicago, he is ready to reach out on behalf of the insular A.B.A.
"We end up talking to the choir all the time," said Mr. Scanlon, formerly the executive vice president of the Petroleum Marketing Education Foundation. "It's time to talk to the congregation, and maybe to the folks on the sidewalk."
If one were to conduct a computer analysis of Mr. Scanlon's vocabulary, no word would pop up more often than "pro-active." Too often, he contends, the A.B.A. has sat on the sidelines, rousing itself only when pummeled. A survey of the association's members by the poll taker Peter Hart corroborated Mr. Scanlon's sense that the nation's lawyers are tired of being punching bags.
"Rather than wait for the issue to sweep over us and drown us out, we're going to be surfing in on the wave," Mr. Scanlon said.
He insists that he has no plans to conduct a public relations campaign ("Whitewashing an old stone fence doesn't make it any stronger," he said), but his description of what is in store sounds suspiciously like one.
Eventually, he said, it could include more television programs, public-service announcements and even paid advertisements. He also wants bar presidents, few of whom ever leave their fingerprints on the public consciousness, to become more vocal.
"We're going to try to show people that there's a face behind all these lawyers, that the profession is not just arguing in a courtroom but dealing with people's problems and solving them on a daily basis," he said.
Two lawyers, neither with any apparent professional self-hatred, are now living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. "We haven't had a lawyer in the White House for some time, and we now have two who are very visible," Mr. Scanlon said. "If they are anything close to successful, it can only help the profession overall."
But Mr. Scanlon acknowledges that the task of making America's lawyers more lovable will not be simple, and he is settling in for the long haul. "I'm 45 years old, so I've got 20 years of work left," he said. "The good Lord willing, and if the creek don't rise, maybe I'll spend all 20 of those years here."

HEADLINE: Two New Law Journals Plan To Focus on Asian Americans

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 28

 BODY:
University of California students in Los Angeles and Berkeley are working separately to produce the nation's first two journals that will focus on legal issues of concern to Asian Americans.
The undertakings reflect in part the growth in the number of Asian-American law students and lawyers. In 1991, the latest year for which data are available, 5,028 Asian Americans were enrolled in accredited American law schools, up from 1,755 in 1981, according to the American Bar Association. 
 The plans for the journals also reflect the view among many Asian-American lawyers and law students that the issues that matter to them particularly have long been neglected by law publications. Both journals are scheduled to start publishing in the fall.
The Berkeley journal plans to draw on a national group of scholars and tackle more global issues, like international trade, and adopt an international perspective.
"What we're hoping to do is be a catalyst and a forum," said Nicole Wong, a second-year law student at Berkeley and editor in chief of the university's Asian Law Journal. "We want to be a forum to raise issues that have been bottled up inside people and a catalyst for people to think about issues they haven't thought about."
The U.C.L.A. journal will be written mostly by students and focus on issues of particular interest to Southern California.
"At U.C.L.A., there's the Black Law Journal, which discusses African-American issues, there's the Chicano Law Review, which deals with Latino issues, and other journals that deal with trade and the environment," said Theresa Han, a third-year law student at U.C.L.A. and co-editor in chief of the university's Asian American and Pacific Islands Law Journal. "What we're talking about are issues that specifically affect the Asian-American community, like voting rights, how admission policies at universities affect Asian Americans or how civil-rights legislation affects Asian Americans."
Both journals have adopted as their approach to legal analysis a young and controversial area of legal scholarship known as "critical race theory." The theory holds that to properly understand law in American society, one must recognize that it has systematically subordinated non-whites.
"Law is not just neutral, to be used by good and bad people," said Angela Harris, a Berkeley law professor and adviser to the Asian Law Journal. She noted, for example, how economic competition between Chinese and white laborers near the turn of the century led to the Exclusionary Acts, which suspended Chinese immigration. "Subordination of people of color is woven into the law," she said.

HEADLINE: On Stage, and Off

BYLINE: By Bruce Weber

 BODY:

The Price of 'Angels'
Among the complicating factors in the negotiations over bringing Tony Kushner's "Angels in America" to Broadway was, on the one hand, the playwright's stated intention to make the play affordable (and thus accessible) to a less affluent, less-than-traditional downtown audience and, on the other hand, the economic risk involved in staging a long, challenging and expensive work about AIDS. 
 Budgeted at $2 million, the first part of the play, "Millennium Approaches," is to open on April 29 at the 945-seat Walter Kerr Theater, a relatively small house. Part II, "Perestroika," is to begin rehearsals in July, with the same cast, and is scheduled to open, in repertory with Part I, in October. During part of the rehearsal period, the schedule of "Millennium Approaches" will be restricted to four performances a week.
This week, in what seems sure to arouse the ire of those who lament the cost of Broadway tickets, the producers announced the pricing plan intended to accommodate the conflicting needs. In addition to providing some inexpensive second-balcony seats -- $7.50 for Wednesday matinees; $15 on Monday through Thursday evenings, and $20 on Friday and Saturday nights -- to be sold only at the box office on the day of the performance, the plan includes a top price of $60 for seats on Friday and Saturday nights, the most expensive ticket ever for a non-musical Broadway show.
In addition, the producers said that for every ticket sold, $1 will be donated to Broadway Cares/ Equity Fights AIDS: about $8,000 for a week of sellouts. The show is also bound by agreement to provide discount tickets to subscribers of the New York Shakespeare Festival, which was originally scheduled to put on the play, and the New York Theater Workshop, which helped develop it.
"The economics of this show are onerous, to say the least," said Rocco Landesman, president of Jujamcyn Theaters, which owns the Kerr and is a producer of the show. "The appropriate price for this show would be $100, if the investors are going to have a decent shot at getting their money back."
Mr. Landesman said other measures had been taken to reward investors ("They should be called donors," he said) for their risk, including giving them 50 percent of the royalty pool instead of the usual 40 percent, and allowing them to recoup 120 percent of their investment before sharing profits with the producers. With all the discounting, the show will have a chance to recoup its investment in about 35 weeks, Mr. Landesman said.
Mr. Kushner said he was satisfied with these arrangements, which he hopes will regularly include discounted orchestra and mezzanine seats even after the obligations to the Shakespeare Festival and the Theater Workshop have been fulfilled.
"Basically, I don't think price should be a reason for anyone not to come see the show," he said. "The trick is to get the discount tickets to those who really need them, instead of to scalpers. That's what's still being worked out."
 
Will Success Spoil 'Anna Christie'?
 "Anna Christie," Eugene O'Neill's drama at the Roundabout Theater, starring Natasha Richardson, Liam Neeson and Rip Torn, has sold out its limited run, which was extended through Feb. 28, but anyone so inclined has one more shot to see the show. This week the producers announced a special benefit performance at midnight on Feb. 18. Proceeds for the "midnight matinee," as it's being billed, will go to Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS. Tickets are $75 and $100. Information: (212) 869-8400 or (212) 719-9393.
Meanwhile, the show's success may have its costs. Tickets have been in such demand that many Tony voters have found themselves sitting in the last three rows of the theater, and some are grumbling.
"I've never been treated this way in all my years as a voter," said Mort Mitosky, a longtime theater investor and a voter for 15 years. "There's no way you could involve yourself in the stage." Asked if he thought the seats would affect the awards, Mr. Mitosky, who said he left "Anna Christie" after the first act, answered: "Absolutely. If you can't engage yourself with the play, how can you vote?"
Byron Goldman, an investor who is another longtime voter, was less angry but no less disappointed. "I imagine that Ms. Richardson and Mr. Neeson will be nominated," he said. "It would be nice to be able to see their facial expressions so you could tell what you're voting for."
Of course, there are a lot of opinions out there. Asked if the seat assignment irritated him, the producer Morton Gottlieb replied: "In that theater, the farther up you go, the better it is. I always ask for seats in the last three rows."
 
Life in 'The Boiler Room'
 Reuben Gonzalez, a 40-year-old New Yorker, lives in Los Angeles now, where he's making a living tapping out contracted scripts for the movies. A playwright and a fiction writer, he admits he's seeking a medium for his realistic but hopeful tales of the Hispanic urban underclass, admits he's been frustrated by an unwillingness of publishers and theater and film producers to take on what he calls "my stories." But perhaps the tide is turning. At the moment, he's involved in talks with the producer Martin Brest ("Scent of a Woman") and the young director Matty Rich ("Straight Out of Brooklyn") for a film about a rehabilitative labor camp for young criminals. And his play, "The Boiler Room," is currently up at the Puerto Rican Traveling Theater at 304 West 47th Street. (Performances are in English Wednesday through Friday nights, in Spanish Saturdays and Sundays, matinees and evenings.)
A frankly autobiographical story, the play is about the travails of a Puerto Rican family in New York -- a mother, her borderline-hoodlum teen-age son and an upwardly aspiring daughter in her 20's -- trying to hang on after the death of the father, who had been a building superintendent. They live in the titular digs, where the boiler itself (frighteningly grandiose, in the current production) commands their lives. Indeed, it's the symbolism of the thing (along with a complicated, winning performance by Miriam Colon as the mother) that holds the play together.
"There's a line in the play that truthfully describes my life," said Mr. Gonzalez, who grew up in the Bronx and Spanish Harlem. "When the mother says, 'Twenty years I followed that man from basement to basement,' that's how it was. Once, we got a ground-floor apartment, and we thought we were in heaven. Of course, in retrospect it was a dump."
A seventh-grade dropout -- "I was suspended for two weeks, but after two weeks no one came looking for me, so I never went back" -- Mr. Gonzalez, like the young boy in the play, broke into cars, snatched purses, spent some time in jail. But eventually he saw life on the streets as a dead end.
"You get older, and the judges don't fool around with sentences," he said. "Either that or I was going to die."
So at age 21, he picked up, moved by himself to Weehawken, N.J., took a job as a stock clerk and set about reclaiming his life. Six years later, he walked into Fordham University, told his story to an admissions officer, passed an entrance exam and won a full scholarship.
"I don't know," he said. "I think I'm a pretty good role model."
A handsome, soft-spoken man with gray-streaked hair and a sense of perpetual befuddlement about him, Mr. Gonzalez said that his mother was much like the lost-seeming, vain but forcefully maternal character Ms. Colon brings to life in "The Boiler Room." His mother, who has returned to Puerto Rico and remarried, hasn't seen the play There's a videotape of it in Spanish, he said, but he's been hesitating about sending it.
"What do you think?" he said. "Should I?"
 
Comings and Goings
 Kevin Spacey and Frankie Faison are to appear in "Playland," the Athol Fugard play that will complete Manhattan Theater Club's Stage II season; it opens May 18. From March 22 through May 2, Stage II will present two one-actor plays in repertory: "Jenny Keeps Talking," by Richard Greenberg, starring Leslie Ayvazian as two estranged sisters, and Charlayne Woodard's "Pretty Fire," an autobiographical series of stories, presented by the author.
It looks as though "Jeffrey," Paul Rudnick's play about sex and love and gay men in the age of AIDS, already extended at the WPA Theater until Feb. 14, may have an afterlife. Kenneth Frankel, who, along with Steve Baruch and Tom and Jack Viertel, acquired the rights to the play before rehearsals began, said Wednesday that the four had made a contract offer to move the play to the Minetta Lane Theater in early March.
Meanwhile, David Henry Hwang's "Face Value," which has been homeless since it was determined that "Five Guys Named Moe" would not be vacating the Eugene O'Neill, is headed for the Cort Theater of the Shubert Organization.
The other possibility for "Face Value" had been the Brooks Atkinson, a Nederlander house. However, James M. Nederlander, president of the Nederlander Organization, confirmed his commitment to staging Lanford Wilson's play "Redwood Curtain," at the Atkinson this spring, though producers of the show have yet to fix an opening night.
Finally, David Mamet said this week that Treat Williams would replace William H. Macy as the harassing and/or harassed college professor in the playwright's "Oleanna" when Mr. Macy's contract expires three months from now. A spokesman for the show, Jim Randolph, said that Mr. Williams had expressed interest but no commitments had been made.
"It'll happen," Mr. Mamet said.

GlenFed Will Miss A Payment

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 28

 BODY:
GlenFed Inc., parent of the nation's fifth-largest savings and loan association, said today that it had run short of cash and would be unable to make a $4.6 million debt payment due in March, which could result in the company being forced into bankruptcy by its bondholders.
In addition, GlenFed announced a $79.4 million loss for its fiscal second quarter, ended Dec. 31, compared with earnings of $27.6 million in the comparable period a year earlier. The results reflect a $77 million loan-loss provision in the most recent quarter, as the company's nonperforming assets climbed 6 percent. 
 GlenFed's capital, which had been depleted by two years of heavy losses, was further eroded by the quarter's loss. That led the Office of Thrift Supervision to impose even harsher operating restrictions on GlenFed's Glendale Federal Bank, the company said today. While before, GlenFed's potential acquisitions needed regulatory approval, now so do the level of the company's interest rates and executive salaries.
The parent of Glendale Federal has been under regulatory pressure since last March to meet new capital requirements by June 30 or risk seizure. It has proposed a restructuring plan based on asset sales or a merger, but analysts say chances of a capital infusion remain slim if losses from bad loans continue unabated.
Stephen J. Trafton, GlenFed's chairman and chief executive, said he was optimistic the looming default could be averted after negotiations with GlenFed's bondholders, who control $59.9 million in securities.
 
 
'Best Course of Action'
 "We've advised them their best course of action is to stand still and wait for the recapitalization," he said.
In its first major step toward meeting new capital requirements, GlenFed also said today that it had begun an exchange with bondholders for preferred stock that would inject $128 million into the company after taxes.
Even so, Mr. Trafton said the company must still raise up to $450 million to meet regulatory requirements. "If GlenFed is unable to raise the capital -- and it will be a very difficult task -- it is possible the institution will face seizure, a liquidation that will cost us as taxpayers $3 billion to $4 billion," he said.
The holding company's cash crunch began last March when dividends paid by its banking subsidiary were suspended when the company failed to meet capital requirements. Its cash was further depleted when regulators forced GlenFed to repay its thrift $2.3 million in holding company expenses in the recent quarter.
Peter Treadway, a savings and loan analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, said the company's best hope for survival lay in winning a settlement in its lawsuit against the Government over an accounting procedure.

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Holding Down the Costs Of Buying Treasuries

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
WITH yields on Treasury securities scraping bottom -- this week the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond yielded just percent, a six-year low -- the costs of investing in these securities count all the more.
Do you get the best payoff buying Treasuries directly from the Federal Government? From stockbrokers? In mutual funds? Here's a quick review of the options , with some strategies to increase yields. 
 People who buy Treasury bills, bonds and notes are making loans to the Government, which uses the money to finance the budget deficit.
Treasury bills, usually called "T-bills," mature in 3, 6 or 12 months. The minimum investment is $10,000, with additional investments sold in increments of $5,000.
T-bills are sold at a discount, meaning that you pay less than the full face value of the bill. When they mature, the Government buys them back at par, or face value. Your profit equals the difference between what you paid and the par value of the T-bill (or its market value, if you sell before maturity).
By contrast, you can buy Treasury notes and bonds for as little as $1,000 but you tie up your money much longer. Treasury notes mature in 1 to 10 years; bonds, even longer.
Unlike T-bills, however, bonds and notes are sold at face value so investors must write a check for the full amount. Interest is paid every six months.
The bonds pay a stated coupon rate, or interest rate, but the yield depends on the price paid for the bond. Yields are reduced when bonds sell for more than par value, or 100. Last week, a five-year Treasury note with a coupon rate of 8.125 percent sold for $109.75, so its actual yield is 5.87 percent.
Factor in the tax savings, too. Interest paid by Treasuries is subject to Federal tax, but is free of state and local taxes. You can defer the Federal income taxes due by buying T-bills that mature the following year because none of the interest would be taxed until then.
Because they are backed by the Government, Treasuries carry virtually no credit risk. However they are subject to market risk. When interest rates rise, the prices of Treasuries fall, and vice versa. The longer the term of the security, the more prices fall when rates rise. You can eliminate market risk completely by holding the Treasury securities to their maturity.
Still, many advisers recommend that individuals stay on the shorter end of the maturity spectrum.
Very conservative investors should own two-year securities, and those willing to accept slightly more risk for more yield might venture out five to eight years, said Maria Crawford Scott, who edits the American Association of Individual Investors Journal, in Chicago. She advises leaving longer issues to institutional investors because of the greater volatility.
Because interest rates have nowhere to go but up, using a "staggered maturity" approach is particularly valuable, says Lewis J. Altfest, a New York City financial planner.He advises splitting a $75,000 portfolio into three lots of $25,000, which would then be invested in 3- , 7- and 12-year issues. The money is rolled over as each matures, creating a constant stream of money available for reinvestment at the then-prevailing rate.
What's the best way to buy Treasuries? The Treasury Department sells Treasuries at auction. Prices are based on competitive bids for specific issues submitted by institutions and professional traders. Individual investors submit noncompetitive bids, meaning that they simply request securities without specifying prices, and then receive the average of the competitive bids.
You can buy Treasuries without paying a middleman through the "Treasury Direct" program. To participate, request the forms and information needed from the Federal Reserve office nearest you (in New York, 212 720-5000).
One problem is that buyers of small lots sacrifice some yield in the form of "odd lot" markups. Last week a one-year T-bill due February 1994 with a coupon rate of 6.875 sold at 103.375, yielding 3.61 percent for million-dollar investors but only 2.77 percent for a $5,000 lot and 3.14 for $10,000 worth, Mr. Altfest figured.
On the other hand, buying direct lets you avoid paying stockbrokers' fees. Merrill Lynch charges $50; Charles Schwab & Company, a discount broker, charges a flat $39 for all Treasury transactions, a hefty fee for small purchases.
However, because the Federal Reserve maintains no secondary market, investors who want to sell before their Treasuries mature must deal with intermediaries.
Treasuries also come packaged in mutual funds. Because funds hold many issues, they never "mature." Shifts in interest rates are reflected in the fund's share price.
Still, buying fund shares is easier than buying directly and might make sense for people who prefer monthly over semiannual interest payments or who invest only small amounts. Shares can be cashed in at any time for full market value.
You pay a price for the convenience. Roughly half the funds carry sales charges; paying such fees for funds that are simple packages of Treasuries makes no sense. Fund expenses average three-quarters of 1 percent but careful shoppers can pay as little as .30 percent for funds sold by the Vanguard Group in Valley Forge, Pa., the industry's lowest-cost provider.

HEADLINE: LAW;
Lawyers More Willing To Discuss Their Fees

BYLINE: By Laura Mansnerus

 BODY:
LAWYERS are not blase about money these days, which means that they are not blase about clients. While still not very amenable to negotiation -- lawyers have fairly firm rates, like surgeons or baby sitters -- they are increasingly receptive to requests to keep costs down.
Clients can minimize rude surprises by asking questions at the outset about fees. Since the advent of computerized billing systems, they can also monitor statements more easily. And increasingly, experts on billing say, clients are doing both. 
 The subject "is in the public eye more than when lawyers weren't allowed to discuss fees publicly," said George Kuhlman, ethics counsel for the American Bar Association. Mr. Kuhlman said advertising had impressed upon people who need lawyers that they are shoppers of a sort.
For new clients, the general practice, urged but not required by most state ethics codes, is to send an "engagement letter" confirming billing terms. Usually a retainer, or down payment, is required; this will be worked off and is sometimes a nonrefundable minimum.
For tasks that are discrete and predictable, like a simple will or real estate closing, most lawyers charge a flat fee that is not likely to exceed $1,000. In personal injury cases, plaintiffs' lawyers work on a contingency basis. Otherwise, billing by the hour, usually in units of 6 or 15 minutes, is the norm. It is also the source of most trouble and suspense.
The hourly rate is disclosed in the first consultation and on each bill. But a firm might have several people working on one matter, including an associate at $100 an hour and a partner at twice that rate. Most clients do not know who is working or how many hours are being rung up.
"People are concerned that the meter is running when the taxi isn't moving," said Richard C. Reed, a lawyer in Bellevue, Wash., who headed an A.B.A. task force on billing.
Nearly all lawyers say, however, that there is no such thing as an estimate -- at least not the kind an auto mechanic gives.
"I'm not an apologist for the profession, but it's almost impossible to say what the bill is going to be," said Daniel R. White, author of "What Lawyers Do . . . and How to Make Them Work for You" (E. P. Dutton, 1987). He added, however: "They will bill as much as they think they can get away with."
So what should a client ask? First, seek a probable range of costs, which is better than no estimate. The client can also worry aloud and in advance about expenses.
"I would say, 'I want you to understand that I'm not a deep pocket,' " Mr. White said. "I have definitely heard lawyers at firms say, 'This client is concerned about the bill.' " For associates doing research, "that means you yuk it up less in the library."
It is certainly legitimate to set an upper limit, although some say that encourages the lawyer to reach it. And no lawyer would argue with a request to notify the client when the tab hits a certain point.
Even with a fixed fee, it's advisable to ask exactly what it covers: How many consultations are included? How many times can the beneficiaries in the will be changed? What if the adoption is contested?
And sometimes neither an hourly nor a flat fee covers photocopies and overnight mail, which can add costs at astonishing speed.
Finally, the client should know the policy on telephone consultations. Almost all lawyers bill them; as for the two-minute call, some record a minimum charge and others don't.
Clients should be aware that conversation costs. Mr. Kuhlman said, "If you want to spend time talking about things that don't require a lawyer, call your sister-in-law."

HEADLINE: Dinkins Proposes a Financial Plan To Fill Budget Gap

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins proposed a financial plan for New York City yesterday that relies on modest spending cuts, an unusual borrowing scheme and increased aid from the state and Federal governments that many fiscal experts consider doubtful.
The proposals are the heart of his plan to close a $2.1 billion budget gap for the fiscal year beginning July 1. Over all, the Mayor proposed spending $31.9 billion, a 4.9 percent increase over spending in the current fiscal year. 
 To close the gap, the Mayor counted on about $614 million in increased state and Federal aid and $296 million in additional city taxes subject to state approval. The city also plans to borrow $215 million from a bank by using unpaid property taxes as collateral. The Mayor defended the borrowing, but some fiscal experts said it was reminiscent of the maneuvering that brought on the fiscal crisis of the 1970's. [Page 24.]
 
Cuts in Services
 The Mayor also called for $623 million in savings in efficiencies and some spending cuts, including not replacing retiring workers in some agencies, contracting out a few city services like the collection of parking tickets and streamlining some operations. The $623 million includes about $96 million in service cuts.
The heaviest blow would fall on the Board of Education, where the Mayor has called on cutting through attrition 2,315 of the current 65,000 teachers positions -- even though enrollment is growing -- and 258 clerical positions to save about $155 million. To make up for the lost teachers, Mr. Dinkins proposed reducing preparation periods and increasing the size of some special tutoring classes. But these efficiencies must be negotiated with the teachers' union.
The remaining $387 million in the budget gap would be filled through a variety of administrative devices, including $200 million by refinancing bonds and stretching out payments on some debt.
State fiscal monitors and budget experts said Mr. Dinkins's plan was unrealistic and would leave the city in an extremely vulnerable position should the state and Federal governments not come through.
"It's one of the riskiest plans we've seen in years," said Allen J. Proctor, the executive director of the state Financial Control Board, which oversees city finances. "He's putting a tremendous amount of stake in the state and Federal governments. When will they know this legislation is dead and how much time will they have to react? The city's going to have $700 to $800 million that it will have to cut if it doesn't get this legislation."
City Council leaders also voiced skepticism about the plan, calling its reliance on increased state aid overly optimistic. Speaker Peter F. Vallone characterized the increased state aid as "place holders" that bought the Mayor some time before he had to outline real service cuts.
The Council Finance Committee chairman, Herbert E. Berman, predicted that Mr. Dinkins would get no additional help from Albany and that the administration would end up slashing services late in the spring, possibly through layoffs.
 
'Don't See Any Escape'
 "We yet will face the very real potential for the reduction of the work force," he said. "I don't see any escape from that as a reality."
Mr. Dinkins said he remained optimistic that the city would get at least some of the aid it is seeking from Albany and Washington, especially with a Democrat as President. He defended his budget as "progressive but prudent" and said, "The sacrifice and belt-tightening which characterized last year's budget must be replicated this year as well."
Specifically, Mr. Dinkins is asking the Legislature for a package of $296 million in additional tax revenue: an extension of a surcharge on personal-income taxes, an increase in the income tax on commuters, new sales taxes on alcohol and tobacco and a fuel tax. He is also asking the state to take over $169 million in Medicaid costs the city now pays and an increase of nearly $85 million in educational aid, an annual battle. Another $110 million would come from increases in other state aid.
State legislative leaders reacted coolly to Mr. Dinkins's tax proposals, pointing out that many of them died in the Legislature last year. They said he would face an uphill battle squeezing more educational aid and Medicaid money from the state in a year when the Legislature is trying to close a $3.6 billion gap.
Should the state fail to help, Mr. Dinkins has put forward in his plan a doomsday list of $168 million in contingency cuts that would crimp high-profile services. They include such measures as eliminating summer school programs, closing public pools, cutting day-care programs, increasing case loads for foster-care social workers, slashing a Staten Island Ferry at rush hour and delaying a police class for six months.
Coming eight months before Mr. Dinkins faces a re-election fight, the preliminary spending plan clearly reflected his desire to sew together the coalition of labor, minorities and liberals that elected him four years ago by avoiding deep service cuts or layoffs. The plan included a group of new initiatives worth about $25 million, ranging from community health clinics to lengthening library hours.
Under the Financial Control Law, the Mayor is required to present this financial plan to show that the city has a plan to keep its budget in balance. After Council hearings, he will submit his actual budget proposal.
Budget experts said it is to the Mayor's advantage to paint a bleak picture at this point in the five-month budget process to put pressure on the state, the Federal Government and the municipal unions to come up with more money for the city.
The Mayor's plan assumes a modest growth in the local economy of about 1.6 percent this year, though it takes into account that wages will probably grow faster than the real-estate market will rebound. As a result, the city is expecting some income and business taxes to rise about $245 million, even as property taxes fall about $388 million. Last year, the city produced a surplus of more than $500 million.
The plan also takes into account a 2 percent raise for most civilian city employees, which will cost an additional $428 million in the next fiscal year, the result of a settlement reached with a union representing 180,000 employees earlier this month.
Although most agencies were asked to shrink their city-financed staffs through attrition and early retirement, a few agencies will grow. Over all, the work force will grow to about 214,000 workers from 212,000 by the end of next year, fueled by the expansion of the Police Department and growing welfare rolls, which under state law automatically require increased numbers of social workers.
The plan takes advantage of a number of so-called one-shot revenues to close part of the budget shortfall, like $55 million from the sale of the Offtrack Betting Corporation and $45 million from the renegotiation of leases with the Port Authority at the city's airports. The administration is planning to dip into its general reserve fund to cover $110 million of operating expenses, leaving $40 million for emergencies, the plan said.
The City Council President, Andrew J. Stein, a Democrat who is planning to challenge the Mayor in the fall, charged that Mr. Dinkins was trying to balance the budget by punishing school children instead of forcing municipal unions to agree to greater concessions. "It's a flim-flam budget," he said. "The Mayor is aiming a knife at the heart of the city's children and teachers."
The Republican candidate, Rudolph W. Giuliani, questioned the wisdom of borrowing money against future tax revenues.
"It seems like a lot of questionable assumptions and one very big mistake that has impact on the fiscal stablility of the city: the borrowing," he said. "Then there is the problem of the administration's double talk. To describe this loan as anything else but a loan is irresponsible."

HEADLINE: THE GAY TROOP ISSUE;
CLINTON ACCEPTS DELAY IN LIFTING MILITARY GAY BAN

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 29

 BODY:
Giving ground to his political opponents, President Clinton authorized the Pentagon today to continue its ban on homosexuals for six months with little practical change while the Defense Department drafts an executive order to lift the prohibition.
After days of negotiation and rancor in the military and Congress, Mr. Clinton temporarily suspended the formal discharge of homosexuals from the military and announced that new recruits would no longer be asked if they are homosexuals. He ordered the Pentagon to produce an order for him to sign by July 15.
 
Victory for Senator Nunn
 In the meantime, the military will continue discharge proceedings against avowed homosexuals or those it believes to be gay. While acknowledged homosexuals will not actually be ousted from the service, Mr. Clinton was forced to agree to a plan that will place them in the unpaid standby reserves -- in effect, putting their military careers in limbo -- and require that they petition for reinstatement if the ban is permanently lifted. 
 Mr. Clinton had wanted to halt all proceedings against homosexuals for the six months. The compromise was a victory for Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who wanted to make clear that avowed homosexuals were still not welcome in the military.
But the compromise appeared to have averted an immediate move in Congress to write the ban into law by attaching it to a family and medical leave bill that is scheduled for a vote next week. The President wants that bill and others to be passed as soon as possible to show that the Democrats have broken the gridlock in Congress.
 
'Step in the Right Direction'
 Mr. Clinton called his announcement today a "dramatic step forward"; it represented the first time a President had taken steps to aid gay men and lesbians in the armed services. But he acknowledged that he had yielded on important issues. [Excerpts, page 8.]
"This compromise is not everything I would have hoped for, or everything that I have stood for, but it is plainly a substantial step in the right direction," Mr. Clinton said during the first news conference of his Presidency, which was entirely devoted to the question of homosexuals in the military and not the economic issues that Mr. Clinton has sought to emphasize.
He said he was aware that Congress might still override any executive order he signed that would allow homosexuals in the military to declare their sexual orientation. "The issue is not whether there should be homosexuals in the military," he said. "Everyone concedes that there are. The issue is whether men and women who can and have served with real distinction should be excluded from military service solely on the basis of their status. And I believe they should not."
Saying he had not "given up on my real goals," Mr. Clinton added, "Normally, in the history of civil rights, the advancements of Presidents have not necessarily been in the forefront in the beginning."
Aides to Mr. Clinton said they expected the issues surrounding homosexuals in the armed forces to die down only temporarily as both sides fight the issue out in the Senate hearings that Mr. Nunn will hold in the next few months.
 
No Real Change in Policy
 Under the agreement, openly gay men and lesbians who are now in the process of being discharged will not be thrown out of the military. But aides to Senator Nunn emphasized that there would be no real change in current policy, because standby reserve status is not far different from discharge.
They will still be separated from service and lose privileges and benefits and could hope to serve again only if the executive order to lift the ban is unchallenged in Congress.
Mr. Clinton indicated that he still planned to sign that order in July and would be prepared to use his veto if Congress sent him a bill specifically intended to overturn such an order. He left unclear whether he would veto a larger bill that he might want if a ban on homosexuals was attached.
Military officials said they were satisfied with the agreement, and looked forward to further discussions in the next six months.
"The Chiefs felt that they had a good opportunity to discuss this with the President and we will support him in this effort," Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters at the Pentagon today.
But Senator Bob Dole, the Senate Minority leader, called the move "a big blunder on the White House's part."
"They never talked with anyone on the Republican side," he said on the ABC News program "Nightline."
Representatives of gay groups said they were happy to have gained even the appearance of a victory today. Instead of asking military applicants about their sexual orientation, recruiters would brief them on sexual conduct, explaining what is considered unacceptable in either homosexual or heterosexual activity.
But at military bases around the nation, like Mayport Naval Station in Jacksonville, Fla., initial reaction to the President's announcement was largely negative. Military personnel said relaxing restrictions on homosexuals would lower morale, raise administrative costs and create a host of practical problems.
"What are they going to do, create special barracks for gays, the same way as they do for men and women?" asked Chad Nuss, a sailor aboard the carrier Saratoga. "I'm totally against it."
But others on active duty said they would learn to adjust to the new situation. "We're just standing by," said Johnny Stewart, who serves aboard the destroyer Spruance. "Whatever the President decides, we'll just have to abide by it."
 
Conduct vs. Status
 Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, said the negotiations leading to the compromise had established the core issue at stake for President Clinton: "the distinction between disciplinary action taken on the basis of conduct as opposed to disciplinary action taken on the basis of status."
He added: "That is, what a person does as opposed to what a person is. From the President's standpoint, this directive establishes that principle, and it is very important that everybody understand that."
But Mr. Nunn and his supporters insisted that they had prevailed in their effort to prevent the possibility that large numbers of men and woman in the armed services would declare their homosexuality during the interim period.
"If there is one thing I've learned on military matters in my 20 years of serving in the United States Senate and working with the military virtually every day, it is that our armed forces function well if we respect and support their basic requirements for cohesion and effectiveness," Mr. Nunn said at a news conference today.
"Resolving this conflict between individual rights and the basic needs of our military is always difficult," he continued. "But our nation has had an effective military because we have achieved an acceptable balance over the years. The balance must be maintained."
 
Judge Helps Clinton
 The President said his hand had been strengthened by a Federal judge in California, who ruled on Thursday that excluding homosexuals from the armed services is unconstitutional.
"It makes the practical point I have been making all along," Mr. Clinton said of the decision. "Which is that there is a not insignificant chance that this matter would ultimately be resolved in the courts in a way that would open admission into the military, without the opportunity to deal with this whole range of practical issues which everyone who's ever thought about it, or talked it through, concedes are there."
No decision has been made about whether the Justice Department would appeal the decision, which applies specifically to the case of a Navy officer who had already been discharged for admitting his homosexuality on national television.
George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director, said that today's agreement would affect few people but that it would buy time for the Administration to win support in Congress for the eventual lifting of the ban.
"This is going to apply to a very, very small number of people," he said, noting that many homosexuals would probably not risk action, even in the interim period, by declaring their sexual orientation before the ban is lifted. "You're talking about situations which are solely based on status, where it's acknowledged. I would expect that it just wouldn't apply in that many cases."
With today's action, the White House also clearly hoped to allow Mr. Clinton to concentrate on economic issues. "The timing of this whole issue was clearly forced by the people in the Senate who are opposed to any change of the policy no matter what the facts are, and I think that was their right to do," Mr. Clinton said. "But they controlled the timing of this, not me."
During the Presidential campaign, Mr. Clinton said on several occasions that he would sign an executive order to lift the ban if he were elected. Although the issue did not get much attention during the campaign, General Powell objected strenuously to the plan in a post-election meeting with Mr. Clinton and subsequently led the military's opposition to it.
Mr. Clinton's aides said that although they had expected that the policy reversal would stir opposition -- especially among Republican leaders in the Senate -- they did not expect it to come as ferociously and from as many quarters as it did.
 
WHAT WILL CHANGE FOR NOW
Questions about sexual orientation will be removed from the induction form
Homosexuality will no longer be grounds for outright discharge from the military
Court proceedings against those discharged for being homosexual will be delayed
Rules on sexual conduct will be explained to recruits
The Pentagon will draft an executive order banning discrimination against homosexuals
 
WHAT REMAINS UNCHANGED
Serveice members who are gay remain subject to discharge proceedings. Homosexuals can still be removed from active duty
However, those who have reached the point of discharge will be transferred instead to standby reserve, where they will receive no pay and no benefits.

HEADLINE: Durable Goods Orders Rise 9.1% In Sign of Manufacturing Growth

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 29

 BODY:
In what economists took as a clear sign of growing momentum in manufacturing, the Commerce Department reported today that new orders for durable goods jumped 9.1 percent in December, the biggest gain in 17 months.
The surprisingly robust performance, which was broad-based, lifted orders for long-lasting goods to $134.5 billion, the highest level in four years. 
 Such orders for items that are designed to last at least three years -- ranging from motorcycles to jets -- are widely watched as an indicator of future economic activity. Orders are the first step in a process that generally leads to buying materials, hiring and transporting finished products.
The consumer-goods sector has been strong since the summer, but factories have so far experienced only a modest -- and more recent -- rebound.
 
'Falling Into Place'
 "Everything seems to be falling into place," said Michael P. Niemira of the Mitsubishi Bank. The December orders may be somewhat overstated, he added, "but the themes are real. Something's going on."
Separately, the Commerce Department reported that disposable personal income climbed 1 percent last month while personal spending rose five-tenths of 1 percent. But incomes were swollen by year-end bonuses, and without them Americans again spent a bit more than they earned.
The report on durable goods included increases in shipments and in unfilled orders as well as in new orders, a three-sided improvement that has been rare in recent years.
"Every single part of the report was strong," said James F. O'Sullivan, an economist at J. P. Morgan. "The economy certainly looks better lately."
The report on durable goods orders tends to be among the most erratic of the Government's main statistical reports, partly because big-ticket items like planes and weapons are often bunched together. Moreover, today's report was only an estimate and is subject to revision.
As a result, analysts cautioned that the December gains were almost certainly too large to be sustained and that other data showed that employers were reluctant to hire.
Lagging growth in jobs and incomes has been a drag on the economy even as it posted seven straight quarters of expansion. Growth in the last two quarters averaged a solid 3.6 percent at an annual rate.
In December, the Labor Department had reported earlier, American factories added 3,000 jobs while the average work week rose for the third month to a very high 41.3 hours.
 
Investment Tax Credit
 Analysts said the December orders might have benefited from the Government's clarification on the tax treatment that capital goods were likely to get. But this effect was thought to be small.
Some businesses had been withholding commitments for items expected to qualify for an investment tax credit that the Clinton Administration has discussed. But some of this uncertainty was removed last month when the Government said that any such credit would be retroactive to Dec. 3.
Analysts, despite their caution, said they could not help but be impressed with the report released today, which exceeded almost all expectations.
There was a 6.4 percent advance, for example, in new orders for capital goods other than aircraft and military equipment, a tabulation widely followed as a guide to basic factory activity. When transportation items of all kinds were excluded, the December gain was 5.5 percent.
Moreover, increases were posted in all the leading groups except furniture and fixtures. Orders for transportation equipment soared 20.8 percent, to $35.2 billion, after a 10.5 percent decline in November.
Electronic- and electrical-equipment orders climbed 6 percent, to $19.3 billion, mainly because of communications equipment; orders for primary metals jumped 9 percent, to $11.7 billion.
Orders for industrial machinery and equipment rose 3 percent, to $22.2 billion, the report also showed.
In capital-goods industries, military orders advanced 14.3 percent, while nonmilitary goods, including aircraft, moved ahead 17.9 percent.
The report also showed that shipments of durable goods rose 3.7 percent last month, to $132.8 billion, after a 2.3 percent rise in November. Shipments increased for all leading groups except furniture and fixtures.
Unfilled orders rose four-tenths of a percent, to $450.2 billion, a tiny increase but only the second gain in 16 months. Backlogs of transportation equipment slipped to their lowest level since September 1989, however, while industrial machinery and equipment eased to the lowest level since July 1987.
A 1 percent rise in personal incomes last month helped to raise earnings for the year by 4.7 percent. But the Commerce Department reported that the December increase would have been just three-tenths of a percent without accelerated bonus payments in the securities industry, subsidies to farm proprietors, bonuses in the auto industry and retroactive Social Security benefits.
The 1 percent rise in disposable incomes -- incomes after taxes -- followed a drop of two-tenths of a percent a month earlier.
The savings rate in December -- savings as a percentage of disposable income -- was 4.7 percent, up from 4.2 percent in November. Consumer spending rose 5.3 percent for the year, and prices rose 2.9 percent.

HEADLINE: Washington Memo;
Housing Secretary Is Suddenly Assertive on Aiding Homeless

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 29

 BODY:
In his first full week on the job, Housing Secretary Henry G. Cisneros declared homelessness "a highest priority," began drafting an eight-point policy plan and spent an evening touring a shelter and the streets.
"There will be fewer homeless people on the streets when we are finished -- that's a promise," he said today, following Thursday's tour of grief and grates. 
 But it was only two weeks ago when Mr. Cisneros, appearing before a Senate panel, struck a much more cautious tone. During those confirmation hearings, he offered few specific solutions and seemed to be laying a groundwork for dampened expectations. "We cannot promise today that we will meet all of those needs," he told the senators, and talked instead of simply reversing the direction of the disturbing trends.
 
Uncertainty Over Real Policy
 The question is, which Cisneros speaks for the Clinton Administration? Is it the cautious Secretary who, like the President who appointed him, had little to say about the problem? Or the poet of the poor who emerged from the streets this week to say of the homeless:
"Their faces were gentle, their eyes were kind; their language was soft. They had suffered in their lives, it was clear."
Leaders of advocacy groups, and members of the transition itself, admit to being a bit confused.
"I'm more optimistic than I was during the campaign," said Fred Karnas, director of the National Coalition for the Homeless. "This is a great first step, but the jury's still out."
The confusion begins not with Mr. Cisneros, but with Mr. Clinton. In his eagerness to court the middle class, Mr. Clinton spent little time talking about the poor and virtually none discussing homelessness.
Advocacy groups crossed their fingers and hoped Mr. Clinton's silence was more a matter of political expediency than a signal of his intentions. "We understood the political realities," said Mr. Karnas.
From the advocates' perspective, things picked up a bit after the election. The transition team invited representatives from about 30 groups to Little Rock, Ark., for a Dec. 7 meeting, which they viewed as an encouraging sign, even though the session was run by the transition's political outreach section, not its policy planners.
And Mr. Clinton then appointed an advocate of the homeless, Andrew Cuomo, to oversee the housing department's transition. Mr. Cuomo, the son of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, runs H.E.L.P., a nonprofit housing group in New York City, and served as chairman of a homelessness study group for Mayor David N. Dinkins.
An Administration official said today that Mr. Cisneros had chosen Mr. Cuomo to serve as an assistant housing secretary, in charge of homelessness. The appointment is awaiting White House approval.
Advocacy groups have been releasing their own wish lists of Government action on the homeless. And all of them are expensive.
This month, the National Coalition for the Homeless called on the Clinton Administration to guarantee housing to all those who need it.
Switching from advocate to realist, Mr. Karnas acknowledged this was unlikely to happen. "I'm not sure how much is going to be able to happen, even with our friends there, given the economic situation," he said.
Mr. Cisneros enjoys a reputation for being a quick study, and when he offered his account of Thursday's tour of shelters, one could hear a bit of the star student in his voice. When the tour ended, he said, he jotted down four observations "for myself about what we need to do."
He said the country needed to link housing and social services, to build more single-room occupancy homes, to distinguish between those who need shelter beds and those ready for permanent homes, and to find jobs for the large number of street people who say they want to work.
Like others who have studied the subject, Mr. Cisneros stressed that different parts of the homeless population had different needs. Perhaps a third require mental health treatment; another third need drug or alcoholism programs, and others are simply in need of housing and jobs.
Digressing in the middle of his formal outline, however, Mr. Cisneros seemed a bit astonished by what he had witnessed in the streets.
"An African-American woman, eight months pregnant, sleeping on the lawn of the Justice Department!" he said. "Five veterans, sleeping on a heat grate for warmth. Incredible things -- veterans!" Mr. Cisneros said some of the people he had met seemed "almost too gentle, too kind for the jostling competitive world."
 
Executive Order Planned
 Although he brought a reporter from The Washington Post along on the tour, Mr. Cisneros said, "This was not a showpiece thing; this was a learning thing."
After meeting with his staff today, Mr. Cisneros said he was recommending that an economic stimulus package include $100 million to $150 million for homeless programs that mix housing and social services.
He said he was drafting an executive order for President Clinton that would instruct the military to make surplus bases available for homeless groups. And he said he would seek a joint venture with Washington's Mayor, Sharon Pratt Kelly, to show members of Congress that programs for the homeless could work.
Mr. Cisneros said that anyone inferring lack of interest from his confirmation hearing was misinformed. "It has always been a priority," said Mr. Cisneros, who said he would have spoken more about homelessness had the Senate panel directed questions in that direction.
What does it all mean?
Like many advocates, Maria Foscarinis, director of the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty, was swaying between encouragement and skepticism. While she said she was "heartened" by the tour, she warned that oratory had its limits. "He's the H.U.D. Secretary," she said, "and he's got to take some specific action."

HEADLINE: Despite U.S., Yeltsin Backs Rocket Deal With India

BYLINE: By SANJOY HAZARIKA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Jan. 29

 BODY:
President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia declared today that despite opposition from the United States, Moscow remained committed to the supply of powerful rocket engines for India's space program.
"We do not plan to backtrack," Mr. Yeltsin said at a news conference here, adding that he would discuss the issue with President Clinton. Mr. Yeltsin said he hoped that the United States would respond with "common sense, sensibility" to the announcement. 
 The Russian leader, on his first visit to India, which was a close friend and strong supporter of the Soviet Union, also spoke of what he called Moscow's new "purposeful Eastern policy."
Mr. Yeltsin said he was "moving away from a pro-Western emphasis" and described his country as a "Euro-Asian power" with economic and cultural interests in this continent.
 
U.S. Banned Such Sales
 His strong support for India on the rocket deal signaled his opposition to the United States on the issue. The engines are powered by supercold liquids known as cryogenic fuels, which are difficult to master, rather than less efficient room-temperature ones.
Last year Washington ordered a two-year ban on the sale of sensitive space technology to Glavkosmos, the Russian Space Agency, and the Indian Space Research Organization, the Indian space agency, because of the contract. It was the first such action against either country.
[In Washington, a State Department official said the sanctions on the companies involved in both countries would remain unless the deal was canceled. The official added that what Mr. Yeltsin said on his visit to India was neither new nor unexpected.]
The United States said last year that a $250 million agreement signed in 1990 with Glavkosmos, then a Soviet space agency, violated the 1987 Missile Technology Control Regime.
The Missile Control Regime has been approved by the United States and other Western nations but without the sanction of international law that seeks to bar the proliferation of medium- and long-range missile technology capable of delivering nuclear warheads.
Both Russia and India say that the cyrogenic rocket technology transfer is aimed at developing giant rockets to place satellites into space and that the project is for peaceful purposes. But American officials say the technology could help India, which has an extensive medium-range missile program, develop long-range weapons.
 
Trying to Ease Differences
 During his two-day visit, Mr. Yeltsin signed a series of agreements with Indian leaders that sought to end differences on economic and military cooperation. A central issue over the last years has been the size of India's debt to Russia, which had been in dispute because of the rapidly falling value of the ruble.
Under the terms of the new settlement, India's debt has fallen from about $11 billion to about $8 billion, Shiv Mukherjee, an Indian spokesman, said.
As part of the economic package, India and Russia scrapped a 15-year agreement that permitted trading in rupees and rubles. Instead, they will now conduct trade in hard currency.
The rupee-ruble arrangement had developed as an integral part of Indian-Soviet relations and helped India, as a specially favored trading partner, pay for MIG fighter jets and other Soviet military equipment with its own currency, saving tens of billions of dollars in foreign exchange at the time. Moscow has been the largest sellers of arms to India.
India and Russia have agreed to increase military cooperation and develop joint military production projects. The supplies of spare parts and equipment, which had slowed in the last years, are to be hastened under this accord.
Mr. Yeltsin said the two sides were also negotiating the purchase of advanced jet trainer fighters for the Indian Air Force. India is seeking about 40 of the jets, and their estimated cost is $1 billion, or roughly one-seventh of the annual military budget. The British Prime Minister, John Major, who was in India recently, discussed British offers to sell Hawk trainer aircraft to India with officials here.
 
Won't 'Play India Card'
 In his wide-ranging remarks, Mr. Yeltsin also redefined relations with India, saying Moscow would not longer "play the India card" against China and the United States.
"The earlier relationship with India was seen in Moscow as a counterweight to the United States and China, that cannot be concealed," he said. He said the two nations renewed a Friendship Treaty on Thursday after dropping a vital security clause that said either side would come to the assistance of the other in the case of an armed conflict.
Mr. Yeltsin said the security clause was no longer relevant because Russia was interested only in a direct relationship with India and not with aligning with it to oppose a third country.
But Indian leaders were buoyed by Mr. Yeltsin's unequivocal support for New Delhi's position on Kashmir. The state of Jammu and Kashmir has been divided by wars between India and Pakistan, and both nations assert sovereignty over the area.
"The truth is on the side of India on this question," he said, adding that Russia supported this country's territorial integrity and unity.

HEADLINE: U.S. Backs Council Seats for Bonn and Tokyo

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 29

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration has indicated that it favors allowing Germany and Japan to have permanent seats in the United Nations Security Council.
The Council has 15 members, but only 5 -- the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France -- have permanent seats, which allows each of them to block any action with a veto. 
 In recent years, Germany, the most powerful economic power in Europe, has said it felt entitled to a seat, as has Japan. So have third-world countries, arguing that the nonindustrialized world should also have a permanent voice. Until now, Washington has gone along with keeping the issue off the agenda, arguing that once the Council seating was up for change, it might open up a Pandora's box of requests.
 
A Sign from Christopher
 The sign that the Clinton Administration would support change came from Secretary of State Warren M. Christopher this week in Washington. In a question-and-answer session with State Department employees, he said that "during the campaign, President Clinton said that he could envisage the addition of Germany and Japan to the permanent members."
The Secretary of State also acknowledged "the complexity of that decision," saying, "I'm sure we've all been in organizations where when you begin to make changes, there are other people who feel that they are entitled to a seat at the table."
On Wednesday, Mr. Christopher's call for changes in the Security Council's composition drew a pained response from Britain's Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, who said, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
While avoiding any direct criticism of Mr. Christopher, the British Foreign Secretary told a meeting of the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London that his American counterpart had recognized the practical difficulties of what he was proposing.
Giving permanent membership to Germany and Japan would need a change in the United Nations Charter and lead to pressure for similar status for other countries as well.
 
Privileged Status Resented
 In the last couple of years, resentment at Britain's and France's privileged position at the United Nations has increased sharply as their relative power in the world has diminished and the cold war's end enabled the Council to start functioning properly again.
At the same time, Britain and France have become increasingly sensitive about talk of changing the Council's membership, evidently feeling their own permanent seats are becoming harder to justify. But as permanent members, they can also veto the change in the United Nations Charter necessary to create new permanent members.
The current German and Japanese Governments have both made clear that they want a permanent Security Council seat in recognition of their economic power and their contributions to the United Nations budget, which are now larger than those of Britain, France and China.
But constitutional restrictions have prevented Germany from sending armed forces overseas to take part in United Nations peacekeeping operations. Although Japan faces similar restrictions, its Parliament has relaxed the ban and sent a small contingent to the operation in Cambodia.
Any American move to give new permanent seats to Germany and Japan alone would certainly run into sharp opposition from developing countries and probably from many other countries as well.
 
A Plan for 20 Seats
 A much discussed proposal, first put forward by Brazil, would create 5 new permanent seats but without a veto, raising the Council's membership to 20. Germany and Japan would take 2 of the seats, with the others going to three of the most populous developing countries, probably India, Nigeria and Brazil. But this proposal is unpopular with the developing countries' regional rivals. A refinement might provide for the 3 third-world permanent seats to be rotated annually among the biggest countries of each region.

HEADLINE: Judge Blocks California Cuts In Welfare to New Residents

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif. Jan. 29

 BODY:
A Federal district judge has issued a preliminary injunction barring California from carrying out a law intended to reduce welfare payments to people who have lived in the state less than a year.
The injunction, issued on Thursday by Judge David F. Levi, was hailed by advocates of the poor as sending a message to other states considering similar measures -- that while such actions might be a politically expedient way to deal with a budget crunch, they will not stand up to court challenge. 
 But supporters of the law said the decision would hurt the state's budget.
"This ruling plunges California deeper into debt, requiring more spending cuts on other programs next year, like education and preventative programs for children," said Eloise Anderson, director of the California Department of Social Services.
 
Would Have Saved $22 Million
 Under the law, welfare recipients who had lived in California less than 12 months and had applied for public assistance after Dec. 1, 1992, would have received welfare payments no higher than the payments they would have received in their home state.
For instance, a women with two children who had recently moved to California from Louisiana would have received only $190 a month, compared with $624 a month for a California resident. California has the nation's fourth highest schedule of payment, behind Alaska, Hawaii and Vermont.
About 50,000 welfare recipients in California have been in the state for less than a year. The Department of Social Services estimates that the residency requirement would have saved the state $22 million in the 1993 fiscal year.
New York has adopted a different schedule of benefits for new residents, and Wisconsin and Minnesota have received Federal approval to carry out similar measures. Mark Greenberg, a lawyer with the Center for Law and Social Policy in Washington, said other states had considered similar measures but had been deterred by questions of constitutionality and fears of lawsuits.
"This reinforces what many people believed: that such laws are unconstitutional," Mr. Greenberg said of the ruling.
In his ruling, Judge Levi wrote, "If the purpose of the measure is to deter migration by poor people into the state, and it appears that this may be the purpose, then the measure must be unconstitutional."
Judge Levi said the law restricted the right of citizens to travel and migrate freely. Quoting from a 1966 Supreme Court decision in the case of United States v. Guest, he wrote, "The right to migrate from one state to another occupies a position fundamental to the concept of our Federal union and has long been recognized as a basic right under the Constitution."
He added, "The state's interest in reducing welfare costs is not sufficient to justify the disparate treatment of this class of needy residents."
The residency requirement, which won bipartisan support, was part of an attempt to close a gap of $11 billion in the state's 1992 fiscal budget.
Mark Rosenbaum, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, which was part of a coalition that brought the suit, said, "This ruling stops dead in its track a crass attempt by Gov. Pete Wilson and the Legislature to shift responsibility for ineffective and short-sighted economic policies in California to poor women and children."
Advocates of the poor say the $22 million savings realized by the law would have represented a small portion of the $6 billion the state pays out each year to welfare recipients.
"Within the context of state welfare budgets, this functions more as a political statement," Mr. Greenberg said.
State officials said they were considering appealing the decision.

HEADLINE: Back to the Big Issue;
After 10 Rocky Days, Clinton Seems Eager To Concentrate on Economic Problems

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 29

 BODY:
After 10 days of hullabaloo about gay personnel in the military and the household help of his nominee for Attorney General, President Clinton now seems hungry to concentrate on the issue that got him elected: the economy.
This week's huge layoffs by large corporations are pushing him to do something to create jobs, while strong economic growth in the fourth quarter is pulling him not to do too much. But there is another factor -- probably the decisive one -- putting pressure on him to get under the hood and do something big about the economy -- and that is politics. 
 The political controversies of his first 10 days in office are pressing him to get the public's mind back on the issue that was the center of his campaign. In announcing an agreement today with Congressional Democrats and the Joint Chiefs of Staff about gay personnel in the military, Mr. Clinton seemed to struggle to shout, above the political din, that he is eager to turn the page and get on to the economy.
At a news conference, Mr. Clinton said the agreement would "allow us to move forward on other terribly important issues affecting far more Americans."
"My Administration came to this city with a mission," he said, "to bring critical issues of reform and renewal and economic revitalization to the public debate, issues that are central to the lives of all Americans,"
During the campaign, Clinton aides gloated in secret when news about layoffs undercut support for President George Bush. Although the recent layoffs by Boeing, Sears, Roebuck and other large companies happened on Mr. Clinton's watch, some of his aides are no doubt smiling in private that these layoffs are shifting the public's focus away from Mr. Clinton's political woes and toward the economic problems he inherited.
In a speech Thursday night, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said, "We must reverse the slide that brings us headlines like Sears cutting 50,000 jobs, and I.B.M. taking out nearly 75,000 jobs."
The week was marked by television appearances, speeches and hints of new programs by members of the Administration's economics team. The White House even arranged a meeting between the President and Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve System, and made sure news photographers were there to record the event.
All this created murmurs in political circles that the Clinton team was struggling to do what it had done so well during the campaign -- focus on the economy and divert the public's attention from the negatives.
George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich and Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman all went public about the likelihood of a short-term plan to stimulate the economy.
Mr. Reich provided some news when he said the Administration would probably extend unemployment benefits and might develop a new training program for the high number of workers permanently laid off during the recent downturn.
"The continuing massive layoffs are evidence that although technically we may be in an economic recovery, we're not yet out of the woods," Mr. Reich said in an interview. "Until you get jobs back you don't have a genuine recovery. Creating jobs remains the President's No. 1 priority."
The last thing Mr. Clinton wants is an economy stumbling badly. His aides remember what happened in late 1991 when consumer confidence and economic growth tumbled after General Motors and other corporate giants announced huge layoffs.
 
A Need for 'Insurance'
 One top Government official said the recent layoffs underlined the need for a short-term stimulus plan "as insurance" that the economy was not going to take a new slide.
David A. Wyss, an economist with DRI/McGraw Hill, a consulting firm in Lexington, Mass., agreed, saying "the Administration wants to make sure that this recovery doesn't stall out the way it did last time."
Administration officials believe the 3.8 percent fourth-quarter growth rate the Commerce Department reported is not sustainable. They point to forecasts predicting growth of 2.5 percent or less in the first half of 1993, so low that it would not cut the 7.3 percent jobless rate.
While many economists consider those forecasts pessimistic, Administration officials also point to reports that consumer spending has grown considerably faster than personal income. This means consumer spending, which has fed recent growth, may have to stop to catch its breath.
Another concern for the Administration is that headlines about layoffs could cause consumer confidence to tumble, pulling spending and the whole economy with it. Policy makers say that if the President shows he is shoring up the economy, that should help consumer confidence.
Mr. Clinton's aides talked this week of a stimulus package that would push up the deficit by $15 billion to $25 billion this year. This money is supposed to create jobs through tax credits for business investment and spending on public works.
Several economists said the fairly strong fourth-quarter growth might make stimulus unnecessary, but Mr. Clinton's political troubles and the bad news about jobs seemed to argue otherwise.
"I think this week's round of layoffs cemented the $15 to $20 to $25 billion economic stimulus," said Allen Sinai, chief economist with the Boston Company.

HEADLINE: New York Lags on Meeting Pollution Standards

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 28

 BODY:
After years of struggle, the Federal Clean Air Act was revised in 1990 with a grand purpose: to force all 50 states to meet new air pollution standards so strict that everything from the way people got to work to the way factories were designed would have to change.
But three years later, the struggle is far from over, as industry groups, environmentalists and consumers continue the battle in state legislatures around the country. Many states have been unable to comply with the first requirements of the law, and in New York, partisan squabbling and a recent court ruling have left state officials warning that the state could well fail to complete a plan altogether. 
 Two weeks ago, the Federal Environmental Protection Agency notified New York and 34 other states that they had failed to meet their first big deadline: the submission of a preliminary pollution-control plan that satisfied the E.P.A.'s requirements.
For New York, this means the state must within 18 months fashion a plan showing, among other things, how it intends to reduce pollution in the New York City region by at least 48 percent by the year 2007. If it fails to devise such a plan, it will automatically lose billions of dollars in Federal transportation funds or face a virtual halt to its economic development.
"It's a real threat that would have a very significant impact on the state," said Thomas C. Jorling, Commissioner of the State Department of Environmental Conservation, who is trying to prod the State Legislature into passing Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's clean air plan.
As New York wrestles with its troubles, experts say that the result is likely to reverberate through the Northeast. "New York has traditionally been out front on these air-quality issues," said Rich Kassel, a senior project attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. "To the extent that New York hasn't been able to put its package through, it's going to have a ripple effect through the rest of the region."
Amendments adopted in 1990 to the Clean Air Act, a law originally passed in 1970, were supposed to reduce air pollution drastically through changes in consumer and business behavior. The law mandated things like cleaner fuel, tighter controls on industry, more efficient cars and an emphasis on mass transit and car-pooling over driving alone, but set different goals for each state and left it to the states to develop the specifics of their programs.
 
Emission Reductions
 But the law is exceedingly intricate and complicated, and it has infuriated powerful constituencies in New York and elsewhere, making it hard for states to agree on a plan that would satisfy the E.P.A.
"The Clean Air Act will require emission reductions from every sector of the economy, and what we're seeing is various sectors -- be they automotive, utility, or petroleum -- all trying to minimize the pain that's being inflicted on them," said Michael J. Bradley, executive director of the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, an air quality consultant.
If New York cannot present an acceptable plan within 18 months, the law provides mandatory sanctions: either the loss of all the state's Federal transportation money (in New York's case, $1 billion a year); or a new regulation requiring that any new polluter, like a power plant or factory, be required to find some way to offset twice as much pollution as it generates. The provision, officials say, could effectively end new economic development in the state.
Six months after that deadline, the Federal Government is required to impose its own pollution-control plan on the recalcitrant states. "We take these sanctions very seriously for one simple reason: the administrator has no discretion," said Raymond W. Werner, chief of the state implementation plan section for the E.P.A.'s New York region. "We have to impose them."
 
More Smog?
 In New York City, recent data have suggested that one pollution problem, carbon monoxide, may be abating but that another problem, smog, is rising. Largely because of the city, New York State has one of the country's worst pollution problems. Yet several factors are conspiring against compliance with the law.
The first is legislative. Last year, Governor Cuomo proposed a plan that he said would allow the state to comply with the clean-air law. But the plan depended on the state's imposing new automobile standards -- known as the California low-emission vehicle standards -- that were even more stringent than the Federal ones. The proposal generated a huge uproar from car manufacturers, who warned that it could increase the price of a new car by as much as $1,000.
The debate over car standards so consumed the Legislature last year that they failed to reach an agreement on an overall plan.
To further confuse things, a Federal District judge last week ruled that the Governor's plan to switch to the California cars was illegal because it placed an undue burden on car manufacturers. Unless the state also agreed to switch to California's more stringent fuel requirements, the judge ruled, it could not impose the automobile standards.
The ruling delighted the Republicans and others who objected to the California standards, but left Governor Cuomo and other Democrats cold. The state is appealing the decision.
"The practical consequences of this ruling are beyond anyone's comprehension," said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Scarsdale Democrat who is the chairman of the Assembly Environmental Conservation Committee. Mr. Brodsky warned that unless the state could switch to the cleaner cars, it would be forced to impose Draconian pollution controls on other polluters -- factories, power plants, and employers whose workers drive to work.
Lawmakers from the Governor's office and the Legislature all say they hope to work out an acceptable agreement this year, one that would enact required programs like a new inspection and maintenance program for cars, car-pooling programs for employers, and emissions controls on factories and power plants. But they are not even close, and the impasse has generated an unusual amount of finger-pointing and blame-shifting.
Commissioner Jorling of the Environmental Conservation Department charged that the Legislature does not appreciate the problem. "They're not capable of writing their own plan, and they care only about their specific constituent problems," he said. "We need to assure the Legislature how difficult a task New York State faces. This isn't a partisan issue or something we can choose to do or not do."
But the Senate Republicans, who often feud with Mr. Jorling on environmental matters, said there was no reason to worry. "Eighteen months is a lifetime in the Legislature," said Dominic Jacangelo, committee director for the State Senate Environmental Conservation Committee. "This is no big deal. We'll get it done, and we'll get it done quickly."
And the committee's chairman, State Senator Owen H. Johnson, a Republican from Babylon, L.I., said that Mr. Jorling was being arrogant and alarmist. "We can act this year, but not if someone is going to throw spitballs at auto manufacturers," he said. "I'm confident that Bill Clinton will not penalize New York State -- he will give us an extension if we need it."
Even the Assembly Democrats, who on many issues can be expected to stand behind Governor Cuomo, are divided because of upstate lawmakers' opposition to the California standards, and because of downstate lawmakers' concerns that three proposed incinerators in New York City, including one at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, would be exempt from some parts of the law.
Meanwhile, time is running out. And environmental groups who applauded the Clean Air Act amendments say that both Commissioner Jorling, and particularly the State Legislature, must get to work.
"The Clean Air Act is unbelievably complicated and there are not a large number of people who are really focused on this problem in the Legislature," said Larry Shapiro, a lawyer for the New York Public Interest Research Group. "I think that very large number of legislators are completely clueless when it comes to virtually any issue that is not directly related to some pet project in their district."

HEADLINE: World Trade Pact Now Seen At Least Several Months Off

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan. 29

 BODY:
Arthur Dunkel, the man overseeing crucial world trade talks, today ruled out the possibility of a global trade pact before March 2, the deadline for a procedure allowing rapid approval of an accord in Congress.
It was the first time that Mr. Dunkel, the director of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, had conceded that an agreement was impossible before this date. As a result, it appears inevitable that final approval of the so-called Uruguay Round of trade negotiations will be put off for several months at least. 
 "I am not here to tell you things that are unrealistic, and I have to say now that it will not be possible to reach a package acceptable to all parties by March 2," Mr. Dunkel told reporters at the World Economic Forum, an annual gathering of political and business leaders in this Swiss mountain resort.
 
New Snags Arise
 Encouraged by an accord on farm trade reached last November by the European Community and the United States, Mr. Dunkel had hoped to wrap up the GATT talks in the first two months of this year. But since then, French objections to the agricultural agreement, uncertainty over the intentions of the new Clinton Administration and the United States imposition this week of tariffs on foreign steel imports have stalled progress and undermined relations between Europe and Washington.
Under the so-called fast-track legislation, which covers agreements completed by March 2, a President is entitled to negotiate a trade agreement and submit it to Congress for expedited consideration with no amendment allowed. The authority has been considered essential by a succession of Presidents and foreign trade negotiators to prevent a second round of trade talks over amendments when an agreement reaches Congress.
President Clinton and his trade representative, Mickey Kantor, have not yet clarified whether, or for what period, they intend to seek a renewal or extension of the fast-track authority. Mr. Kantor is to meet Europe's top trade negotiator, Sir Leon Brittan, in Washington on Feb. 11.
A trade agreement is widely regarded as essential to revive the sagging world economy and head off looming protectionism in both the United States and Europe.
 
'The Great Stagnation'
Indeed, Mr. Dunkel's announcement came as Lester Thurow, a leading economist, declared at the Davos meeting that "what we have is not the Great Depression. It is the great stagnation." He added that he believed President Clinton would have to stem imports to achieve the domestic economic growth of 4 percent he seeks.
"You would call it protectionism; I would say it's isolation, but he would say it's common sense to get re-elected," said Mr. Thurow, the dean of the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

HEADLINE: Canada Imposes Tariffs on Steel From U.S.

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, Jan. 29

 BODY:
The Canadian Government imposed provisional tariffs on steel from the United States today, two days after the United States placed steep import duties on Canadian steel.
Canadian officials insisted that the proximity of the decisions was coincidental, but they also left little doubt that their investigation of unfair trade by American steelmakers was a tit-for-tat reaction to similar moves by Washington in relation to Canadian steel imports. 
 Canada and the United States both took action against imported steel they say is sold in their markets at prices below what it fetches in the country of origin. The practice is known as dumping.
Canada's action, which placed tariffs ranging from 4.5 percent to 124.2 percent on American steel, was also an effort to bolster Canada's case to recognize the integrated nature of the North American steel market and help reduce the threat of further conflicts.
Canada's Minister of Trade, Michael Wilson, spoke out against "the counterproductive nature of both countries taking anti-dumping action against imports from each other." He said a steel pact between the nations might be able to "short-circuit the whole business."
The two countries are each other's biggest steel customers. American exports to Canada in 1991 at 1.7 million tons were a quarter of total exports of 6.3 million tons. Imports from Canada of 2.9 million tons the same year were nearly a fifth of the United States' total imports of 15.7 million tons in 1991.
In their enforcement actions, the two countries also acted against other suppliers engaged in what they say is unfair pricing. Canada placed tariffs on steel from Germany, France, Italy, New Zealand and Britain today in addition to the United States. The Commerce Department named Canada Wednesday along with 18 other countries.
Eleven American steelmakers were singled out for the punitive duties. Those found to be most seriously at fault were the Advance Steel Company, the Kasle Steel Corporation, the McLouth Steel Corporation and the Sharon Steel Corporation, which were all assessed duty increases of 124.2 percent. The Commerce Department's determination had set duties as high as 68 percent on steel imports from Canada.
Today's duties, on hot-rolled steel sheet used mostly in the auto industry, resulted from complaints filed in September by Stelco of Hamilton, Ontario, and Algoma Steel Inc., of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. American companies initiated their complaints against the Canadians June 30.
For the time being, the Clinton Administration appears to be rebuffing the Canadian efforts to obtain a two-way accord on steel. Marshall Casse, the American minister-counselor for economic affairs at the United States Embassy in Ottawa, said the United States preferred an agreement involving more nations.
"We think that's a better approach to improve the climate for trade in steel than the proposed bilateral, sectoral arrangement between the United States and Canada," he asserted.
Canada's main interest, trade officials said, is in restructuring the antidumping laws. "We've been in discussions with our counterparts in the U.S. on this, and we expect these discussions to continue," one Ottawa trade official commented.
Fred Telmer, chairman and chief executive of Stelco, Canada's biggest steel company, said, "Something has to be wrong with the rules when Canadian steelmakers and American steelmakers are both found to have similar dumping margins when selling in this integrated market."
As in the United States, a decision on permanent duties will be made in several months, but steelmakers must put up money immediately to cover potential liability from the additional duties. Another Government agency, the Canadian International Trade Tribunal, has to find that the domestic industry has been materially injured. The tribunal has 120 days to make its finding.

HEADLINE: Consumer-Confidence Level

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index for January fell to a revised level of 89.3, from the originally reported 90, according to those with access to the survey, which is distributed to subscribers. In December, the consumer sentiment index was 91.
The university also reported that the final January index of consumer expectations dropped to 83.4 from 89.5 in December. The preliminary January index was 81.9. 
 The drop in the expectations index contrasts with a gain in the January index of current economic conditions, which rose to 98.6 from 93.4 in December. The preliminary index for January was 102.6.
The consumer sentiment index is 21.8 points above the January 1992 level of 67.5. The record high for the sentiment index is 97.9, which was established in January 1989. The low is 63.9, set in October 1990.

HEADLINE: From Port to 17 Fathoms, Views on Dredging Differ;
On the Docks Shipping Is the Issue, But at Sea They Worry About the Fishing Industry

BYLINE: By CHARLES STRUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, Jan. 29

 BODY:
Fish are partial to a varied seascape; a flat ocean floor holds little allure. But give them a mound, a slope, a canyon, and they will materialize in communities large enough to attract food they can eat, predators that can eat them and fishermen who glory in it all.
This is what has happened over the last 79 years at a federally managed disposal site called the Mud Dump, six miles east of Sandy Hook, N.J., and 10 miles south of the Rockaway peninsula. A mere spot on nautical charts, it has been the repository of uncounted tons of New York Harbor's dredged muck since World War I and is now in the middle of some of the richest fishing grounds on the East Coast.
 
Port Versus Fishermen
 It is also in the middle of a big fight about what to do with the removed sediment, or dredge spoils, from Newark Bay that are contaminated with the industrial poison dioxin and whether they will cause harm if placed in the habitat of scallops, crabs and other bottom feeders and the fish that graze nearby. 
 In many ways, it is a classic confrontation between economics and ecology, with all of the familiar questions about risk and how to manage it, with implications that may resonate in ports around the country.
The Port of New York and New Jersey maintains some of the most lucrative container-ship berths on the Atlantic, in a vast bayside warren called the Port Newark/ Elizabeth Marine Terminal. To insure the survival of almost 200,000 jobs and a $20 billion waterfront industry, it must dredge the berths annually. The environmental risks of the dredging, if any, are within acceptable limits set by the Government, say port officials, who have spent almost three years trying to address concerns about dioxin, a relatively new addition to the gallery of environmental villains. A permit issued Jan. 6 by the Army Corps of Engineers was blocked a week later by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency because of concern over the amount of spoils to be dredged.
The fishermen, and the environmentalists who support them, say a commercial and recreational fishing industry in the region, along with a large bluefin tuna business based in New England, are vulnerable as well. They see the risk of dioxin contamination as frightening and irreversible.
"The commercial-fishing industry isn't opposed to dredging and dumping dredge spoils in the ocean," said Jim Lovgren, whose trawler leaves Point Pleasant, N.J., dragging huge nets at depths of 200 feet to harvest whiting and ling. "We're an industry so we understand the needs of industry. But what's being overlooked and ignored is the money involved in the commercial and recreational fishing industry. They're dumping on another industry."
"Commercial and recreational fishing amounts to about $100 million a year in the region," said Stephen Sloan of the Association of Atlantic Charter Boats and Captains. "This is the best bluefish spot in the New York bight, if not the East Coast. Hundreds and hundreds of boats hit this spot on the weekends, from Belmar, Manasquan, Sandy Hook, Sheepshead Bay and Freeport. If they can find a way to do this, it will wreak havoc up and down the coast."
Mr. Sloan's concerns, and those of many other fishermen and environmentalists center on their fear of dioxin, both because of what science has said dioxin can do and because of what science acknowledges it still does not understand.
"This could be 'Silent Spring' incarnate," said Mr. Sloan, who also advises the National Marine Fisheries Association. "The substance they want to dump is highly toxic."
 
Toxic, but How Toxic?
 Scientists know that dioxin, a byproduct of herbicide manufacture, is readily absorbed in the food chain. But a Federal panel this fall said its review of studies of dioxin had indicated that it was most dangerous only to those who had prolonged exposure to it. The abandonment of an entire town -- Times Beach, Mo. -- a decade ago because of dioxin accumulation in the soil has since been called an overreaction.
And it is no longer clear that dioxin is, as scientists have proclaimed, the most toxic compound known to man. The latest data about its effects on people, fish and wildlife are still being evaluated by the E.P.A.
Thursday afternoon, as two days of meetings to revisit the issue came to a close at the E.P.A. regional headquarters in Manhattan, officials of labor, industry and the port met in a kind of pep rally at Berth 23 in Port Newark. Their mission, accomplished as a chilling breeze blew in off the bay, was to show solidarity with the longshoremen and other port workers whose jobs they feel are threatened by the E.P.A.'s delay.
"This isn't an issue of us against them," said Raymond L. Bramucci, the New Jersey Labor Commissioner. "It's an issue of public policy that has to come to a sensible resolution.
"It sounds terrible," he said of dioxin. "It may be terrible. But while we find this out, we have to keep this port open." He was joined by Stanley Brezenoff, the Port Authority's executive director; Barbara W. McConnell, the New Jersey Commerce Commissioner, and John Bowers, president of the Internatinal Longshoremen's Association, among others.
A spokeswoman for the E.P.A., Mary Breitenbach, said that there was no timetable for a decision on the dredging permit. She said the agency had a large amount of data to study and would probably have nothing to say on ocean dumping at least until the end of next week.
 
Cap's a Question, Too
 Besides concerns about dioxin's absorption in fish tissue, ecologists are also troubled by how the Mud Dump would be capped, and when. The Mud Dump is about a mile from a position known as 17 Fathoms, an area in which sports fishermen who come for bluefish, bonita, false albacore, blackfish and fluke are almost assured a good catch. Continual dumping of spoils and the sand caps that cover it have created a mound perhaps 45 feet high and two miles wide.
Despite assurances by the Corps of Engineers, fishermen believe that the sediment does not stay put. And they say the big December storm that caused widespread coastal flooding and severe damage churned up large amounts of the muck, spreading it around the ocean bottom.
The contaminated spoils would be capped with fresh sand, but ecologists say this might not happen until the dredging project ends. Port officials have said that 29 of the 62 berths would be dredged in a continuous operation over 40 days. The port will need to seek an additional permit each year.
"They can't cap till they finish dumping," said Bill Greaux of the Hi-Mar Striper Club, a fishing club. "So as they dump and send it through the water column, it'll hit the beaches when the tide turns."
Referring to New Jersey State Health Department guidelines on eating fish that may already be tainted by other commonly soluble chemicals, Mr. Greaux said, "What irks me is that we have one government agency telling us not to eat this stuff and another government agency dumping this stuff."

HEADLINE: For Some, Loan Proposal Calls Up Ugly Memories

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
For two decades, ever since New York City's questionable financing practices of the late 1960's and early 1970's nearly forced the city into bankruptcy, the idea of borrowing money to pay for operating expenses has been anathema at City Hall.
So dire were the consequences of avoiding the city's underlying problems by refinancing operating debts that any current budget proposal that smacks even remotely of the practice sets off alarm bells that can be heard as far away as Albany. They were ringing loudly yesterday. 
 A small but significant element of the financial plan that Mayor David N. Dinkins proposed yesterday calls for the city to borrow $215 million from an investment bank, using unpaid city property taxes as collateral. The proposal, a tiny element in a spending plan that totals $31.9 billion, immediately evoked concern among some fiscal experts and politicians.
 
Smoothing the Flow
 Senior mayoral aides called the loan from Chemical Securities, the public finance arm of Chemical Bank, a creative way of helping the city smooth its flow of tax revenue through a difficult time. They said the device is used often, in different forms, by other local governments and by private companies. An investment analyst and several fiscal experts agreed.
The bank, in a complex arrangement, would in effect lend the city the $215 million at about 5 percent interest, taking as collateral $400 million in unpaid property tax obligations. The city would then repay the money in the following fiscal year, the one that begins in July 1994, after the delinquent taxes have been collected.
Philip R. Michael, the city's budget director, described the transaction as an accounting maneuver. "It's not borrowing on your future," he said. "It's not borrowing on your credit card."
Mr. Michael said that, because property-tax delinquencies have increased during the recession, the loan was a way for the city to "smooth out our cash flow," to obtain earlier, via the loan, what the city will eventually receive from collecting the delinquent taxes.
"We are just getting an advance against our accounts receivable," he said. "It's an absolute lock that in that pool of $400 million in delinquencies, you'll get the $200 million. In fact, it's a lock that we'll get the $400 million. There's no risk."
"This is not going out there to borrow money," Mr. Michael added. "We already have the money owed to us. It's money that's already ours. We're just having it accelerated."
 
Seems Gimmicky to Some
 But some elected officials and fiscal experts did not share Mr. Michael's confidence in the arrangement. They said the proposal -- intended to help the city close a potential budget gap of $2.1 billion in the next fiscal year, which begins on July 1 -- seemed reminiscent of some of the discredited financial gimmickry of the 1970's.
Raymond D. Horton, the president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit group that monitors the city's finances, said the loan was different in scale and in many particulars from the deficit financing that helped bring the city down 20 years ago. But Mr. Horton contended that the underlying principle was strikingly similar.
"It's just borrowing against the future," Mr. Horton said.
"This is small, it really is," he said. "Sometimes we're accused of being real purists on this issue. City people may say, 'Look, it's only $200 million and the state's not helping us and so we have to do things that we don't really want to do.' But it's really a repeat performance of what went on in the late 60's and early 70's. The complaint then was that nobody sounded the alarm."
 
A 'Disturbing Sign'
 Other fiscal experts expressed less criticism than did Mr. Horton, but many said they were still concerned about the strategy. The State Comptroller, Edward V. Regan, said in a prepared statement that the loan was a "disturbing sign" that the Dinkins administration was failing to get the city's long-term expenses in line with its long-term revenues.
Allen J. Proctor, the executive director of the State Financial Control Board, said that, while the loan might not technically be construed as deficit financing, he objected to it because it would let the city put off more difficult choices.
"The city is saying that it wants 1995 income in 1994, and it's paying 5 percent to do so," Mr. Proctor said.
"These kinds of things put off confronting the very difficult reality: some tax is going to have to be raised or some service is going to have to be eliminated," he said.
 
Criticism Was Expected
 Mr. Michael and his aides -- who said the idea of the loan had come from the investment bank and that there had been intense negotiations over the proposal in recent weeks -- clearly expected some criticism of the loan. Mr. Michael said, for example, that he had discussed it on Thursday with bond analysts at Moody's Investor Services.
The director of the public finance department at Moody's, Daniel Heimowitz, said yesterday that the practice of selling uncollected receipts was common in private industry and that, in various ways, other local governments do similar things, like selling off tax liens. Mr. Heimowitz said the city's proposal did not alarm him.
"Given the budget pressures, it is not inconsistent with some of the risks and pressures that the city is dealing with," he said.
"To us, it doesn't seem to be a tip of an iceberg or an opening up to something broader," Mr. Heimowitz said.
"The loan is very clearly identified against a very specific tax," he said. "It's a very specific receivable with a history of collection. It's a much more defined sort of advance of revenue than the kinds of practices that the city maintained in the early 70's. This is different."
Some fiscal experts predicted that as the city's financial picture alters during the next several months, the Mayor and his aides would probably drop the loan from their proposed budget.
In the complex politics of the budget, the city usually offers a grim snapshot of its finances in January. Then, after it has wrung from the State Legislature all that it can in March, the city revises its budget in April and May, generally showing an improved outlook. Last year the city acknowledged by late spring that it had accumulated a surplus of more than $500 million.
The Mayor and Mr. Michael say that such a large surplus is unlikely this year. But Mr. Michael, when pressed yesterday by a reporter who said that some people expect the surplus to grow this spring, smiled and said, "We hope they're right."

HEADLINE: 30-Year Bonds Rise in Quiet Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices finished mostly higher in quiet trading yesterday, first dropping on news of unexpectedly strong factory spending but later rallying on hints the Government would cut its long-term debt.
The price of the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was up 2/32 point, with its yield dropping to 7.19 percent, its lowest since August 1986. 
 Selling pressure was initially heavy, analysts said, after the release of a Commerce Department report showing a 9.1 percent surge in durable goods orders by United States factories last December and a 4.1 rise for the year.
The bond market normally reacts unfavorably to signs of rapid economic growth, which is generally inflationary. Inflation erodes the value of fixed-income investments such as government securities.
 
Altman Remarks Draw Investors
 However, investors returned to the market on comments by Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman that the Clinton Administration is considering changing the Government's borrowing mix to cut long-term and increase short-term debt.
"That was the key factor supporting the long end; we got some buyers into the market at the end" following Mr. Altman's remarks," said William Sullivan, director of money market research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
While Mr. Altman said the Government was "not on the verge of a decision," the market has been fueled in recent weeks by speculation of a reduction in the supply of 30-year, or "long," bonds at coming Treasury auctions.
The market finished the week focused on the budget deficit reduction measures put forth by President Clinton and backed by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, analysts said.
"The policies they're talking about are contractionary and potentially a drag on the economy, although there is talk of a stimulus," said Dan Seto, an economist at Nikko Securities. A sluggish economy could prompt the Fed to lower interest rates, he said. Falling interest rates tend to bolster bond prices.
"It shows sensitivity of the market," Mr. Seto said. "It has taken bad news very well and good news even better."
 
Intermediate Rates Gain
 In the secondary market for Treasury securities, short-term maturities were off by 1/32 to 2/32 point, while intermediate maturities gained between 2/32 and 8/32 point, the Telerate Inc. financial information service reported.
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills rose to 2.89 percent, up 4 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Discount rates on six-month and one-year bills each rose one basis point, to 3.03 percent and 3.20 prcent, respectively.
The Federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 2.9375 percent, down from 3 percent late Thursday.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 9814/32 , up from 9811/32 Wednesday. The average yield to maturity was unchanged at 6.31 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Surges as U.S. Data Show a Stronger Economy

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar had a substantial rally yesterday after the release of several better-than-expected reports on the economy.
Gold prices declined after rising overseas. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $330.20 an ounce, off 30 cents from Thursday. The Republic National Bank said gold slipped 30 cents an ounce to a late price of $329.70. 
 The dollar was propelled higher by a Government report showing orders to American factories for durable goods jumped 9.1 percent in December. The Commerce Department also reported that personal incomes rose 1 percent in December, helping to raise earnings for the year by 4.7 percent, while consumer spending increased 5.3 percent in 1992.
Both reports were more positive than analysts had anticipated. "They confirmed that the pace of economic recovery accelerated at the end of 1992," said Marc Chandler, an analyst with the advisory firm IDEA.
The dollar advanced sharply, and "the gains were all the more impressive because they were scored despite a very hard line from the Bundesbank about not cutting rates," Mr. Chandler said.
The Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, has been under pressure to trim interest rates to stimulate economic growth. Lower rates overseas make yields on dollar-denominated securities more attractive, thereby increasing investors' need for dollars.
The British pound fell to a six-year low yesterday, continuing the fallout from the Bank of England's steep rate cut earlier in the week. That the central bank allowed the pound to fall indicated that "Britain doesn't really care about where the pound is going," Mr. Chandler said.
In London the pound fell to $1.4873, from $1.5175 late Thursday. In New York, it cost $1.4865 to buy 1, down from $1.5160 Thursday.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 124.30 Japanese yen, up from Thursday's closing bid of 124.15 yen. Later in London, it rose to 124.74 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 124.65 yen, up from 124.20 yen on Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.6110 German marks, up from 1.5862; 1.4880 Swiss francs, up from 1.4620; 5.4495 French francs, up from 5.3660; 1,493.25 Italian lire, up from 1,477.25, and 1.2678 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2692.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday, included: 1.6085 German marks, up from 1.5860; 1.4853 Swiss francs, up from 1.4615; 5.4430 French francs, up from 5.3725; 1.8105 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7846; 1,500.50 Italian lire, up from 1,477.00, and 1.2705 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2707.
Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $330.50 an ounce, from $330.15 late Thursday.
Silver prices were mixed. On the Comex in New York, silver for current delivery settled at $3.652 an ounce, down from $3.70 on Thursday.

HEADLINE: A Timid Stimulus Package

 BODY:
President Clinton, reacting to news of huge layoffs at I.B.M., Boeing, Sears and other corporate giants, plans to propose $15 billion or $20 billion in Federal spending hikes and tax cuts to stimulate job growth. Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, says the Clinton plan sounds fine.
No wonder. A $15 billion stimulus package is virtually meaningless to a $6 trillion economy. Mr. Greenspan isn't worried that the package will overheat the economy and ignite inflation because the package isn't big enough to matter. 
 Despite this week's surprisingly good news about growth in the last three months of 1992 -- 3.8 percent annualized -- the economy is still operating well below capacity and growing too slowly to bring down unemployment very far or very fast. It still needs a shot of adrenaline. That means a package -- made up of public investment and tax cuts targeted on private investment -- at least three times the size Mr. Clinton seems poised to propose.
What the growth figures released this week show is that recovery is firmly under way. The economy has been growing at a 3.5 percent rate for the past six months. But by historical standards, the recovery is slow.
Worse than slow, the recovery has also been "jobless." Companies have raised output without increasing employment. In the long run, such gains in productivity will be welcomed. But for a year or two, unemployment will stay uncomfortably high.
The troublesome combination of slow growth and high unemployment presents Mr. Clinton with an opportunity. He can jack up Federal spending without fear of straining the economy or fueling inflation. The situation invites boldness; so far, Mr. Clinton offers timidity.
In the past, most stimulus packages have emphasized higher transfer payments, like unemployment compensation, and lower income taxes. The idea was to stimulate consumption. Mr. Clinton offers a better idea. He plans to boost investment by accelerating public projects that are ready to go but held up by state and local governments for lack of funds. And he proposes to cut taxes on private investment in new plant and equipment -- a powerful way to boost productivity.
It doesn't take guts for Mr. Clinton to urge Congress to spend more and tax less. But the package could raise fears that he isn't serious about taming the long-term deficit. To calm Wall Street, he will need to issue a credible deficit-reduction plan, as promised.
Labor Secretary Robert Reich conceded that a $15 billion stimulus was small, but asserted it would nonetheless pack a psychological wallop. That sounds more like psychobabble than economics.
A $50 billion package of accelerated public investment spending and targeted tax cuts would boost long-term growth and short-term jobs. It would be big enough to do some good, but not so large as to do any harm.

HEADLINE: Keynes Wouldn't Know His Economic Heirs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Kudos to Alice H. Amsden for "From P.C. to E.C." (Op-Ed, Jan. 12) and to David Allen and Herbert Barchoff for letters the same day. They demonstrate how far removed the academic mainstream of economics is from modern economic realities. John Maynard Keynes himself, long a pariah in the profession, would find much of this work alien to his central concern with the capacity of the economy to provide adequate jobs and income for ordinary people, and to sustain high employment over time. 
 Today's self-appointed guardians of the Keynesian school focus on a narrow segment of Keynes's work while ignoring the rest: for example, his view that stability and abundance over the long term require, in his words, "the euthanasia of the rentier" and "a somewhat comprehensive socialization of investment." He understood the corrupting role of unaccountable power in the hands of a financial and business elite.
These issues seldom arise in modern economic discourse. Equally rare is serious attention to today's inequalities in distribution of wealth and income, the extinction in the modern global corporations of even minimal loyalty to the problems in their own societies, the effects of reducing and weakening the ability of working people to unionize in their own defense or the deference of the Federal Reserve to the needs of its banking constituency, to name only a few.
We looked in vain for insight from the economics establishment about the deindustrialization of America, the loss of managerial competence, the steady increase in poverty and economic insecurity, and the destructive effects of a massive military buildup over the last 12 years.
For more than 70 years the most useful economic insights have come from such oddballs outside the mainstream as Thorstein Veblen, Piero Sraffa, Gardiner Means, Gunnar Myrdal, Joan Robinson and Robert Lekachman, among others. None of them would have been considered seriously for the Council of Economic Advisers, much less full professorships at Chicago, Cambridge or Princeton.

HEADLINE: Keynes Wouldn't Know His Economic Heirs;
The Empty Fortress

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"From P.C. to E.C." (Op-Ed, Jan. 12), Alice Amsden's excellent article on economic correctness, only touches the surface of the tyranny conservative "high" theory has imposed on economic discourse and economic training. Two million college students a year are enrolled in introductory macroeconomics courses. For more than a generation, these courses have been dominated by the Samuelson-originated, Keynesian synthesis. 
 This synthesis emphasizes that the Federal Government can play an active role in promoting high employment. For a generation students were taught that Government deficits can promote employment and that the business cycle can be tamed by Government demand management.
In the last decade, there has been a radical transformation of macroeconomic teachings led by the same economically correct ideas Professor Amsden discusses. Concepts unheard of 20 years ago -- the natural unemployment rate, rational expectations, aggregate demand and aggregate supply, long-run Phillips Curve, equilibrium business cycles -- are now central to introductory courses.
These concepts have two things in common. (1) They all attack Keynesian notions that activist government policies are helpful. As unemployment has risen from the 3.5 percent to 4 percent experienced in 1965-70 to the 5.5 percent to 7.5 percent of the last decade, students are taught that this is natural, that government policies are powerless to do anything about it and that government stimulants will only make matters worse by generating inflation rates. The standard introductory course virtually ignores that this "natural" unemployment consigns black Americans to unemployment rates equal to more than 10 percent in "good" times.
(2) These concepts are virtually untestable, relying on axiomatic acceptance of theoretical assumptions.
As Professor Amsden notes, any attempt by individual economists to question these underlying assumptions "disqualifies them, by E. C. etiquette, as 'real' economists." Thus, the tyranny of these high theorists is turning the economic profession into ideological defenders of the status quo and away from the innovative applied science it had been during its Keynesian era.

HEADLINE: Israelis Strive to Prevent U.N. Sanctions

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Jan. 29

 BODY:
Feeling bolstered by a seal of approval from the country's High Court of Justice, Israel renewed its diplomatic offensive today to stave off United Nations sanctions over its deportation of more than 400 Palestinians to Lebanon.
Government officials said they were resigned to a new strong condemnation from the Security Council in coming days, possibly accompanied by a deadline for bringing back the hundreds of Islamic fundamentalists expelled from the occupied territories six weeks ago, accused of being threats to Israeli security. 
 Their focus instead was on averting sanctions, something that Israel has never had to face over the years despite having been a frequent target of Council denunciations. But it is also something that looms as a bigger threat this time because of Arab charges that the enforcement of resolutions against Iraq but not those against Israel amount to a double standard.
 
Warning From Rabin
 Using his most forceful language yet to underline a point he had made before, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin warned that any "operative steps" against Israel would "wipe out the chances for peace in the Middle East."
"If the message the Arabs get is that they can use the Security Council to coerce Israel to do as they wish, then I tell you that there is absolutely no chance for peace with them," he was quoted by the press as having told officials of his Labor Party on Thursday night. "Whoever fails to grasp this basic fact of life fails to understand the A B C's of international relations."
In terms of domestic opinion, Mr. Rabin felt he was on solid ground. A poll published today in the newspaper Hadashot -- conducted on Wednesday, a day before the High Court upheld the deportations -- showed 78 percent public approval of the Government's action, which came after a series of Palestinian attacks that left five Israeli servicemen dead.
 
Pressure From U.S.
 Nevertheless, while he insisted that the expulsions will stand, Mr. Rabin was under pressure from the United States to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis. Even though the Clinton Administration says it opposes Security Council sanctions, it also wants to avoid having to cast a veto that might compromise the American role as chief sponsor of the Middle East peace talks.
The Prime Minister spoke today with Secretary of State Warren Christopher, after meeting on Thursday in Tel Aviv with the United States Ambassador, William C. Harrop. In Washington, a senior State Department official said Mr. Christopher stressed the need "to get a process under way that could be pointed to as progress on the issue."
Israeli officials declined to discuss details of the conversations, but they expressed confidence that President Clinton would make certain that sanctions against Israel did not become one of the first foreign-policy developments of his young Administration.
According to Israeli press reports, the Americans have proposed that the expelled Palestinians be brought back from their makeshift tent camp in Lebanon to a stretch of southern Lebanon proclaimed by Israel as its "security zone." The State Department official said Mr. Christopher's suggestions included the shift to the security zone and an expedited appeals process for the deportees that would allow some to return home quickly.
 
Opposed by Rabin
 Mr. Rabin has expressed his firm opposition to returning all the deported men to Israeli-controlled territory at one time, and there is also no sign that the Palestinians themselves would accept anything short of return to the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Several Israeli news organizations reported that the Government, in an effort to show flexibility, was looking to bring back dozens of the banished Palestinians after a study of their cases by new military review boards created immediately after the court decision.
Aides to the Prime Minister called the reports "speculation," but they also did not deny them.
 
'Reviewing the List'
 "I can't tell you that we are not bringing back anyone," said Oded Ben-Ami, a spokesman for Mr. Rabin, in his twin capacity as Defense Minister. "But we are reviewing the list, and if we find there are people who were mistakenly removed according to the established criteria, then we will reconsider."
In response to the High Court's instructions, the Israeli Army set up a procedure in Lebanon today to make it possible for the deported men to appeal their banishment in person. An army officer was posted at a checkpoint leading to the security zone, but he waited for hours in vain for Palestinians to appear.
In their unanimous ruling, the seven justices said the Government had to make "practical arrangements" that would enable the Palestinians to file personal appeals that had been denied them when they were taken across the border on Dec. 17.
Although troubled by due process questions rooted in the mass nature of the expulsions, including the lack of prior appeals, the justices declared the action to be nonetheless legitimate under prevailing emergency regulations in the territories.
 
A Makeshift Camp
 The exiles have spent the last month and a half in a makeshift camp about a mile from the checkpoint, on a desolate hillside that lies between Israeli and Lebanese Army outposts. Like Israel, Lebanon says it is not responsible for the Palestinians, and from the start it has refused to let them onto territory fully under its control.
To the surprise of no one, the deported men went nowhere near the checkpoint today.
As in the past, they said that to file appeals would be to accept the legitimacy of an Israeli action that has been broadly condemned overseas as a violation of international law. "Our decision is fixed and final, and will never change," said the Palestinians' spokesman, Abdul Aziz al-Rantisi, who is from the Gaza Strip.

Dr. David MacDougall was taking a brief, well-earned nap on a couch in the neurosurgery department at Hermann Hospital in Houston when his beeper sounded at 3 A.M. on July 24, 1988. It was the emergency room calling and the conversation was brief, a basic recitation of the facts. The patient was a Latin American male, age 24, who had been shot in a dispute in Madisonville, 85 miles away, at 1:15 A.M. One bullet had grazed his skull, near his left temple, and the other had entered through the back of his neck, penetrating the spinal cord.
The patient had been taken to a local hospital in a private car. It was unclear whether he had been able to breathe on his own during that trip or if any lack of oxygen had affected his brain. When he arrived at the hospital, about six minutes after the shooting, he was given cardiopulmonary resuscitation and put on a ventilator. After he was stabilized, he was transferred by helicopter to Hermann. Officially, Hermann's emergency room was full that night, closed to incoming trauma patients. But this young man was admitted. The word in the E.R. was that he would probably make a good organ donor. 
 MacDougall hung up the phone and walked quickly down the five flights of stairs between the neurosurgery floor and the emergency room. The patient, whose name was Armando Dimas, lay on a stretcher in the middle of the gleaming room. He looked small for a grown man, about 125 pounds. Heavily drugged but conscious, he was squinting in the bright overhead lights. A nurse stood beside his stretcher, adjusting the monitors that tracked his heartbeat and respiration rate. His clothes had been cut from his body by the staff in the emergency room, and a hospital-issue sheet was tucked around him from the rib cage down. Numerous and dramatic tattoos were fully visible against his pale brown skin. A snarling tiger crouched along his left arm, a sultry woman vamped down the length of his right arm and a woman, a man and a flower were sketched randomly across his chest. Colorful, MacDougall thought, as he entered the room and saw his patient for the first time.
MacDougall leaned over the stretcher so that Dimas did not have to turn to see his face. The patient's eyes were open and he looked responsive and alert. The doctor made a mental note, which would soon become a more formal chart entry, that the lack of oxygen did not appear to have made him a vegetable.
Straightening, MacDougall reached for the X-ray envelope and pulled out the films. What he saw made him inhale so sharply he whistled. The devastation caused by a bullet to the spine depends largely on where it enters. The lower the bullet, the less the damage, because the severed nerves will most likely be below the point of injury. A shot to the lumbar region, or the lower back, will likely paralyze the hips and legs but leave the arms alone. A shot to the thoracic vertebrae, or those in the back of the rib cage, will take away the feeling in the chest area, too. A bullet in the cervical vertebrae, which are in the neck, can paralyze everything from the neck down. The opaque sheets that MacDougall was holding against a lighted box in the emergency room showed a bullet lodged higher in the spinal cord than he had ever seen in a patient who survived.
"This guy should be dead," MacDougall thought, and slipped the X-rays back into their envelope.
For the next 15 minutes, he conducted a physical exam that essentially confirmed what he already knew. As he went through the familiar game of neurological Simon Says -- "Can you move your right leg? Your left leg? Can you wiggle your nose?" -- MacDougall was frustrated. Not with the poor response he was getting, but with the fact that he was doing these tests in the first place. This man had no chance of recovery. Even if he survived, which was unlikely, injuries like this one do not reverse themselves. In neurosurgery slang, Armando Dimas would spend his life as "a head in a bed," with a body that was more or less irrelevant.
In every hospital of every city in the United States there is a patient like Armando Dimas. The illness or injuries might be different, but the message is the same -- medical progress often raises more questions than it can answer. At first, the question asked by this young man's doctors was one of life and death: Is it worth saving a life if it is to be spent trapped in a motionless prison? Later, the questions would turn to money: Who should pay -- and where would they find the money to pay -- the stratospheric cost of that motionless life? One of the earliest rules learned by medical students dates back to Hippocrates: First, Do No Harm. But the complexities of modern medicine mean it is impossible to be certain what constitutes harm. Would it be more harmful, David MacDougall wondered as he left the examining room, to let this patient die or to let him live?
 TO EVERYONE'S SURPRISE, ARMANDO Dimas did not die. But for the rest of his life he would be paralyzed from the jaw down. He would not be able to breathe without a machine. If his cheek itched, he could not scratch it. He couldn't cross his legs, wiggle his toes, change the channel on the television set or turn off the overhead light. In his old life, he might have whistled at the attractive women who walked in and out of his room all day. Now, as they dressed and undressed him and handled his body as if it were another piece of hospital equipment, he fantasized instead that he could feel the water on his skin as they washed his limbs and that he could bat their hands away and finish the task himself.
On the day he was shot, Dimas had been in the United States for 12 years. He was here illegally, although he and his entire family had applied for legal residency under the new amnesty law. He had come from Matamoros, Mexico, a town that defines poverty. His father was the first to cross the border, and he worked and saved for several years before he sent for his wife and 12 children. They walked together across the Rio Grande at a point where the river narrows to a trickle, then hitched a ride to Houston, 354 miles north. It took three weeks for them to make their way to the small rural town where their father was working in a mushroom factory, cleaning and stemming the vegetables.
Home for the family of 14 was a five-room trailer with cracked windows. Armando and four brothers shared one cramped bedroom. His young son, Armando Jr., who lived with his mother, shared the room on his frequent visits. The heating system never really worked, but the stove usually did and everyone gathered in the kitchen for warmth during the blessedly short Texas winters. The better life they had moved here to find was always a few paychecks out of reach.
What was Hermann now to do with this helpless man? His mother, Victoria, refused to face the fact that her son's injuries were permanent, insisting that a big hospital like Hermann could find a way to work a miracle. She would not allow doctors to tell her son that he would never move again, a restriction that brought mixed reaction from the staff. If he were told his fate, they were certain, he would ask to die (a request they could not legally meet). But they could agree not to save him if he had a sudden cardiac arrest -- a likely event in someone so sick. Whatever his decision, they insisted, it should be his to make, regardless of what his mother said. Yet everyone was hesitant about asking Dimas directly, against his mother's specific instructions.
Cindy Walker would gladly have told him, but for the first 48 hours she wasn't certain what he knew. Walker was the social worker in charge of Dimas's care, and her desire to do good runs as deep as her Texas accent. But she shows this compassion more often by chucking a patient under the chin than by stroking his hand. Her ultimate goal was to make it possible for the Dimas relatives to eventually take him home, ventilator and all, and care for him with the help of round-the-clock nurses. It was in Hermann's interest to find some way to discharge Dimas. As a patient with no health insurance, his care could cost the hospital thousands of dollars a month for the rest of his life.
But a ventilator-dependent quadriplegic is a weighty burden for any family, even one with limitless funds and free time, and this family had neither.
'HOW IS HE GOING TO RETURN home?" Mrs. Dimas asked Cindy Walker when the subject was first raised. "We aren't educated enough to run that machine. Something will happen to him, and we won't know what to do. We aren't educated, and it's too late for us to become educated. This is all we are." It pained Mrs. Dimas to say this, since she and her husband had always prided themselves on protecting their children. They had fled Mexico for what they hoped would be a better life and had worked dirty, difficult jobs every harvest season. Their life had not worked out as planned, but they still had their pride. Now they found themselves turning their son away.
Their inability to care for him, however, did not keep his relatives from expressing disapproval over the care he was getting at Hermann. Specifically, they did not agree with MacDougall's increasingly certain statements that their son would never walk again. They insisted, regularly and loudly, that if the bullet that they saw on the X-ray were removed, their boy would be just fine.
MacDougall tried to explain that the real threat to Dimas's life would come from surgery to remove the bullet. "The problem isn't the bullet," he said "It's the damage the bullet did upon entry. To take it out we would have to cut into his brain. He would not be able to survive that operation, particularly not in his current condition."
Unconvinced, Mrs. Dimas asked Cindy Walker for a second opinion "from a different doctor of the brain," and within hours another specialist stopped by the rotating bed. He concurred with MacDougall's opinion, and his note concluded: "Prognosis for recovery very poor. Unlikely he will be able to breathe on his own. No further recommendations."
When told of the results of the second opinion, Mrs. Dimas insisted that a third doctor, this time from another hospital, examine her son. The physician in charge of Dimas's care responded by asking Walker to call a meeting of the family, the social workers, the key medical staff and someone from the hospital chaplain's office. Everyone gathered three days after the shooting. The only person missing was the patient, who hadn't been invited.
There were no social pleasantries to open the meeting. "I think you know everyone here," Walker said to Mrs. Dimas.
With the help of two other neurosurgeons who had seen Dimas, MacDougall explained, once again, what his patient's chances were. For three days MacDougall had been tempering his message with hope -- as a cushion and a hedge, a way to ease reality onto the family and to protect himself if an odds-defying recovery actually happened. Now he feared that approach had been wrong. Hope was the only part of the message that this family heard. He needed to speak more clearly.
"We have to make decisions," he concluded, looking directly at Mrs. Dimas, "and those decisions have to be based on the reality that this is all there will ever be."
Walker, the social worker, nodded. That's what she had been saying all along.
"Have you talked to him directly?" she asked. "How much of this has sunk in?"
First MacDougall and then the others on the case said they hadn't had a real discussion with Dimas.
"Isn't it time someone talked to him?" Walker asked, then waited as the question was translated for Mrs. Dimas.
The weathered, weary woman shook her head furiously, speaking so quickly that the adept translator had difficulty keeping pace.
"It's not true, it's not true. You can't tell him that because it's not true. He can walk, he will walk. He can breathe; he will not need that machine. Why do you say otherwise?"
Hermann is a big modern hospital, Mrs. Dimas said, as if daring the staff to meet her challenge. Surely all these doctors could cure him. Otherwise she would find someplace else.
MINUTES AFTER THE meeting ended, Cindy Walker called Lin Weeks, the chairman of the Hermann ethics committee, which decides cases too hard (or too hot) for one person to make. Weeks, in turn, called Randy Gleason, the hospital's lawyer, and the three met briefly that same afternoon in Weeks's cluttered office. This was an informal meeting of the ethics committee, of a type that Weeks held every so often when the question seemed simple and no formal request for a full session had been made. Walker was certain that what she was seeing happen was wrong. She wanted to know whether someone less involved felt the same.
Weeks and Gleason went over the details of the case, and then Gleason said: "We don't need the whole committee on this. We don't really have a problem. There is no reason not to tell him and every reason to tell him."
"What are his chances of surviving this?" Weeks asked.
"It's touch and go, but he's come further than anyone thought so far," Walker said. "He's bound to arrest sometime, and if we make him D.N.R. -- we'll ask him first, I mean, but he'll probably want it. I sure would." A Do Not Resuscitate order can be placed on a patient's chart at his request.
The next day, at 11 A.M., Armando Dimas was told. Among those who crowded around his bed were his mother, a translator, Cindy Walker and the chief nurse on the neurosurgery floor, Norma McNair. McNair did most of the talking, as the ventilator wheezed in the background. At one point, the alarm on the machine went off and a nurse came over to check the source of the problem. McNair kept talking while the nurse adjusted the dials.
She told Dimas that his condition was permanent. Nothing is 100 percent certain, she said, but we are fairly sure this is the best it will be. She explained how the spinal cord works, how it was damaged, that it doesn't grow back and cannot be fixed.
Then she described all the things that might happen to him because of the paralysis, further complications that might threaten his life. He would be susceptible to pneumonia because he couldn't cough on his own and his lungs could clog more easily. If that happened, they would give him antibiotics unless he said he didn't want them. He was also susceptible to heart failure because all his muscles were weakened, including the ones that held up his veins and hence his blood pressure. If his heart stopped, they would try to resuscitate him, and she described in detail what that would mean.
When she finished speaking, she asked him a long list of questions, each of which could be answered with either a yes or a no. He was to respond by blinking his eyes -- two blinks for yes, one for no.
Do you understand what we're telling you?
Yes.
Do you want to have medicine for infections?
Yes.
Do you want to be resuscitated if your heart stops?
Yes.
Do you understand what that means?
Yes.
You know they will pound on your chest, they may break your ribs, they may use electric shock on your chest?
Yes.
You know you could live just like this for many years?
Yes.
There was annoyance in the blinks now. Dimas, as he later explained, had the feeling these women wanted him to give up and die, an idea he found confusing since he was sure they would eventually cure him. Mrs. Dimas stood up and put her hand on her son's brow.
"You want to live?" Cindy Walker asked, her voice betraying amazement at his decision and admiration for what she considered pure but misguided faith. "You know you can always change your mind about this."
Dimas blinked twice.
"This isn't the only time we'll talk about this, so if you change your mind, you'll have a chance to tell us," Walker said. "We'll ask you again."
As they left the room, Cindy Walker whispered: "This guy is gonna survive. Now what do we do?"
HAZEL MITCHELL FIRST learned that Armando Dimas was a patient at Hermann several weeks after he arrived, when it was apparent that his condition was stable. Mitchell's job was to get uninsured patients out of the hospital as quickly as was medically possible, and until that could be accomplished, to see that their care was as economical as possible.
Dimas had been transferred from intensive care to the intermediate neurological ward nearly two weeks before Mitchell came to visit. When she arrived at his room, he was surrounded by nurses. Mitchell didn't stop to talk. Dimas barely noticed. From where he sat, she was just another stranger with a Hermann ID badge.
Hers was a particularly important, if thankless, job at a hospital that was seriously strapped for money. Hermann was already $4 million in debt when Dimas was admitted. Eventually, the hospital would have to close its emergency room to most trauma patients, meaning that there would be one remaining trauma center in an area of three million people. But for now, the hospital was hoping to solve its problems through stringent cost cutting. The 24-hour cafeteria, often the only source of food for on-call residents and families keeping vigils, had its hours cut back sharply, replaced by coffee makers and vending machines. And managed-care clinicians like Hazel Mitchell scrupulously reviewed patients' charts, to see where costs could be cut.
Back in her office, Mitchell pulled out the computer printout of Dimas's ever-increasing bill. Every item used at Hermann carries a computer-coded label -- every packet of Tylenol, box of rubber gloves, tank of oxygen, tube of skin cream. And every time a patient is given a pill, has the cut on his forehead cleaned, needs a new tank of oxygen or wants lotion rubbed on his dry skin, a nurse peels the labels from the needed items and sticks them into the chart where they make their way through the bureaucracy, into the computer and onto his final bill.
The charges add up quickly. Each dose of Tylenol costs 70 cents. Swabbing the cut on his forehead costs 80 cents for the dab of hydrogen peroxide, $20 for the newly opened box of sterile rubber gloves and $2 for a sterile sponge. The oxygen runs $5 per hour, or $120 a day. A tube of Lubriderm is $5.30.
Armando Dimas's bill had reached $57,021.61 in just three weeks. Some charges were one-time items: $439.50 for the time spent in the Hermann emergency room, $1,248 for the helicopter at a rate of $12 per mile. Other charges would be reduced or eliminated now that he had left the I.C.U. A bed there is billed at $495 per day, while a room in the intermediate unit is $410. The rotating bed, at a charge of $161 per day, could also be phased out.
Even with those savings, however, the remaining numbers were staggering. The ventilator carries a charge of $273 per day. Each time secretions are suctioned from the ventilator, which happens as often as once an hour, it requires a trach-care tray: $28.25 each. Every morning his blood is drawn to test the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels at a cost of $93.75. The two daily pouches of intravenous food cost $95 apiece. The saline solution that keeps him hydrated comes to $12.50 per bag.
These price tags, of course, do not reflect the cost of the items to Hermann. No mouthwash costs the $2.30 per gargle that Hermann charges. Each line item on the bill includes a certain amount of overhead to cover the salaries of the supply staff, electricity to light the storeroom, telephone and mailing costs. Security officers have to be paid, as do page operators, the cleaning crew and administrators like Lin Weeks and Randy Gleason. A few more cents are added to cover the patients who never actually pay their bills and insurance companies that reject claims long after services are rendered.
The numbers Mitchell cares most about are those that are left when the extras are subtracted, leaving the actual cost to the hospital. To find those numbers she multiplies the amounts on the bill by real-world percentages, figured out for her long ago and printed on a pocket-size chart.
During his first 21 days at Hermann, Dimas was billed $13,674 for supplies like rubber gloves, catheter tubes, enemas, abdominal support binders, foam bed cushions, adhesive tape and sterile gauze. Mitchell multiplied that by 0.441316 to arrive at the actual cost of $6,034.55. The respiratory therapy bill of $14,076 was multiplied by 0.374903, meaning it actually cost the hospital $5,277.13 to keep Dimas breathing. The pharmacy bill of $7,940.90 was multiplied by 0.491065 for an actual cost of $3,899.49. In all, the actual cost of Armando Dimas's first three weeks at Hermann was $29,837.
There was a time when Hermann Hospital would not have worried about numbers like these. In fact, there was a time when Hazel Mitchell's job didn't even exist. When she graduated from nursing school in 1967, much of the technology that costs so dearly had not been invented. Ventilators were relatively new, and portable versions, like the one Hermann was trying to use to send Dimas elsewhere, were not yet invented. There were no CAT scans, sonograms, test tube fertilization, laser surgery or microscopic surgery. And the increase in costs was paralleled by a decrease in ways to pay for it all. The number of uninsured patients in the United States is rising steadily. When the patient cannot pay the bill, the hospital must absorb the cost.
As she worked her calculator through Dimas's chart, Mitchell saw no easy solution. Dimas was not a Houston resident, so he did not qualify for the county hosptial. Cases like his bring to mind an old Chinese proverb: "If you save a life, you are responsible for it."
For now, there was little to do besides keeping track of his charges and suggesting ways to save a few pennies here and there. For instance, Mitchell noted on the chart, Lubriderm lotion costs about half as much as Nivea lotion. Perhaps the nurses could use more of one and less of the other.
About an hour after she began her initial review, Mitchell put her findings into a folder that she marked with Dimas's name and patient ID number. She would add to the file weekly despite the odds against any form of reimbursement to Hermann. "Who knows," she said. "Maybe he'll win the lottery."
HOW MUCH WAS Hermann required to do for Armando Dimas? It was a question Mary Coffey, his occupational therapist, found herself asking almost every day. Occupational therapy is about reteaching patients the tasks of everyday life -- feeding yourself, tying your shoes, opening the front door. The goal is not to do everything exactly the same way as before, but to learn to compensate, using muscles that are still strong in place of ones that are permanently weakened or using specially designed tools in the absence of sinew and synapse.
Coffey had never worked with a patient with a spinal cord injury as severe as Dimas's. She improvised as she went along. Over the weeks, she helped him to do things the textbooks said he should not be able to do, like sitting in a chair. But that victory simply revealed the frustrating fact that his wheelchair was too big -- his head flopped in one direction and his body listed uncomfortably in another.
Without a proper wheelchair, her other plans were impossible. She wanted to teach him to use a "mouth-stick," a long, slender rod with a mouthpiece at one end that can be used to do tasks usually done by fingers, like pressing computer keyboards or writing on a chalkboard. Time and patience could eventually translate those abilities into a job. But first he had to be able to sit up straight.
While the occupational therapy helped Dimas with his posture, other departments were helping him do things like speak and eat. It took most of August before daily tests ruled out any physical reason he couldn't eat and several more weeks for speech therapists to teach him how to best use his functioning mouth muscles to help chew and swallow. He began by sipping clear liquids through a straw. Soon he was eating everything in sight. His mother, who had sat helplessly by his bed from 9 A.M. to 7 P.M. every day, saw this as a chance to re-enter his life, and each day she came with plates of homemade tamales and burritos. She fed these offerings to him, placing each bite gently in his mouth, then patting his lips with a napkin after each swallow.
He could talk, too. At the end of August, the breathing tube in his throat was enhanced with a device called a talking trach. With proper training, patients fitted with this device can force air slowly through the double rings of the tube to produce a breathy, hoarse sound. Dimas was a surprisingly quick learner, and it wasn't more than a week before he was bossing the nurses around in a throaty whisper. Most of his orders and complaints were given in English. The staff wasn't sure whether two months in the hospital listening to his second language had improved his skills or whether he had always been more fluent in English than he had let on, preferring to eavesdrop on his caretakers.
He was even making progress physically. When Coffey touched his right shoulder, Dimas could usually feel the pressure. Every once in a while he also said he felt pressure when, as a test, she pressed her fingernail into the soles of his feet. He complained periodically of "pain" in his lower back, and when Coffey alternately held a cold towel and then a hot one to his skin, he could tell which was which three times out of five. Getting him into his wheelchair was no longer the production it had been weeks earlier. He could be placed directly into something akin to full sitting position and stay there without any discomfort for more than two hours.
That was the good news. The bad news was that his wheelchair was still too big and his head control was nonexistent. Coffey had little hope that any of his physical and emotional progress could be translated into vocational ability until those problems were fixed. She tried stuffing pillows against his sides, like packing in an oversized crate, to keep his body straight. When that didn't work, she added blankets and seat cushions from the visitors' area -- anything she could find. She rolled towels and wedged them behind his neck to keep his head from flopping from side to side. Eventually, she found three foam belts, used to strap patients down when they are wheeled around on gurneys, and she strappedone each at his head, his shoulders and his legs. It was a technique she had occasionally used to align comatose patients, but this patient could look her in the eye as she bound him to his chair. It became the worst part of her day.
"We might as well gag him too," she said. "It's got to be a scary feeling, and it doesn't do any good for his orthopedic alignment, either."
She had tried to find him a better chair. The pediatric versions were too small. The specially designed versions used by the neurology department were equally unacceptable, because when the headrests on those were raised, the footrests automatically lowered, and there were days when Dimas could not tolerate having his feet down. She tried to borrow a chair from the rehabilitation center down the block, but they didn't have enough for their own patients. She talked to Cindy Walker and Hazel Mitchell, who were sympathetic but not encouraging. "We can't just buy him a custom-made wheelchair," Walker told her. "We have to face the fact that we can't afford him as it is."
Over the weeks, the saga of Dimas's chair made Coffey steadily angrier. She knew all about Hermann's finite resources, but she believed her patient's needs deserved a larger portion of those resources than he was being given. "You have this totally, totally debilitated man whose only chance to interact with the world is to get him equipment that he could have control over," she responded to Walker. "It's so annoying that this man was admitted with open arms when he was a donor, and now that we have to treat him as a man, we're hemming and hawing." Finally, she put this frustration on two pages of single-spaced paper, which she then mailed to Hazel Mitchell.
INTEROFFICE MAIL moves slowly at Hermann, and Mitchell did not receive the letter until a week after it was mailed.
"A letter, out of the blue!" she exclaimed as she passed it around to the members of the hospital's nonresource committee, which meets weekly to discuss all the patients who cannot pay their bills. "A two-page letter. This is ridiculous. It came through the interoffice mail; I just found it in my box."
"In your opinion, does he need a new chair?" asked Willene Guttenberger, who conducted the committee meetings.
"It's not uncommon for us to use towels or tie patients in," Mitchell answered. "As you can see from the letter, the word she uses is 'dehumanized.' Dehumanized. I think that's a little dramatic. If the patient really needs something, for the most part I O.K. it." Her eyes narrowed and her words slowed slightly. "There are some people here with the feeling that they've got to go to extremes in their requests. I screen those requests; Iprioritize things. They have a tendency to rattle off everything he may possibly need and I say, 'O.K., let's prioritize. What does he really need?' And if it's a safety thing or if it's a deformity thing, of course he's going to have it. We will bend over backward whether it's starting him out with it here, hooking him up with the system after he leaves. It's our legal responsibility."
"Does he need that chair?" Guttenberger asked again. "Do we have an old one that can be converted?"
"He could be tied with a towel," Mitchell said, but her tone was less angry and hinted at compromise. "People are tied all the time like that. But I see the point. He's alert and awake, and it's different tying up a comatose patient than someone who's alert. So if this will help him from an emotional standpoint, we should do it. This man is not out to lunch, and maybe it is dehumanizing, considering most of the ones we tie up are out to lunch and he's not."
"Understood," Guttenberger said. "Now, how do we keep down the cost?"
Mitchell had done some research of her own. "I don't think we need to buy it outright. We can rent it, which Mary doesn't suggest in her letter. I got a quote of $78 a month, including a 40 percent discount. Mary had only gotten us a 20 percent discount."
Cindy Walker interrupted. "If he's going to be here for years, do we want to rent forever?"
"That's another thing we should talk about," Mitchell said. "I don't think he needs to be here for the rest of his life. I think we need to start talking about transferring him to Bart's." Bart is Hermina Bartkowski, and she runs something called the Total Life Care Center on a scruffy side street near downtown Houston, which cares for ventilator-dependent patients, among others.
"What's his daily cost here?" Guttenberger asked Mitchell.
"It's down to about $890 a day."
"And what would it be there?"
"About $300."
Guttenberger winced.
"We have no other options?"
"Not that I can think of."
"Let's see what we can do to get him into Bart's."
BART'S OCCUPIES A single-story institutional-looking building, which was originally built as a county school for the handicapped. An alternative inpatient health-care facility, Bart's is a place Hermann sometimes uses to get out from under the financial strain of patients like Armando Dimas. Without Hermann patients, Bartkowski's 40-bed facility would probably not stay solvent. Without Bart, Hermann would probably be in even more desperate financial shape.
Bart's is a cheerful place in spite of its grim, utilitarian reason for being. Two finches chirp in a cage by the front door, next to the sunny plant-filled atrium and across from the colorfully furnished recreation area. The hallways are wide and bright. All the rooms are filled with plants,photographs and stuffed animals -- even the rooms of comatose patients who have no idea that the cozy touches are there.
Many who work with Bartkowski call her a saint, a particularly flattering term given the tendency of medical professionals toward understatement. As she walks from room to room in the institution she fought to create, it iseasy to see where the description came from. None of the twisted bodies or the vacant stares seem to depress her, or more accurately: she refuses even to hint at that depression when there is any chance a patient might overhear. She speaks to the unresponsive residents as if they understand every word.
The responsive patients go on trips: the circus, the zoo, shopping at the mall for Christmas gifts. When one early-summer trip to the Astrodome was a disappointment because the home team lost, a late-summer repeat trip was scheduled and that time the Astros won. Had they lost on the second visit, she would have taken everyone back once more. "I didn't think it was fair that they would lose when my patients were there," she says. "The time they finally won, everybody came back with a huge grin on their face. There's so little I can give them."
That Bart's stays open has become increasingly important to Hermann. Of the two dozen patients in her care at any given time, about one-fourth are being paid for by the hospital, which saves more than $100,000 each month by placing patients in her care. Bartkowski is able to provide high-quality care at a low cost because she hires people that other facilities will not. In addition to her 20 licensed nurses, she employs between 30 and 35 nurses's aides, depending on the number of patients. Many of those she hires are recent Polish immigrants and many are doctors or nurses who are waiting for certification to practice in the United States. Bartkowski hires them as technicians and nurse's aides, allowing her to provide a quality of care not usually available at such a low cost.
Armando Dimas arrived at Bart's on Nov. 1, 1988. He did not bring his specially ordered wheelchair, which despite Coffey's careful planning never properly fit. His room at Bart's was decorated with bright animal posters and pictures of his family. His parents came to visit every weekend, bringing his 5-year-old son, Armando Jr., who had moved in with them after his father was shot.
Dimas found a kind of peace at Bart's. Every so often, someone would ask him if he wanted to be made D.N.R., and he would always say no.
"I see my family," he told a visitor who noted that a lot of people would not want to live as he was. "My sister brings me food. It's nice here." Unable to point, he wrinkled his sunburned nose, a result of the morning he had spent sitting in the courtyard of Bart's. "See, I go outside a lot," he said. "In a lot of ways, things are good."
He paused, trying to explain the gritty life he led before and how the shooting and its aftermath had changed everything. "If I hadn't been shot," he said. "I would have died."
Last fall, however, just a few weeks after that conversation, Dimas found himself angrily asking to die. The cost of his care had increased steadily during his years at Bart's, to $12,000 each month, and in September 1992 the financial office at Hermann -- though the hospital was in much better shape than it had been five years before -- decided it simply could not pay his bills for the rest of his life. His hospital bills were now approaching three-quarters of a million dollars. (His finaltotal was $727,008.71.) But money was not the only reason for its decision, the hospital said. It was better for a patient to be with his family, and it was time to send Armando Dimas home.
"Where can I go?" Dimas asked forlornly, when his mother told him the news. "Why don't they just wheel me out to the sidewalk and let me die?"
Hermann gave Bart's one month to train the family to care for Dimas, and all his brothers, sisters, their spouses and children tooklessons in how to lift, feed, wash, change, position and suction him. During years of visits to Bart's, the machines had become less intimidating and his routines had become more familiar, but his parents still feared they could not handle the job alone. They moved 20 miles from Madisonville to Huntsville, where most of their children had settled and where there were more available hands. The stress took its toll on Victoria Dimas, who was hospitalized twice in the days before her son's return because she was having trouble breathing.
On Halloween morning 1992, an ambulance drove Armando Dimas home. He was frightened during the first few nights, certain that the electricity would fail and he would suffocate, since the family cannot afford an emergency generator. Only a battery pack or a hand pump would keep his ventilator working until power was restored.
But a call to the utility company brought assurances that he would not be left to die during a blackout. He feels safer now, secure in the fact that a member of his family is at his side every moment. His mother takes the day shift, two of his brothers alternate on the night shift and everyone else helps when they can.
He is happy at home, he said. It's good to have his son nearby, and he is resigned to the fact that Hermann's promise to care for him had an expiration date.
"I was angry, but I'm less angry," he said two weeks after he moved back home. "Things changed. This is the way it is. That's all."Magazine Desk

HEADLINE: DANCE;
Ballet's Young Rebels With A Cause

BYLINE: By JENNIFER DUNNING

 BODY:
Ballet dancers' brains are in their feet, the saying goes. Everyone knows that dancers -- or "boys" and "girls," as they are called inside the theater and out -- will do anything to dance, from living lives of strict submission to just about everyone they face in the rehearsal studio or classroom to enduring long hours for less pay than the stagehands, designers and musicians who help get their show on the stage. But times have changed. Today's ballet dancers see themselves as valuable professionals with lives of their own.
No longer exotics who trail swan feathers wherever they go, dancers are standing up to management, demanding better wages, benefits and working conditions. They are asking hard questions of the union that represents them. And, while still as committed as ever to their careers in dance, they are going to college, marrying, raising children and buying cars and houses, just like the folks next door. 
 The boys and girls are growing up.
One sign of the change was the appointment in October of Kevin McKenzie as artistic director of American Ballet Theater. Dancers have served as ballet company directors before, most notably Mikhail Baryshnikov, who led Ballet Theater from 1980 to 1989. But for the most part they have been superstars or artists intent on creating a company of their own. Mr. McKenzie is from within the ranks, an American-born dancer better known as an elegant 19th-century prince than as a corporate policy maker.
Another sign of a new maturity and toughness on the part of dancers is the class-action suit brought a year ago against the American Guild of Musical Artists, which represents ballet and modern dancers in larger companies, as well as Broadway dancers, singers and stage managers. The suit has been filed by nine current and former principal dancers from Ballet Theater, the New York City Ballet, Dance Theater of Harlem and the Joffrey Ballet. It seeks $20 million in damages and a change in the union pension plan that would enable dancers to obtain benefits when they retire from dancing, almost always long before the plan's minimum retirement age of 65. The suit is pending in United States District Court.
In mid 1989, when management began talks with City Ballet dancers on their current contract, it dealt with young dancer-negotiators who were polite but firm about their needs. One of the negotiators characterizes the contract, which runs through July, as representing wage and health-benefit gains "unprecedented" for the City Ballet.
When Ballet Theater faced a severe financial crisis last summer, its dancers decided to join the effort to save the company. On March 25, the company's two floors of studios will be turned into a giant party ground for a benefit planned and produced by the dancers and other company personnel, with the participation of dancers ranging from the youngest corps member to the greatest stars of the past. "Things had come to a head," recalls Raymond Serrano, a former dancer who is now company masseur. " 'Let's get on it,' we said."
And when Ballet Theater began its search for a new director last year, the dancers were asked by the board of directors for recommendations. Mr. McKenzie, who had performed with the company for 12 years, through 1991, was one of the dancers' top choices.
Mr. McKenzie had also organized a benefit, during the second of the two labor disputes that resulted in lockouts at Ballet Theater, in 1979 and 1982. The disputes -- watersheds in the dancers' slow progress toward greater independence -- gave them a heady and unaccustomed taste of self-reliance. The first of the disputes was particularly public and bitter, but groundbreaking gains in wages and working conditions were won. Those who led the battle still talk of it with pride.
"I think dancers grew up a lot during those lockouts," Mr. McKenzie says. But the process, suggests the 38-year-old director, was one that was waiting to begin. "Dancers are men and women portraying men and women. They have a big responsibility to be a performer. No one's going to do it for you. You have to get up and dance yourself. You learn that quickly."
The way had been prepared well before the lockouts. When Rudolf Nureyev defected from the Soviet Union in 1961, he brought new ideas about classical ballet to the West. Ballet, as his exciting pyrotechnics proved, was accessible entertainment. Ballet was also not necessarily a woman's art, and the fact that men have an easier time going into the field today may well have helped legitimize it as a profession. There was another message: dancers need not be puppets. And, as Mr. McKenzie says, the later example of Mr. Baryshnikov demonstrated that dancers could also manage their own careers.
It was, however, no superstar who led the Ballet Theater dancers into the fray in 1979. Frank Smith, now a dance faculty member at the prestigious North Carolina School of the Arts, was then a nine-year member of the Ballet Theater corps. When contract negotiations began in 1979, Mr. Smith sensed that once again the dancers were being shortchanged -- and in the midst of the so-called dance boom that was bringing new audiences and new money to ballet.
The dancers had little job security. They were expected to subsidize the company in many ways, Mr. Smith says, from living below the poverty line to giving up days off without reimbursement. The dancers' negotiating committee, of which Mr. Smith was a member, decided to consult Leonard Leibowitz, a labor lawyer recommended by a Ballet Theater orchestra member. Mr. Leibowitz was astounded by what he heard as he talked with the dancers. "You could have gotten them to dance for you if they paid you a few bucks to do it," he says.
Pay for first-year corps dancers today is $650 a week for a guaranteed 38 weeks of work annually, with the highest contractual salary $1,250 per performance week for soloists. In 1979, beginning pay was $300 for 40 weeks. (Basic salary for company musicians is $982; in 1979, it was $392.)
"You needed four or five dancers just to rent an apartment," Mr. Leibowitz says. "I think it's gotten a little bit better, though in terms of inflation I'm not sure the scale is all that different in purchasing power."
DANCERS HAVE BECOME MORE aware of their rights at a time when ballet companies are not as able to meet the performers' challenge. "You don't undo all those years of substandard compensation that quickly," Mr. Leibowitz says. "But now it's so difficult to make the kinds of gains the dancers made in the 1980's. Dancers are terrified when they're told they may screw up a season. But I think there's a more realistic fear for the very existence of a company."
Fear was a familiar emotion among the Ballet Theater dancers as they held out for a better contract in 1979, though the public support of principal dancers like Cynthia Gregory and Gelsey Kirkland and the guest artists Natalia Makarova and Anthony Dowell raised the dancers' faltering courage. "It was an uneasy feeling when we realized that we would not go to work the next day, and all because we wanted to see things change," Mr. Smith recalls.
In some ways, the second lockout was even harder. The dancers were more sophisticated, but management was prepared.
Some of the dancers' concerns during the two series of negotiations struck outsiders as frivolous. Yet they were important examples of the kinds of thinking that Mr. Smith and his colleagues wanted to change. Why should dancers not be willing, for instance, to double up in hotel rooms on tour? "We weren't high school kids going as a marching band to the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade," Mr. Smith says.
And why would dancers take seriously the matter of being addressed as boys and girls, still the custom in many ballet troupes? The answers to that question provide a look into a rare and curious mentality -- and a preparation for life that calls to mind the force-feeding of geese for foie gras. Ballet training, with all its competitive drive for technical excellence, is demanding to the exclusion of much of what passes for a normal life, and it starts at a very early age. Single-mindedness is a prerequisite for a career in ballet.
One of the earliest and keenest observers of dancers and their lives is Lincoln Kirstein, who with George Balanchine founded the New York City Ballet and, in 1934, its forerunner, the American Ballet. Mr. Kirstein tried for a time to expose the students at the City Ballet-affiliated School of American Ballet to other art forms. The students refused. "When I tried to take Balanchine to the Metropolitan Museum, he said he'd been to a museum," Mr. Kirstein says today. "The well-rounded dancer doesn't exist. I don't think they worry much about the state of architecture or fiction."
But that intense focus can lead to what Mr. Leibowitz sees as "almost a life style of servitude. Educational opportunities are severely limited. What that also produces is an adherence to authority."
Cynthia Harvey, a leading ballerina at Ballet Theater and one of the plaintiffs in the pension suit, suggests that that attitude is comparable to the psychology of abused children. "We keep coming back to the same situations, the same relationships," she says. Mr. Serrano recalls that his drive to dance led him to travel on his own at age 14 from Puerto Rico to New York, where he lived in a church on the Lower East Side. "I sacrificed and sacrificed and sacrificed," Mr. Serrano says. "It gets to be part of the routine."
Such masochism dovetails neatly into the notion, prevalent even today, that dancers are eminently expendable. "We have such a strange idea of dancers as physical instruments that are used for a while and then are finished," says David Moore, a former member of Ballet Theater and City Ballet and the founder of the new Ballet Company of Spokane, Wash. This perception of ballet dancers was strengthened as demands for technical expertise began to soar during the 1970's, forcing dancers' lives and training to become even more narrowly focused.
The situation is different for modern dancers. They have traditionally started their training later and gone about it less intensely, though the gap has narrowed. "Ballet dancers' opinions are not very often sought," Mr. Smith says. "I think in the modern field a great deal of creating is expected to come from the dancer. Maturity is a greater aspect of the training."
Indeed, Mr. Smith can remember that in his days at Ballet Theater, which he left in 1983, every dancer had an end-of-the-year conversation with Lucia Chase, a founder and the director of Ballet Theater for 40 years. There were sometimes unpleasant surprises like suddenly terminated contracts. "But you felt you had your turn to talk," Mr. Smith says.
As dance became more popular and as company founders and motivating geniuses died, ballet and modern dance became more of a corporate enterprise in the 1970's. Both Mr. Smith and Mr. Kirstein make the point that ballet companies are not and cannot be democratically run institutions.
"I was one of the first people who pushed the union business," says Mr. Kirstein, who also spoke out early about career retraining. "I thought a company could be run like a democracy -- a lovely thing, but of course perfectly impossible. Finally, the dancers themselves said it couldn't go on that way." For Balanchine, he adds, "there were no two opinions -- he saved a lot of time."
BALANCHINE ALSO HAD AN aversion to his ballerinas marrying. "I hate to say it, but there was a different way of thinking when Balanchine was around," says Judith Fugate, a principal at City Ballet and a plaintiff in the pension suit. "There's a more lenient atmosphere now."
Ms. Fugate is married to Medhi Bahri, a guest soloist. "I've found my dancing has only improved," she says. "It makes such a difference to walk out of the theater and have something more to go home to than an empty apartment and Chinese dinner. And if you're happy, you take it into your performance."
Marriage, says Cynthia Gregory, intensifies a dancer's quest for security. "Practically all the principals and soloists and some corps dancers are married now," Ms. Gregory says. "You can have a family and career. And I suppose that's one more reason why dancers have become more interested in their finances and in the security of their professional lives." Ms. Gregory is one of the plaintiffs in the suit, which was instituted for the dancers by Hilary B. Miller, her lawyer-husband. The group also includes Fernando Bujones, Martine van Hamel, Donald Williams and Carole Valleskey.
Some dancers disagree with the premise of the suit. Sanford Wolff, national executive secretary of the American Guild of Musical Artists, points out that most guild contracts do provide for severance pay and that the union supports a dancers' career-transition program. But when Ms. Gregory began to canvass other dancers, the response was unanimous. "I've had dancers at A.B.T. and City Ballet come up to me and say, 'If you need signatures, let us know.' Dancers have to love dance. But they also have to live. "
Lockout participants -- among them Mr. Serrano and his wife, Christine Spizzo, a former Ballet Theater dancer who now teaches dance and performs on Broadway -- routinely pass along information on managing finances. Mr. Serrano has a table in his home massage office with pamphlets on everything from buying a house as an investment to opening a retirement account. "In our day, we couldn't afford things like that," he says. "We couldn't even think about investment."
Until recently, ballet dancers also tended not to think about going to college during their performing lives. But 26 dancers from City Ballet and one each from Ballet Theater and Dance Theater of Harlem are enrolled in a special matriculation program at Fordham University that allows them to take one course a semester. The dancers are teachers' pets, too, according to Roger McIntyre, director of adult admissions. "They're so wonderfully disciplined," he says.
Jenifer Ringer, one of City Ballet's most promising younger dancers, is a Fordham student. "I always enjoyed school and I wanted to be able to keep on learning," she says. "And I'd like to pretend to be a normal student and meet some normal people. My focus is on ballet. But if I have a hard day, I can always go think about cells dividing."
Michael Byars, a soloist at City Ballet, studies at Fordham and is also enrolled in the Labor Studies Program at Empire State College -- as well as choreographing, composing, teaching ballet classes to the company and, at the school, writing a column for N.Y. Casting, a new audition newspaper, and working as a volunteer with seriously ill children at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital.
"But the dancer part is always first," Mr. Byars says. Everything else, he adds, is part of a hyphenated phrase that always begins with "dancer."
Not everyone agrees that there has been a change in the way dancers think about themselves and their careers. "Dancers' whole existence is in their bodies," Mr. Kirstein says. "You can't expect analytical intelligence on top of a skillful body. They accept discipline because they know it works. They are very narrow and very deep. Their competition is not about prestige. It's about skill."
Will dancers' growing independence dilute their concentration and diminish artistry? Choreographers who remember the pre-union days tend to grumble about clock-watching. "An artist simply cannot count time," says Agnes de Mille. "That is the one thing he has to give, and he gives it."
But Carl Corry, a principal dancer with the Joffrey, believes that independence enhances performing. "The union for ballet dancers is not very strong," Mr. Corry says, "but at first it added another voice so that dancers could concentrate on their work. It freed them from the expenditure of emotional energy needed to fight for some basic stuff."
Donald Williams, a principal with Dance Theater of Harlem, sees even more commitment in today's dancers. "If we are thought of as adults, we can demand respect," he says. "If we demand respect, we have to put forward a product that is worthy of respect. What is important is the choice -- dancers' making the decisions themselves."

HEADLINE: TELEVISION VIEW;
Stop the Spaceship, I Want to Get Off

BYLINE: By Gerald Jonas; Gerald Jonas writes the Science Fiction column for The New York Times Book Review.

 BODY:
THE LEAST WE CAN EXPECT OF science fiction, which focuses so assiduously on the future, is that it be up to date. According to this criterion, the science-fiction series that have proliferated on television this season -- "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine," "Space Rangers" and "Time Trax" -- fall short. Instead of representing an evolutionary step forward from the "Star Trek" era, which began 26 years ago with the first voyage of the starship Enterprise and is still going strong with "Star Trek: The Next Generation," the new shows prompt a sense of deja vu. Inside their futuristic packaging they offer familiar premises and plots mostly borrowed from past television shows and movies.
For all its public resolve to be grittier and sexier than its forebears, "Deep Space Nine," launched this month with a two-hour special (its regular time slot is 7 P.M. Sundays on Channel 11 in New York), comes across as no more than a "Star Trek" spinoff, set in a seedy 24th-century space station instead of a spotless starship. "Space Rangers," which began on CBS this month and is seen at 8 P.M. Wednesdays, offers 22d-century space cops in a higher-tech, lower-brow "Mission: Impossible" laced with secondhand "Aliens." "Babylon 5," a syndicated movie to be broadcast in late February, features yet another space station filled with touchy humans and nonhumans with funny faces and hairdos. "Time Trax, " a syndicated hourlong series (8 P.M. Wednesdays on Channel 9), apes a different model: by setting 22d-century villains loose in 1993 to be chased by a 22d-century policeman, it promises to be an interminable "Terminator." 
 You might think television would bring out the best in science fiction, whose essence is neither dialogue nor psychological insight but the pictures it awakens in the imagination. Of course, all good fiction asks the reader's cooperation in imagining a credible reality, a detailed, coherent world -- Proust's Paris, Joyce's Dublin, Faulkner's Mississippi -- in which characters can plausibly act and interact. But science fiction asks even more because the elaborate worlds it seeks to construct in the mind -- ecosystems, technologies, social structures -- are themselves imaginary.
In good science fiction, as in all good writing, it's important to get the details right. Science-fiction writers consult texts and experts in astrophysics, meteorology, plate tectonics, evolution, ecology and more to find scientifically defensible justifications for the worlds they want to write about: worlds with gravity a million times stronger than the earth's, worlds where space or time travel are commonplace. Some writers become so involved in these details that they have no energy left to worry about characters or plot, so they fill their ingenious intellectual constructs with stick figures. The best science fiction, however, creates new worlds that cast light on the people who live there -- people whose problems arouse sympathy despite their distance from us in time and space and biology.
In the hands of writers like Aldous Huxley, George Orwell, Arthur C. Clarke and Ursula Le Guin, and movie makers like Stanley Kubrick, science fiction can be a powerful stimulus to fresh thinking. It can restore to jaded sensibilities a sense of wonder about the unlimited potential of life in an infinitely large and various universe. Meanwhile, television continues to stumble over the essential first step: creating a background world. The problem is partly lack of money, partly lack of imagination.
To set a story in a plausible 23d-century New York or Paris or Dublin would require the construction of futuristic dwellings, streets, transportation, offices, theaters. With current technology and budgets, this is impossible for a weekly series. "Time Trax," which needs no special sets for present-day scenes, bypasses the problem but runs the risk of looking like every other cops-and-robbers shoot-'em-up. The solution most producers have chosen is to stage the bulk of the action on a permanent indoor set, with telescreens and transporter beams and holodecks to allow limited access to the outside world. Fortuitously, science fiction provides the ideal set: the controlled environment inside a spaceship or space station.
"Star Trek" was hardly the first series to discover this economical solution. In the early 50's, when television was live and special effects were minimal, "Captain Video" and "Tom Corbett, Space Cadet" sailed the space lanes, ridding the galaxy of assorted evildoers. Watching these shows placed a special strain on the audience, whose job was not so much to imagine a detailed world of the future as to ignore the obvious gaps in the world on screen. I remember one space captain trying to dodge a collision with the sun by giving a couple of hard turns to a steering wheel that might have been lifted from my father's Oldsmobile 88.
As the original "Star Trek" demonstrated, viewers will forgive almost any inadequacies of style if the characters, however wooden, are amusing enough and if the stories are stimulating. The pilot episode of "Deep Space Nine" had a thought-provoking scene in which Comdr. Benjamin Sisko (played by Avery Brooks, formerly the street-smart Hawk on "Spenser: For Hire") used baseball to explain to a species that lives in an eternal moment what it is like to experience time in a linear manner. At the least, with so many species rubbing noses in cramped quarters, the spaceship/space-station setting can be used to preach against ethnic prejudice, a staple of the original "Star Trek."
But the producers of the new shows have limited their horizons by repeating the "Star Trek" formula so slavishly. By adopting a military model, in which the main characters are bound to one another hierarchically, these shows lose the chance to explore other kinds of social organization. Even on the gentler programs, like "Star Trek: The Next Generation," the temptation to resolve conflict through force is always at hand.
The "Star Trek" universe is more than 300 years in the future, more than enough time for provocative social experiments to have emerged. What about a series set in a society that rotates leadership by gender? Or by lottery? Economies where transactions are measured in units of pleasure and pain instead of money? Such speculations, which animate much of the best science fiction, would not be out of place on television. What might the special-effects wizards be able to create in the way of universities, houses of worship, prisons, parliaments of tomorrow?
Rumor has it that breakthroughs in computer graphics will soon make it possible to match any kind of background illusion with live actors, so characters will be able to stroll through a city of the future as easily as they now dissolve into subatomic particles to be beamed through space. When those illusions become television reality, the only barrier to the creation of good science fiction on the small screen will be the imagination of the creators.

HEADLINE: Prague's Jewish Heritage

BYLINE: By RUTH ELLEN GRUBER; RUTH ELLEN GRUBER'S book, "Jewish Heritage Travel: A Guide to Central and Eastern Europe," was published last February by John Wiley & Sons.

 BODY:
THE rooftop of Prague's Jewish Town Hall is dominated by a large clock; on its face are Hebrew letters instead of numbers, and hands that run backward. The building itself, which has a bright pink, stylized Baroque facade and a cupola-topped tower, dates to the 16th century, but is still the center of community life for the 2,000 or so Jews who live in Prague today -- with a kosher restaurant on its ground floor, offices and function rooms upstairs and bulletin boards fluttering with notices of events.
Other historic buildings nearby, including several ancient synagogues, were incorporated into the Jewish Museum, originally founded in 1906, after the Holocaust. The buildings are exhibitions in themselves, but also house the museum's extraordinary collection of precious textiles, gold and silver ritual objects, manuscripts and artwork that bear breathtaking yet painful witness to the splendor of the Jewish past. The museum owes its unparalleled collection -- parts of which toured the United States in the 1980's as the "Precious Legacy" exhibition -- to a cruel twist of history. The bulk of the exhibits are treasures and artifacts looted by the Nazis from 153 destroyed Czech Jewish communities and brought to Prague for what they planned as a "museum of an extinct race." The city was home to more than 35,000 Jews at the outbreak of the war; most of them perished. 
 Under the Communist regime, the monuments in the old Jewish quarter were maintained by the state and became popular tourist attractions. Today, they attract more than a million visitors a year.
For centuries one of the most important Jewish centers of all Europe, Prague contains relics documenting almost the entire tumultuous sweep of Jewish history in central Europe -- from the first Jewish settlement in Prague, about 1,000 years ago, and the rise of the city as a renowned center of Jewish scholarship and culture at the end of the 16th century and beginning of the 17th.
ALTHOUGH Empress Maria Theresa briefly expelled Jews from Prague in the 1740's, conditions improved so much during the reign of her successor, Joseph II, that Jewish Town was renamed Josefov. In 1867 Jews won full equality and soon such Jewish writers as Franz Kafka, Max Brod and Franz Werfel became prominent in Prague's intellectual life.
Prague's major sights of Jewish interest are concentrated in the old Jewish Town, on the low-lying right bank of the Vltava River, near the Old Town Square off Parizska Street. The quaint neighborhood is high on historic atmosphere but looks very little as it did to the generations of Jews who lived here over the last 800 years. Sweeping urban renewal at the turn of the 20th century demolished the one-time dank warren of narrow alleys, passages and courtyards and replaced them with the planned streets and opulent if now somewhat dilapidated buildings, lavishly ornamented with sculptural reliefs and ironwork. But a handful of landmarks, like the Old Town Hall,, still evoke the historical character of the old ghetto.
The museum has no one main hall, but all the buildings housing individual exhibitions, as well as the Old Cemetery and the museum offices, are near the Old Town Hall, within a few steps of each other. Tickets may be purchased at the entrances of the various exhibitions.
I recommend starting with the Old Jewish Cemetery. I doubt if any Jewish relic anywhere outside Israel has captured the imagination the way this cemetery, founded at the beginning of the 15th century and in use until 1787, has. Here, some 12,000 gravestones are crowded together, tipped over, tilted, eroded and sunken into the earth in an evocative testament of the past. Over the centuries lack of space forced graves to be placed on top of each other, layer upon layer -- as many as 12 hummocky layers in all. Many of the jumbled tombstones feature exquisitely lettered Hebrew epitaphs or carved decorative motifs referring to names and professions or replete with Jewish symbolism: a tailor's scissors, for example, or hands raised in priestly blessing.
MANY famous personalities are buried here, including the mathematician, historian and astronomer David Gans (1541 to 1613), the Jewish Town Mayor Mordechai Maisel (1528 to 1601) and Rabbi Jehudah Ben Bezalel Loew (circa 1525 to 1609), celebrated in legends as the creator of the golem -- a soulless man of clay brought to life with a magic incantation. Visitors by the hundreds place pebbles on their tombs in remembrance or leave messages written on slips of paper asking intercession to bring good luck or blessing. Every possible surface of Rabbi Loew's massive tomb, which is built like a miniature house whose oversize endpieces have carved pillars, ledges and other decoration, is covered by pebbles and paper. The oldest identified gravestone, dating from 1439, is that of Chief Rabbi Avigdor Kara, who survived a bloody pogrom in 1398 and whose dramatic elegy on the tragedy is still recited in Prague on Yom Kippur: "Heavy fell our Lord's scorn on Golden Prague, the city of beauty we mourn."
Just next to the Old Cemetery is the pseudo-Romanesque mortuary, built in the early 20th century, housing the Jewish Museum's Holocaust exhibitions. Particularly poignant is the collection of crayon drawings -- of butterflies and flowers -- by children who were held in the wartime ghetto at Terezin, most of whom perished.
Also near the cemetery entrance is the 17th-century Klausel Synagogue, which until recently contained the museum's precious collection of Hebrew prints and manuscripts. It was reopened this summer as the site of special temporary exhibits after extensive renovation.
At the edge of the cemetery a block away, on Siroka Street, is the peak-roofed, bright orange-yellow Pinkas Synagogue, originally constructed in the early 15th century as the private prayer house of a wealthy family and even today set in a small courtyard and complex of buildings including dank subterranean rooms housing an ancient well and mikvah, or ritual bath. The synagogue's soaring Gothic arches and vaulted ceiling are highlighted with decorative frescoes and frame tall windows through which you can glimpse the eerie shapes of tombstones. After World War II, the synagogue was turned into a memorial to the 77,297 Czechoslovak Jews who were slain in the Holocaust: Their names were inscribed on the sanctuary walls. Unfortunately, they were removed during a lengthy restoration project, but they are being re-inscribed.
A block away, next to the Jewish Town Hall, is the Old-New Synagogue, which is said to be the oldest synagogue in use in Europe. (Two synagogues are currently in use in Prague. The other is the highly ornate, Moorish style 19th-century Jubilee synagogue on Jeruzalemska Street near the main train station.) Built around 1270, the Old-New Synagogue got its strange name after a still "newer" synagogue was erected. A tiny, Gothic structure, its floor is below street level and its steeply peaked roof is decorated with distinctive brick gables added in the 15th century. Inside the whispery, dimly lighted interior, twin naves are surmounted by Gothic vaulting. Seats run around the outer edge of the small sanctuary, all facing the bimah, where the cantor and those officiating are generally to be found during a service. Defining the bimah are central support pillars and encased by a decorative ironwork grille. This synagogue was already old (and apparently mysterious) in Rabbi Loew's day. Legend has it that the golem still sleeps, hidden by the rabbi, in the synagogue's attic.
Across Cervena Alley, the buttressed, 16th-century High Synagogue contains the exhibit of Jewish textiles -- everything from gold and silver stitched Torah mantles and colorful, richly embroidered curtains to prayer shawls and items of clothing, including a marvelous cape worn by the 16th-century visionary Schlomo Molcho. Around the corner on Maisel Street, the museum's collection of silver ritual objects is found in the newly refurbished sanctuary of Maisel Synagogue, originally built by Mordechai Maisel as a private prayer house in the 1590's. Here are displayed finely wrought Torah shields and decorations, pitchers and ritual wash basins, spice boxes, candlesticks, seven-branched menorahs and the like. The ornate, Moorish-style Spanish Synagogue, slightly farther afield across Parizska Street, is also part of the museum, but has long been closed.
A new museum opened in the Jewish Town district last year, an exhibit commemorating Franz Kafka, who lived most of his brief life in Prague. The museum is set up at 5 U Randice Street, where Kafka was born on in 1883. Under the Communists, Kafka's dark, psychological tales were virtually banned, but since the political changes two years ago he has been embraced as a local hero. The little museum illustrates Kafka's life, providing interesting insights into the sophisticated Jewish life in Prague in the early 20th century. On a nearby corner is a bust of the author.
THERE are numerous Jewish sights outside the old Jewish Town district, including former synagogues and historic cemeteries. Among the most interesting is the cemetery on Fibichova Street in eastern Prague's Zizkov district, which was opened in 1680 and was the main Jewish burial ground in Prague for a century following the closure of the Old Cemetery in 1787. It has many fine tombstones.
The vast New Jewish Cemetery on Nad Vodovodem Street in eastern Prague was laid out in 1890 to accommodate 100,000 graves and is still used by the local Jewish community. A seemingly endless silent expanse of elaborate tombstones shrouded in ivy and obscured by shrubs, saplings and undergrowth, it is a poignant sight: a powerful contrast to the Old Cemetery and a memorial to the Holocaust.
Signs at the gate point the way to the simple white stone marking the tomb of Kafka and his parents; nearby is a plaque commemorating the writer Max Brod. All around are tombstones bearing witness to the wealth and importance of the pre-war Jewish community: Many are sculpturally elaborate family tombs in styles ranging from neo-Gothic to Art Nouveau. Already, though, most are overgrown; many are tipped over or cracked. No descendants have been left to tend the graves. This vast, silent forest of lonely stones is a far cry from the well-maintained monuments of Jewish Town. But the story it tells is just as dramatic, just as important to witness.
 
 
 
VISITOR'S GUIDE TO THE CAPITAL
Getting There
 International airlines fly to Prague, and there is also regular train service from Vienna, Berlin and elsewhere. Americans do not need visas for the Czech Republic.
 
Accommodations
 It can be very difficult to find a hotel room in Prague, even in the off season, so book well in advance. Be prepared to pay first-class rates in a first-class hotel. The country dialing code is 42, the city code for Prague is 2.
The modern, American-style Inter-Continental Hotel (43-45 Curieovych, Prague 1; telephone 231-1812; room for two $275) is a few minutes' walk from the Old Jewish Cemetery and other sights in old Jewish Town.
Elsewhere, the Forum (4 Nusle Kongresova; 410-364; room for two $214) is modern and has good restaurants; the Palace (12 Panska Prague 1; 235-9394; room for two $305) is a famous old world hotel near Wenceslas Square. Budget-conscious visitors should look into the numerous new agencies renting out rooms and flats. One such agency is the Accommodation Service (Hastalske, Prague 1; 231-0202).
 
 
Dining
 Beside the kosher restaurant in the Jewish Town Hall, 18 Maiselova Street, which serves set price meals for $10 and up, there are several inexpensive places to eat in the immediate neighborhood. U Golema (8 Maiselova; 261-898) is an atmospheric tavern. U Stare Sinagogy, on Parizska Street next door to the Old-New Synagogue, is a simple but lively place.
It can be very difficult to get reservations at Prague's top restaurants. New, private restaurants, geared to foreigners and averaging $20 to $25 a person, are springing up as a free market economy takes hold. First-time visitors to Prague should try Obecni Dum (1090 Republiky; 231-1268) for the splendid Art Nouveau decoration, if not the cheap but unimaginative food.
 
Sites of Interest

HEADLINE: DOWN AND OUT

 BODY:
Kevin Phillips's article "Down and Out" (Jan. 10) is timely. The euphoria evident during this past Christmas shopping season bears out the hope the middle class has for the success of the campaign promises. But, of course, politics is one thing; government is another. Many things have happened since the campaign (Somalia, Bosnia, Iraq, etc.) to derail, or curtail, the amount of time and money President Clinton will be able to spend on his domestic programs.
Although I'm in the lowest of income-tax groups, I pay well over 35 percent of my income in Federal, State, City and FICA taxes (I'm self-employed), and I don't really expect this to go down, no matter what has been promised. Nor do I expect my income to return to what it was in the mid-1970's, when I could afford vacations and the theater. I've been doing without these for a long time. But if my standard of living were to go down further, I'd have to resort to food stamps. The jobs lost in my field (publishing) are not coming back, or, at least, not in the quantity or at the salaries they were 15 years ago. 
 The promises of politicians are evanescent. Too many unexpected problems crop up. We're in for the very long haul.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL PROPERTY: The Gulf ands Western Building;
Twisting in the Wind On Columbus Circle

BYLINE: By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN

 BODY:
FOR almost a quarter century, a 44-story black-and-silver-striped skyscraper known almost from the moment of its conception as the Gulf and Western Building has stood ungainly guard over Columbus Circle. Sneered at by architecture critics, the building from early in its life has been called structurally problematic and inappropriate for its site.
Now it sits mired in 15-month-long bankruptcy proceedings amid allegations of "nightmarish conditions" created by structural defects that cause the building to twist slowly in the wind and hazardously misaligned facade panels that an engineer hired by the owner says have the potential to blow off in a windstorm and endanger pedestrians below. 
 The bankruptcy itself is almost certain to bring about a change of ownership that real-estate specialists say could eventually lead to the rectangular-slab building's being stripped to its steel framework, or even demolished, perhaps to make way for a luxury hotel, a residential building or a combination of both directly across from Central Park.
The story of the building, completed in 1970 as the culmination of a decade-long renewal of the Columbus Circle area and as part of an attempt by New York to keep major businesses from leaving the city, is a saga of what can go wrong in the world of commercial real estate. The questions surrounding the building will also have an effect on Columbus Circle, which has been the focus of controversy over plans to replace the New York Coliseum building with an office tower called Columbus Center.
"The problem," said Albert Cleary, a director of Cushman and Wakefield, a major international real-estate concern, "is the building, not the site. If it were a different building, with that very attractive location and those views, any vacancy would be filled in a second -- or Paramount would be renewing."
Paramount Communications, the entertainment and publishing giant that used to be called Gulf and Western and whose companies include Paramount Pictures and Simon and Schuster, is the building's prime tenant. Its lease expires in April 1995. According to court papers, Paramount has indicated it does not plan to renew and has already begun to look elsewhere.
Jerry Sherman, a Paramount spokesman, said the company had retained Goldman, Sachs and the Georgetown Group and was "currently exploring the midtown area and studying our options as to space requirements."
Mr. Cleary said Paramount was also looking outside New York City.
The departure of Paramount Communications would leave about 85 percent of the building empty in a city where there is already a glut of unused commercial space -- a situation that should enable the company to strike a good deal elsewhere. The new owner of the Columbus Circle building, most likely its principal creditor, General Electric Pension Trust, would have difficulty attracting other concerns to a troubled building when there is so much other office space from which to choose.
The expected presence of asbestos, a problem in many 1960's buildings, and the high cost of repairing the building's major defects also add to the likelihood that the building might have to be rehabilitated or replaced, and increase the difficulty of finding someone willing to buy it.
General Electric Pension Trust is part of GE Investment, the investment arm of General Electric. A spokesman for the parent company, Jack Batty, would say only that "we are talking to the tenants about possible future courses of action and we intend to work with them; I can't say anything more about the future of the building."
The current owner, 15 Columbus Circle Associates, part of Winthrop Financial Associates, a large Boston-based real-estate company, said through a spokesman, Philip J. Brannigan Jr., that it would not comment on any issues involving the building while the bankruptcy proceedings were continuing.
The building's cloudy future adds even more uncertainty to the prospects for the Columbus Circle area in the difficult real estate market. Directly across Broadway sits the old New York Coliseum, the proposed site for a 2.1 million square-foot, multitowered office, apartment and retail complex called Columbus Center, to be built by Mortimer B. Zuckerman through the Boston Properties development concern.
BUT even though the last legal obstacle to the deal was removed last June and a closing on the $338.6-million purchase of the site could have taken place in December, no date has been set, with Boston Properties saying only that it is committed to the deal "as soon as it is economically feasible."
The arrival of economic feasibility, however, is not on the short-term horizon. Cushman & Wakefield reports that the vacancy rate for Class A office buildings in midtown Manhattan in the fourth quarter of 1992 was 16.3 percent, compared with 9.7 percent in 1986. "We're still operating in a negative demand area," Mr. Cleary said.
As for the old Gulf and Western Building, he added: "Everybody's been trying to sell it, but as far as I know there have been no takers."
"The speculation is that considering the site, a hotel would be the best use, with a residential building next best," he said. "But the biggest problem with the building has always been structural issues, and I don't know whether you can keep the building and upgrade it. The way the floors are designed you could probably turn it into a hotel, but structurally I don't know if the building makes sense. There have always been a lot of problems with the wind. Some people think you'd have to tear the building down."
James D. Kuhn, president and chief operating officer of Newmark and Company, a large New York real-estate concern, agreed that a hotel would be a natural for the site, as would a mixed-use building, part hotel and part residential, with condominiums on the upper floors. But he said that despite the structural problems, which had existed "from day one," and although "anything's possible," he did not think it likely that the building would be torn down.
"I'm not sure with today's zoning rules that you could build as much footage as you could in the past," he said.
What seems more achievable, he said, is "a gut rehabilitation, stripping the building down to the steel, reinforcing it and putting up a new curtain wall," with GE "most probably selling the building to somebody else and walking away, or co-redeveloping with somebody."
David W. Levinson, executive managing director of Edward S. Gordon, acknowledged that there had been talk in the industry about demolishing the building because of the huge structural problems, but he said doing so would be too costly. "It does need a substantial amount of work," he said, "but I think there's a way to salvage some part of the structure."
Mr. Levinson added that whether the building became a hotel or a residential building "was more a function of the timing," of how long it takes to do a feasibility study and make the necessary changes.
"Right now, we don't need an additional hotel in midtown," he said. "If when the time comes the office market is very soft, it could be used for residential. But the office market as a whole is tightening, and my expectation is it could come back as an office building again."
THE building is not the only Manhattan office tower to have trouble with the wind, but it is perhaps the one that has received the most notice. Its problem is an unhappy legacy of a change in architectural design that began in the 1950's, when architects started to replace the rigid steel frames of skyscrapers with lighter, more flexible frames of stronger steel. As a result, some of those buildings began swaying in the wind. The swaying occurs, engineers say, when walls, floors, stairwells and glass exteriors designed for more rigid buildings are put in ones with the flexible frames. The sway at Gulf and Western created cracks in the interior stairwells and core walls, and workers began complaining that the building's movement made them queasy.
Concern about the sway was a significant part of court papers filed in connection with the bankruptcy proceedings by the building's second largest tenant, BDO Seidman, an accounting and consulting firm. Lawyers for the firm said that conditions in the building were "nightmarish" and that the owner had "failed to take steps to remedy major structural and other problems."
"The entire skin of the building is defective and must be redone," the lawyers said. "This and the sway of the building causes the window seals to crack, resulting in leaks when it rains. The debtor also has failed to repair large cracks in the concrete of the building and there are problems with the building's exterior columns. The entire building is now surrounded by scaffolding which has remained long beyond any reasonable period of time."
In its response to the court, the owner called the assertions "nothing more than a blatant, last-minute attempt" by BDO Seidman "to avoid its legitimate obligations under leases with above-market rents, in order that it might capitalize on the current weak commercial real estate market in New York City by relocating to newer quarters at a more favorable rental rate."
Jerry Walsh, a spokesman for BDO Seidman, said the company would have no further comment. But 15 Columbus Circle Associates itself, in its original papers seeking Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, acknowledged as significant liabilities "the alleged presence of asbestos and certain structural defects," such as "the twisting of the building in the wind, penetration of rain and gaps in the elevator shafts."
A report on the condition of the building's facade prepared after an inspection on Sept. 26, 1990, said it was in an unsafe condition. The report, prepared by an engineering concern for the building's owners, said that "there are many severely misaligned facade panels, particularly at the column bays and at the corners of the building," and urgently called for "immediate remedial measures" to "establish and maintain safe conditions."
The report noted that a protective sidewalk bridge, or sidewalk shed, was in place around the perimeter of the building but added that "if any facade panels were to detach from the building during a windstorm, they could be blown far beyond the sidewalk bridges."
More than two years after the filing of the report, no such remedial measures have apparently been taken, said Vahe Tiryakian, a spokesman for the city's Buildings Department. Violation notices were issued on Dec. 5, 1990, and on Aug. 5 and Oct. 20, 1992. Because no report had been submitted by the owner on any actions taken to repair the facade, a hearing was held Dec. 17 at the city's Administrative Control Board, Mr. Tiryakian said, and a $400 fine was imposed.
Mr. Tiryakian said that the severe windstorm in December had not caused any pieces of the facade to blow away, "so it doesn't look as if this material is about to fly off the building." But he added that the condition could be deteriorating, "and we will focus on getting remedial action under way at that facade."
The owner of the building and the land on which it sits, 15 Columbus Circle Associates, filed for bankruptcy in November 1991 after the General Electric Pension Trust, which holds the third and fourth mortgages on the building, began foreclosure action on the property. The owner of the building had obligations of $577,000 a month to the pension trust.
IN the proposed distribution of assets under the owner's Chapter 11 plan of reorganization, General Electric Pension Trust would receive the property in partial compensation for its total claim of $56 million. The case is being heard by Judge Tina L. Brozman in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan; the next hearing is due in mid-February.
Winthrop Financial Associates of Boston, of which 15 Columbus Circle Associates is a part, controls through its various entities -- which include the First Winthrop Corporation and 19 N.Y. Properties -- more than $6 billion worth of real estate in 42 states and Canada and employs about 1,900 people. First Winthrop bought the Gulf and Western Building in 1984 from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation as part of a $400 million deal involving 19 prime commercial properties in New York. Paramount Communications, the former Gulf and Western, has been the building's main tenant since construction was announced in 1967.
The building contains 649,000 rentable square feet, of which Paramount Communications occupies 542,039, or about 85 percent, including the second through fifth and 13th through 44th floors, as well as part of the concourse and subconcourse levels. Paramount's companies in the building include Paramount Pictures and parts of Simon and Schuster and Prentice-Hall. BDO Seidman leases about 12 percent of the rentable square footage, including the 6th through 8th and 10th through 12th floors. Its leases expire between 1995 and 2002.
The location that is now known as 15 Columbus Circle has never been particularly lucky. The site at the turn of the century of Durland's Riding Academy, one of the largest riding schools in the world, it was bought by the newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, who hoped to turn Columbus Circle into Hearst Plaza. He planned a 30-story American Circle Building, but because of steel shortages during World War I the building was limited to two stories when it went up in 1915. It remained until 1966, much of it occupied in its later years by radio station WINS. But it was best known as the home of the 55-foot-tall Coca-Cola thermometer sign, which provided the temperature and the next day's weather to a generation of New Yorkers and was taken down on Aug. 20, 1965.
In March 1965 plans were announced for a 45-story, $20 million office tower on the site. But in June 1966 the proposal was changed to a 35-story circular apartment tower perched atop a 10-story office-and-restaurant base shaped like the prow of a ship. It would be known as 1 Central Park West and would carry the highest rents of any Manhattan luxury residences: well over $100 a room a month.
The builders of the office-apartment tower, however, could not get the needed mortgage financing and sold the land. And on Oct. 26, 1967, Mayor John V. Lindsay announced plans for a 44-story, $20 million building that would be the home of a large industrial corporation that was consolidating its headquarters in New York City: Gulf and Western.
THOMAS E. STANLEY, head of the Dallas architectural firm that designed the marble, glass and aluminum-sheathed structure, said it would "provide a nice transition from Central Park." But when it opened in 1970, architecture critics generally disagreed, calling it too tall, the wrong shape for its site and completely out of context.
Adjacent to the building is a moviehouse, the Loews Columbus Circle (formerly the Loews Paramount). Robert Smerling, president of Loews Theaters, said he expected that it would remain despite the problems. The lease extends to April 1995, "with some options beyond that," Mr. Smerling said, "and though I don't think anybody has focused on what we're going to do then, it's been a successful theater for us and depending on the rent and the marketplace we expect to continue there."
As for the building itself, "It's all subject to what's going to happen to those tenants," said Mr. Cleary of Cushman and Wakefield. "If Paramount commits to someplace else, then you have something. With the tenants in possession, there's not much you can do."

HEADLINE: Perspectives: Mixed-Income Housing;
Finding a Way To Keep Building

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
"PEOPLE have a perception that New York City is suffering worse than it is," says Stephen M. Ross, president of The Related Companies, a development, management and financial services firm based in Manhattan. "Actually, the rental market is strong."
When a developer says "people" he usually has lenders in mind. Mr. Ross has been busy of late trying to get lenders' perceptions to reflect his own experience lately in renting out apartments. He has succeeded sufficiently, it seems, to win a financial commitment for his next Manhattan project from a pension fund he declined to identify, a 180-unit residential building on the southeast corner of First Avenue and 84th Street. Groundbreaking is expected in late spring. 
 Eighty percent of the apartments will be market-rate, mostly bigger family-sized apartments. The rest will be for low-income people. An 80-20 income mix is characteristic of the buildings that use tax-exempt financing. The Related Companies, historically a user of low-income housing programs in its construction projects, comes to it naturally.
What is new in Manhattan is that conventional mortgage financing is so unavailable that builders who have not previously used governmental programs are beginning to turn to them. Much of what little new multifamily housing is forthcoming in New York City in the early 90's is likely to make use of government-backed bonds.
Related has other new projects close to a construction start in the region. The company has received a financial commitment for a large-scale mixed-income development known as The Ninth Square in downtown New Haven, a $100 million joint venture with a St. Louis real-estate company, McCormack Baron & Associates. Construction is to start in early March after six years of planning.
The site consists of four city blocks near the southeast side of the New Haven Green, diagonally across from the Yale campus. Yale is an investor in the project, as are the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority, the state's Departments of Housing and Economic Development, the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development and the city of New Haven itself.
There will be 335 rental apartments, dispersed in one new nine-story building, a smaller five-story building and two sets of rehabilitated historic buildings. Beyond that there will be two parking decks for 644 cars and 49,000 square feet of retail space. The architects are Herbert Newman & Associates of New Haven and Smith Edwards Architects of Hartford.
And in the Strawberry Hill section of Stamford, Related expects to start construction in early spring on 263 rentals in a string of four-story elevator buildings on a site near St. Joseph's Hospital. The architect is BGA Associates of Dallas.
Mr. Ross, who is 52, is a tax lawyer who worked in investment banking on Wall Street after he came to New York from Michigan in the late 60's. He founded Related in 1972, specializing in syndicating the tax benefits available to investors under various Government low-income housing programs. Profits were used to support the company's own development work, primarily subsidized housing at the time. Related developed about 5,000 units of subsidized housing. Later it turned to commercial projects and conventionally financed housing.
"To be successful as a real-estate developer you must be in another business and have another source of income," Mr. Ross says. "You should not be forced to do deals. You will do a lot of bad deals that way."
IN retrospect he perhaps wishes he had not made certain deals in the mid-80's, when Related, like other real estate companies, expanded broadly across the country, usually in joint ventures with local development partners. In New England the regional company eventually closed down with a loss of nearly $40 million. The lenders were paid off on two market-rate condominiums and the undeveloped land where another was planned. Similarly, an operating company that had embarked on several commercial ventures in California was closed down, with substantial losses.
There were successes as well, including a million-square-foot office park in Westchester called The Centre at Purchase. And in Manhattan, Related bought a major interest in the 550,000-square-foot office building at 625 Madison Avenue, on the south blockfront from 58th to 59th Street, and rehabilitated it for new tenants, itself included.
One project that Related long tried to develop but never could was Riverwalk, a mixed-use extravaganza of 1,800 apartments on 30 acres along the East River from East 16th to 24th Street. Related was designated as developer in the early 80's by the administration of Mayor Edward I. Koch. Ultimately, with extraordinary environmental problems causing long delays and the market timing lost, the city's designation was withdrawn.
Last November, Related completed a restructuring as a limited partnership, with new investment capital. The new partners are Jorge M. Perez, who was a joint-venture partner in The Related Group of Florida, in Miami; Max Fisher, a Detroit financier, and the Moses Ginsberg family, long active in shipping and real estate in New York.
The Florida company has several active development ventures, both market-rate and subsidized, in the southeastern part of the state.
In Manhattan, Related's most recent project, the 522-unit Monterey on the northeast corner of 96th Street and Third Avenue, is a demonstration of the potential for mixing low-income units in a building essentially marketed to middle-income people.
IT has been successful even though total rents on the market-rate units averaged only $28 a square foot a year, Mr. Ross said. The rents were about $3 a square foot below projections. But the financing was tied to short-term interest rates, which fell at the same time rents were falling. At $28 a square foot a year, a typical one-bedroom apartment rents for about $1,500 a month.
A profile of the market-rate tenants indicates that they are representative of the young professional and executive class that is a key element of Manhattan's workforce. Providing decent housing for this class of tenants helps bolster the city's jobs base.
Close to 60 percent of these tenants are new arrivals to New York City, Related's rental office said. About 35 percent of the tenants work in banking or financial services, 20 percent in the medical profession and 20 percent in law. The rest are in assorted fields. And 70 percent of all the tenants are between the ages of 26 and 38.
The average income of single tenants is $68,000. When there is a second income-earner in the household, that person's income has averaged $43,000.
There is a fully equipped health club at the Monterey. The management reports that 396 of the 710 residents in the building have joined it. The fee for residents is $450 a year.
At the 84th Street site, the apartment mix will be more heavily weighted to larger apartments, which should bring in an older, upper-income tenancy in a location that has recently seen the development of another high-end rental, the Lucerne, at 350 East 79th Street, at First Avenue. STATE or city authorization to use tax-exempt bonds on a particular project is not alone sufficient to trigger new construction. The builder must be able to find a guarantor for the bonds so they will be salable in the marketplace. Although in the past Related has used pension funds or financial- services firms that specialize in credit enhancement, the expectation is that builders will increasingly be obliged to look to the Federal Housing Administration, an operating arm of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, to accept this role.
The extension of New York's Section 421a tax abatement program to 20 years from 10 years improved the prospects for financing of new housing starts in Manhattan. The Brodsky Organization, a builder of condominiums and market-rate rentals in the 80's, is expected to turn to bond financing for the first time at its Manhattan West project -- 1,000 units on West End Avenue between 61st and 64th Streets. It is expected to get under way this year.
Even Glenwood Management Corporation, the builder of the Lucerne and other fully market-rate rentals on the East Side for many years, is considering this form of financing for its next major project, a 270-unit rental at 92d Street and York Avenue, said Gary Jacob, executive vice president of the company.
"The standards for loans have gone from one extreme to the other," said Mr. Jacob. "They were liberal in the 80's. Now they're overly restrictive."
According to Alan H. Wiener, chairman of American Property Financing Inc., which assists builders in obtaining public financing, five or six development sites in Manhattan are candidates for it.

HEADLINE: Child Care Makes a Mark in Office Parks

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD

 BODY:
IN 1989, when Sandra Beetner was looking to relocate her computer graphics company, she had a 5-month old girl. As a result, she viewed child care as an important amenity, not only for herself but for her employees, many of whom were also young parents.
"We were moving from Manhattan, and were used to lots of conveniences and services, like pick-up and delivery and printing services," she said. "I can't say that child care was the top priority, but its availablily unquestionably influenced my decision." 
 Genigraphics, the company of which Ms. Beetner is president, eventually leased 16,000 square feet at Enterprise Corporate Towers, in Shelton, Conn., one of the first corporate parks in the metropolitan area to have a child-care center. The 104-child center was built in 1988.
Since then, several other developers have decided that, to be competitive, they, too, will have to provide child care.
"About four years ago, we started questioning our tenants and our own employees, and we found out they had a real problem finding good child care," said Michael Grossman, vice president of leasing for the Robert Martin Company, the first developer in Westchester County to build on-site child-care centers at its corporate parks. The company now has four centers.
The first, opened in February 1990, is in the Cross Westchester Executive Park, in Elmsford. It now has others in the Mid Westchester Executive Park in Hawthorne and in the South Westchester Executive Park in Yonkers. Recently, it opened a second one in the Elmsford park at the request of medical companies in the area, since the park was already zoned for child care.
"It seems whether we like it or not, we're in the child-care business," Mr. Grossman said. "We plan to eventually have centers at every one of our properties." In addition to its three executive parks, the company owns two office buildings in Tarrytown and just under a million square feet of office space in downtown White Plains.
When Ms. Beetner was planning to relocate, she looked at some of Robert Martin's properties. "I remember she mentioned she had a baby," Mr. Grossman said. "That's about the time we decided that day care was a competitive necessity for us. I mean, when the president of the company has a baby, it's pretty clear that child care is going to be important to that firm."
The best evidence of the success of Robert Martin's strategy, according to Mr. Grossman, is that two of its centers now have waiting lists and the first one the company built, at the Elmhsford site, is now considering adding a kindergarten.
John Chapman, a vice president for customer services at Basys Automation Systems, has two children at the South Westchester center. "It really simplfies my life," he said. "The kids love it. It's a creative environment for them. And instead of traveling around, dropping them off and picking them up, they're in the building next door to me. It easily saves me a half hour each day."
ONE of the latest developers to take the plunge into child care is the Rockefeller Center Development Corporation, which is building a 7,000-square-foot, free-standing building at its International Trade Center, a 6.7 million square foot corporate park in Mount Olive, N.J. The 105-child center is scheduled to open in August.
More than 2,000 employees are expected to move into the park by next year. BASF, an international chemical company, is now completing construction of a 675,000-square-foot building, and eventually plans to build a total of 1.7 million square feet of office space.
The construction is part of a major consolidation of the company's northeast operations. "At total capacity, we could have 5,000 people at the site," said George Neumann, BASF's site director for the project.
Eugene A. Preston, director of marketing for the International Trade Center, said that having a child-care facility "is almost a necessity in marketing a big park nowadays, in order to attract the kinds of businesses that we want."
The developer is also considering adding a child care facility at its flagship property, Rockefeller Center in Manhattan. "To date, centers have been harder to do in an urban setting with space limitations and other restrictions," Mr. Preston said. He also explained the logistical difficulty of having parents commuting into the city by mass transit with a child in tow.
Few developers own or operate the centers they build. They usually hire outside companies specializing in child care, like Bright Horizons, which operates 52 corporate child-care centers on the East Coast.
Michael Day, development manager for Bright Horizons, said he's now negotiating with several other developers who are also planning child-care centers in corporate parks.
He attributed the flurry of activity in the metropolitan area to the current economic climate. "On the one hand, it's difficult to justify the expense, but on the other, developers are more competitive with each other," Mr. Daly said. "A lot of times, it's simply a matter of the tenants going to the existing landlord and making a request."
The child-care operator is often very involved in the design of the facility. For instance, for its free-standing structure, Rockefeller Development hired its architectectural firm, D.W. Arthur Associates Architects of Boston.
BUILDING a child-care facility is fraught with complications and expense. The building codes vary by state, but typically there are strict requirements, such as having at least 35 square feet of activity space per child, an outdoor play area and "lots of plumbing with miniature fixtures," Mr. Grossman said. "They're cute, but expensive." They must also have kitchens with commercial equipment, special air-conditioning and heating systems and indoor areas that are exposed to natural light.
After building a center, the developer then essentially subsidizes it by renting at a drastically reduced rate or, in some cases, without charge.
"I was more interested in getting the best quality people to run the center than getting the highest rent," said Robert D. Scinto, developer of Enterprise Corporate Towers.
For the Robert Martin Company, the effort has been worthwhile. "It's now a part of our package," said Mr. Grossman. "It's what differentiates us from the competition, and helps us maintain our high occupancy levels."
According to Mr. Grossman, all of Robert Martin's three parks with day-care facilities are now more than 95 percent occupied.
The developers who have entered the child-care business seem prepared to stay. "With two-income families the norm now, the need will continue to grow," said Mr. Preston. "I don't see that changing any time soon."
When his company first moved to Enterprise Towers a year and a half ago, Richard Schwartz wasn't sure how many employees would make use of the on-site center. "We have 150 people and almost 80 percent are female," said Mr. Schwartz, president of the northeast region of Prudential Relocation Management, which relocates corporate employees. "About eight people use it now," he said.
"But that number is increasing as people get used to the facility. And several of our newer employees have had babies since we moved."
For some developers, the pay-off in having child care is often more a matter of image than substance. "No one came here because of a day-care center," said Mr. Scinto. "But it's an important part of our image. It says we're family oriented and helps us be more than just a group of office buildings."
One of Mr. Scinto's tenants, Ms. Beetner, believes that having children around adds a human touch. Her office is adjacent to the center, connected by a walkway. "The kids come by trick-or-treating," she said. "They're not intrusive. It's just nice to see them."
She also believes it's helped her business as well. When her administrative assistant recently had a baby and "she was having trouble weaning herself from her baby," Ms. Beetner said, "the process was made so much easier by having the center nearby. I think it made the difference in her being able to come back at all."

HEADLINE: Lottery Winners Years Later

BYLINE: By ELISABETH GINSBURG

 BODY:
ON St. Patrick's Day in 1971, Edward Henry of Morristown became the first member of an elite club -- New Jersey lottery millionaires. Since then, the lottery has bestowed individual jackpots of $1 million or more on dozens of people.
Most winners spend their first hours riding high on a wave of euphoria and publicity. After that, anything goes. The windfall can become an asset or a liability or something in between, depending on the personality of the winner. 
 Dr. H. Roy Kaplan, an Asbury Park native who is now adjunct professor of sociology at the Florida Institute of Technology, studied early lottery winners (including many in New Jersey) in the 1970's and did follow-up studies in the 80's. He concluded that "open, extroverted" people generally adjusted better to becoming instant millionaires than more reticent types.
Extroverted or not, the first thing many winners acquire is an unlisted telephone number to prevent the inevitable calls from long-lost relatives, would-be investment advisers and the host of strangers who are -- or claim to be -- down on their luck. Some winners, like Mr. Henry, refuse to discuss their experiences publicly, even years afterward.
Donald Bakely, Evelyn Marie Adams and Pat Grace are New Jerseyans who became lottery millionaires in the 80's. Though other winners have left the Garden State in search of warmer climates or have requested unlisted phone numbers, they have stayed put and stayed accessible. All three were willing to step briefly back into the spotlight to describe what "normal life" is for an instant millionaire.

 
 
Co-Workers' Attitude Led A Winner to Quit His Job
 Mr. Bakely of Thorofare is an electrical engineer who won $4.2 million in 1982. He decided to retain his listing in the local telephone directory. "I like to talk to people," said Mr. Bakely, who confirmed that over the last 10 years he has received all kinds of solicitations.
Unwilling to turn away the genuinely needy, Mr. Bakely keeps a list of government and charitable organizations and makes referrals whenever he is approached. A few years ago, he received one especially memorable letter containing a plea for $2,000 and ending with a request that the money be sent via certified check or money order. "He wouldn't accept my personal check," Mr. Bakely said.
Strangers were not the only ones looking for handouts. An old friend who borrowed $2,000 was resentful when Mr. Bakely asked about repayment. "He didn't think a millionaire should be worried about such a small amount," Mr. Bakely said. "I feel badly about losing the money, but I feel worse about losing a friend."
The windfall also changed his relationship with his co-workers. "For the first six months after I won, they treated me like a celebrity, but after that it turned to jealousy," he said. Eventually, he quit his job.
Though his millions have caused Mr. Bakely more than a few headaches, there have been compensations. He bought an expensive new house and a luxury sports car. Living out a longtime fantasy, he put the car through its paces at a high-performance driving school. His 15-year-old daughter, Kathleen, attends a private school and will be able to afford any college she chooses when the time comes.
 
 
 
Time for Community Service
 Since his "retirement," Mr. Bakely has had another luxury -- free time. He donates many hours to community service projects and is active in his local Kiwanis Club.
Now more than halfway through his 20-year lottery stipend, Mr. Bakely is looking ahead to the day when the checks stop coming. His house will be paid for, and his investments should provide a steady income, though he admits that it will not be as much as he has received from the lottery.
He does not foresee a return to the working world. As a designer of nuclear power plants, he has watched the demand for his specialty diminish as his years away from it have increased. The lottery may well have saved him from needing that other kind of state stipend -- unemployment insurance.
Dr. Kaplan noted that Mr. Bakely was not alone in leaving his job. About three-quarters of the earliest lottery winners quit their jobs for one reason or another, he said. By the 1980's, more of the winners were younger and opted to continue working, though some used jackpot money to retrain themselves for more gratifying jobs. Dr. Kaplan also noted the tendency of many winners to buy themselves new homes.

 
 
A Two-Time Winner Loses Her Privacy
 Like most lottery winners, Ms. Adams of Point Pleasant Beach endured the publicity barrage that goes with winning a big jackpot. Unlike her fellow Pick-6 winners, Ms. Adams was thrown into the spotlight twice, as the first two-time winner of the New Jersey Lottery.
After winning $3.9 million in October 1985 and $1.4 million four months later, Ms. Adams found that she no longer had the privilege of privacy. "I was known," she said, "and I couldn't go anywhere without being recognized."
Ms. Adams, who was a convenience store clerk when she won for the first time, also received many requests for financial aid. "I gave a lot of money away at first," she said. "Now I am more selective."
Like Mr. Bakely, Ms. Adams found that some people to whom she lent money did not think it necessary to repay her. Within her own family, reactions to her extraordinary good fortune were mixed. "Most of my family was great," she said, "but a few of my relatives were angry because I had so much."
From the lottery's 1971 inception until she won, Ms. Adams spent $25 a week on tickets. Afterward, she increased her ticket expenditures to $100 a week.
 
Many Plans, Including Marriage
 After winning her second jackpot, the newly wealthy woman was full of plans for the future. She intended to marry her fiance, who owned the convenience store where she worked. She also hoped to use her lottery winnings to return to school and study music, with the goal of one day opening a music store.
Seven years have passed since the double windfall, and Ms. Adams no longer works in the convenience store. She married her fiance, and his store, which had become popular with ticket buyers, was sold.
For a short time after the sale of the store, neither Ms. Adams nor her husband, Edward, worked. He eventually became bored, and returned to work as an "independent inventory control specialist," she said.
She has deferred her dream of leaving Point Pleasant Beach and returning to school until her daughter, Tracy, graduates from high school next year. In the meantime, the two-time winner is in the process of supervising an extensive home remodeling project. She still buys an occasional lottery ticket.
Ms. Adams has attended reunions of former lottery winners, and she found that they all have the same stories about the joys and sorrows of becoming wealthy overnight. She is philosophical about her own experience. "It didn't change me," she said, "but it did change the people around me."

 
 
A Master's Degree And a New Career
 Mrs. Grace, who lives in Hunterdon County and won $2.8 million in 1986, also talked about the changes her good luck brought -- and did not bring -- to her family. "We stayed in the same town and shopped in the same stores," she said. Her son, Sean, who was in high school at the time, suddenly found himself more popular with some of his classmates
Mrs. Grace stressed the good things that her prize money brought. After winning, she was able to afford to get a master's degree in speech pathology. Now the lottery income allows her to practice her profession at a day-care center in East Orange where the pay is low but the work is emotionally satisfying.
Her husband, John, who was a semiretired golf professional in 1986, has been able to play "even more golf," she said. Sean Grace was able to attend Notre Dame instead of a less expensive college, and his parents live in a big new house they built for both enjoyment and investment purposes.
Mrs. Grace said the master's degree was not the only education she has received since winning the jackpot. After losing some money because of bad investments, she was forced to learn, she said, "the basics of sound investing."
The Graces' goal is to manage their money in such a way that will provide a comfortable income when their stipend runs out 13 years from now. Mrs. Grace said her winnings "don't seem like $2.8 million," mostly because of the sizable yearly tax bill. But, she said, "you can't complain when you have a six-figure income."
Like Ms. Adams, Mrs. Grace still buys lottery tickets. "I intend to be a double winner," she said.

HEADLINE: 10 Years of Making Ailing Children's Wishes Come True

BYLINE: >By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
LAST September, Theresa Beauchamp of Union made a call to the Make-A-Wish Foundation in Elizabeth. Mrs. Beauchamp, who had just been told that her 3-year-old son had leukemia, called to find out how he could make a wish.
The person who answered said it was simple: put the boy on the phone.
"I want a tree house," said Christopher (Kiki) Beauchamp. 
 Two weeks later, Kiki had his tree house.
"Basically, no wish goes ungranted," said Norma C. Godin, executive director of the New Jersey chapter of the Make-A-Wish Foundation in Elizabeth. Over the years, the state chapter, which is part of a nationwide organization with 78 independent chapters, has granted hundreds of wishes for children, like Kiki, who have life-threatening illnesses.
Two weeks ago, as the chapter celebrated its 10th anniversary, officials assessed the challenges ahead as terminal illnesses, particularly AIDS, claim increasing numbers of young lives.
"Being part of Make-A-Wish puts everything else in perspective," said Richard C. Wischusen, president of the board of the New Jersey chapter. "You begin to realize that all the problems in your life don't add up to a fraction of what some people go through."
 
Requests Expected to Rise
 Mr. Wischusen, a lawyer in New Providence, said that over the last three years the chapter had granted more wishes than in all the preceding years combined. And, he said, the number of new wishes is expected to increase in 1993.
"More people are becoming aware of us," he said, "and it's my perception that the H.I.V. virus is adding to our numbers."
The wishes granted by the foundation range from modest to magnificent. The chapter's first wish was a simple request for a birthday card to be sent to a 7-year-old Union County boy with a terminal illness. In contrast, the chapter fulfilled a more elaborate request last year when it sent a seriously ill boy and 11 members of his family on a 14-day trip to Israel.
"It's not the kind of wish we could do every day," said Ms. Godin, who became director of the chapter about three years ago.
Over the last 10 years, she said, the chapter granted 810 wishes. About a quarter -- 207 -- were granted in 1992 alone. Next year, Ms. Godin said, she expects to grant about 250 wishes. The value of the 1992 wishes was estimated at more than $928,000, though the actual cash spent is somewhat less.
"We try to get as many 'in-kind' donations as we can," Ms. Godin said, adding that all the chapter's working capital comes from donations. The bulk of the donations come from individuals and from fund-raising events held throughout the year. The events range from golf outings for business people to cake sales run by employees of businesses in the state.
"About 90 percent of our donations go directly to wishes," Ms. Godin said, adding that 10 percent is used for administrative expenses, which include three full-time employees.
The majority of wishes, she said, are for trips to Disney World in Florida. Typically, the foundation will cover the entire cost of the trip for the child and family members, including brothers and sisters. Even spending money is included.
But not every child wants a trip to Florida.
"I asked him if would rather go to Disney World, but he just wanted the tree house," Mrs. Beauchamp said, explaining that her son's wish was inspired by a visit to a cousin's tree house last summer.
In keeping with the chapter's practice of fulfilling wishes as economically as possible, officials looked for someone who could build a tree house. They didn't have to look far.
Two of the chapter's board members, Jack and Robert Silverstein, owners of Rojac Construction in Ocean, volunteered labor and materials for the job.
The problem was that the only tree on the property was a pine tree -- not exactly the ideal setting for a treehouse. So instead of building inside the tree, the builders instead put the tree house next to it, a matter of little significance to Kiki.
"I like it a lot," he said while pedaling around his driveway on a miniature bulldozer. "I can play G.I. Joe."
A different kind of wish was granted to Tony Johnson, 15, a Hudson County resident whose AIDS was diagnosed in September 1991. Last year, Tony, who was writing a book of essays about his life before and after AIDS, was becoming frustrated writing the book in longhand.
The Make-A-Wish Foundation found out about his plight through a social worker and offered him a computer. "Now I wonder how I ever did without it," he said.
Tony finished his book, "A Rock and a Hard Place," last spring, and it will be published in April by Crown Publishers of New York. "I'm working on my second book now," he said.
Most wishes originate when doctors, nurses or social workers tell parents of a sick child about the foundation. Typically, the child or the parents will describe the wish in a letter. The foundation contacts the child's doctor to determine whether the illness is life threatening.
If it is, the foundation's board meets to determine whether the child's wish can be fulfilled without impairing the chapter's ability to grant other wishes. Once the wish is approved, it is sent to a local office where volunteers handle the details.
The foundation's New Jersey headquarters are in a modest two-room office in Elizabeth. A sign proclaims "Don't Postpone Joy," and walls lined with photographs document that philosophy. Children who wished for meetings with their heroes are seen being hugged by celebrities ranging from Mr. Rogers to Mr. T. Photographs of children with stars like Hulk Hogan, Michael Jordan and Bruce Springsteen are displayed along with pictures of children with former President Ronald Reagan and United States Senator Bill Bradley.
The common thread that unites the images is an enchanted child in the midst of building a memory.
"That's what really fired me up," said Greg Jones, president of McCormick Corporate Communications in Long Valley, who has just become a member of the board. "There's the obvious benefit to the child, but beyond that, there are memories being made for the family as well."
Bob Bellacosa of Livingston reflected on the value of such memories. "In May of 1991, our son was diagnosed with a brain tumor," Mr. Bellacosa said, adding that the boy, Robbie, was 4 at the time. "In the late stages of his illness, our pediatrician came across the Make-A-Wish Foundation."
Mr. Bellacosa said the doctor contacted Ms. Godin and told her of Robbie's avid interest in professional wrestling and of his worsening medical condition.
"He was bedridden," Mr. Bellacosa said. "Ms. Godin came to visit him at 10 o'clock in the morning, and by 5 o'clock that afternoon we had this behemoth Russian wrestler in our house, spending time with our son."
Nine days later Robbie died.
"But that visit was such a bright spot," Mr. Bellacosa said. "It was really good medicine, not only for Robbie, but for the family as well because of the memory it leaves. It was a very good day. We still talk about it. And when it's all over, that's all you have to hold on to."
 
'He's Doing O.K. Now'
 When Ryan Ian Poyatt was 4 and living in Haddon Township, it was found that he had a brain tumor. Though most of the tumor was surgically removed, Ryan was left blind, and a portion of the tumor remained.
"He's doing O.K. now," said his mother, Mary Riggin Poyatt. "He hasn't stopped progressing. I've got a lot of my Ryan back."
Ms. Poyatt said the Make-A-Wish Foundation called her several times, asking her if there was anything her son might need. "I didn't want to ask for something just for the sake of getting it," she said.
But then, after discovering that Ryan enjoyed being pushed along for rides on his tricycle, Ms. Poyatt told him about a bicycle she had seen in a magazine. The bicycle had two seats and three wheels and could be painted any color of the rainbow.
A few weeks later, after sending his letter to the Make-A-Wish Foundation, Ryan sat on the back of a red two-seater, his mother providing the pedal power, and the spring breeze on his face providing proof that some wishes indeed come true.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Harking Back To the Days of Malaise

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
REMEMBER the last time that the Democrats controlled both the White House and Capitol Hill? Then Washington was convulsed by a long and ultimately inconclusive battle over a national energy policy, a fight that pitted region against region.
By opening up the possibility of new energy taxes, the Clinton Administration has inadvertently walked into a possible re-run of that battle, a fight that many on Wall Street seem to have forgotten. Last week, when J. Bennett Johnston, the Louisiana senator who chairs the Energy Committee, proposed a tax on imported oil aimed at assuring a price of $25 per barrel for domestic oil, the oil stocks went crazy. 
 The idea is a bit batty for a lot of reasons, including the fact it would raise little revenue for the Government while providing oil companies with windfall profits. And as Salomon Brothers' Bill Randol noted, chemical companies that use petroleum as a raw material would be devastated. To be sure, it does play brilliantly in Louisiana. But in Maine, the home of George Mitchell, the Senate Democratic leader, and a place where a lot of homes are heated by imported oil, it is hard to imagine a less popular idea.
By Friday, the implausibility of the Johnston proposal had begun to sink in on Wall Street, and oil stocks slipped back. But the Standard & Poor's index of domestic integrated oil stocks was still up 6.4 percent for the week, perhaps ending a long period during which the oils have been dead in the water.
A big part of that move, as is noted on page 15, stemmed from reports that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was actually going to get its act together and cut production enough to boost world prices. Stranger things have happened, but the probability of that happening when oil demand is depressed by weak growth in this country and recessions in Europe and Japan would seem to be low. It would no doubt be rational for the oil producers to cooperate, but even now it appears likely that enough of them would cheat on a production accord to render it ineffective.
Still, it is understandable why value-oriented money managers would find oil companies enticing. Exxon's market value rose $3.7 billion last week, as the stock gained $3 to $61.125, but it still trades at just 15 times estimated 1993 earnings, not an impressive number in the current frothy environment. Oil companies are seen as plays that benefit from inflation and strong economic activity, and the conventional wisdom is that neither of those will come again. For those who doubt that, the long-term contrarian argument for the oils has great appeal, whatever happens at the next OPEC meeting.
The Wall Street reaction to the uproar over possible energy taxes is not that important, although lots of money may be made. The more significant question is whether a regional battle will again paralyze the Government. It is high time for President Clinton to stop the trial balloons and come up with a tax policy that can pass Congress.

HEADLINE: Pondering an Energy Tax That Can't Please All the People

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
THE energy tax being considered by the Clinton Administration could reduce the budget deficit, cut oil imports and meet environmental goals. But before the Administration asks Congress to approve one, it will have to decide which problems it wants cured the most, and whom it is willing to offend in the process.
Last weekend the Treasury Secretary, Lloyd Bentsen, said the Administration was considering a "broad-based energy tax." Experts say that there are three practical ways to levy such a tax. First is the "B.T.U." tax, in which each unit of energy, no matter what the source, would be taxed at the same rate; second is a sales tax on the fuel used by utilities, industries and individuals ; third is a "carbon tax" based on how much carbon dioxide the fuel's use creates. Other possibilities -- not so broad-based -- are taxes on oil imports and on gasoline. 
 Each produces a different set of winners and losers, allies and enemies. The carbon tax, for example, would hit residents of the Midwest very hard, and the oil import tax would hurt the Northeast; both would be felt much more mildly in the Pacific Northwest.
If any energy tax is enacted, consumers would pay more not just for the energy they buy directly, like gasoline or electricity. Everything has an energy component, from maple syrup, which is produced with prodigious amounts of oil, to a dentist's filling a cavity, which requires electricity for the drill. Indeed, most people pay more for energy through the goods and services they buy than they pay directly in utility or fuel bills. In that sense, a "broad-based energy tax" could resemble a national sales tax or a value-added tax.
Picking which tax will emerge, if any, is difficult. A spokesman for the Treasury Department, Scott Dykema, said on Friday that "nothing has been ruled in and nothing has been ruled out."
But Roger Altman, deputy Treasury Secretary, said in an interview with John McLaughlin, host of the television program "The McLaughlin Group", on Friday that "there are good arguments for a B.T.U. tax, and there are good arguments for an ad valorem tax." An ad valorem tax is a sales tax on energy.
"I think those two are the primary options in this area," he said. "I don't think that a gasoline tax is as attractive, I don't think that a carbon tax is as attractive, but whether the President will ultimately decide on an energy tax at all, and how he'll come down as between these two or some of the other options, I don't know."
On Capitol Hill, key players have yet to take a position. Dan Rostenkowski, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, reiterated last week that he favors a gasoline tax, 25 cents a gallon or more, and has also said he would support other tax increases if the President wants them. But he has not been more detailed on the subject of energy taxes.
Likewise, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has supported an energy tax but not expressed any preference thus far.
Whatever tax is chosen, implementation would probably be complicated. And the tax would create a drag on the economy -- perhaps even a sudden burst of inflation. But such taxes are also extremely attractive as a way to raise money. The national energy bill is about $475 billion a year, nearly 10 percent of the gross domestic product. "There's real money here," said Phillip K. Verleger Jr., an energy and commodity economist. If the Administration holds to its goal of cutting the deficit by $145 billion in four years, that implies major revenue growth even if there are also spending cuts.
Some people in the energy industry say that energy should not be singled out for taxation. "Good economics tells you you should raise revenue from the broadest source possible," said Bruce G. Humphrey, the chief economist at the Edison Electric Institute, the trade association of investor-owned utilities. "An energy tax literally excludes 90 percent of the rest of the economy." The result, he said, is distortions in the economy.
But that is the idea, say proponents who want to change the way energy is used. However, such considerations may be secondary, especially in Mr. Bentsen's mind. The trial balloon for this tax was floated by the Treasury Secretary, not the Energy Secretary, Hazel Rollins O'Leary, who told the Senate Energy Committee in her confirmation hearings a few days earlier that she did not favor energy taxes.
Following is a description of the options:
 
The 'B.T.U.' Tax
 Fuel comes in many forms and when engineers compare them -- to decide, say, whether to run a factory on oil or natural gas -- they refer to the heat content as measured by B.T.U.'s, or British thermal units. Trivia buffs will recall that a B.T.U. is the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit at or near 39.2 degrees.
Some people, including Mr. Altman, say that rather than taxing coal by the ton or oil by the barrel, which effectively means different taxes for different kinds of fuels, they should be taxed according to a common standard. Each B.T.U., no matter what fuel it came from, would be taxed at the same rate.
Under this tax, the hardest hit would be coal, because its price per million B.T.U.'s is the lowest, around $1.50, so on a percentage basis, any fixed tax would add to coal's cost the most. The price of a million B.T.U.'s of natural gas varies by season but is generally around $2. The price of heavy oil, the kind most often in competition with gas and coal, varies sharply but recently has been around $2.50 per million B.T.U.'s.
By contrast, a B.T.U. tax would fall only lightly on the uranium used in nuclear power plants. Uranium, which is not priced by the B.T.U., in any case costs far less than fossil fuels. (Most of nuclear energy's costs come from capital and labor.)
A B.T.U. tax could also be applied to energy from windmills and hydroelectric plants. Currently the Energy Department measures the electric output of those plants and calculates how many B.T.U.'s would have been required to make that electricity from the average plant running on fossil fuels.
"A B.T.U. tax might be viewed as being regionally fairer" than a carbon tax, which would hit some fuels more than others, said Roger Dower, an energy expert at the World Resources Institute, a nonprofit group in Washington that advocates the use of taxes to achieve environmental goals. But Mr. Dower added that such a tax, while more politically palatable, is not aimed at the fuels that cause the most damage.
Some analysts say the tax would drive some users to oil from coal, therefore increasing reliance on oil imports. Also, a B.T.U. tax would discourage the use of not just fossil fuels but all energy, including environmentally benign "renewable" sources like wind, geothermal energy or wood from tree farms.
As measured in B.T.U.'s, about 40 percent of the energy consumed in this country comes from oil, 24 percent from natural gas, 23 percent from coal, 8 percent from nuclear power and 4 percent from hydroelectricity. If the tax were levied by energy content, those fuels would bear it in those proportions.
A variant of a B.T.U. tax would be a fixed tax on the price of all fuels -- say 5 percent. It would be just like a sales tax. This would exempt windmills, hydroelectric dams and geothermal energy, whose operators do not pay for fuel. Nuclear power would benefit, too, because uranium is very cheap, even if reactors are expensive.
 
The Carbon Tax
 Most environmentalists favor something more targeted: a tax on fuels in proportion to the amount of carbon dioxide their use creates. Carbon dioxide is implicated by scientists as the single most important gas in global warming. Among fossil fuels, natural gas produces the least carbon dioxide, oil is in the middle and coal produces the most. Hydroelectricity and nuclear power produce none; windmills, which are on the threshold of commercial success, and solar electric systems, which are a step behind wind, are also free of carbon dioxide. Vice President Gore, when he was a Senator, expressed support for a carbon tax.
"I think a carbon tax makes sense," said Dr. Harold M. Hubbard, now a fellow at the Hawaii Natural Energy Institute, who wrote an article in Scientific American two years ago that environmentalists hail as a landmark in explaining why energy should be taxed. "A carbon tax is probably the most politically acceptable and even-handed way," he said, pointing to the goals of reducing dependence on fossil fuels, moving to "sustainable" energy sources, and "spreading the misery over a broader base."
But some regions would suffer much more than others from a carbon tax. Almost 90 percent of the electricity in Ohio comes from coal. By contrast, about 90 percent of the electricity in Washington state is from hydroelectricity or nuclear power. That means the energy-intensive aluminum mills of the Pacific Northwest could continue almost unaffected by a carbon tax, while the farms and factories of the Midwest would face huge new costs.
Mr. Humphrey of the Edison Electric Institute said hypothetically that a tax of $100 per ton of carbon emitted by burning fuel would raise the price of a ton of coal by 230 percent, of oil by 65 percent, and of natural gas by 90 percent.
At most utility power plants a million B.T.U.'s turns into about 105 kilowatt-hours of electricity. This implies an increase of about 2.4 cents per kilowatt-hour from coal-burning plants on a national average price of electricity of about 7.5 cents -- a big blow to customers.
The tax would favor renewable energy sources and nuclear power over other sources. But John H. Lichtblau, chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, said the main effect would be to make coal less competitive against gas. "Most inter-fuels competition is in the electric sector, with coal and gas," he said.
Proposing a carbon tax would also create an instant nexus of opposition, from the coal industry and coal-state members of Congress. Environmentalists and tax experts refer to Robert C. Byrd, the West Virginia Democrat who is the President Pro Tem of the Senate, as if he were a force of nature when they describe how difficult it would be to enact a tax over his opposition.
 
The Oil-Import Fee
 Both a carbon tax and a B.T.U. tax would dampen demand for oil, but neither would do anything for domestic oil producers, which have lost nearly half a million jobs in 10 years and are now producing less oil than at any time since the early 1960's. The independent producers -- that is, those whose companies only produce oil, as opposed to refining or marketing it -- recently called for a fee of some kind on oil imports. Backed by some oil-patch members of Congress, this would amount to a more narrowly based energy tax.
On Thursday, J. Bennett Johnston, the Louisiana Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Energy Committee, said he would propose a floor price of $25 a barrel on oil imports. If the world price were lower, the Government would impose a tariff to effectively raise the price to $25.
But the United States has ratified a free trade agreement with Canada, one of this country's largest sources of oil, and has signed, if not ratified, a similar agreement with Mexico, another major producer. Washington would also like to avoid destabilizing Venezuela, a big source of imports, or offending an ally, Saudi Arabia.
An oil-import tax also has problems. For example, of the roughly 94 million housing units in this country, more than half, about 48 million, use natural gas, and only about 13 million use heating oil. Nearly all of those 13 million are in the Northeast.
Alternatively, Washington could propose a tax only on gasoline, said Jeffrey C. Genzer, the lawyer for the National Association of State Energy Officials. That would raise the ire of people in the West, who typically drive longer distances, but it would also upset state officials, who would see that increase as pre-empting future increases in state gasoline taxes.
In budget maneuvering last year, Congress shied away from a gasoline-tax increase of even 5 cents. Such a tax produces severe differences in impact by region and income. But in its favor, the price of gasoline is low now, which might make it more politically palatable.

HEADLINE: Making a Difference;
Up Against Icahn's Muscle

BYLINE: By VERONICA BYRD

 BODY:
THE chairman and chief executive of E-II Holdings Inc., Steven J. Green, says there is no challenge too daunting, but he's certainly being put to the test now.
First, E-II, the parent company of Samsonite luggage, Culligan water treatment equipment and McGregor men's wear, has been operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since July 1992. Those subsidiaries operate independently and are not directly affected by the bankruptcy. 
 More recently, the company came under attack by the financier Carl C. Icahn, who sought bankruptcy court permission to file a competing reorganization plan.
Mr. Icahn, who holds $220 million of E-II's junior bonds, said his plan, which the court rejected on Friday, would be better for bondholders. He also said he wanted to see Mr. Green removed as chairman.
Mr. Green, 47, said there were some encouraging signs of growth at the company.
When Mr. Green took the helm of E-II Holdings in December 1990, its senior bonds were trading at 22 cents on the dollar and its junior bonds were trading at 9 cents. As of Jan. 25, senior bonds were trading at $1.18 and juniors at 71 cents.
"What we decided to do was totally insulate the operating companies from the reorganization process," Mr. Green said. "Our goal was to globalize all the companies."
An aggressive advertising campaign abroad "stressed our product's quality for the money," Mr. Green said, and now 60 percent of Denver-based Samsonite's earnings come from Europe. The luggage maker also opened a travel shop in the GUM store in Moscow's Red Square. Botany 500 also opened a Moscow shop.
Darryl Schall, an analyst with Dabney/Resnick and Wagner Inc. in Los Angeles, which specializes in securities issued by troubled companies, said the company's expansion into Europe was a good move and described the restructuring roller coaster as "a saga" with several financial titans battling to control a solid company with solid potential.
He said the prospects for E-II "are very good, especially in light of an improving economy."

HEADLINE: Stanching the Loss of Good Jobs

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
THE layoff announcements come with painful regularity. Facing stiff competition and disappearing profits, corporate America has been throwing workers overboard, by the millions. Last week alone, four corporate giants announced that nearly 100,000 jobs -- most of them "good" ones, meaning full-time work with health and pension benefits -- would soon disappear. The Clinton Administration is debating measures that might slow the process. But what is really needed, nearly everyone agrees, is a wholesale reorganization of the way Americans work.
The reorganization, emphasizing worker training, flexibility and initiative, is hardly new. Some American companies have been trying for years to make the transformation. But now, with the job cutbacks showing no sign of easing off, the need to change is becoming more urgent. The hope among many public policy experts and executives is that jobs will somehow be saved if companies constantly train and retrain their workers, so that even the lowliest stock clerks learn new tasks while carrying out their old ones in an entrepreneurial and hustling spirit. 
 Recognizing the urgency, the National Association of Manufacturers called a news conference in Washington this month to campaign for change from the traditional system of designing jobs that demand little from most workers. "The best thing you, Mr. Employer, can say to your workers is, 'You are valuable, you are my most important asset and I am going to train you to within an inch of your life,' " said Phyllis Eisen, a senior policy director at the N.A.M.
Despite such talk, the "new" work ethic is not a panacea. Even if Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, United Technologies and Sears, Roebuck were fully committed to the new approach, they still would have announced job cutbacks last week, most experts say. But the total would probably have been much less than 100,000 -- perhaps only half that number.
"There is not a single magic bullet to save jobs," said Harley Shaiken, a labor economist at the University of California at San Diego. "But reorganizing work is one way to slow the cutbacks."
Making workers more efficient and entrepreneurial will not cure weak economic growth or overcapacity. Boeing, for example, is structured to make more planes than the airlines now want to buy. What's more, union leaders say the new system is an excuse, in some cases, for getting rid of seniority, work rules and even collective bargaining.
 
Making It Pay Off
 But when the new work ethic does succeed, the results can be eye-catching -- and job-saving. The money made from a worker's rising output can more than offset training expenses, high health insurance premiums and other costs -- and sometimes even defeat a competitor's low-wage operation in the third world.
That, at least, is the message from Christoph Schmid, president of Luk Inc., which makes clutch plates in Wooster, Ohio, for manual-shift cars. Luk managed to overtake the Borg-Warner Corporation, the market leader, which had shifted its production of plates to Brazil.
"They were counting on labor-cost savings, but we drove them out of the business in the United States," Mr. Schmid said. (Borg-Warner sold the Brazilian operation in 1990.)
Reaching for such successes and prodded by the Government to maintain jobs, a growing minority of American companies is trying to reorganize its offices and factories. Employees are encouraged to work in teams, learning to do many tasks, so that a machine operator can also repair machinery, a bank teller can fill in as a loan officer and an airline reservation clerk can push ticket sales by recommending a hotel and museum to visit on arrival. In the process, seniority and work rules are often discarded, along with many managers, since workers ideally govern themselves.
"We have rules and boundaries, but the boundaries can be quite broad for people who have enough information and background to operate on their own," said Richard Chandler, general manager of Motorola Inc.'s cellular products division in Arlington, Ill. He mentioned a production worker who became annoyed with defective parts for cellular telephones from an Atlanta supplier. She asked to fly to Atlanta and meet with the supplier. "I was nervous about it, but I let her go," Mr. Chandler said. The defects were corrected.
That sort of initiative and knowledge requires a difficult switch from the decades-old American practice of dividing work into simple, repetitive tasks carried out by workers who are never greatly respected by their bosses, or trusted to perform without being prodded and policed. More than 90 million people in a labor force of 124 million still fall into this category. So far, only 5 percent of the nation's 5 million companies have made the transition to the new way of working or are trying to do so, according to various surveys.
 
The Clinton Proposals
 Endorsing the transformation, the Clinton Administration is considering proposals that would encourage companies to hire and train -- proposals that the new Labor Secretary, Robert B. Reich, describes as carrots and sticks. One proposal is a tax credit that would reward companies for each employee hired beyond a certain base number. Another, according to Administration officials, would require companies to spend part of each dollar they receive in Federal research grants for employee training.
In a third approach, companies would be required to spend on training an amount equal to 1.5 percent of their payrolls, with the training spread among all workers. Currently, two-thirds of the $30 billion that companies now spend each year on training goes for college graduates -- although they make up only 25 percent of the labor force, according to the Labor Department.
Finally, Administration officials are reported to be considering an idea that Mr. Reich raised publicly before he became Labor Secretary this month. Corporations might be allowed to hold down base pay, but would be required to pay to all workers annual bonuses linked to profits -- a change intended to keep pay linked to earnings.
"Some companies are upgrading their workers and work practices on their own," Mr. Reich said in an interview, referring to such well-known examples as Motorola, Xerox and Corning. "But what we see across the landscape is that most American companies are not doing much."
The biggest obstacle is job security. Even a Motorola is reluctant to promise no layoffs, although so far Mr. Chandler, with more than 3,000 workers in the cellular division, has been able to cover periods of weak demand and falling production with such devices as mandatory vacations. "Only once did we send people home for a month without pay," Mr. Chandler said.
 
Worker's Perspective
 The problem is that workers are unwilling to go all out to increase their productivity only to find themselves jobless.
"To get that sort of commitment, the line worker has to be sure that he or she would not make a suggestion for some new efficiency that would put that person out of work the following day," said Dennis Cuneo, a vice president at New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., the General Motors-Toyota joint venture in Fremont, Calif., that is rated as perhaps the most efficient auto plant in the nation.
New United, famous for embracing the new approach to work and turning a G.M. factory that had failed into a huge success, agreed in 1984 to no layoffs -- except in the most dire straits, and then only after managers' pay is cut along with other expenses. "When you say management will take some of the pain, that makes a difference," Mr. Cuneo said.
The no-layoff agreement has been written into United Auto Workers contracts with New United. And in the late 1980's, when production did fall sharply, New United found itself with 300 idle workers, 10 percent of its employees. To keep them busy, they were rotated into four-week training programs, at full pay, until production picked up eight months later.
The state government in California subsidized some of the cost, justifying the outlay with the argument that unemployment pay would have been more expensive. But if the slowdown had lasted a few more months, even New United might have resorted to layoffs and attrition, Mr. Cuneo said.
Republic Engineered Steel, having been purchased by its employees and managers in 1989 from the failing LTV Corporation, takes a different tack. Pressed lately to come up with $80 million a year in savings to remain solvent, the employee-controlled board eschewed layoffs but asked the company's 5,000 workers for cost-cutting proposals. One thousand ideas came in, each one reviewed by a committee of managers and representatives of the United Steel Workers union.
So far, $63 million in annual savings have been implemented, none of which involve cutting staff, said Harold Kelley, a company vice president. One such step, for example, recycles water used as a coolant in the casting of steel bars from melted scrap.
 
Necessary Bleeding
 But such tactics are not always sufficient without some layoffs. Overwhelmed by Japanese competitors, Xerox first shrank its staff by 20,000 in the early 1980's to get rid of excess capacity, and then proceeded to reorganize jobs and retrain the employees who remained. So did Corning. And now I.B.M., Sears and General Motors are similarly shrinking their operations, having become stuck with too much capacity and too many people for their declining sales -- no matter how well trained or motivated these workers might be.
"The ethos of job security dies quickly in the onslaught from I.B.M. and General Motors," said David Wyss, chief economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill.
More subtly, the new work practices assume that workers can be trained -- even if the company has to start by teaching them basic math and reading -- and then will bring energy and initiative to their jobs. That is not always the reality.
At German-owned Luk, the manufacturer of clutch plates, Mr. Schmid, the president, transplanted some German work practices, trying to get his 340 employees to constantly search for ways to improve output and quality.
Several workers, for example, figured out that robots that were moving clutch plates from one station to another for different steps in the manufacturing process could not do the job as quickly and efficiently as a special conveyor belt that these workers then helped to design.
For these entrepreneurs, jobs are guaranteed, Mr. Schmid said. But that is not the case for the "person who only runs a machine and comes up with no ideas and no suggestions for improvement. That person does not have the same job security, and a good number of them are pushed out and replaced each year."
There are losers, then, in the new world of work, people who find themselves unable to adapt to the faster pace. That has drawn criticism from union leaders. "You have this meritocracy, and what people overlook is that a meritocratic system tends to favor younger, energetic workers," said Leslie Nulty of the United Food and Commercial Workers. "You can't run a society where older people cannot make a living."
But the alternative is to remain locked into a work tradition rooted in America's prowess at developing mass production technologies earlier in this century. For 75 percent of the labor force, work is still largely divided into simple, repetitive tasks.
The problem is that, increasingly, automated machinery, computers and robots can do these simple tasks. And so can workers in third world countries, at much lower wages, whether the task is assembling a motor or taking airline reservations by phone. Sticking with old work habits makes the labor force endlessly vulnerable to layoffs, lower wages, part-time work and fewer benefits as work is automated or shifted overseas.
Reflecting these forces, full-time employment among the nation's jobholders, after rising through most of the 1980's, has remained unchanged since 1989 at 60 percent. Wages have stagnated or fallen for 80 percent of American households.
To generate jobs, the nation has traditionally relied on two developments, neither of which is providing much assistance now. One lifesaver would be a dramatic new product, based on new American technology, that would be manufactured initially in American factories. The computer industry grew from such a breakthrough, but another is not in sight.
The other fallback is strong economic growth, so strong that consumer demand for goods and services keeps companies operating at full capacity despite the competition from abroad and however inefficiently work is organized. But the American economy remains weak.
 
The 3M Experience

Indeed, even a company like 3M, which is among the most deeply involved in the new work practices, is feeling the pinch these days.
For more than a decade, 3M has maintained domestic employment at 50,000. Layoffs are unknown and when some of 3M's 60,000 products, most of them different types of tapes, experience a sales downturn, people are shifted to the manufacture and distribution of those that are selling well. In exchange for this job security, workers have played a big role in finding ways to increase their average output by 8 percent a year, says Richard Lidstad, vice president for human resources.
The problem is that since 1989, sales have failed to keep up with the growth in the company's production capacity. Instead of sales gains of 8 percent or more a year -- the norm in the 1980's -- 3M is experiencing gains of 5 percent or less.
"The goodwill of a work force is very important to productivity," Mr. Lidstad said. "But if the 5 percent sales growth persists, we could have a problem. I suppose we would have to shrink the work force through attrition. We would go to great lengths to avoid layoffs."
 
 
 
WHEN JOB GROWTH IS A ZERO-SUM GAME

WEAK as the economy is, BancOne, headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, has been going against the grain of corporate America, adding workers instead of shedding them. But like many other thriving companies, BancOne has not added much to total employment in the United States.
Since 1987, BancOne's payroll has risen to 43,000, from 20,000. Much of this growth, however, has come from acquiring community banks in 11 states, along with their employees, or serving the customers of failed savings and loan associations, and sometimes hiring an S.& L.'s employees.
What new jobs there are come mostly from extending banking hours -- some branches are now open on Sundays, for example -- or adding services that a local bank had not offered in the past.
"If you buy a small bank, they often do not have a car leasing or mortgage operation, so we put the people in there to do these tasks," said the chairman of BancOne, John B. McCoy.
Job training plays only a small role in motivating or improving the skills of this growing work force. Ironically, Mr. McCoy counts on turnover -- 10 percent of BancOne's employees on average leave each year -- to motivate those who remain.
"Some turnover is healthy," Mr. McCoy said. "What it really does is allow the people to move up in the company. People can say to themselves, 'I can get a better job just by staying at BancOne.' "
There isn't much turnover in upper management, but Mr. McCoy has solved that problem, so far, through expansion: newly acquired banks need chief executives.
BancOne's chief financial officer, for example, is about to move up to the presidency of a major new operation in Arizona, and the president of a Wisconsin bank is transferring to Columbus to be chief financial officer.
"These are powerful promotions," Mr. McCoy said.
But how does BancOne generate the turnover?
Well, 20 percent of BancOne's employees work part-time, and their ties to the company are tenuous. College students are hired, mostly to work late shifts, and they leave after graduation. And BancOne's tellers earn only $17,000 to $18,000 a year.
"I am not sure many people retire as tellers," Mr. McCoy said.

HEADLINE: It's Not Just How Well You Play the Game . . .

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
The DALLAS COWBOYS, playing in the Super Bowl today, have always liked to promote themselves as America's Team. Winning Super Bowl XII in 1979 took them one step further, to America's sports merchandiser. For the next six years the Cowboys sold more sweat shirts, T-shirts, hats, coffee mugs and other paraphernalia than any other team in professional sports.
At one point, sales of goods decorated with the Cowboys' distinctive star accounted for 30 percent of the National Football League's merchandise sales. 
 But the world of sports merchandising is changing dramatically. In recent years, as it has grown into a business with more than $12 billion in sales, teams that win a championship are no longer guaranteed first place at the cash register in a clothing store.
Consider the Colorado Rockies, a baseball team that will not even play its first game until next season. Yet in 1992 the Rockies sold more merchandise than the Mets, Dodgers, the world champion Toronto Blue Jays and many other teams. Indeed, only the Chicago White Sox, Atlanta Braves and New York Yankees outsold the Rockies.
Or consider the San Jose Sharks. Last year, their first season in the National Hockey League, they performed dismally -- and sold more merchandise, $150 million worth, than any team in professional sports except the Chicago Bulls, which sold $300 million in goods as they won their second consecutive basketball championship.
How could this be?
The reason, merchandising experts say, is that the color, design and quality of goods have become more important to sales than fan loyalty or game success. Sports merchandise, if not quite high fashion, is fashion nonetheless.
"Although sports has become more a part of our popular culture, people are buying these sports clothes mainly because they like the way they look," said Karen Raugust, editor of the Licensing Letter, a trade publication based in Brooklyn. "It's become a fad. A lot of these folks are wearing T-shirts, and they don't even know what sport the team plays."
The Sharks -- were they lucky or shrewd? -- chose teal, a very hot color last year, to go with black and silver as the team colors. Their logo is a racy shark biting a hockey stick in two (some hockey fans have noted that a broken stick is a perfect metaphor for the Sharks' performance on ice). The Rockies' colors are black, silver and purple, their logo a baseball soaring to a Rocky Mountain high.
And the Chicago White Sox jumped from back in the pack to lead all baseball teams in merchandise sales after it changed the team colors to silver and black. It's a hot combination: the best-selling football team, the Los Angeles Raiders, and the second-best-selling hockey team, the Los Angeles Kings, also wear silver and black.
"Teams are switching their colors and uniforms in order to become more appealing to the fans and to sell more merchandise, and that's something that has never happened before in the history of professional sports," said Richard White, president of Major League Baseball Properties.
"A few years ago, merchandising had little impact economically on the leagues," he added. "But now there is no owner who does not recognize that these products have a very substantial impact on their bottom line."
And how. In some cases, merchandising accounts for as much as 10 percent of a team's profits, Mr. White said.
Sales of all sports merchandise -- not just team-name goods from the major pro sports but also products from the Olympics, professional wrestling, automobile racing and other sports -- increased 9 percent last year to $12.1 billion, from $11.1 billion in 1991, and 66 percent in the last five years, from $7.3 billion in 1987.
The boom was made possible, in part, by the public's greater appetite for casual wear; a generation of children now go to school in sweat shirts and sweat pants. And sales were vigorously pushed along by a determined marketing effort by the four major professional sports.
In each league, the proceeds of all team merchandise sales are pooled and divided equally among the teams -- an approach that the teams in smaller markets would love to extend to broadcasting rights, and that the wealthier teams steadfastly oppose.
Ms. Raugust said the National Football League, Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League have all increased both the number of products they offer and the number of distribution channels.
In all four professional leagues, merchandising is coordinated by a central properties division that licenses hundreds of manufacturers to produce thousands of products, including hats, shirts, jackets, balls, uniforms, shoes, bags, watches, telephones and videos. The leagues now offer clothing lines designed specifically for women, men and children, right down to sleepers for newborns, embossed with a team logo.
"We try to make items that people will wear every day," said John Bello, president of National Football League Properties. "We spend a lot of time in Europe looking at the latest fashions and then we try to incorporate them into our sports gear."
As a result of this hard work, Mr. Bello estimates, about 67 percent of American households have at least one item bearing an N.F.L. logo.
The N.F.L. sold about $2.1 billion in licensed merchandise last year, Major League Baseball about $2.4 billion. Sales of basketball merchandise have been growing the most quickly of any of the major sports and reached $1.4 billion last year, while the National Hockey League lags (as it does in fans and broadcast revenue), with merchandise sales of about $600 million.
The major leagues aside, many minor league teams also sell merchandise vigorously, albeit on a much smaller scale. And the market for college sports merchandising is also huge, an estimated $1.5 billion last year.
Mr. Bello said all the professional leagues have expanded not just what they sell, but how it is sold.
Once largely available only at concession stands at ballparks and coliseums, and at sports equipment shops, team merchandise is now sold in many clothing stores and most department stores. Teams develop mailing lists of season ticketholders and anyone who orders tickets by mail, and sends merchandise catalogues to fans' homes. And some leagues are making plans to market goods through home television shopping.
Even if the teams that do particularly well in selling licensed merchandise must share their profits with laggards, intangible benefits accrue, like national name recognition and even influence within the league. The National Hockey League has agreed, for example, to let San Jose host the All-Star Game in 1995.
And with the wide disparity in sales among teams in the same league -- precise totals are not available, because the leagues will provide only rankings of sales, and not the actual numbers -- some of the most successful merchandising teams are now proposing to end the sharing of their profits.
If ticket sales are confined, as a matter of course, to fans within easy reach of a team, the demand for merchandise of new teams and lesser-known teams extends nationwide, and indeed, overseas, executives of professional teams and leagues say. That, too, is a sharp contrast to the past.
The next major market for sports merchandising may well be overseas. All the major leagues have been cultivating foreign audiences, playing exhibition games in Europe and Japan.
Broadcast of games and highlight shows abound, and many of the biggest North American sports stars are already well known overseas. This provides a ready market for merchandising.
And league executives are already exploring Australia, South America and other parts of Asia, where sport is immensely popular and other American exports, like music and videos, have done very well.
 
COLLEGES BENEFIT FROM FASHION
BENEFITING from growing public demand for sports merchandise, colleges and universities have experienced a boom in sales of products bearing their logos.
The Collegiate Licensing Company, which coordinates licensing agreements for 126 colleges and universities, said that college merchandising has been growing at about 25 percent to 30 percent a year and reached $1.5 billion in sales last year.
That's good news, say college and university officials who are facing severe budget cuts and seeking new sources of revenue. The officials declined to disclose specific sales figures, but the top-selling schools acknowledge that they have surpassed $1 million in annual merchandise revenues.
Unlike professional sports merchandisers, colleges and universities have done little to capture new sales. In most cases, retailers have approached the schools seeking to put their names and logos on products.
"Most college logos and colors date back many, many decades, and the schools are reluctant to change them," said Barbara Bailey, director of marketing for Collegiate Licensing. "Success in college merchandising is tied mainly to how well the teams play and also to the public's perception of the institution."
Brian McGuire, assistant athletic director for promotions for Georgetown University, Collegiate Licensing's top seller, attributes the school's success to its popularity as "a strong academic institution that is also good at sports." However, Mr. McGuire said that the school's recent surge in sales might have something to do with the fact that President Clinton is an alumnus and frequently wears Georgetown sweat shirts while jogging.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
Those Wacky Little Stocks Abroad 

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
COLLECTING oddball little stocks from around the world has catapulted the Acorn International Fund into first place among overseas stock funds, at least for the few short months since its startup. Acorn soared 8.5 percent from Sept. 23 through Jan. 22 compared with a 0.7 percent gain for its peers, according to Morningstar Inc., the mutual fund researchers in Chicago.
Its offbeat strategy may make Acorn a good bet for the long haul, said John Rekenthaler, editor of the investment newsletter Morningstar Mutual Funds. But the double risks of currency shifts and small-stock investing suggest the fund is not for everyone. 
 With just $39 million in assets so far, Acorn International is an offshoot of the $1.45 billion Acorn Fund, both managed by Chicago-based Wanger Asset Management. The original Acorn, a small-stock fund begun in 1970 by Ralph Wanger and still run by him, returned 17.3 percent a year compared with 12.4 percent for the average small-stock fund in the decade ended Dec. 31, 1992.
Acorn International's co-managers are Leah Zell and Gary Greenberg.
Ms. Zell arrived at the Acorn Fund in 1984 via Harvard University, where she earned a doctorate in economic history in 1979, and Lehman Brothers, where she had a position in corporate finance. She and Mr. Wanger were married in 1985.
Mr. Greenberg also specialized in corporate finance, after earning a graduate degree in international management from the American Graduate School of International Management (known as the Thunderbird School) in Arizona in 1985. He worked first at Continental Bank, then at Vickers da Costa, international brokers based in New York. He went to the Acorn Fund in early 1989.
Since the mid-80's, Acorn senior has invested about one-quarter of its assets overseas. Acorn junior was set up partly because the original Acorn was closed to new investors in 1990 and partly for people seeking more overseas exposure, said Mr. Wanger.
One of the three analysts working on Acorn International (Marcel Houtzager assists the two co-managers) hits the road every six weeks to scour the world for what Ms. Zell calls "wacky little stocks" -- under-researched or misunderstood growth companies, preferably with a solid market niche.
They look for companies with market capitalizations of $200 million to $750 million, using "growth at a reasonable price" as a yardstick, giving them more of a growth focus than Acorn senior. Research takes a three-pronged approach: selecting a country, then an industry, then the companies.
Right now, 30 percent of the Acorn International portfolio is in Southeast Asia (excluding Japan), and 28 percent in Europe. Seven percent each is invested in Latin America and Japan, with the balance mostly in Canada, Australia, Israel and Korea.
Europe is good now, Ms. Zell said, because while the economies are weak, "interest rates are clearly on the downtrend and that usually means healthy markets." The two-year recession there has narrowed the spread in prices between high-quality and lower-quality companies, letting the fund pick up solid companies at much lower prices than similar firms would command in the United States. Two favorites: Guilbert, France's premier supplier of office products, and Telegraaf, a Dutch newspaper company with dominant market share, excess cash and a state-of-the-art printing plant.
The managers hedge European holdings by owning exporters in dollar-sensitive markets like Scandinavia, which are expected to do well as the American dollar strengthens over the next year or so. One favorite is Huhtamaki, the Finnish company that produces Milk Duds, Heath bars and Norplant, the controversial new implant contraceptive. Also, they hedge European currencies to reduce risks from a rising dollar.
Growth in Southeast Asia is being helped along by growth in China, the managers said. Acorn owns shares in Tigaraska, an Indonesian distributor of Johnson & Johnson products like Band-Aids, and in Cafe de Coral, a Hong Kong company with a chain of fast-food restaurants (fried chicken feet, corn on the cob and a Coca-Cola costs $2.50) that is moving into the South China market.
Acorn likes Mexico because of its market liberalization, falling interest rates and restrained inflation. The fund owns shares in Grupo Herdez, which produces enough mole sauce and mayonnaise to capture most of the Mexican bottled condiments business; the company has had a joint venture with American spice producer McCormick since 1947.
Other holdings include Teva, an Israeli generic drug company, and Affymax, a Dutch biotechnology firm.
The new Acorn fund is not for the faint-hearted, venturing as it does into far-flung companies that most investors probably never heard of. One way its managers minimize risk is by diversifying broadly. Six industries account for roughly 9 percent each of the fund -- drugs, publishing, financial services, leisure, food and retail -- while another four hold 20 percent more.
Leisure is an important theme based on the rising standard of living worldwide. The fund owns shares in several gaming companies in Malaysia, and in Sega, a Japanese video game maker whose next big product is a line of virtual reality helmets for children. Another favorite: Costa, an Italian cruise ship company.

HEADLINE: All About/Commercial Real Estate;
It's the Business Tenant Who's Calling the Shots

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
LOTS of people are talking about an uptick in business these days. Those people are not in commercial real estate.
The industry's motto of the early 90's -- "stay alive 'til '95" -- has deteriorated to "find something to do 'til 2002." 
 The lingering effects of the recession, combined with the unrelenting pace of corporate cutbacks, have continued to pummel the commercial real estate industry. Office vacancy rates are at all-time highs, while rents are stuck in the gutter.
"We won't see thriving markets any time soon," said James S. Vanderslice, managing director of Cushman & Wakefield, an international real estate services firm.
 
New Negotiating Style
Any Concession May Be on the Table
 The effect of the slump has been a turnabout in how business is done. While it is a terrible time to own an office building, it is a terrific time to be a corporate tenant.
"Tenants have evened the playing field," said Julian J. Studley, chairman of the New York real estate firm that bears his name. Alvin I. Apfelberg, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, is even more bullish: "There is a nationwide renaissance of tenant strength."
Stores and small companies that once looked longingly at Park Avenue or Rodeo Drive now find them within reach. Brokers, traditionally paid commissions as a percentage of rent, are accepting fees that give them more incentive to strike hard bargains. And auditors are making sure that landlords no longer play fast and loose with negotiated yearly rent increases.
Tenants are using their new sense of power in many ways: negotiating liberal sublease clauses; obtaining more generous allowances for customizing their spaces, securing many months of free rent and gaining other concessions that, in better times, landlords would have laughed at. In fact, tenants are changing the nature of real estate negotiations in ways that, even when the economy recovers, may never change back.
"Corporate real estate departments are looking at every aspect of every lease, seeking ways to save money," said Peter Santora, director of Arthur Andersen's corporate real estate group in southern California. "And, they are finding them."
Take the International Business Machines Corporation, which as recently as 1988 either owned or rented 118 million square feet in the country. That has shrunk to less than 107 million square feet, and is still going down.
Beyond adding to the already bloated inventory of office space, I.B.M. is eking out savings in its remaining space. It has been auditing the annual escalation charges in its leases and dunning landlords for rebates. It has insisted its brokers settle for flat fees based on the amount of space rented. And it has consolidated as many divisions as possible into I.B.M.-owned space.
Hughes Aircraft is cutting 750 people from its corporate staff in Los Angeles and moving the remaining 500 from its headquarters overlooking the Pacific Ocean. The military contractor is seeking to lease the building's 550,000 square feet of office space.
Companies that are expanding, meanwhile, are wringing huge bonuses from financially strapped landlords. Landlords historically provided a lot of money to new tenants so they could customize office space before they moved in. Now a growing number of tenants are taking the space as is, in return for "low rent and extra months of free rent," said Edward Goldman, a managing director with Edward S. Gordon.
Cash is not always the issue. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, the big New York law firm, recently rented seven floors of as-is space in Black Rock, the CBS corporate headquarters on West 52d Street.
Not only was the law firm able to negotiate rent down to the low $30's a square foot from the high $30's, it persuaded CBS to release the partners from any personal liability should the firm stop paying its rent. Wachtell, Lipton won't talk, but many real estate brokers say that was the make-or-break point on the deal.
Time was, corporate leases were just a dozen pages, mainly boilerplate. Today, with sublease clauses and contingencies for foreclosures, they look like the unedited version of "War and Peace."
"Landlords, tenants, sublessees, banks, just about everyone wants to make sure they're covered on all possible problems," said Christopher F. Graham, a partner with the Manhattan law firm of Thacher, Proffitt & Wood.
Modern leases are likely to include clauses on who is responsible for removing asbestos or for making the premises accessible to people with disabilities.
Landlords, clinging to some semblance of control, are demanding codicils restricting subletting. "Sophisticated landlords are now insisting that tenants not sublease to anyone with a lower credit rating than their own," said Paul Rennert of Rennert, Diana Real Estate in Union, N.J.
 
Nonprofit Competitors Even Churches Eye
The Added Revenue
Last year, Chase Manhattan's tellers went to church together. Hundreds of high school students taking S.A.T. preparation classes went to temple. Primerica's shareholders, meanwhile, got to play Carnegie Hall, the site of their company's annual meeting.
"We're not just a concert hall anymore," said Bret Silver, Carnegie Hall's manager of event-sales. "We want to be thought of as a venue, a facility."
Many nonprofit organizations are renting out space -- often competing with for-profit operations in ways that have them skirting dangerously close to violating tax rules on unrelated business income.
It's a nondenominational problem. Ralph M. Birnberg, administrator of Temple Beth El in Hollywood, Fla., noted that more than half the people he spoke to at a recent convention of synagogue administrators complained of huge deficits. "Those that have decent space are viewing it as a wonderful source of income," he said.
Some churches are positively unabashed in their approach. The Universalist Church on Central Park West has a "space available" sign right between its front doors, with a number to call. And, it has a full time marketing director, Fred Seidler, whose sole job is to find rental business.
Apparently, he's been doing the job quite well. Receptions and events, like Chase Manhattan Bank's Teller Appreciation Night last fall, have grown more common.
All told, rentals -- which average $2,500 for weekend events, $1,000 for weekdays -- accounted for more than 85 percent of the church's $460,000 operating budget last year.
 
 
 
A MARKET TOO TIGHT FOR SNOBBERY
 THROUGHOUT the 1970's mid-price stores like Toy City or discounters like Kmart stayed out of New York. The market was too chancy, the rents too rich, the landlords too snooty to welcome a discounter.
Now they're humming "I Love New York."
"This is the best retail real estate market tenants have faced in 25 years," said Charles Aug, president of Garrick-Aug Worldwide, a huge Manhattan-based retail real estate broker.
While the movement of new stores is clearly visible in Long Island and other nearby suburbs, and in Queens, a walk down some of Manhattan's premier shopping streets really tells the tale. Eddie Bauer, known mainly as a mail-order clothing and sporting goods company, has opened shops on 58th Street and Madison Avenue and 45th Street and Third Avenue. The Innovation Luggage discount chain has a store at 43d Street and Fifth Avenue, in space where Nynex once sold computers.
Cosmetics Plus, a discount shop, is on 57th Street, opposite Carnegie Hall. Barnes & Noble used to be there -- also a discount store, true, but one that sold culture so, in the salad days, slipped in as snottily acceptable.
Even co-ops are lowering their standards. Shareholders who once balked at restaurants or any other business that might generate smells now woo them.
"Co-ops used to want only high-image stores," said Neil Kreisel, president of the Kreisel Company, which manages co-ops and condominiums in New York. "Now they'll live with a cheese store and bags of garbage outside, as long as it generates revenues."

Meeting Challenges With Inward-Looking Focus

BYLINE: By Peter H. Lewis

 BODY:
AST Research Inc. originally made memory and multifunction expansion boards for early I.B.M. personal computers. Now, it clearly has momentum in a fiercely competitive market. As president and chief executive, Safi Qureshey (pronounced KRESH-ee) has presided over such innovations as upgradable PC's, 24-hour computer bulletin board and facsimile customer support, and a segmented product line, ideas that have since been adopted by I.B.M., Apple, Compaq, Dell and others.
Question: Your company is in the top 10 in PC makers and is gaining market share. Why are you successful when so many others have slipped? 
 Answer: It's a matter of focus. No company can do well unless it has a full-time focus. You cannot participate in this business part time. We, along with a few other companies, try not to distract ourselves by going into areas that may look very tempting but that could dilute our resources.
Q: But your new Manhattan multiprocessor system, a powerful network server, broadens your focus, doesn't it?
A: The core technology is derived from our efforts in desktop and notebook computers. I call it complementary expansion. We took the time to do it right. Compaq came out with its multiprocessing machine almost three years ago, and people were asking when we were going to do one. Now the time is right.
Q: What's your biggest challenge?
A: It's internal. As I look outside I see tremendous competition, technology changes, companies going out of business. But the confidence I have is that there's a very large market for personal computers and it is growing, despite the recession and other issues. As we go from just less than $1 billion in sales last fiscal year to more than $1 billion, with the price compression we are producing 60 to 70 percent more computers today than we did last year. The challenge is, how do we create a management infrastructure that can continue to be flexible and responsive as we continue to grow?
Q: What's your growth rate?
A: The industry grew 8, 9, 10, 11 percent last year; I don't know the exact number. We grew close to 40 percent.
Q: How do you keep up with customer support?
A: We have been adding service capabilities. One example: We realized that if we upgraded all the computers that our service technicians use, from 386 to 486, we could cut about 15 to 20 seconds off the time it took to get the right information to the customer. Yeah, it was an added expense, but just the savings on the telephone line was worth it.

A Fizzle in the Overseas Sizzle

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
THE good, albeit short, track record of Acorn International flies in the face of the recent experience of most overseas investors. The Morgan Stanley Capital EAFE Index, a proxy for the stock markets in Europe, Asia and the Far East, has gained just 1.3 percent a year, on average, in the last five years compared with 16 percent jumps in the Standard & Poor's 500 index.
The EAFE index is heavily skewed toward Europe and Japan, and the disappointing results mainly reflect the recessions in those regions. But many analysts assert that economic cycles in those regions lag the United States and so should soon be ready to turn. 
 Investing overseas has produced profits over the long term, so the recent poor performance of international funds should be seen as an aberration, even as a signal to move money into those markets while they are still near their lows, said John Rekenthaler, editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds in Chicago.

Paradox for Windows: Worth the Wait?

BYLINE: By Peter H. Lewis

 BODY:
BORLAND International Inc. is finally ready to begin selling Paradox for Windows, its long-awaited data-base management program. As an introductory offer for at least the next 90 days, Borland is charging $139.95 for Paradox for Windows, more than 80 percent off its list price of $795.
Paradox for Windows was expected to be delivered last year, but businesses that have been waiting for a powerful and elegant Windows data base may well find the wait worth it. Initial testers say the program appears to be superior to other Windows data bases for ease of use, the ability to work with other data-base formats on a network and for application development. 
 But if that is good news for Borland, it comes late in the day. The Paradox problem and an even more frustrating delay with Borland's Quattro Pro for Windows spreadsheet have cost the company dearly. Once a darling of Wall Street, Borland stock has been hammered in recent months and the company recently laid off 15 percent of its work force.
The delay for Paradox was especially damaging because in the interim the Microsoft Corporation was able to rush its Access for Windows data base to market, at a special introductory price of $99. Microsoft's $99 promotion is scheduled to expire on Monday, with Access reverting to its list price of $495. But Borland's entry may extend the discount -- and Microsoft has far deeper pockets.
"It's break point for Borland," said Stuart D. Woodring, director of software strategy research for Forrester Research, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass. "The delays made it difficult for Borland to compete in the face of the huge user migration to Windows, and Borland was sorely hurt when Microsoft came out with Access."
In this fierce battle, Borland has the two most popular DOS programs, Paradox and dBASE, while Microsoft has Access and Fox Base. (No other company is a significant player in this market.)
Microsoft's bold pricing guaranteed that Access would get in the door, and forced Borland to similar bargain-basement levels. Microsoft has reportedly sold several hundred thousand copies of Access since November, a phenomenal rate, but software analysts say they cannot tell whether businesses are buying it for evaluation (in which case it becomes "shelfware") or whether they are incorporating it into day-to-day activities.
With the broad shift in corporate desktop computing to Microsoft Windows as a de facto operating system, many companies will be more willing to make a major change in data base programs. As long as they have to change applications anyway, to take advantage of Windows, they might as well examine new data base engines.
A company that has relied on the DOS version of Paradox will probably move to its Windows version, but Borland cannot take customer loyalty for granted. The Lotus Development Corporation's Lotus 1-2-3 for Windows, for example, has not been nearly as successful as its DOS versions were; the Wordperfect Corporation dominated the DOS word processing category but has not repeated its success under Windows.
A company's decision to change data-base managers is certainly not taken lightly. Data-base managers are perhaps the most important business application, since they provide the framework and tools for organizing a company's most important information. Accordingly, the reliability of a data base is of paramount importance.
Companies have little tolerance, and rightly so, for software bugs that can cause the corruption or loss of data, and Microsoft's Access 1.0 has been criticized by many early users for problems that can cause system crashes and data loss. Borland officials say they delayed releasing Paradox for Windows until they were sure it was bug-free. But savvy computer users know they should always be cautious with any software designated version 1.0.
A powerful data base like Paradox serves several functions. At the simplest level, it stores records of customers, orders, sales, personnel, inventory and other vital information, and provides a way for users to sift, sort, enter, view and print the data. Most simple Windows data bases can do that.
What sets Paradox and its competitors apart from the low-end programs is built-in programming language, which can be used to craft custom business applications, including on-screen forms and special report generators. Most businesses need the flexibility that programmable data bases offer, since they would rather tailor the software to the way they do business than change the way they do business to match the software.
It is also critical for a data base to be able to work with all the data in a company's computer system, whether the information resides in the user's computer, in a departmental server or in a mainframe somewhere else in the company.
Paradox for Windows has a data-access technology called an Interbase Engine, which can grab data from Paradox, dBASE and other files within Paradox for Windows, and allows the user to view information in a variety of formats. However Borland has not released the software "drivers" that many customers need to gain access to any data in their systems. By midyear, the company says, it will have the ability to connect to Interbase, Oracle, Microsoft Sybase, SQL and DB2 formats.
Paradox for Windows also rises above its competitors by virtue of its use of object-oriented technology. Simply put, each facet of the data-base screen, including graphs, buttons, boxes, forms, fields and so on, is a separate object with its own distinct abilities. And those objects can be used again and again in other projects.
Paradox for Windows "has one of the better front ends I've seen, as far as creating forms," said Cliff Emrich, a programmer at Southern California Edison's San Onofre nuclear power plant in San Clemente, who has been working with preliminary versions of the program for what he said "seems like years."
Using Borland's ObjectPAL programming application language, programmers can concoct Windows data-base applications with relative ease, including complex routines that draw data from a variety of sources.
For people who write software, "it is extremely powerful and offers a lot of features that others don't have," said a programmer for a large health-care company in New York. He added, "The object-orientation makes developing your second application much easier because of the re-useability."
Paradox for Windows certainly isn't perfect, the programmer added. "The big problem is that it's slow. It does seem to be very demanding of memory."

HEADLINE: The Word Police

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
THIS month's inaugural festivities, with their celebration, in Maya Angelou's words, of "humankind" -- "the Asian, the Hispanic, the Jew/ The African, the Native American, the Sioux,/ The Catholic, the Muslim, the French, the Greek/ The Irish, the Rabbi, the Priest, the Sheik,/ The Gay, the Straight, the Preacher,/ The privileged, the homeless, the Teacher" -- constituted a kind of official embrace of multiculturalism and a new politics of inclusion.
The mood of political correctness, however, has already made firm inroads into popular culture. Washington boasts a store called Politically Correct that sells pro-whale, anti-meat, ban-the-bomb T-shirts, bumper stickers and buttons, as well as a local cable television show called "Politically Correct Cooking" that features interviews in the kitchen with representatives from groups like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. 
 The Coppertone suntan lotion people are planning to give their longtime cover girl, Little Miss (Ms?) Coppertone, a male equivalent, Little Mr. Coppertone. And even Superman (Superperson?) is rumored to be returning this spring, reincarnated as four ethnically diverse clones: an African-American, an Asian, a Caucasian and a Latino.
Nowhere is this P.C. mood more striking than in the increasingly noisy debate over language that has moved from university campuses to the country at large -- a development that both underscores Americans' puritannical zeal for reform and their unwavering faith in the talismanic power of words.
Certainly no decent person can quarrel with the underlying impulse behind political correctness: a vision of a more just, inclusive society in which racism, sexism and prejudice of all sorts have been erased. But the methods and fervor of the self-appointed language police can lead to a rigid orthodoxy -- and unintentional self-parody -- opening the movement to the scorn of conservative opponents and the mockery of cartoonists and late-night television hosts.
It's hard to imagine women earning points for political correctness by saying "ovarimony" instead of "testimony" -- as one participant at the recent Modern Language Association convention was overheard to suggest. It's equally hard to imagine people wanting to flaunt their lack of prejudice by giving up such words and phrases as "bull market," "kaiser roll," "Lazy Susan," and "charley horse."
Several books on bias-free language have already appeared, and the 1991 edition of the Random House Webster's College Dictionary boasts an appendix titled "Avoiding Sexist Language." The dictionary also includes such linguistic mutations as "womyn" (women, "used as an alternative spelling to avoid the suggestion of sexism perceived in the sequence m-e-n") and "waitron" (a gender-blind term for waiter or waitress).
Many of these dictionaries and guides not only warn the reader against offensive racial and sexual slurs, but also try to establish and enforce a whole new set of usage rules. Take, for instance, "The Bias-Free Word Finder, a Dictionary of Nondiscriminatory Language" by Rosalie Maggio (Beacon Press) -- a volume often indistinguishable, in its meticulous solemnity, from the tongue-in-cheek "Official Politically Correct Dictionary and Handbook" put out last year by Henry Beard and Christopher Cerf (Villard Books). Ms. Maggio's book supplies the reader intent on using kinder, gentler language with writing guidelines as well as a detailed listing of more than 5,000 "biased words and phrases."
Whom are these guidelines for? Somehow one has a tough time picturing them replacing "Fowler's Modern English Usage" in the classroom, or being adopted by the average man (sorry, individual) in the street.
The "pseudogeneric 'he,' " we learn from Ms. Maggio, is to be avoided like the plague, as is the use of the word "man" to refer to humanity. "Fellow," "king," "lord" and "master" are bad because they're "male-oriented words," and "king," "lord" and "master" are especially bad because they're also "hierarchical, dominator society terms." The politically correct lion becomes the "monarch of the jungle," new-age children play "someone on the top of the heap," and the "Mona Lisa" goes down in history as Leonardo's "acme of perfection."
As for the word "black," Ms. Maggio says it should be excised from terms with a negative spin: she recommends substituting words like "mouse" for "black eye," "ostracize" for "blackball," "payola" for "blackmail" and "outcast" for "black sheep." Clearly, some of these substitutions work better than others: somehow the "sinister humor" of Kurt Vonnegut or "Saturday Night Live" doesn't quite make it; nor does the "denouncing" of the Hollywood 10.
For the dedicated user of politically correct language, all these rules can make for some messy moral dilemmas. Whereas "battered wife" is a gender-biased term, the gender-free term "battered spouse," Ms. Maggio notes, incorrectly implies "that men and women are equally battered."
On one hand, say Francine Wattman Frank and Paula A. Treichler in their book "Language, Gender, and Professional Writing" (Modern Language Association), "he or she" is an appropriate construction for talking about an individual (like a jockey, say) who belongs to a profession that's predominantly male -- it's a way of emphasizing "that such occupations are not barred to women or that women's concerns need to be kept in mind." On the other hand, they add, using masculine pronouns rhetorically can underscore ongoing male dominance in those fields, implying the need for change.
And what about the speech codes adopted by some universities in recent years? Although they were designed to prohibit students from uttering sexist and racist slurs, they would extend, by logic, to blacks who want to use the word "nigger" to strip the term of its racist connotations, or homosexuals who want to use the word "queer" to reclaim it from bigots.
In her book, Ms. Maggio recommends applying bias-free usage retroactively: she suggests paraphrasing politically incorrect quotations, or replacing "the sexist words or phrases with ellipsis dots and/or bracketed substitutes," or using "sic" "to show that the sexist words come from the original quotation and to call attention to the fact that they are incorrect."
Which leads the skeptical reader of "The Bias-Free Word Finder" to wonder whether "All the King's Men" should be retitled "All the Ruler's People"; "Pet Semetary," "Animal Companion Graves"; "Birdman of Alcatraz," "Birdperson of Alcatraz," and "The Iceman Cometh," "The Ice Route Driver Cometh"?
Will making such changes remove the prejudice in people's minds? Should we really spend time trying to come up with nonmale-based alternatives to "Midas touch," "Achilles' heel," and "Montezuma's revenge"? Will tossing out Santa Claus -- whom Ms. Maggio accuses of reinforcing "the cultural male-as-norm system" -- in favor of Belfana, his Italian female alter ego, truly help banish sexism? Can the avoidance of "violent expressions and metaphors" like "kill two birds with one stone," "sock it to 'em" or "kick an idea around" actually promote a more harmonious world?
The point isn't that the excesses of the word police are comical. The point is that their intolerance (in the name of tolerance) has disturbing implications. In the first place, getting upset by phrases like "bullish on America" or "the City of Brotherly Love" tends to distract attention from the real problems of prejudice and injustice that exist in society at large, turning them into mere questions of semantics. Indeed, the emphasis currently put on politically correct usage has uncanny parallels with the academic movement of deconstruction -- a method of textual analysis that focuses on language and linguistic pyrotechnics -- which has become firmly established on university campuses.
In both cases, attention is focused on surfaces, on words and metaphors; in both cases, signs and symbols are accorded more importance than content. Hence, the attempt by some radical advocates to remove "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" from curriculums on the grounds that Twain's use of the word "nigger" makes the book a racist text -- never mind the fact that this American classic (written in 1884) depicts the spiritual kinship achieved between a white boy and a runaway slave, never mind the fact that the "nigger" Jim emerges as the novel's most honorable, decent character.
Ironically enough, the P.C. movement's obsession with language is accompanied by a strange Orwellian willingness to warp the meaning of words by placing them under a high-powered ideological lens. For instance, the "Dictionary of Cautionary Words and Phrases" -- a pamphlet issued by the University of Missouri's Multicultural Management Program to help turn "today's journalists into tomorrow's multicultural newsroom managers" -- warns that using the word "articulate" to describe members of a minority group can suggest the opposite, "that 'those people' are not considered well educated, articulate and the like."
The pamphlet patronizes minority groups, by cautioning the reader against using the words "lazy" and "burly" to describe any member of such groups; and it issues a similar warning against using words like "gorgeous" and "petite" to describe women.
A S euphemism proliferates with the rise of political correctness, there is a spread of the sort of sloppy, abstract language that Orwell said is "designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind." "Fat" becomes "big boned" or "differently sized"; "stupid" becomes "exceptional"; "stoned" becomes "chemically inconvenienced."
Wait a minute here! Aren't such phrases eerily reminiscient of the euphemisms coined by the Government during Vietnam and Watergate? Remember how the military used to speak of "pacification," or how President Richard M. Nixon's press secretary, Ronald L. Ziegler, tried to get away with calling a lie an "inoperative statement"?
Calling the homeless "the underhoused" doesn't give them a place to live; calling the poor "the economically marginalized" doesn't help them pay the bills. Rather, by playing down their plight, such language might even make it easier to shrug off the seriousness of their situation.
Instead of allowing free discussion and debate to occur, many gung-ho advocates of politically correct language seem to think that simple suppression of a word or concept will magically make the problem disappear. In the "Bias-Free Word Finder," Ms. Maggio entreats the reader not to perpetuate the negative stereotype of Eve. "Be extremely cautious in referring to the biblical Eve," she writes; "this story has profoundly contributed to negative attitudes toward women throughout history, largely because of misogynistic and patriarchal interpretations that labeled her evil, inferior, and seductive."
The story of Bluebeard, the rake (whoops! -- the libertine) who killed his seven wives, she says, is also to be avoided, as is the biblical story of Jezebel. Of Jesus Christ, Ms. Maggio writes: "There have been few individuals in history as completely androgynous as Christ, and it does his message a disservice to overinsist on his maleness." She doesn't give the reader any hints on how this might be accomplished; presumably, one is supposed to avoid describing him as the Son of God.
Of course the P.C. police aren't the only ones who want to proscribe what people should say or give them guidelines for how they may use an idea; Jesse Helms and his supporters are up to exactly the same thing when they propose to patrol the boundaries of the permissible in art. In each case, the would-be censor aspires to suppress what he or she finds distasteful -- all, of course, in the name of the public good.
In the case of the politically correct, the prohibition of certain words, phrases and ideas is advanced in the cause of building a brave new world free of racism and hate, but this vision of harmony clashes with the very ideals of diversity and inclusion that the multi-cultural movement holds dear, and it's purchased at the cost of freedom of expression and freedom of speech.
In fact, the utopian world envisioned by the language police would be bought at the expense of the ideals of individualism and democracy articulated in the "The Gettysburg Address": "Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal."
Of course, the P.C. police have already found Lincoln's words hopelessly "phallocentric." No doubt they would rewrite the passage: "Fourscore and seven years ago our foremothers and forefathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, formulated with liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all humankind is created equal."

HEADLINE: Give Vent to the Public And Watch the Weal

 BODY:
I found John Hurley's letter of Dec. 26 an informative and interesting statement of the problems arising from a lack of citizen involvement in overseeing the public purse strings. Though his focus was on energy and utility matters, there are several areas in the public sphere, especially here in the suburbs, where Mr. Hurley's approach would raise interesting questions for discussions.
Commendations for giving him the space for an important and interesting viewpoint. Citizen involvement may be an old and familiar idea, but it appears to be more honored in its breach than observance. Informed involvement in monitoring the purse strings seems like a tedious and time-consuming undertaking. However, in relieving "we the people" of responsibility, all levels of government seem to be raising our taxes in proportion as the "burden" of informed consent is lightened. 
 More than ever there is a need to hear from the thoughtful and well-educated public that the institutions of government and media do not generally offer access to. Professional columnists sound to me as tired and repetitive as the professional politicians they speak with and about. In the spirit of the recent national political campaign, let's hear from, and about, the rest of us on the editorial page.

HEADLINE: There Comes a Time To Control the Borders

 BODY:
In response to the letter by Patrick Young [Jan. 3] in which he claims that my comments concerning illegal aliens are xenophobic and wrong. If the comment "Why do American citizens, who joyfully help those who come here legally, have obligations to those who criminally entered this country?" is xenophobic, so be it. While he states El Salvadorans who come to this country are not criminals due to their status as war refugees, he does not comment on the illegal aliens from other countries, too numerous to mention. He does not mention that having a fake Social Security card to illegally get a job is a crime. We are not told of the costs through increased taxes to take care of these people's need for special education, bilingual teachers and health care.
He states, "The Statue of Liberty is more than a monument it is an ideal." I agree. As I stated, "The United States admits more legal immigrants than any other country." Unfortunately the time when the United States was an unexplored wilderness with the space for any and all is over. In the past the immigrants who came here were mostly on their own to sink or swim. Now however a vast "safety net" has been mandated in which we pay for those who have entered this country illegally. While I am proud of our country's status as a nation of immigrants, there comes a time which our resources become limited and we cannot expect to receive all of those driven by economics and population pressures out of their countries. Any country must retain some control of its borders.

HEADLINE: Ready or Not, Clinton Is Rattling the Country

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IN his inaugural address, President Clinton recalled Thomas Jefferson's belief "that to preserve the very foundations of our nation we would need dramatic change from time to time. Well, my fellow Americans," Mr. Clinton said, "this is our time. Let us embrace it." Not everyone was in such an embracing mood last week, but few doubted any longer that the season of change was here. From Capitol Hill to the Pentagon to the radio call-in shows, the message heard across the land was: My fellow Americans, fasten your seat belts.
Mr. Clinton, who was known for a rather messy but nevertheless effective style of governing in Arkansas, insisted that he was not distracted by the frenzy surrounding his decision to lift the ban on homosexuals in the military. The truth be told, Clinton aides say, it was distracting everybody. It was a cacophony, though, that people probably had better get used to, for it could be the theme music for the early Clinton Administration -- a symphony inherent in its very diverse agenda and the personality traits of the boss himself. 
 What happened to Mr. Clinton last week on the issue of homosexuals in the military was that one of his agendas outran the others due to poor planning. Mr. Clinton arrived in Washington with two main programs in his briefcase. One was a social values agenda, which aimed not only at reversing 12 years of Republican policies on issues from abortion counseling at Federally funded clinics to homosexuals in the military, but also at introducing new legislation like the family-leave bill. A lot of this could be implemented through executive orders, with the stroke of a pen -- and that is what he did.
But there was a lot more in the briefcase: plans for economic reform, affordable health care, welfare reform, national service, job creation. These were the big-ticket items of Mr. Clinton's broader agenda for revitalizing the country -- the program for which he was elected. Mr. Clinton's ability to move ahead with these would be the great test of his contention that activist government, in the mold of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson, can still work to fix mega-problems requiring not just the stroke of a pen but the reshaping of huge institutions and the building of huge coalitions.
What happened was that the first agenda got put in place immediately while the second one was still in the briefcase -- because Mr. Clinton's White House staff was not up and running in time, because many of his top appointees were not in place in the government agencies and because his economic team had not been able to agree on the plan he hoped would be ready by day one. Mr. Clinton was a victim of his own sloppy transition.
Had his economic plans been ready last week, as he had promised, the gays-in-the-military story might have been cast in a somewhat different light, and not left what was probably a false impression, that this is a radical-left Administration more interested in sexual politics than middle-of-the-road economics. Indeed, all early signs are that Mr. Clinton favors economic proposals that tilt toward the conservative deficit-cutters, a foreign policy as cautious as George Bush's, and middle-of-the-road welfare reform. The danger, though, is that first impressions will become lasting impressions.
No wonder, then, that when Mr. Clinton's spokesman, George Stephanopoulos, was asked if the President planned to speak out regularly on behalf of lifting the ban on homosexuals, he could not answer fast enough: "The President is going to speak out now on health care, his economic plan and national service."
If the plot of last week's mini-series was about a new President riding into town with an activist agenda on a political machine without all the wheels screwed on tightly yet, some of the subplots were equally intriguing.
Subplot I: Machiavelli meets Sam Nunn.
Machiavelli in his advice to new princes allowed that it is "much safer to be feared than loved" because "men have less hesitation to offend one who makes himself loved than one who makes himself feared." Translation: Avoid losing your first test of wills with Congress or the Pentagon. Presidents build their authority by asserting their will and sustaining it. That is why Roosevelt would sometimes ask his aides to bring him some bills to veto, knowing that the occasional slam dunk into the circular file is what keeps opponents in line.
Mr. Clinton did not slam dunk anyone on the gay rights issue. He clearly had to make concessions both to the military brass and Senator Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee and who opposed lifting the homosexual ban. It was a reminder to Mr. Clinton that gridlock in Washington comes in many varieties, and that he can have as much trouble with Democratic power barons used to having their own way as with their Republican counterparts across the aisle.
Still, much nonsense is being written about how terrible a blow last week was to Mr. Clinton. It will be a terrible blow if he does not get his health-care package adopted. It will be a terrible blow if he does not get his economic program enacted. But compromising on a highly contentious issue like homosexuals in the armed forces -- a compromise that allows him to still move ahead with lifting the ban while defusing the issue for a while -- is hardly likely to be his Presidency's undoing.
"One week after Clinton takes office people are saying, 'The Presidency is dead -- he did not call Sam Nunn early enough on the gays issue,' or, 'Homosexuals in the army is overwhelming his economic agenda,' " said Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institution. "I heard the networks comparing him already to the failed Carter Presidency. Would everyone please just sit back and take a deep breath for a minute? I mean, really. There will be plenty of time to handicap the Clinton Presidency -- after it is more than a week old."
Subplot II: Zeal at home, caution abroad.
What was striking about Mr. Clinton's first week in office was the way he swung for the fences on the domestic front and laid down bunts in the foreign affairs field. In domestic affairs Mr. Clinton was quick to assert a break with the Bush Administration, but in foreign affairs he was equally quick to assert continuity.
Yes, there has been much talk about his Administration "reviewing" policy options for possible intervention in Bosnia. But Mr. Clinton has just forced the Pentagon to accept the admission of homosexuals; he will soon ask it to accept major spending cuts. His ability to force the Pentagon, on top of all that, to alter its intense opposition to involvement in the Balkan quagmire would now seem to be severely constricted. This is not the time for a President who avoided the draft to call up the cavalry for a dubious mission.
 
Press Resentment
 Subplot III: Mr. Clinton in the press room with a knife.
In perhaps the shortest honeymoon since Zsa Zsa Gabor's last marriage, there is already bad blood between Mr. Clinton and the White House press. It is fed in part by the fact that the established media for the first time in recent memory are covering a President and senior staff their own age if not younger. During the campaign, that may have produced some fawning identification with the Clinton team, but in the period of governing it seems to have created an undercurrent of resentment.
There is also a loose sense in the press corps that Mr. Clinton has not always told the truth, and has gotten away with it, leaving journalists doubly skeptical of his every utterance.
"I think the Clinton people's contempt for the press is left over from the Gennifer Flowers and draft controversies during the campaign," said Larry J. Sabato, professor of government at the University of Virginia. "The Clinton people deeply resented the coverage they got on those issues. What feeds their contempt is a feeling that they survived it all and learned how to operate without the mainstream media, and they plan to go on doing just that."
This tension has helped to create a bizarre disconnect between the attitudes toward the Clinton Presidency inside the Washington Beltway and outside of it. "It's odd," said Representative Jim Leach, an Iowa Republican. "The inside-the-beltway crowd is really setting Clinton up for a fall in the very near future, but the rest of the country desperately wants his Presidency to succeed, and they are still ready to give him time to deliver on the economy and health care."
Subplot IV: The politics of jogging.
When Mr. Clinton went out to jog for the first time after moving into the White House, his escort motorcade found itself driving along sidewalks on the National Mall and heading the wrong way on one-way streets in an effort to keep up with him.
That scene was an apt metaphor for Mr. Clinton's first week in office, when Congress, the military and the public also scrambled to keep up with the new President, who seemed to be following his own unique traffic patterns. The question for the coming months: Who will have the right of way?

HEADLINE: Conversations/Walt Whitman Rostow;
A Vietnam Hawk's Battle Plan For a City's Mean Streets

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex.

 BODY:
WALT WHITMAN ROSTOW recalls coming home at 3 A.M. from the White House during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis to find his wife, Elspeth, a history professor, sitting cross-legged in bed, grading papers. He remembers exactly what she said: "You haven't been so cheerful since the Second World War."
Now, some 30 years later, Mr. Rostow, who was a foreign policy adviser to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, is experiencing a not dissimilar good cheer, born of clear purpose and a sense of optimism about overcoming an ominous threat. 
 The economist-diplomat-warrior heads a civic organization called the Austin Project, which immodestly intends to solve the problems of urban America, starting with the capital of Texas. Mr. Rostow, a professor of economics at the University of Texas, has not been a notable figure in local politics, but in little more than a year the project has attracted public officials, foundations, private social service agencies and business leaders.
The City Council voted unanimously last September to begin the first phase of the project's strategy, which calls for greatly expanding and coordinating programs, both private and public, aimed at prenatal care and at aiding disadvantaged children up to the age of 8. This month Mayor Bruce Todd promised to try to double the local spending on those programs in 1993, with help from foundations and the state and Federal governments.
Mr. Rostow, 76 years old, says his approach to the cities is colored by the same optimism that he and others of his generation brought to government when John F. Kennedy became President. As another generation takes over Washington in an era bedeviled by deficits and mistrust of government, Mr. Rostow insists that a robust sense of possibilities is the key to success.
"We were a generation that had seen very bad times in the Depression and during the war, in 1942," he said, "when the nation faced great military danger, and we had become used to saying to ourselves, 'O.K., suck up your gut and get at it, we'll win because we have to.' That wasn't cheap optimism in the Kennedy days, and that spirit has not been lost in this country. You see it today in people young and old when they are committed to an idea."
 
Fighting Pessimism
 He readily acknowledges that years of "cumulative failure and chronic stagnation have left people both in the inner city and outside profoundly pessimistic about these problems, but it is not in the American character to sit by passively and watch the ship go down."
Mr. Rostow proposes a disarmingly simple solution. That may help explain why it has quickly won wide acceptance in Austin.
"You rapidly and drastically increase your prevention efforts with the young until they are equal to the scale of the problem," he said, "and in a short time the investment will pay for itself because you'll pay less for damage control."
An effective prenatal care program that reaches every teen-age mother, for example, will save much more than its cost by reducing the number of low birth-weight babies who need expensive neonatal care. Similarly, programs that succeed in reducing dropout rates produce huge savings in lowered welfare and law enforcement costs.
"It's just a problem of transition," he said. "How are you going to get the investment in prevention high enough to where the level of pathology begins to fall and still keep up the damage control? If you can get through that interval, money won't be a problem."
Things seem simpler in Austin (pop. 465,000) because of its size. Doubling local spending on the programs for children sounds ambitious, but in Austin that only means raising $2.6 million, which the Austin Project reasonably plans to accomplish in a year. And problems still seem to be manageable. Sure, there are street gangs in the black and Hispanic neighborhoods on the east side of town, but the police counted only 37 murders throughout the city last year.
Austin's small scale also makes it easier for a coalition to form. "This country's inherent strength is that it is a highly diffuse society with many points of initiative," he said. "If you can get everyone to agree on a common strategy, then you have a chance of orchestrating all these marvelously variegated elements so each does its part. Whether you are in Austin or New York, there are plenty of dedicated people with good ideas for saving the cities, but usually they do not function together as a unit."
By means of illustration, Mr. Rostow said that earlier that day during a board meeting of the Austin Project, a police officer, a social worker, a university professor and a computer company executive each addressed aspects of the project's strategy.
As in the Atlanta Project, organized by former President Jimmy Carter, and similar efforts in other cities, Mr. Rostow says, the fundamental goal in Austin is "to see how you create an operational unit out of a community." By getting many public and private agencies to agree on a program, he hopes the project will reduce duplication and expenses. But more important is his conviction that a common purpose greatly multiplies ingenuity and commitment.
 
The Good War
 Asked if he had any models, he answered without hesitation, "The extreme model is this country waging a war that commands overwhelming support." No doubts about the strategy and everyone doing their part. The images he drew came from one war in particular: "women working in factories, not buying new automobiles, rationing."
Certain ironies were unavoidable during an afternoon spent with Mr. Rostow. His office at the Lyndon B. Johnson Library is just down the hall from a replica of the Oval Office, where he spent many hours helping direct the Vietnam War.
For someone of a younger generation it was impossible not to ask how that war fit into his model of strategic consensus. After stumbling and digressing a bit he said: "The way we fought the war in Vietnam reminds me of the way we are trying to deal with the cities, running after all the symptoms and putting Band-Aids on them instead of going for the cause." Instead of getting sucked into a guerrilla war in South Vietnam, he says, we should have massed enough ground troops and air power along the Ho Chi Minh trail "because they would have had to stand and fight there or be dead."
As things turned out, he admits, "It was a harrowing way to fight a war."
Mr. Rostow shifts much more readily to that earlier conflict, vividly recalling events like the liberation of Paris. Of a friend from that time he says, "he really had a gallant war."
His visitor, denied such memories and instead recalling frustration and dissent, asks how someone whose war was Vietnam could summon that same bold faith in common purpose typical of the World War II generation.
Mr. Rostow, that rare combination of intellectual and optimist, pauses and a cloud passes over his face. "I just don't know," he says. "It's a mystery to me."

HEADLINE: JAN. 24-30: Blue Chip Blahs;
America's Corporate Giants Cope by Jettisoning Thousands of Jobs

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
The economic enigma facing the Clinton Administration -- strong growth but few new jobs -- can be explained by looking at the battered blue chips of corporate America.
Last week, I.B.M. announced that its chief executive, John F. Akers, would step down within three months. A week earlier, the computer giant had reported a $4.97 billion loss for 1992, the largest in corporate history. Since 1986, the International Business Machines Corporation has sliced its work force by 100,000 people and more cuts are planned. 
 In the past two weeks big work force cuts were also announced at Sears, Boeing, United Technologies, McDonnell Douglas and Eastman Kodak.
The job rolls of big companies have been shrinking for years, with the employment of the Fortune 500 companies down more than 3.6 million in the decade ended 1991. But the process seems to have accelerated recently, even though most economic indicators now point upward.
In certain industries, special circumstances are responsible for the turmoil. Defense contractors are struggling to adjust to the post-cold war world. Yet there are forces that affect the entire corporate economy: fast-changing technology, international competition and the deregulation of finance and telecommunications.
"Large, bureaucratic styles of management cannot adjust to these changes," said Daniel Mitchell, a professor at the University of California at Los Angeles graduate school of management, "and that's why the Fortune 500 companies have been shrinking."

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
Usually, the Illegality in Domestic Work Is Benefits Denied

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
FAMILIES who do not pay Social Security and unemployment taxes for their maids and nannies are not just breaking the law. They are denying their household help the pensions and protection against disability and joblessness to which the workers are entitled.
The practice is even more pervasive in affluent communities than the hiring of illegal aliens, which was the focus of most of the attention this month surrounding Zoe Baird and the withdrawal of her nomination to be Attorney General. 
 Take the case of a maid who has worked steadily all her life at the minimum wage. If she retires or becomes disabled today and the proper Social Security taxes have been paid all along, she will receive nearly $500 a month, an amount that will rise along with inflation. If no Social Security taxes have been paid, she will receive nothing. And if the taxes have been paid on only one-quarter of her earnings, she will get only $180 a month.
Or take the case of a nanny who, as often happens, is dismissed when the children are old enough to be home alone. If her unemployment insurance taxes were paid, she can get Government unemployment checks for 26 weeks or more, covering up to half of the weekly wages she had been receiving. No taxes paid, no checks.
These taxes are not optional. If the household worker, even a once-a-week cleaning woman, is paid $50 in any calendar quarter, the employer is required by law to pay Social Security taxes. If the worker is paid $1,000 in a quarter, unemployment tax is due. As Ms. Baird learned, the taxes are owed even if the worker is an illegal alien and has no Social Security card.
But for one reason or another, the vast majority of families with maids or nannies, even ones who are American citizens, do not pay these taxes.
The law is hardly ever enforced, and nothing usually happens to scofflaws. But the workers -- many of whom are members of minority groups, most of whom are poor and nearly all of whom are women -- are cheated.
"This is not a victimless crime," said James C. Corman, a former Democratic congressman from California who now practices law here. "The victims are the poorest among us, the working poor, and they are victimized by people who are among our most affluent."
The Census Bureau reports about 560,000 household workers in the country. The Bureau of Labor Statistics counts about 875,000. Many, of course, work in more than one home.
According to the Internal Revenue Service, about 500,000 taxpayers paid Social Security taxes for household help last year. The I.R.S. has made a rough calculation that 2 million should have paid. There is evidence that that is an underestimate; a survey by the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that about 7 million households spent money in 1991 for "housekeeping services."
Some of those households may not have owed the taxes. The law that determines who is an employee and who is a contract worker, for whom Social Security taxes are paid by someone else, is, like so much else in the tax code, mind-numbingly complicated. The I.R.S. says 20 separate factors must be considered.
But usually it boils down to this: If the maid or nanny is hired and paid by a baby-sitting agency or cleaning service, then she is a contractor. Otherwise, she is an employee. Nancy Duff Campbell, co-president of the National Women's Law Center, said virtually all full-time maids and nannies and most who work part-time are employees, not contractors.
The Social Security and Medicare tax is 15.3 percent, of which half is supposed to be paid by the employer and half withheld from the worker's pay. The unemployment compensation tax varies but is generally about 2 percent of the first $7,000 of wages, all paid by the employer.
 
A Paper Flurry

Representative Andrew Jacobs Jr. of Indiana, who heads the Social Security subcommittee of the Ways and Means Committee, said he did not think most people who failed to pay proper taxes were "willful violators." Many, he said, do not know they must pay taxes. Others are put off by the paperwork -- the quarterly statements to be filed with the I.R.S., the various state forms and the W-2 form totaling the year's wages and taxes, six copies of which must be sent out every January.
More important, many maids and nannies say they would rather work off the books and not have the money withheld. "Poor people in our country are in a terrible double bind," said Nancy Amidei, who teaches at the University of Washington School of Social Work. "Right or wrong, they see the Social Security tax, which would provide for their retirement in the future, as taking food off their table today."
So why doesn't Congress do something? Why doesn't the I.R.S. crack down on violators? Why doesn't the Government advertise the importance of paying Social Security taxes and having benefits accrue?
One reason is that maids and nannies have no organized advocates -- no unions, no lobbies, no one who contributes money to political campaigns. Mr. Corman, the former congressman, offered another reason. "Crimes committed by well-off people against poor people," he said, "do not get as much attention as crimes committed by poor people against well-off people."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
A New President Finds the Trade Combatants Acting Up

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
AFTER several years watching China dump raw materials for steel-making on the market at unfairly low prices, the Government decided to get tough last week. It imposed import duties on the product, ferrosilicon manganese, and made it clear that such predatory practices would not be tolerated.
The story may sound familiar, but the venue was not Washington. It was here in Tokyo. 
 Japan, the country with the world's largest trade surplus, had for the first time retaliated against a country it accused of dumping. It was showing the world its stern new face on trade policies -- and that included a threat that any American attempt to curb imports from Japan might draw retaliation.
But as much as Japan has worked to recast its image as a trade liberal fighting for free markets, last week it ran into uncomfortable reminders of the old accusations that it uses unfair practices to gain economic advantage at home and abroad.
The United States Commerce Department accused several countries, including Japan, of selling steel at unfairly low prices and said it would impose stiff tariffs. Detroit's Big Three automakers said they are considering filing a suit seeking punitive duties on all imported autos, arguing that European and Japanese car-makers are selling cars for less than they do at home.
And the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan issued a report detailing many barriers it said foreign businesses still face here, despite more than a decade of negotiations. It listed 34 industries where it said discrimination still exists and 14 practices, many by the Japanese Government, that hobble foreign businesses.
The report was careful to note that there have been improvements. But what was most striking about the list -- which included things as odd as an effective restriction on dog food makers offering buy-one-get-one-free promotions and as important as barriers to Japanese car dealers selling imported autos -- was that it made clear that the Clinton Administration is facing the same kind of trade problems with Japan that past administrations were supposed to have cleared up.
"Despite Japanese Government actions to liberalize and internationalize, years of protection and export-driven strategies have shaped an environment inherently unfavorable to foreign firms," said Richard I. Johannessen Jr., president of the chamber and head of the Asian operations of Rockwell International.
For instance, the United States Government made a major effort to open Japan's byzantine transportation and wholesaling system over the last two years. There have been several agreements, but, the chamber's report said, "the overall results have been disappointing."
 
Primed to Compete
 The persistence of these problems has lent weight to those who have argued that Japan's economic playing field is not level because it is not playing the same game as the United States. America's trade policies have been premised on the assumption that if you pinpoint and then remove impediments, the free markets will flourish. The evidence is now supporting the view, many argue, that the Japanese system itself is an impediment and so America should change, in part by adopting even tougher policies.
Chalmers Johnson, an expert on Japanese political economy and industrial policy at the University of California at San Diego, has described the notion at the heart of the Japanese economy as "developmental capitalism." The state is organized, he said, almost solely for the purpose of making Japanese industry and exporters more competitive, and the apparatus for achieving this goal is one that no trade negotiations can dismantle.
On one level, it is hard to dispute such arguments. In 1980, Japan had a $10 billion trade surplus with the United States. Since then, its imports from the United States more than doubled, from $20.8 billion to $48.15 billion in 1991, but its exports to the United States nearly tripled, from $30.9 billion to $91.6 billion in 1991.
The Japanese have admitted their markets have needed to open up, but they have also rejected some of the blame for the trade imbalance, saying it results from the United States' huge budget deficits and a lack of effort on the part of American manufacturers. Some conservative American economists agree.
It took until just a few months ago, for example, for the Chrysler Corporation to import a version of its popular Jeep Cherokee with the steering wheel on the right-hand side for Japanese drivers.
The Compaq Corporation has recently initiated a price war with Japanese computer makers that has shaken up the market, but it took years before Compaq bothered to break into Japan, the world's second-largest computer market.
Now, some influential Japanese are acknowledging that discrimination is an integral part of the Japanese system and are calling for deep changes in the way businessmen and bureaucrats here think.
"We should lend an ear to the criticism that Japan in itself has become a fortress," Akio Morita, the chairman of Sony, said in a recent essay. "Japan has been late in opening its markets to the world and assuring the transparency of those markets. What changes it has made have been piecemeal, caused by direct foreign pressure."
This debate over whether the Japanese economy really is fundamentally different, and how the United States should respond if it is, has been remarkably bitter. There is surprisingly little agreement on the most basic questions since they ultimately reflect on how the United States economy ought to be managed in an increasingly competitive world.
Some Clinton Administration officials have already signaled that they intend to be tougher with Japan and friendlier toward tariffs as levers to force open Japanese markets.
What they cannot yet say is whether the approach will continue to be piecemeal, whether it will be matched by new strategies at home to make American companies more competitive, and whether four or eight years from now the Chamber of Commerce will be issuing the same complaints all over again.


GRAPHIC: The American Chamber of Commerce in Japan released a harsh report last week detailing laws and business practices it said hobble American companies trying to do business there. Among the examples it cited:
 
Foreign law firms still cannot hire Japanese lawyers or form partnerships with Japanese firms. Foreign firms cannot even use their real names: they must be known by the names of the lawyers working in Japan.
 
The Ministry of Transportation dictates what air carriers can charge, what discounts they can offer and services they can provide. It prohibited a foreign airline from offering business-class passengers a limousine pick-up service, which Japan Airlines does not offer.
 
Laws sharply restrict sales promotions, making it hard for newcomers to break into markets. One company cannot discount another's product so, for example, a hamburger chain cannot offer a free soft drink with each purchase. Expensive promotions are restricted, so a hotel cannot offer an extra night's stay, and airlines cannot offer upgrades.
 
Discriminatory import guidelines for wheat and barley make it hard for American grain companies to compete, and enable Japanese trading houses to market American wheat to other Asian countries at prices the American companies cannot match.
 
Cellular telephones cannot be purchased in Japan; they must be leased from the telephone companies.
 
American food companies have been excluded from industry groups discussing new freshness-dating rules.
 
American producers of soda ash, used in making glass, must funnel all imports through a terminal controlled by the four major Japanese producers. The fees are high and frustrating delays are common.

HEADLINE: With Casino Profits, Indian Tribes Thrive

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LEDYARD, Conn.

 BODY:
With such adaptations as "wampum" credit cards and waitresses in skimpy maiden tunics, casino gambling on Indian reservations has become a multibillion-dollar industry that is fueling a renaissance of American Indian tribal fortunes and culture.
A movement that began tentatively in 1980 with a court fight over a Florida bingo hall has spread to at least 17 states and 52 tribes operating more than 100 casino and large-scale bingo sites. Many more states, including New York, are negotiating casino agreements. 
 And amid such progress Indians are turning back from diaspora and going home to depressed reservations after three centuries of decline. They are eager to document their blood lines and get in on the upturn in fortunes.
 
A Piece of the Pequots' Pie
 "They see the succcess we're having and would like a piece of the pie," said Joseph J. Carter, who turned away from urban American life a decade ago to join his brother, Gary, and scores of others in reviving the Mashantucket Pequot tribe and creating the 'state of the art' Foxwoods reservation casino here. Both brothers now have important roles in the casino.
The tribe, once down to fewer than a dozen residents on the reservation, now has over 225 returned or rediscovered members, plus a growing list of applicants who insist they are entitled.
"I think it's wonderful that people who suffered adversity for centuries around here finally have a chance to get theirs," said Irving Wizenfeld, a visiting gambler sensing a higher cause in his losses, as the adaptative tribe uses its gambling profits to tutor the young about massacre and disease at the hands of colonialist usurpers. "Isn't that what America is supposed to be about?"
 
Free Tuition and Travel
 Led by its chief and chairman, Richard Hayward, one of the national leaders of the Indian casino movement, the tribe now guarantees college tuition for all its children and world travel for its elders, and it has hired its own archaelogist to disinter lost tribal history.
All this and more, including hotels for visitors and home construction for tribe members, is under way because of the booming profits from its modern, woodsy gambling palace that had to go to 24-hour operations to handle the action soon after it opened last February on the 1,800-acre reservation here, a three-hour drive east from New York City.
No less impressive, the tribe has sought another profit line by branching into casino management consulting. They deal with tribal chiefs from across America who are steadily visiting so they can shape their own grand plans for tribal resurrection.
Within the pastel-toned gambling factory, the sounds of the outside forest are lost to the lucrative whirrings of slot machines and roulette wheels and the clipped intensity of high-stakes poker tables where players are free to set their own limits at hundreds of dollars a bet on the Indians' sovereign grounds.
 
Boon Beyond Reservation
 A second casino building is already under construction, and officials plan to triple the current 3,500-member payroll. This boon extends well beyond the reservation, since most workers are not tribe members and are surviving in a troubled economy depressed by the post-Cold War cutbacks in local armaments industries. Casino officials declined to show a balance sheet, but total bets can range from $500,000 on a slow day to $3 million on a busy weekend day, with the tribe netting at least a third, in the estimate of one Foxwoods official.
Spurred by successes like Foxwoods, Indian casinos have become a $6-billion-a-year industry across the country, with steady growth predicted by Indian gambling officials to total at least $1 billion annually, based on the rush of new casino compacts now in negotiation and under study in Washington. Although Indians control less than 1 percent of the overall American gambling industry, court-tested Federal law gives them far greater power than other casino operators to set up in states where gambling is restricted.
As the Indians pressed for casinos and opposition grew, Congress passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988, outlining compacts between states and tribes. The law allows Federally recognized tribes to negotiate casino agreements in any state where casino-style gambling is allowed, even for limited charity purposes. While most states allow such limited forms of gambling, only Nevada and New Jersey permit full-scale casinos outside reservations.
 
Mohawks and Oneida in Line
 Representatives of tribes in New York are among the Indian leaders visiting the casino here; they are trying to negotiate gambling agreements with state officials. Some New York officials estimate that compacts are likely to be reached with the St. Regis Mohawks and Oneida Nation, although this would be only the opening step in a laborious entrepreneurial exercise that, for all its intricacies, is being attempted by dozens of tribes across the country.
"They're getting very inventive out there," said Bob Walker, a spokesman for the Federal Department of the Interior, which oversees the compacts between the states and the tribes under the 1988 law.
"Tribes are marrying up with private gambling interests lately," he said, noting proposals for tribal-sponsored casinos in downtown Detroit and Wichita, Kan., in suburban Chicago and a dozen other places far removed from reservations.
This could be done by ceding city lands in trust to tribal sponsors as reservation sanctuaries, an approach that leaves Federal officials wary. Abetted more and more by commercial gambling specialists from established casino spas like Atlantic City and Las Vegas, the projects even include a proposed casino in Iowa co-sponsored by an out-of-state tribe, the Santee Sioux of Nebraska, and a Nevada resort casino.
 
America's Grimmest Past
 But the Indians' more certain path is by individual tribal compacts, which most states are mandated by Federal law to negotiate. The Indians' new casinos and high-stakes bingo halls from these compacts have already created tens of thousands of jobs. The most inviting ones are going to their own people, whose families have suffered some of the grimmest experiences of poverty, prejudice and denied opportunities in America.
In Minnesota, for example, 5,000 jobs have been created at a dozen reservation gambling sites. The Mille Lacs band of Chippewas, which in recent years had an unemployment rate of 45 percent, with major health and alcoholism problems, now reports nearly full employment after a new casino began producing $15 million in annual revenues and opened a world of community services.
"Gambling has proved vital to us," said Reid A. Walker, a member of the Mandan tribe of North Dakota and an executive of the National Indian Gaming Association, an association spearheading the casino movement for 70 tribes.
"It has brought us great hope. It's a renaissance for Indian country, giving us power to start our own programs in health care, infrastructure, education and more."
But lately, says the association, various states have been resisting harder in state courts and attempting greater regulation as the Indians' potential becomes clear. In Idaho, for example, voters in a referendum last November favored banning casino-type gambling. A similar referendum is being held on restricting existing Indian casinos in Wisconsin.
 
Reservations Are Sovereign
 But the only way a state can head off Indian casinos is to bar casino-type games totally throughout the state, often a complex constitutional move that risks the opposition of church and other charity groups. The Indians' gambling sovereignty is rooted in the Supreme Court's decision in 1976 that while states may have some civil and criminal jurisdiction over Indian tribes, they do not have regulatory powers.
Here in Connecticut, the Mashantucket Pequots, after having to sue the state earlier to force it into negotiations, dealt cleverly with the threat of competition in recent weeks by offering $100 million of its annual revenues to the state as community aid. In return, Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., who has resisted casino gambling beyond the reservations, gave the Indians permission to use slot machines and thus apparently defused growing pressures to extend casino gambling to needy cities.
In theory, the Indians might police their gambling alone, but the Foxwoods chieftains are advising other tribes to cooperate closely with outside authorities, including state police, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and even the Central Intelligence Agency, in guarding against inroads from organized crime.
 
'All About the Bad Guys'
 "We want to know all about the bad guys," said Mr. Carter of Foxwoods. The security here, with workers in green blazers watching quietly and with videotapes recording through mirrored windows, has already led to the arrest of criminal figures attempting a credit-card scam at the casino, Mr. Carter said. He says the Indians' own sense of tribalism is itself a barrier to the underworld.
The tribes stress the far more tangible effects of casino gambling. There is the new power plant, 950-unit housing development, fire, police and court systems, universal employment, health care and education for the once impoverished Cabazon band of Mission Indians in California who established the first reservation casino a decade ago. There is the $86-million annual operating budget of Wisconsin's Oneida tribe. There is the 600-year-old Sandia tribe in New Mexico, renewing its roots and culture with $16 million in annual gambling revenues and helping the Albuquerque economy.
Mr. Carter's personal history on the reservation began with a $5-an-hour job clearing trees for the casino site. Now he does tribal public relations at "somewhere between $55 and $80 an hour," he said with a smile. His duties require travel to Atlantic City, Las Vegas and other casino spas where he can finally place a bet, something tribal officials do not permit their members here at the Foxwoods tables.
"You need money to practice sovereignty," was the lesson drawn by Foxwoods' Mr. Carter, wandering his tribe's crowded casino here. He savors the flood of would-be Indians, lately petitioning the chieftains over hoped-for tribal ties, as much as he values the gamblers wielding their wampum cards with that endless hunch that they can be winners. "Hey, everybody wants to be a Mashantucket," Mr. Carter declared, surveying the latest action.

HEADLINE: SOME SEE RICHES IN TROUBLED LOANS

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
For the first time since real estate prices collapsed three years ago, the nation's banks are finding eager buyers for the troubled loans and repossessed property that have pushed many of them to the brink of collapse.
Since 1990, banks had been able to do little to rid themselves of their real estate problems other than watch their $80 billion in bad real estate debts lose value, and wait for prices to rebound. But now, real estate executives at the largest banks are being deluged with telephone calls from people and companies offering to buy their troubled assets -- property that banks have repossessed, or on which the owners are no longer keeping up their loan payments.
 
A Chance for a Killing
 This developing market means a reprieve not only for the banks but for the Federal Government. Troubled real estate loans were the main reason several large banks failed in recent years, costing the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation billions of dollars and raising the prospect of a costly Federal bailout. 
 Potential buyers of the troubled properties include large companies like the General Electric Capital Corporation, Wall Street houses like First Boston and wealthy individuals like the Texas investor Robert Bass. Most of them became interested in buying distressed properties cheaply as the Government sold off big pools of real estate it had taken over from failed savings and loan associations; but by now, most of that property has been sold, and these investors are looking for more bargains elsewhere.
They are prepared to buy as much as $20 billion to $30 billion worth of real estate from the banks, says Stephen A. Roth, president of the Secured Capital Corporation, who helped auction properties for the Government's Resolution Trust Corporation. They are looking for annual returns of 20 percent or more and are offering to pay about half the original value of a property.
This is forcing the bankers to choose whether to take cash today or to sit on the assets themselves, holding out for the possibility of a higher price later.
"The banks have to make a choice," said Mr. Roth, who has also turned his attention to the bank portfolios. "There is now a relatively efficient market. The issue now is price."
Which option they choose could well be the most important issue bank executives face this year. If banks are able to persuade regulators and investors that the last of their loan problems are behind them, their stock prices will rise. That would allow them to merge with other banks, bringing the consolidation that experts say is necessary for the industry to return to health.
But there is a risk to the strategy, too. If the banks sell their assets too quickly and too cheaply, they will deprive themselves of much needed capital and further weaken the financial system.
 
'Better Off Selling'
 As real estate prices have edged upward, more and more banks have opted to take that risk. Late last year, both Fleet Financial Group, of Providence, R.I., and Nationsbank, of Charlotte, N.C., sold large packages of real estate assets, originally valued at more than $500 million each, to investment groups.
"We felt we were better off selling these problem assets in the marketplace and taking the proceeds and investing them in earning assets," said James H. Hance Jr., chief financial officer of Nationsbank, the country's fourth largest bank.
And just last Tuesday, the BankAmerica Corporation said it had agreed to sell assets originally valued at about $2 billion at half that price to a special corporation set up by the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund, an investment pool with funds from institutional investors.
These transactions are encouraging other bankers to consider these bulk sales.
"At first, the buyers could drive a pretty hard bargain, but the prices have been getting more reasonable on both sides," said Robert S. Strong, a senior vice president in charge of real estate for the Chase Manhattan Bank. "We are increasingly optimistic that we may see deals that make sense, " he said. Chase has about $3 billion in troubled real estate loans that it will sell if the price is right, Mr. Strong said.
 
Some Banks Are Cautious
 But other banks, including Citicorp, the nation's largest real estate lender, and Wells Fargo & Company, argue that the prices offered by these speculators are still far too low, and say they intend to sell their properties one at a time over the next few years.
The Chemical Banking Corporation recently offered pieces of its $12 billion real estate portfolio to leading buyers of real estate in bulk. It found that the bids were 15 to 30 percent below what it estimated it could get for the properties individually.
"The discounts in the bulk sale market are absurd," said Joseph A. DeLuca, Chemical's executive vice president in charge of real estate finance. "We have time and again been able to achieve better prices selling properties individually." With Chemical's capital strength and earnings, he went on, "we don't have to pursue an uneconomic path for a short-term gain."
The bank sold $150 million in real estate last quarter and Mr. DeLuca expects to continue selling properties at that pace. "We want to get it done quickly, but we want to get it done well."
To many in the real estate industry, the banks are being unrealistic in the prices they are asking. The banks, used to setting prices in calmer times, assume that a price that gives an investor a 13 to 15 percent return on a property is fair. But the real estate crisis has left many investors needing higher returns to compensate them for the risk in the market, and has made them willing to pay less.
"Look at the risk involved in owning strip shopping centers today," said Thomas J. Barrack Jr., chief executive of Colony Capital Inc., a fund that is affiliated with General Electric Capital, the Robert Bass Group and the Cargill Corporation. "There is no liquidity in the market."
It is just these risks that makes some banks eager to sell, even at 50 cents on the dollar.
"When you're in a falling market, our feeling is the smartest thing to do is take the first reasonable offer," said Allen D. Brown, executive vice president of First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles. "I don't want to sit here a year from now having to take another write down on a property I could have gotten out the door this year."
While First Interstate has been quick to get out of its troubled real estate, it has generally sold property to local investors individually or in smaller pools of less than $20 million, rather than through bulk sales.
Similarly, even though Citicorp has $13 billion in real estate assets in North America, $6 billion of it troubled in some way, it still wants to sell properties individually.
"At the end of the day all real estate is sold retail, one building at a time, to the end users," said Robert A. McCormack, Citicorp's executive vice president in charge of North American real estate. "A financial intermediary will take a group of properties off your hands wholesale, but will charge you a hell of a price," he said.
Citicorp, which has 500 people to manage its $13 billion North American real estate portfolio, can operate and sell the properties more efficiently than most investment funds, he said.
While Citicorp may be an exception, the real estate companies argue that most banks do not have the resources to manage the properties properly so they can be sold for the highest value. "Are banks able to do what is necessary to get the most value out of these assets?" asked James M. Allwin, president of Morgan Stanley Realty. "In many cases the marketplace feels others may do better."
Indeed, Nationsbank calculates that each year it costs 10 to 20 percent of the value of a loan to manage the properties and administer the problem loans, Mr. Hance said. Moreover, by getting rid of the problems, the bank can reassign the bankers who have been watching them to winning new business, he said.
Even if the hard numbers argue for keeping real estate rather than selling at current prices, some banks argue that there is considerable benefit to creating the appearance of taking tough, decisive action.
"We wanted a clean slate to re-energize our earnings and re-energize the morale of our people," said John W. Ballantine, chief credit officer of the First Chicago Corporation, which has put $2.1 billion in real estate up for sale. "Also, quite frankly, we wanted to get the stock price up."
Investment bankers, looking to cut short the debates over what the future prices of real estate, have concocted ways for banks to sell their assets now and still retain some benefit if the market rises more than expected.
The BankAmerica transaction is an example. The troubled assets were sold to a shell corporation, which will raise money by selling bonds and stock. BankAmerica will invest somewhat less than $100 million in that stock, distributing it to its shareholders. If the real estate is eventually sold for more than a certain amount, the shareholders will receive part of the proceeds.
Over the next year, any bank with more than $100 million in real estate will want to consider this sort of structure, said Edward S. Annunziato, an investment banker at Merrill Lynch who specializes in commercial banks. "The banks know it is a bad time to sell, but cosmetically they are forced to," he said. "So they can put together a package where the shareholders can get something back later."

HEADLINE: CLINTON WEIGHING FREEZE OR NEW TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
President Clinton's economic advisers and Democratic Congressional leaders have concluded that retirees receiving Social Security benefits and Government pensions should pay a significant part of the price of deficit reduction, officials in the White House and Congress said this week.
But the advisers and the top lawmakers disagree over how they should pay: whether through limiting cost-of-living increases in benefits or by increasing taxes on benefits. President Clinton has not come down on either side, the officials said in interviews, but they added that Senate leaders had warned him that any attempt to freeze benefits would be rejected by the Senate.
 
Political Dangers Ahead
 Over the years, cuts in Social Security have been thought to represent political suicide. But Administration officials and Democratic lawmakers seem to agree that they cannot exempt the elderly when asking all Americans to make equal sacrifices to reduce the budget deficit. 
 The mere fact that the Democrats are talking about either limiting Social Security payments or taxing them more heavily is an indication of how difficult it will be to lower the deficit and how serious the new Administration is about tackling the problem. The 30 million retirees who receive Social Security checks each month are a powerful political force.
 
Many Tough Choices
 But one official said Social Security cuts were being considered because "we have picked the bones clean of the easy political choices, and none are left."
The White House said Mr. Clinton and his advisers were working on the economic plan at the Presidential retreat at Camp David, Md., over the weekend. Another meeting with Congressional leaders is scheduled for Monday evening.
Social Security is only one of scores of difficult budget decisions in the offing. Other elements of the deficit-reduction package will almost certainly involve higher taxes on the wealthy, a new energy tax, stiffer enforcement of tax laws affecting foreign corporations with operations in the United States and reduced spending for the military and various domestic programs.
Some of those measures could also be politically unpopular. But Mr. Clinton's goal of cutting the current $300 billion deficit nearly in half by the time he leaves office cannot be accomplished without political cost.
 
1-Year Freeze Proposed
 Providing an account of a meeting at the White House last Wednesday, the officials said that Leon E. Panetta, the budget director, strongly advocated a one-year freeze in cost-of-living increases for Social Security recipients and retired Federal workers who receive civilian or military pensions. Social Security checks, which now average about $650 a month, rise each year to reflect the previous year's rate of inflation.
Mr. Panetta's plan was supported by Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, but Senators at the meeting vigorously opposed it, saying the plan stood no chance of passage in the Senate.
The Senators -- including George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader; Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, chairman of the Finance Committee, and Jim Sasser of Tennessee, chairman of the Budget Committee -- said it would be fairer to make a larger portion of Social Security benefits subject to income taxes, a method that they said would raise at least as much revenue as a freeze.
Under current law, retired couples with annual incomes above $32,000 and individual retirees with incomes above $25,000 must pay income tax on half of their Social Security benefits.
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, a former Senator from Texas, tended to side with the Senators, according to reports from the meeting; President Clinton is reported to have said little and did not indicate where he stood.
Mr. Clinton's spokesman, George Stephanopoulos, said Thursday that Social Security changes were under consideration but that no decisions had been made.
 
Bitter Fiscal Medicine
 Mr. Clinton has said publicly that he hopes to propose measures next month to cut the deficit by $145 billion in the 1997 fiscal year, the last year of his term. Unless some action is taken, the deficit that year will be $319 billion, the Congressional Budget Office projected this week.
During his Presidential campaign, Mr. Clinton said he would oppose any reduction in Social Security benefits, but he said he might be willing to support a higher tax on those benefits in some circumstances.
Some lawmakers believe the Administration is putting out word that the inflation adjustments might be frozen so that when less painful medicine is prescribed it can be swallowed more easily.
 
10 Percent of Burden
 John Rother, executive director of the American Association of Retired Persons, one of Washington's most influential lobbies, suggested in an interview that the Administration would have a big fight on its hands if it proposed any changes in Social Security taxes or benefits. "If the standard is shared sacrifice," he said, "then people can sacrifice in any one of several ways. It's not fair to ask the same people to be hit on Medicare and Social Security, too."
The Administration is considering an increase in Medicare insurance premiums for upper-income retirees.
A one-year freeze in cost-of-living increases next year would save as much as $15 billion in 1997, or about 10 percent of the total deficit reduction being sought. Taxing a larger share of Social Security benefits or lowering the income at which taxes are imposed could raise at least that much revenue.
Pensions for Government workers who retire from the military or civilian jobs are already fully taxed.
Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, the chairman of the National Governors Association, which is meeting here, today endorsed the idea of putting Social Security proposals on the table as the Administration considers ways to cut the deficit. He said the governors want to have a role in drafting deficit-reduction policies and would meet with Mr. Clinton this week.
 
Contrasting Precedents
 Retirement benefits account for about a fourth of the entire Federal budget, and Administration officials and the Congressional leaders agreed that deficit reduction would be impossible if those benefits were left untouched.
Changes in the law that affect pensioners adversely are never easy politically, but they are not impossible either. In 1983, with the support of the Reagan Administration and Democrats in Congress, cost-of-living increases were delayed for six months to put the Social Security system on a sounder financial footing.
On the other hand, a political firestorm erupted in 1988 when Congress imposed a surtax on the most affluent 40 percent of retirees to pay for Medicare coverage of catastrophic illness. The law was repealed the next year.
 
House vs. Senate
 The officials who reported on the meeting Wednesday night gave this account of the arguments:
Mr. Panetta emphasized the importance of a public perception that sacrifice would be borne evenly. He said the Administration's goal was a deficit-reduction package that contained twice as much savings from spending reductions as new revenues from tax increases. That ratio would be difficult to meet, he said, if the tax on Social Security pensions was increased and the benefits were not reduced.
Supporting Mr. Panetta, Mr. Gephardt maintained that as a political matter, retirees would feel the cost-of-living once, early in Mr. Clinton's term, and would not hold it against the Democrats four years from now if the overall economy had improved. On the other hand, he said, a permanent tax increase would be felt year after year when retirees fill out their tax forms.
The Senators countered that freezing the inflation adjustments would mean little to wealthy retirees but would push hundreds of thousands of pensioners into poverty. Taxing more of the benefits would have its greatest effect on upper-income retirees; poorer retirees do not generally owe income taxes.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "The President's Economic Plan Takes Shape"
 
President Clinton and his economic advisers insist that no final decisions have been made about the economic program the President plans to present to Congress Feb. 17.
 
But the shape of some aspects of the program and the general direction of some others are clear. In public statements, Mr. Clinton and others in his Administration have mentioned these elements.
 
OVERALL PRINCIPLE
With immediate tax cuts and new spending, Mr. Clinton would allow the budget deficit to rise slightly this year to give the economy a quick stimulus. But for the longer term, he would like to lock into place this year tax increases and spending reductions that would reduce the deficit, now about $300 billion, by $145 billion in the last year of his term.
 
 TAX INCREASES
The top tax rate, now 31 percent, would be raised to at least 36 percent for families with incomes above $200,000.
A surtax, probably 10 percent, would be imposed on income above $1 million.
The minimum tax, owed by taxpayers with big deductions or a large amount of tax-exempt income, would be increased.
A new tax on all forms of energy is under consideration. A separate gasoline tax and a tax on carbon emissions have been ruled out.
New measures would be taken to collect more taxes from foreign companies doing business in the United States.
 
STIMULUS
The deficit this year would be allowed to rise by slightly more than $20 billion. One-third of that money would be spent on public works projects like roads and bridges; one-third would be spent for job-training and education, and one-third would involve tax breaks for business to encourage new investment.
 
TAX CUTS
Businesses would be allowed to lower their tax payments by a percentage, probably 10 percent, of the money they spent on new machinery and equipment. Rules would limit this tax credit to investments that otherwise would not have been made. The capital gains tax would be reduced on investments made in small businesses and held for at least five years.
 
RETIREMENT BENEFITS
Either cost-of-living increases in Social Security benefits would be limited or more income taxes would be imposed on these benefits.
Upper-income people would be required to pay more for Medicare insurance covering doctors' fees.
The pensions of retired Government employees, military and civilian, would be reduced in some way.
 
MILITARY SPENDING
Pentagon spending over the next four years would be cut by at least $40 billion below what the Defense Department had been anticipating.
 
WORKERS
The minimum wage, now $4.25 an hour, would be increased annually to keep pace with inflation.
Workers now unemployed would be allowed more weeks of unemployment compensation. (pg. 24)

HEADLINE: CLINTON PLANNING A SHIFT OF FOCUS

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
Anxious to move beyond a fight over homosexuals in the military that President Clinton felt was forced on him prematurely, the Administration plans an aggressive campaign in February to focus on the middle-class issues, like health care, that helped Mr. Clinton win election.
The President has acknowledged that he fell short of his goal when he accepted a compromise on Friday allowing the ban on homosexuals to remain largely in place for six months. But in the wake of the agreement, White House officials made it clear that they considered the gay ban a peripheral issue and now plan to turn the discussion to health care, the economy and restructuring the welfare system. 
 Even though the issue looms as another potential problem six months from now, Administration officials say they are confident that voters demand no more from the President than that he stand by his principles.
"To even suggest you're going to win on an issue like this is crazy," said George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director. "All you can hope to do is limit your losses."
 
Middle-Class Agenda
 Beginning with a meeting next week on health care with the nation's governors and leading up to State of the Union speech on the economy Feb. 17, Mr. Clinton hopes to persuade voters to forget his stumbling start and think instead about issues that surveys show continue to resonate with voters.
"You'll see action on ideas like health care, welfare reform, reciprocal service and the responsibility of people to give something to their country," said one close Clinton adviser. "All of that is solid middle-class, value-based agenda."
If this approach works, his advisers hope that most Americans will have trouble remembering the name of Zoe Baird, his failed nominee for attorney general, let alone the battles lost with Senator Sam Nunn and Gen. Colin L. Powell over the ban on homosexuals.
By moving quickly over the trouble spots and on to the subjects he wants to build his Presidency around, one Clinton adviser said the President plans to "shut down one kind of conversation" and shift to another.
 
Focus on Leave Bill
 The first order of business next week will be to win Congressional passage of the family and medical leave measure that Mr. Bush vetoed and that Mr. Clinton has pledged to sign. That measure is expected to be voted on in the House and Senate this week.
White House officials said that Mr. Clinton was also planning to name a welfare task force that would begin to put meat on the bones of the President's campaign pledge to "end welfare as we know it" and satisfy moderate and conservative Democrats who had feared the White House was backing away from the issue.
And in appointing his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, to run a task force on health care that is charged with presenting a comprehensive plan to Congress within his first 100 days in office, Mr. Clinton has signaled the importance of yet another social issue.
"People are fascinated with Hillary Clinton," said Mandy Grunwald, a political consultant who advises the Clinton White House. "And that fascination is now attached to an issue that they have a deep concern about. Anything about the economy and anything about health care is listened to with much more acute ears."
 
Meeting With Governors
 The President plans to use the annual winter meeting of the nation's governors, a old favorite platform, for his announcements this week. He has invited the Governors to a two-and-one-half-hour private meeting on Monday and will speak at the meeting's plenary session on Tuesday.
"His agenda's their agenda," one state official said. "It's all domestic policy, welfare reform, Medicaid, infrastructure. There's a close alignment on the issues."
But the Republicans do not plan to cede the stage to Mr. Clinton so easily, and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader, made clear that he intended to do his part to keep the spotlight trained on the Administration's mistakes.
The Clinton forces are already preparing their defense should Senate Republicans, as expected, attempt to make the gay ban law by attaching it to the family leave bill with the hope that the President will be forced to sign a provision he opposes or veto a bill he dearly wants.
It is important to Mr. Clinton that he snatch the spotlight back. In his news conference on Friday, Mr. Clinton made it clear that he longed to return to a different set of priorities.
"My Administration came to this city with a mission to bring critical issues of reform and renewal and economic revitalization to the public debate, issues that are central to the lives of all Americans," Mr. Clinton said in a statement that was little noticed amid the uproar over homosexuals in the military.
Geoffrey Garin, a veteran Democratic consultant who does not work for the White House, said Mr. Clinton had a good chance to turn the discussion around and determine what news headlines will say about him in coming weeks.
"The next two weeks are an incredibly important two weeks," Mr. Garin said. "It is important to set the stage for the announcement of his economic program. He has to give people a way to think about it, define the terms of the debate and ultimately that will occur.
"There is a lot riding on the next two weeks," he added. "In some respects, it is to Clinton's advantage to play to that drama."

HEADLINE: $105 Million Poorer Now, Chain Mends Race Policies

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NASHVILLE, Jan. 29

 BODY:
For more than 20 years, some of its employees charged, the Shoney's restaurant chain deliberately shunted blacks into low-paying and low-visibility jobs when it hired them at all and clearly showed a preference for white servers, cashiers and managers.
This week the Nashville-based company was spared a trial on the accusations when a Federal judge in Florida gave final approval to a consent decree ending a four-year lawsuit over racial discrimination in hiring. 
 Without admitting wrongdoing, Shoney's Inc. agreed to pay $105 million over the next five years mostly to an estimated 10,000 blacks who either worked for or were denied employment by the company in the last seven years, according to the company and terms of the settlement. Some white employees who were dismissed for not following orders to dismiss blacks will also receive money.
The settlement is described by lawyers and industry analysts as one of the nation's largest in a racial discrimination suit.
 
'A Changed Company'
 Taylor J. Henry Jr., Shoney's chairman and chief executive, said that even before the settlement the company was changing. "The suit focused our priorities on doing what is right," he said in an interview. "We are a changed company, and we regret any mistakes we made in the past."
The settlement, tentatively reached last November, was negotiated by the company, private lawyers and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which represented the employees as a class. Judge Roger Vinson of Federal District Court in Pensacola, Fla., approved it on Monday.
The suit, filed in 1989 by several Shoney's employees in Pensacola, charged that the chain's founder and former chairman, Raymond L. Danner, ordered managers to dismiss blacks when he believed that there were too many employed at a particular restaurant and that he once offered to match any employee's contribution to the Ku Klux Klan. They said Mr. Danner, 68 years old, frequently used racial slurs when referring to black workers.
 
Items in Settlement
 The settlement, which covers the period from Feb. 4, 1985, to Nov. 3, 1992, could mean as much as $100,000 each to some original plaintiffs. The amounts for others will depend on how long they worked for Shoney's or how many times they applied for employment or promotions and were denied.
In addition, the settlement calls for the company to embark upon an aggressive affirmative-action program in hiring and promotions over the next 10 years. The plan sets goals that the company must reach in staffing its 759 company-owned restaurants. It envisions blacks accounting for 20 percent to 23 percent of managers and assistant managers and 3 of the 25 regional directors by 1998.
The company owns or franchises 1,803 restaurants in 36 states under the names Shoney's, Captain D's, Lee's Famous Recipe Chicken, The Fifth Quarter and Pargo's. The consent decree covers only the company-owned restaurants.
Kerry A. Scanlan, a lawyer with the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund who worked on the case, said one of the most significant aspects of the settlement was the program to seek out black applicants for entry-level positions, because Shoney's has historically promoted its managers from within the ranks.
"It is a field where you can, with little education and a lot of hard work, work your way up to a management job and make an extremely good salary," Mr. Scanlon said. "This is a part of our economy that is going to grow and where jobs will be secure."
Dewitt Nelson, one of the original plaintiffs, was dismissed from Shoney's in 1989 after four years' work in the kitchen. He said that although the settlement came too late for him to advance at Shoney's it "will let some other black people be promoted."
Terry Toney, who had managed one of the company-owned restaurants here and who is one of the whites likely to participate in the settlement, said he learned from Mr. Danner personally the company's attitude toward black workers.
Mr. Danner stated his "philosophy" of keeping the number of black employees in line with the proportion of black customers, Mr. Toney said in a recent interview, and "shortly thereafter he fired me because I didn't do what he told me to and I didn't fire some black employees."
 
An Active Boss
 Mr. Danner, a former professional musician and tool and dye maker, grew up in humble circumstances in Louisville, Ky., and built the company from a single Shoney's Big Boy restaurant in Nashville in 1959 into a $1-billion-a-year business. Court papers depict him as a man with an intense management style who was known to visit his restaurants unexpectedly and pitch in if they were very busy or close them temporarily if he found them unsatisfactory.
Shoney's said Mr. Danner would not comment on the settlement, but according to his own deposition in the suit, he was not shy about sharing his theories about hiring blacks.
"I have on occasion given my opinion that a possible problem area was that the specific store in question had too many black employees working in it as compared to the racial mix of the geographical area served by the store," Mr. Danner said in the deposition.
According to a deposition by Mike Vinson, a manager of Shoney's restaurants in the Prattville, Ala., area, managers with what were considered too many black employees in serving positions were often told with a wink that it was to "too cloudy" in the restaurant and were directed to "lighten it up some." At other times, another one white manager, Daniel Gibson, said in his deposition, Mr. Danner was blunter, saying, "I don't like niggers, and I don't want to see them in my stores."
As a result, lawyers for the plaintiffs said, blacks accounted for 38.6 percent of Shoney's kitchen workers in 1989, 8.4 percent of its servers, 3.7 percent of its mid-level managers and trainees and 1.8 percent of the managers.
Mr. Henry, the chairman, would not comment on the accusations against Mr. Danner. He said that in recent years Mr. Danner had removed himself from the company's daily operations though he remained on its board. He also said that since the suit was filed Mr. Danner had done much to aid civil rights groups and historically black colleges.
Thomas Warren, a Pensacola lawyer who filed the original suit, said the company "had made an enormous change in a positive way" even before the settlement. For example, he said, it now has about 10,000 black employees scattered throughout the company, whereas three years ago there were only 5,000, concentrated in lower-paying jobs.
"The tone of the negotiations and their willingness to agree to some rather overbearing provisions tell me that this company has learned that they don't want to go through this again," Mr. Warren said. "I'm optimistic and excited about what we can do in the way of affirmative action over the next 10 years."

HEADLINE: Democrats Live It Up (a Bit) Before Biting Bullet (Maybe)

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BALTIMORE, Jan. 29

 BODY:
Aside from the coq au vin dinner, the twist contest and the spectacle of Dan Rostenkowski carousing in a conga line with a tablecloth draped over his head, this year's House Democratic retreat was hardly any fun at all.
The Representatives and their spouses were invited by their leaders to cut loose a bit and to celebrate the envisioned end of gridlock on Capitol Hill. But the two-day conference at Johns Hopkins University that ended on Friday was a party that only a policy maven untethered to electoral politics could love. 
 The food and the disc jockey were good, but the news was bad: The country is saddled with high debt, low savings and workers who do not produce enough. And in a reversal of the logic most Representatives find easiest to follow, lecturers opined that taxes are too low and spending is too high.
The 150 Representatives who attended the conference here heard one senior member of the Administration after another plead with them to swallow the bitter medicine of austerity. "There will be tough votes ahead," Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen told the gathering Thursday night. "If we wait it may be too late."
 
Liberal Grumbling
 More than a few liberals grumbled that their leaders were forgetting why they had become Democrats.
Representative Anthony C. Beilenson of California, a member of the Budget Committee, was downright caustic after hearing Mr. Bentsen. "It is poetic justice," he said, "that he's in charge of economic problems his votes helped create. He, like half the Democrats in Congress, voted to cut taxes and raise defense spending."
Still, the Democrats demonstrated that they were becoming attuned to the new mood of austerity and the public outcry against perks. The retreat was less stylish than in the past: meals were served in a gymnasium.
Lobbyists were prohibited from attending. They used to pay $6,000 to join the merrymaking, and their money was used to finance it.
While entertainment was not lavish, the sock hop Thursday night was definitely outside-the-Beltway boisterous. As a disc jockey ushered the Representatives through various chorus line dances from the hokeypokey to the electric slide, he urged them to "grab a peer; it will help."
The lawmakers dutifully swung into action. Representative Jack Brooks of Texas took Mr. Rostenkowski of Illinois, a fellow committee chairman, into his arms for a minute before Representative Dick Swett of New Hampshire broke in to dance what looked like a tango with Mr. Rostenkowski.
 
Lots of Wiggle Room
 Representative Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn tossed M & M's in the air while dancing and caught them in his mouth without missing a beat.
"Is this on C-Span?" Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the majority leader from Missouri, asked in a tone of amusement mixed with concern. "If we can get them to do this, then we can get them to vote for the budget!"
Maybe yes, maybe no. The twist contest might have been a metaphor for the turf battles in the House. Mr. Brooks, Mr. Rostenkowski, Mr. Gephardt and Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, appointed themselves judges.
Mr. Dingell unilaterally disqualified Mr. Rostenkowski from the contest for conflict of interest. Mr. Rostenkowski twisted anyway, and the other chairmen overturned Mr. Dingell's ruling. Putting seniority above dancing talent, they awarded Mr. Rostenkowski an honorary prize.
With their memories of the sock hop still fresh, the lawmakers gave a standing ovation this morning to Leon E. Panetta, who left the House and the chairmanship of its Budget Committee to become President Clinton's Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Acknowledging the cheers, Mr. Panetta said, "That's not going to change the news I have to give you." He went on to urge the slashing of Government bureaucracies and a retooling of welfare and entitlement programs benefiting retirees that Democrats have worked to expand since the New Deal.
"There can be no smoke and mirrors," he said. He reminisced how as a Congressman he had hated to cast unpopular votes, but added: "There's no choice here. We must make choices we have avoided the last 12 years."
House leaders joined Administration officials in voicing the view that Mr. Clinton could be a one-term President if Democrats do not unite quickly to put the budget in order. But the liberals remained unconvinced.
"The deficit is an excuse for not taking action," said Representative Ronald V. Dellums of California, the new chairman of the Armed Services Committee. "You put people to work and you'll start bringing down the deficit."

HEADLINE: Officials Say Redrawn Census Area Will Affect Federal Spending

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ

 BODY:
The Federal Government is redefining the boundaries of the New York metropolitan area to include far-flung suburbs, a little-noticed move that Government and health officials say could cost hospitals in New York City $121 million a year and could make thousands of New Jersey and Long Island residents ineligible for Federal housing subsidies.
The change, which lumps Long Island, northern New Jersey and one county in Pennsylvania with New York City in the same primary metropolitan statistical area, has raised a storm of protest among public officials and civic leaders. They say the new district could affect Federal aid because it will alter statistics, such as the cost of living and labor costs, used in allocation of Federal funds. 
 Medicare payments, for example, are linked to a wage index for the metropolitan area. The city and New York counties have higher hospital labor costs than the northern New Jersey and Pennsylvania counties, hospital experts said. If the new metropolitan area is imposed, the wage index would go down for the New York areas and up for the New Jersey and Pennsylvania counties.
Many officials have questioned why the Federal Office of Management and Budget has expanded the New York metropolitan area to include rural and suburban counties that do not wish to have their identities overwhelmed by the city.
 
A Rejected Recommendation
 Although revisions in the metropolitan statistical areas are done every 10 years, after new Census figures become available, the reasons for this change remain controversial. Many statisticians and planners say they are particularly puzzled because the 1990 census figures did not suggest a need to re-draw the boundaries.
"When I saw the definitions, I was taken aback by some of the gerrymandering," said Ken Shipp, a Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics employee who served on the advisory committee overseeing the process.
He and other committee members said they were surprised to discover recently that the final proposal rejected the committee's recommendation to keep Long Island and northern New Jersey as separate metropolitan areas.
A Government official involved in the process, who spoke on condition of anonymity, conceded that the new boundaries were flawed, partly, she said, the result of a job that was six months behind schedule. She said the Government was soliciting local opinion on the matter and would reconsider the situation by the end of June.
The process of redrawing metropolitan areas after each census is traditionally accompanied by controversy. This time around, after about eight months of meetings, the Office of Management and Budget announced last month that it had consolidated a number of areas across the country in what appears to be the most significant revisions ever.
 
Country's Largest Area
 Experts agree that the most striking revision was in the New York metropolitan area. While Nassau and Suffolk Counties, 13 New Jersey counties and Pike County in Pennsylvania had previously been grouped as part of eight separate metropolitan areas, the new arrangement joins them with the previous New York City metropolitan area, which included Westchester, Rockland and Putnam Counties.
Connecticut is not affected by the change. The other region most dramatically affected, officials say, is Boston.
The new metropolitan area is the largest in the country, with 17 million people, spanning 24 counties from Montauk, L.I., on the east to just beyond the Delaware River, across from northwest New Jersey, on the west. The New Jersey counties are: Bergen, Passaic, Hudson, Essex, Union, Morris, Sussex, Middlesex, Somerset, Hunterdon, Monmouth, Ocean and Warren.
Metropolitan areas, as used by the census, were first developed in 1950 as a framework for collecting, tabulating and publishing data by geographic area.
 
Impact on Hospitals Cited
 No comprehensive studies have assessed yet whether the new metropolitan definition would substantially affect the distribution of Federal money. At least one economist, Regina Armstrong of the nonprofit Regional Plan Association, in Manhattan, expressed skepticism that it would lead to much of a difference.
But several New York State and City officials said the most serious impact would be a severe drop in Medicare reimbursements to New York hospitals as a result of the changed metropolitan area.
According to calculations by the Hospital Association of New York State, the hospitals in New York City would lose $121 million in Medicare reimbursements, with municipal hospitals losing perhaps as much as $25 million of that. The association estimated that Long Island's hospitals would lose $11 million. Westchester, Rockland and Putnam Counties' hospitals would lose $18 million, the association said.
In turn, the Hospital Association said, the New Jersey and Pennsylvania counties stand to gain about $150 million.
 
To Take Effect in October
 Judy L. Chesser, the director of the city's Federal Affairs Office, called the situation "totally unacceptable" and said the city would be working with the New York Congressional delegation to "reverse this catastrophe." The new funding formulas would take effect in October.
Long Island and New Jersey officials also speculated that a change in the borders of the metropolitan area could affect how they administer projects financed with Federal Housing and Urban Development money.
"It would be a mess," said Don Campbell, the Acting Housing Commissioner in Nassau County. "We would still receive the same amount but could spend it in fewer places."
For instance, Mr. Campbell and others said, community block grant programs that offer people assistance in buying homes often require that the buyer's income be no more than 80 percent of the median, or halfway point, for the metropolitan area.
If Long Island and northern New Jersey were joined with New York in one metropolitan area, the median income would fall significantly in Nassau and Suffolk Counties and in parts of New Jersey. Many suburbanites who were considered moderate or low income in the past would no longer qualify for such aid.
 
A Slap in Long Island's Face
 Aside from the impact on government funds, officials said the decision would have a devastating effect on their status as economic centers independent of New York. The lack of statistics specific to their areas would make it more difficult to attract business, they said, as well as make it harder for local planners to gauge trends in the subregional economies.
"It really does take away any identity from northern New Jersey," said Connie Hughes, director of the New Jersey Labor Department's data center. "People here are very upset." Local officials in New Jersey last week were studying the measure and trying to decide whether to fight it.
For Long Island, which rejoiced 20 years ago when the Federal Government allowed it to step out of the shadow of New York and designated it a separate metropolitan area, the announcement has been interpreted as a slap in the face. The Island's representatives in the House as well as both New York Senators have written to the Office of Management and Budget, objecting to the decision and calling for its reversal. Officials say they are optimistic that Long Island will be returned to its separate status.
Lee E. Koppelman, executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board, said: "Long Island -- with almost 3 million people -- has more population than 20 states, and to treat it like a tail to New York City is absurd. We are ready to go to war over this."
Some officials say the newly defined metropolitan area rightfully highlights an integrated economic region that has grown even more cohesive in the last decade. But they quickly added that the new arrangement was too large for statistical purposes.
 
Reasons for Change Confusing
 Dr. Koppelman contended that the redefinition was the last step in a 12-year trend, started under President Ronald Reagan, for the Federal Government to try to save money by limiting the amount of data it collects.
An Office of Management and Budget spokesman declined last week to discuss the motives for a decision that had been made under a previous administration, but several Government officials knowledgeable about the decision denied that cost-cutting was a factor.
It remains confusing why the change was made.
Several officials, who insisted on anonymity, explained the decision as follows: If Long Island and northern New Jersey were to retain their independent metropolitan area status, Federal rules required them to show local opinion in support of it.
These officials said that letters were sent on Oct. 1 to the Congressional delegations of these areas, warning that they would be merged with New York if no comment was received in 45 days. While members of Congress from other parts of the country answered similar letters, no one responded from Long Island, New York City or northern New Jersey, they said.
Other officials, however, questioned this interpretation of the regulations. They said that the Federal Government's timing did not take into account the fact that many of the Representatives from Long Island and New Jersey were retiring and almost all of the others were embroiled in tough re-election campaigns.
Dr. Koppelman called the explanation for the change "very suspicious."
"It's ridiculous to write to Congressmen in the final weeks of a campaign," he said. "What kind of response did they think they were going to get?"
"Why didn't they write to the regional planning board that's the most familiar with this issue?" he asked.

HEADLINE: Scoffing at Its Skeptics, Buffalo Prepares for University Games

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUFFALO

 BODY:
The last time this city held a major international event, the 1901 Pan-American Exposition, it ended in a catastrophe: President William McKinley was assassinated.
Now Buffalo is trying again. It is scrambling to prepare for the July 8 opening of the World University Games, the largest athletic event in the world this year. And there are predictions of a disaster, once again. 
 "It's about time people started realizing that it's a flop," Mayor James D. Griffin said two months ago. "I don't want no part of it. There's no way this isn't going to end up costing us money and a lot of pain."
The prediction echoes the skepticism that has become normal before international sports events. They are so expensive and complex that it seems impossible to prepare on time or recoup the investment. Some do; others don't. Sheffield, England, which was host of the last games in 1991, lost $18 million.
 
Hint of Personal Vendetta
 Organizers of the Buffalo competition acknowledge early management failures. But they say the criticism by the Mayor, an early supporter of the games, is little more than a personal vendetta reflecting the social and demographic tensions shaking the area's long-fixed political landscape.
The organizers say they are gaining momentum after a slow start, and predict a whopping success. They say the games, held every two years, which are expected to attract a worldwide television audience and 7,000 college-age athletes from perhaps 180 countries, will make Buffalo a sporting megalopolis and provide an economic and psychological boost.
"For the first time since the turn of the century, we will be showing the magnificent beauty of Western New York to the world," said the Erie County Executive, Dennis T. Gorski, one of the games' godfathers. "It's a big thing for us. We're not Washington or New York, the glamour cities. This is a vivid demonstration that Buffalo can compete toe to toe with any city."
A study prepared by Nichols Applied Management of Edmonton, Alberta, predicts the games and a concurrent cultural celebration will pump $150 million into the region by 1993, at a cost of $72.3 million to city, state and Federal governments. The company also concluded that the 10-day event would raise the national profile of colleges and universities in the area and provide a long-term stimulus to the area's economy.
 
Doesn't Like to Fly
 "We're going to be left with world-class facilities," said Kurt P. Alverson, president of the Greater Buffalo Convention and Visitors' Bureau. "That should bring us events and dollars for years to come."
Armed with the study, the Mayor at first supported efforts to win the games. Since he doesn't like to fly, he sent a deputy to help lobby the United States Olympic Committee and the International University Sports Federation, the Brussels-based governors of the games. "It is my pleasure to renew my support for efforts to bring the 1993 World University Games to Buffalo and Erie County," he wrote in a 1989 letter to the president of the federation.
But he had changed his mind by the time his 1991 race for county executive was in full wing. It was a vitriolic, personal campaign with the games as a focus. But the rancor over the event reflected long-repressed tensions from suburban flight, industrial decline and efforts to retool the recession-racked region into a service center, the gateway to metropolitan Canada and the Great White North.
Those conflicts simmered for decades as Buffalo decayed into a small-scale paradigm of urban crisis, a shell surrounded by whiter, richer suburbs.
 
A Generational Brawl
 But the campaign also was a generational brawl between Mr. Griffin's traditional neighborhood-based politics and the corporate government style symbolized by Mr. Gorski, an efficiency maven. Mr. Griffin, who at 63 is 15 years older and much gruffer than Mr. Gorski, has become a combative political fixture since his election 16 years ago. The County Executive, by contrast, is a newcomer, a polished, rising political star who was seeking re-election to a second term.
In their only face-to-face debate before the Democratic primary, Mr. Griffin accused his rival of lying; Mr. Gorski claimed that the Mayor allowed corruption and cronyism to run amok at City Hall. Mr. Griffin criticized Mr. Gorski for hiring high-priced executives to run the games and predicted they would be a "shambles"; Mr. Gorski responded that they would become the greatest event in the area's history.
"If Mr. Gorski thought it was good for Western New York, Jimmy Griffin probably thought it wasn't," Richard F. Gorko, vice president of business development for the Greater Buffalo Chamber of Commerce, said.
 
Self-Fulfilling Prophecy
 Primary night was an embarrassment for the Mayor. He was beaten 32 percent to 68 percent; Mr. Gorski even beat the Mayor by a 2-to-1 margin in Buffalo. But Mr. Griffin soldiered on, running in the general election on the Republican and Right-to-Life lines. He was trounced again, losing by 22 percentage points.
The Mayor, who this year seems likely to face the toughest re-election campaign of his career, only stepped up criticism of the games and predicted a bust. It seemed likely to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Although 12,000 Buffalonians had volunteered to work at the event, business leaders hesitated. So did sponsors. Local news organizations began focusing on the games' management problems. What began as a campaign to revitalize the depressed area seemed on the verge of collapsing.
But organizers now say they have turned the corner. They have reduced their budget to $34 million, one-third less than first planned. And they have begun to line up sponsors.
 
Financial Avalanche
 The best news for organizers was provided by New York Telephone and its parent, Nynex. In November they announced a $1 million challenge grant. While organizers must raise $7.5 million more in three stages to receive the entire grant, they say the grant has started a financial avalanche and that they will soon release the names of myriad more sponsors.
"Once the focus shifts away from the financial side and onto the athletes, I think people will become really excited," said Scott Brown, a spokesman for Mr. Gorski.
The Mayor may never be a vocal supporter of the event. But in recent weeks he has stopped his public criticism. "I promised I won't say another negative word about the games and I won't do it," he said in an interview. It was less than a ringing endorsement. But that is major progress for organizers.
"He doesn't have to love us; we would just like him to treat us with respect," said Burt P. Flickinger Jr., a local philanthropist and chairman of the games.

HEADLINE: From Well-Known Givers, Help for Neediest Fund

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
New York Mets fans may remember it as a nasty episode in a particularly demoralizing fifth-place season. During a game last September, the outfielder Vince Coleman became so incensed after striking out that he began arguing with an umpire and then got into a shoving match with his manager, Jeff Torborg.
When the Mets punished Mr. Coleman by suspending him for two days without pay, he filed a grievance with the players' union and the two sides went to arbitration. But after the season, the dispute was settled. The winner was The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. 
 Mr. Coleman agreed to drop his protest and the Mets returned to him the salary he lost during the suspension. He then donated that money -- $21,405.83 -- to the Neediest Cases.
"My wife, Lynette, and I are fortunate enough to have two healthy children," Mr. Coleman said from his home in Scottsdale, Ariz. "I'm just glad that the kids of New York will be able to benefit from the money."
 
Dozens of Notables
 Jay Horowitz, a spokesman for the Mets, said the ball club was eager to put the dispute behind it. "We're going into a new season," he said. "Both sides wanted to start anew. This was the best solution."
Dozens of other notables have donated to the fund during the current campaign, often as a gesture of thanks for their good fortune.
Peter Falk, the actor best known for his portrayal of Lieutenant Columbo, the bumbling-yet-brilliant sleuth, contributed $5,000. Chris Columbus, the director of "Home Alone 2," gave $20,000.
The tennis star John McEnroe, a veteran contributor, donated $10,000 through his foundation. Roger C. Altman, the new Deputy Treasury Secretary in the Clinton Administration, and his wife, Jurate Kazickas, sent $1,000. And the actor Tony Randall gave $1,000 in memory of his wife, Florence Randall, who died last April.
 
'Making Life a Little Better'
 Muriel Siebert, the first woman to buy a seat on the New York Stock Exchange, donated $10,000 to the Neediest Cases on behalf of her firm, Muriel Siebert & Company, a discount brokerage in New York City.
"Over the years," she wrote in a letter to the fund, "I have followed the annual drive and have had admiration for the perseverance that The New York Times has exhibited in its continuing and very difficult task of making life a little better for needy people."
Paul Newman, the actor and purveyor of salad dressing, spaghetti sauce and other foodstuffs, gave $50,000 to the fund through the company that he established with his longtime friend, the author A. E. Hotchner. The company, Newman's Own, donates all profits to charity.
Edgar M. Bronfman, chairman and chief executive officer of The Seagram Company Ltd., donated $5,000 after reading an editorial in The Times about Safespace, a residence for homeless teen-agers run by the Community Service Society of New York, one of the charities supported by the Neediest Cases. The Joseph E. Seagram & Sons Inc. Fund separately gave another $10,000.
 
Supports Seven Charities
 The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund supports seven charities that help tens of thousands of people. The Times pays the expenses for the Neediest Cases appeal, so all contributions are given directly to the charities. This year's campaign, the 81st, ends on Feb. 28.
Three men active in the civic life of New York City -- Felix G. Rohatyn, Andrew J. Stein, and Howard J. Rubenstein -- made contributions. Along with his wife, Elizabeth, Mr. Rohatyn, a partner at Lazard Freres & Company who is chairman of the New York State Municipal Assistance Corporation, donated $2,000.
Mr. Stein, the City Council President who has indicated he intends to challenge Mayor David N. Dinkins in the 1993 Democratic mayoral primary, sent $2,000. Mr. Rubenstein, the public relations executive who has advised Mayor Dinkins and worked to calm tempers in Crown Heights and other neighborhoods in New York City, contributed $1,000. He wrote that he hoped the money would "help ease some of the tense race relations fueled by economic distress and social need."
David McCullough, author of the best-seller "Truman," gave $1,000. "The Neediest Cases Fund is one of the most worthy and important of all campaigns in a city I love and depend on," he wrote.
And Howard Stringer, president of the CBS Broadcast Group, contributed $2,000 with his wife, Dr. Jennifer Patterson. "In a year of charity overload, sorting out targets for donations has been especially difficult," Mr. Stringer wrote. "Still, your remarkable fund continues to stand out, shorn as it is of middlemen. So here is our annual donation -- a drop in an increasingly overflowing bucket."

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
G.O.P. Seeks Identity and a Message

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, Jan. 30

 BODY:
Intent on erasing the bad memories from the Houston convention and the November election, the Republican Party met here in search of its identity.
But instead of departing today with new resolve, party leaders found themselves as balkanized by ideological disputes as the Democrats were after Jimmy Carter lost the White House in 1980. 
 The new watchwords of Republicanism were uttered repeatedly: "inclusion" and "diversity." Yet they sounded like empty sloganeering as an unusually timid Republican National Committee stayed clear of taking stands on issues that could further underscore its fissures.
In a contrast to the harsh tones at the Republicans' last big gathering in August, today members refused even to consider resolutions critical of President Clinton's pledge to lift the ban on homosexuals in the military or on abortion.
 
'Have to Stand for Something'
 About the only thing the membership could agree on this weekend was that Haley Barbour, a lawyer-lobbyist and veteran Republican insider, should be the new chairman, and even that took three ballots. It was a battle not over ideas, but who would make the best television spokesman and technician. (Mr. Barbour was nominated as a candidate who could "sit across from Bryant Gumbel and not let Bryant Gumbel get the best of him.")
"We must learn the lesson of 1992," Mr. Barbour declared in his opening address to the party today. "The lesson of 1992 is very, very clear, and that is: We Republicans have to stand for something. For us to succeed, for us to win elections, people have to know what we believe in, and why, and to feel like we will adhere to those principles."
But first, as Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader, put it, the new chairman must "sit down and find some common ground."
"I don't have any remedy," Mr. Dole said.
The party is still struggling for a unifying message. The religious right and moderate Republicans are locked in a tense state-by-state, precinct-by-precinct fight over the social agenda. And even mainstream Republicans are at war over fundamental issues like the economy, with Mr. Dole warning Republicans here about the "staggering deficit," and Jack F. Kemp, the former Housing Secretary, pitching a more populist, growth-oriented economic message to conservatives last week.
 
Warning on 'Zealotry'
 While the new party leadership sought to strike a harmonious public pose, the fact that Republicans are still mired in finger-pointing and recriminations was underscored in the valedictory address of Richard N. Bond, the departing chairman.
In an about face on Friday that reverberated through Republican ranks more than any speech he delivered when he ran the party, Mr. Bond called on Republicans to abandon their anti-abortion stand in the party's platform and to "not cling to zealotry masquerading as principle."
Mr. Bond said in an interview later that he had made the speech because he believed the party could rebuild itself only "if we have an honest, sincere and open discussion with those who disagree -- the sooner the better."
But at least for the short term, Mr. Bond's words seemed to encourage the factional disputes. "Rich Bond is advocating political suicide for the Republican Party," said David O'- Steen, executive director of the National Right to Life Committee.
 
'Big Tent' and 'Big Magnet'
 Like Mr. Bond, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas seemed intent on distancing himself from the Republican National Convention last August. Though Mr. Gramm was the keynote speaker at the convention, he sidestepped a question today about whether the August gathering made the party appear intolerant, insisting that the only convention speeches he recalled were President George Bush's and his own. "I didn't hear the whole convention," he said.
Even as he promoted his idea that the party update its "big tent" theme of inclusiveness by calling itself the "big magnet" party, Mr. Gramm refused to say whether that meant abolishing the Republican plank against abortion. "It is clear we are not going to have unanimity on that issue," he said, adding that the decision to alter the language was "something that's got to be decided by a vote of the delegates" at the next national convention.
Some Republicans took heart in suggesting that even if they do not make peace among themselves, they can resurrect the party around the notion, as Morton C. Blackwell, a committee member from Virginia put it, that "Mr. Clinton will be so bad."
The new Administration made good fodder for this gathering, as party leaders were not bashful in declaring that the new President's honeymoon was over. Though the rank and file was reluctant to take up the resolution on homosexuals in the military, both Mr. Barbour and Mr. Gramm, who is chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, attacked Mr. Clinton for playing politics.
 
'Pay Off a Political Debt'
 "The very first thing Bill Clinton did when he came into office is to pay off a political debt to a powerful special interest group, the Democratic Party, by saying our first national security priority is to lift the ban on homosexuals in the military," Mr. Barbour said.
In a hint of what the Democrats can expect from Mr. Barbour, who is a native of Yazoo City, Miss., he attacked Mr. Clinton with his trademark folksy anecdotes. This is how he described the new President's turnabout on his campaign promise of a middle-class tax cut:
"I tell you, it reminds me that they're very much like an armed robber who served a 12-year sentence in a penitentiary," Mr. Barbour said. "And now he gets out and the first thing he does, he knocks over the first liquor store he sees. I mean, that is exactly their mentality about this. They haven't been in office for a week and they've got five good new taxes they want to impose on the American people."
Perhaps because they are not accustomed to losing the White House, Republicans are borrowing from the rhetoric of the Carter years as they try to reposition themselves as the party of the people outside the capital. In 1976, Mr. Dole told Republicans, "We are a top-down party instead of a grass-roots-up party."
Today, 16 years later, Mr. Barbour spoke these words: "We have to understand that we are a bottom-up party; the Democrats are a top-down party."

HEADLINE: Status Issues Occupy Candidates

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 28

 BODY:
In many ways the two Republican candidates for New Jersey Governor have a lot in common. Both are moderates in the mold of former Gov. Thomas H. Kean. He is a well-paid partner in one of the state's most prestigious law firms, while she is a wealthy horse-country patrician. And both hired illegal aliens as domestic help.
But in the first days of the campaign to pick a challenger to Gov. Jim Florio, the two candidates, Cary Edwards and Christine Todd Whitman, find themselves fighting over just how wealthy and privileged they are. 
 And while other issues are certain to be heard as the campaign progresses, the debate over rank and class has produced a wealth of press coverage that neither would otherwise have attracted so early in the campaign.
 
The First Shot
 Mr. Edwards, who was State Attorney General in the Kean administration, fired the first shot with his campaign biography, which is headed by the quotation, "I know what it's like to struggle to make ends meet."
"I was one of the original latchkey kids," Mr. Edwards said in an interview, noting that his mother was divorced when he was 11. "I was a 19-year-old kid in Bergen County, and my working mother couldn't get a mortgage because she was a woman, and I signed the mortgage, 19 years old, because I was a man, and they would take my signature."
"Christie Whitman," he said, biting off the words sharply, "Christie Whitman never had to decide between paying the mortgage and paying for food. That is the difference in our backgrounds."
The words sound a bit incongruous in Mr. Edwards's Parsippany law office, surrounded by garnet leather and mahogany. Until he asked to be put on advisory status during the governor's race, he was the managing partner for New Jersey in the Manhattan firm of Mudge Rose Guthrie Alexander & Ferdon, once the firm of Richard M. Nixon and John Mitchell.
 
A Silver Spoon
 Mrs. Whitman, who grew up riding to hounds and shooting skeet on the family estate at Oldwick, goes head to head with the class issue, which grew hotter last week with the admission by both that they had hired Portuguese nationals as illegal domestic help. "I have been fortunate, privileged," she said as she formally announced her candidacy at one of three stops in the state on Jan. 26. "I don't apologize for it."
Asked if she would live in the newly refurbished governor's mansion near Princeton, she again said that she and her husband, John, a financier, were "privileged to live" on the family estate at Oldwick, and would probably have no need for the governor's mansion.
Nor, she said, would she accept the full $130,000-a-year governor's salary, although she said she had not settled on a figure. Governor Florio refused a raise and takes only $85,000 of the $130,000.
But while Mrs. Whitman, who ran strongly in a Senate campaign against Bill Bradley in 1990, vowed economy and an effort to roll back part of Mr. Florio's 1990 tax increase, demonstrators carried picket signs protesting the hiring of illegal aliens. "Jobs for New Jersey, Not Portugal," said one.
 
The Alien Issue
 Although a similar admission by President Clinton's nominee for Attorney General, Zoe Baird, forced her to withdraw, it is unclear how the issue will affect the campaign here. In the media-driven world of sound-bite politics, it could fade away, as both candidates acknowledge they hope will happen now that they have agreed to pay taxes on the wages paid to the undocumented workers. Or it could dog them through the June 8 primary.
Although another Republican might enter the race, experts expect one of the two to be Mr. Florio's opponent on Nov. 2.
"I've never said that Jim Florio will be a pushover," said Mrs. Whitman, echoing the new conventional wisdom about the Governor, who, even before both his potential opponents ran into trouble on the alien issue, was making a modest comeback in the polls after two and a half years of approval ratings below 30 percent.
A poll of likely voters in The Asbury Park Press three weeks ago showed the Governor trailing Mrs. Whitman by 6 percentage points, 36 to 30, and almost even with Mr. Edwards, who was preferred by 32 percent of likely voters compared with Mr. Florio's 31, with about a third of respondents undecided.
Given the margin of error of about 5 percentage points, that put Mr. Florio in a virtual dead heat with either opponent.
Governor Florio has been relatively quiet on the issue of illegal workers, saying only that he had never hired an illegal alien himself and expressing concern over people of privilege hiring undocumented workers.
Republicans, on the other hand, have tried to put the best possible face on it. Virginia Littell, the party chairwoman, said the issue was moot and predicted it would have little effect on the election.
 
The Economy, Kean Says
 Former Governor Kean, now the president of Drew University and the Republican Party's most respected elder statesman, said he thought the issue would fade and the campaign turn to broader issues of government.
"In the end, it will be a debate over taxes, the economy, education," Mr. Kean said.
For their part, both candidates said they wanted to run on the issues, Governor Florio's stewardship of the state being the major one, not least the $2.8 billion in new taxes he pushed through the Legislature.
But both are also putting first things first, and the first hurdle is the June 8 primary. "I think it will a very tough primary," Mrs. Whitman said. "I respect Cary as a campaigner."
Mr. Edwards said, "I like Christie Whitman. I just don't think she should be governor."
He has accused her of threatening cuts in he state's Homestead Rebate program, which was greatly expanded by Governor Florio, then promptly slashed by more than half by the Republican Legislature in a tax backlash a year ago. He has also accused her of insensitivity in money matters.
Mrs. Whitman denies urging further cuts in the rebates and lumps Mr. Edwards into the category of "career politicians who will say or do anything to get elected."
Both candidates say that the women's vote will be critical in the primary, and Mrs. Whitman maintains that her candidacy has already forced Governor Florio to appoint 16 women as judges. "I call them the Whitman judges," she said.
 
The Early Years
 Mr. Edwards's campaign biography dwells on his early years and that his mother, Virginia, "a gifted professional with a B.A. in psychology, was paid half what a man would have made as a social worker."
In an interview, he talks of his parent's separation and divorce when he was 11. "She paid $25 installments for five years to pay the lawyer's fee," he said. When she was 68 years old, he said, and he was a member of the State Assembly, she ran for the city council in Fairlawn, winning and going on to serve two one-year terms as Mayor in the mid-80's.
"I will not surrender one inch to Christie Todd Whitman because of her gender," he said. "I fought for the equal rights amendment and have been on the forefront on women's and family issues."
Mr. Edwards's first foray into politics came in 1975, when he was elected to the Oakland Borough Council. The next year he won a seat in the State Assembly. He was Governor Kean's legal counsel from 1982 to 1986, and his Attorney General from 1986 until he resigned in 1988 to run for Governor, running second in a crowded primary to Representative James A. Courter, who was defeated by Jim Florio. While Attorney General, Mr. Edwards pursued environmental issues aggressively.
Mrs. Whitman, 46, was a member of the Somerset County Board of Chosen Freeholders from 1983 through 1987, and served as the president of the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities in the Kean administration from 1988 to 1990.
Her father, Webster Todd, who died in 1989, was a chairman and fund raiser for the Republican Party in New Jersey, and her mother, Eleanor Todd, who died in 1990, was a Republican national committeewoman.
 
A Sacrificial Lamb With Teeth
 She was a relative unknown when she took on the formidable task of running against Senator Bill Bradley in 1990, but stunned everyone by nearly unseating him with 49 percent of the vote to Mr. Bradley's 51 percent. She sensed his aloofness and the voters' resentment of that and campaigned aggressively. Nominated virtually as a sacrificial lamb, she ran more strongly than anyone had expected.
She has been running for governor ever since, under the aegis of a political action committee she called Citizens for an Affordable New Jersey.
In her 1990 race, she put her net worth at between $700,000 and $1.3 million. Her husband, John Whitman, then chairman and chief executive officer of Prudential Bache Interfunding, a group that financed leveraged buyouts, reported a net worth of between $1.5 million and $2.7 million.
Mr. Edwards, who did not release a financial statement in his 1989 primary run for governor, would say only that his net worth is "less than seven figures," or a million dollars.

HEADLINE: THE GAY TROOP ISSUE;
Compromise Dampens Republican Hopes on Ban

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
Efforts by Republicans in the Senate to retain a ban on homosexuals in the military have apparently lost momentum since President Clinton announced a compromise Friday that delays a final resolution of the issue for six months.
Saying they have a winning political issue, Senate Republicans said they still hope to add an amendment codifying the current ban to legislation providing family and medical leave. But they acknowledged that they lost crucial votes for such an effort when Mr. Clinton and Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, reached an agreement in which the armed forces will stop asking recruits about sexual orientation while continuing discharge proceedings for homosexuals until the Pentagon drafts a new policy in six months. 
Mr. Nunn, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, was preparing to offer a compromise amendment of his own that would put the agreement into law, senior Democratic aides said. Should the Republican effort stumble completely, Mr. Nunn may not offer the amendment at all.
 
'Smoke-screen Compromise'
 "The Democrats may have the votes because of this smoke-screen compromise," said Walt Riker, a spokesman for Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican minority leader. "The Democrats have figured out a way to string everyone along."
Senate Republicans will meet on Tuesday to discuss an amendment, which would be offered in the full Senate and voted on separately from the family leave bill. The family leave bill is expected to be the first measure to come up for a vote next week.
However, Republicans seem divided over the wisdom of emphasizing a social issue like homosexuality after an election in which voters demonstrated far more concern about the economy.
Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, the Republican Senate whip, appeared to distance himself from the effort to codify the ban. "That will not necessarily be a Republican strategy, and it's not one that will be totally agreed upon by Republicans," he said today. "I have heard of no strategy for all Republicans."
Nonetheless, on Friday, some Republicans who favor an amendment proclaimed that Mr. Clinton had put his own legislative program in jeopardy by fulfilling a campaign pledge to a sector of the American public that is out of step with mainstream thinking.
"President Clinton's statement that his mind is made up makes a mockery of real consultation," said Senator Daniel R. Coats of Indiana, a Republican member of the Armed Services Committee. "He is acting on the assumption that this policy will eventually be abandoned, but that conclusion is premature and high-handed."
Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, said: "I can assure you that the Joint Chiefs of Staff could have gone for an eternity without ever considering this problem. It was the President, in the commitment he made to a special interest group, that brought this problem to a head."
 
Seeing an Advantage
 White House officials said they doubted Senate Republicans could attach the ban to family leave legislation, and they were prepared to seize whatever political advantage they can from criticizing the Republicans as trying to block legislation that is overwhelmingly popular with families with two working parents.
George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director, said that the Administration plans to do little lobbying on the military issue over the next six months other than to stand by Mr. Clinton's general commitment to the elimination of the ban on homosexuals.
"As the process goes on and people lose some of their worst fears, it's possible to reach some agreement," he said. "And if not, we still stand by our principles."
Senate Democrats appeared as divided as the Republicans on the issue. Conservatives, especially those who serve on the Armed Services Committee, are reluctant to saddle the military with new rules that they fear could will hurt morale and combat effectiveness. But they are equally apprehensive about confronting Mr. Clinton, especially so early in his term.
A senior aide to a Democratic member of the Armed Services panel said conservative Democrats feel they have been let off the hook by the Clinton-Nunn compromise, at least for six months. Over that time, the committee will hold hearings in which witnesses favoring restrictions on homosexuals in the military will be given the opportunity to make their case.

HEADLINE: SUPER BOWL XXVII;
Where the Roman Numerals Dance With the Dollar Signs

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
When Super Bowl XXVII, between the Dallas Cowboys and the Buffalo Bills, kicks off this evening it will renew an American rite of sports and marketing that was born in relative modesty but has grown to be the undisputed champion of sports extravaganzas and a testament to cash and cachet.
"It's almost anti-American not to be a viewer of the Super Bowl," said Dick Enberg, who will announce the game for NBC-TV.
 
One Big Living Room
 At least 100 million viewers across the country (worldwide estimate: 750 million) will tune in the Super Bowl, with an expected kickoff at 6:18 P.M., Eastern time. Diehard fans will start the ritual with what amounts to a two-and-one-half-hour television tailgate party. 
 Between commercials, NBC's pre-game host Bob Costas (estimated annual salary: $2 million) will entertain viewers with features, interviews and endless reasons why this Super Bowl cannot be missed. After the 150-minute appetizer, Mr. Costas will hand off to Mr. Enberg (estimate: $1.5 million) and Bob Trumpy (estimate: $300,000), at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif., and after two weeks of hyped-up anticipation, the game, which has rarely lived up to its billing, will begin.
"I've never been more nervous than at the Super Bowl, what with the size of the audience," said Mr. Enberg. "The great bulk of the audience doesn't watch football all season."
It is that audience that induces television networks to bring out their heavy technical artillery, compels advertisers to spend millions of dollars to court consumers with splashy commercials, often to unveil new products, and motivates cities to grant sweetheart deals to pro football in order to bring tens of thousands of visitors to their environs.
The Super Bowl is expected to be a small, much-needed profit center for the network, which is paying $752 million to the National Football League for its share of a four-year contract.
Making it worthwhile for NBC, which has lost about $80 million on its pro football investment in the first three years of the pact, will be such advertisers as Pepsi-Cola, Subaru of America, Frito-Lay, Nike, Anheuser-Busch and Gillette willingly spending $850,000 for 30-second commercials, up $50,000 from 1992.
A rare chance to tap into the nexus of 100 million beer-drinking, soda-sipping, chip-munching, car-buying consumers -- a World Series game draws about half the viewership -- means paying a price that dwarfs the second-highest amount paid for prime-time advertising, $310,000 for 30 seconds on CBS's "Murphy Brown."
Put another way, it will cost $28,333.33 per second -- and hundreds of thousands of dollars in production costs -- to introduce Crystal Pepsi, Subaru's Imprenza line and Nike's Michael Jordan-Bugs Bunny commercial.
 
A Capacity Audience
 Advertisers cannot reach a critical mass of 100 million in any other programming, and to divide their expenditures into several shows over a month's time would distill their message. How sure an investment is it? Of the 25 top-rated programs in television history, 12 have been Super Bowls.
Bringing a Super Bowl to a city (this is the fifth visit to Pasadena) is big-time politics. And money. The Super Bowl XXVII Host Committee in Pasadena spent an estimated $250,000 in beating out other cities to be the host.
Why? Cash pouring into the Southern California economy is expected to top $83 million -- including $58.4 million from visitors -- 66 percent greater than the spending at last year's site, the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, where winter limited Super Bowl tourism to the great indoors.
"The message of the Super Bowl being in the Los Angeles area?" said Rich Perelman, the host committee's director of communcations. "With the Michael Jackson halftime show and the associated Heal L.A. project, and all the attention on this area, it says we're still here. It's still sunny. It's still fun."
 
No Rent at the Rose Bowl
 So prestigious is the Super Bowl's presence that the Rose Bowl, owned by the city of Pasadena, will get no rent, a largess that has become de rigueur for Super Bowl hosts. With 103,000 seats sold at $175 apiece (one price fits all), the N.F.L. will realize $17-$18 million in gate receipts.
In and around the Rose Bowl, about 100,000 20-ounce cups of beers will sell for $6 apiece, 55,000 hot dogs will go for $2 and 6,000 slices of pizza will be consumed for $2.50 apiece. Commemorative T-shirts will sell for up to $28, and sweatshirts for $65..
The N.F.L. is spending between $12 million and $15 million on its big Pasadena adventure. It pays the winning team expenses of $1.2 million and the losing team $960,000. Each of the 90 rings for players and staff of the champion team cost $4,000; the losers' rings cost $2,000. A replica of the Vince Lombardi Trophy for the winning team to tote home to Buffalo or Dallas costs $20,000 to $23,000, depending on the price of silver.
Members of the champion team will get 90 winner's shares worth $36,000, while losers will get 90 shares of $18,000. The shares have been unchanged since 1982, frozen because of the absence of a labor agreement between the owners and players. Although shares should increase significantly now that labor peace has been achieved, the football figures for this year compare badly with those of the World Series champion Toronto Blue Jays, who received $114,962 for a full share, and the runner-up Atlanta Braves, who got $73,323.
 
A Theme Park, Too
 The league is spending $2 million to stage the N.F.L. Experience, a pigskin theme park adjacent to the Rose Bowl that is offering free attractions -- once you pay an admission fee of $10 at the door ($5 for children). The amusements include games to test fans' football skills, chances to pose in authentic uniforms and player autographs.
If the Super Bowl is a money magnet for the city it is played in, it is also a lure for gambling. The Super Bowl is the single biggest sports betting event in Nevada, with virtually every angle, from who wins the coin toss to who will win, available for wagering.
Last year, when the Washington Redskins trounced the Bills, 37-24, $50.3 million was bet at the 104 licensed sports books in Nevada, but the legal bookies kept only $301,280, according to the Nevada Gaming Commission.
The year before, a close 20-19 New York Giants victory over the Bills, saw $40 million wagered, with $3.5 million netted by the legal books. Of course, this figure is a tiny percentage of the total amount wagered illegally (estimate: $3 billion, with every dollar untold).

HEADLINE: The Nuclear Risk Shifts to Asia

 BODY:
After America and Russia agreed to radical arms reductions, the risk of nuclear war seemed to recede, to the relief of most ordinary mortals. But the risk may just have been relocated -- to South Asia, where India and Pakistan are careering along on a nuclear collision course. Turbulent politics in both countries may be accelerating the pace.
A standstill agreement between India and Pakistan, policed by mutual inspections, could arrest this dangerous development. But there may be precious little time left for the Clinton Administration to help arrange it. 
 India's ruling Congress Party has been quietly building the bomb, as well as a mighty military establishment. It does so at the expense of improving conditions for its people. That misjudgment only speeds India's disintegration.
Not to be outdone, Congress's Hindu fundamentalist rival, the Bharatiya Janata Party, is currying favor with nationalists by flaunting India's status as a nuclear power. "We don't want to be blackmailed and treated as oriental blackies," says a B.J.P. spokesman. "Nuclear weapons will give us prestige, power, standing. An Indian will talk straight and walk straight when we have the bomb."
In fact, the bomb could have the opposite result if neighboring Pakistan follows suit and builds its own; nothing could add more to India's insecurity. A Pakistani bomb seems more likely following the death of the Army Chief of Staff, Gen. Asif Nawaz, who was a prominent nuclear dove.
Pakistan still says it's willing to stop bomb-making if India does. India is balking. It claims it needs to deter China, whose untimely nuclear test last May did little to allay Indian fears.
The U.S. and others can induce India to cooperate. India wants improved political and economic ties with the U.S. and allies like Japan and Britain. They can be held up pending a favorable response on nuclear talks. Arms sales to India can also be slowed, although President Boris Yeltsin's announcement last week that Russia plans to proceed with sales of arms and rocket engines seriously weakens this leverage.
At the same time, India's security concerns can be eased if Pakistan puts its bomb-making on hold and China offers reassurances on India's border concerns. Neither neighbor will be safer with a nuclear-armed India.
Nuclear arms will do little to ease India's more pressing domestic needs. Nor will a display of nuclear pride do much for its prosperity and unity.

HEADLINE: Teen-Age Gangs Are Inflicting Lethal Violence on Small Cities

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark.

 BODY:
Around the intersection of 15th and Oak in the center of the town that just gave the country a President, the streets are lined with trees and small wooden houses with yards, the picture of an older Southern neighborhood. On a cold winter's day the sidewalks are empty except for a cluster of teen-agers who melt away as two strangers cruise by slowly.
The placid-looking corner is the city's most violent spot. With three killings there in four months last year, all in broad daylight, and six there or nearby in two years, it may be as dangerous as any place in America. Those disappearing teen-agers, it turns out, are gang members selling crack, and this is territory where rival gangs cross paths. 
 Little Rock, with a modest population of 177,000, is experiencing a big-city epidemic of gangs, guns, crack and murder. It had a record 61 murders in 1992, up from 52 in 1991 and an average of 37 over the five years before that. For the last two years, Little Rock's murder rate in relation to population has equaled that of New York or Los Angeles.
 
Teen-age Murders
 Since the mid-1980's, many smaller cities and towns have seen devastating increases in assaults and killings, led by a doubling in the murder rate among juveniles. Most of the killers and most of the victims are young black men.
Perhaps nowhere has the change been faster than here, for reasons no one can explain beyond the area's chronic poverty. "This hit Little Rock with the power of a sledgehammer," said Steve Nawojczyk, the county coroner, whose job includes picking up the bodies from the streets and who has made the study of teen-age gangs his avocation.
Mr. Nawojczyk (pronounced na-VOY-check) describes an evolution here that is typical. What were bands of delinquent teen-agers only four or five years ago, he said, have quickly grown into crack-selling gangs with caches of semiautomatic weapons.
In the last two years, drive-by shootings and what are known as walk-by shootings (for those too young to drive) have become common.
Most of Little Rock, about two-thirds white, one-third black, remains peacefully suburban. But a 20-block area surrounding Central High School, where Federal troops were sent to enforce desegregation in 1957, is now known to the police as the war zone. Mainly black and poor and infested with crack and weapons, this neighborhood and other areas to the east are riddled with gang graffiti, the coded boasts and taunts of Bloods and Crips, Vice Lords and Folks, names borrowed from Los Angeles and Chicago gangs with which some local groups are loosely affiliated.
To the initiated, the scrawlings tell menacing tales. On one wall is inscribed "187" -- the California penal code number for homicide -- someone's threat or declaration of achievement. On another is a pitchfork signifying the Folk Nation, and on another is "SLOB," the Crips' insulting name for the Bloods. More and more, too, does "R.I.P." appear, monuments to slain comrades.
With one crack gang lurking eight short blocks from the Governor's Mansion, Bill Clinton was well aware of the increasing violence and helped promote countermeasures like counseling and summer activities for teen-agers. But officials here have learned how hard it is to combat trends rooted in decades of poverty, rising teen-age pregnancies, broken families and broken communities.
 
Thousands Involved In Gang Culture
 Here, as much as in New York or Los Angeles, more and more killings seem senseless. Some involve fights over drug turf or drug deals, like the drive-by shooting of 18-year-old Cedric Fowler in August as he rode his bicycle at 15th and Oak. Some, like the nearby killing of 17-year-old Kevin Gaddy last February for his Sporter athletic jacket, seem more a reflection of greed and coldbloodedness.
Many shootings result from nothing more than gang bravado. Nineteen-year-old Kelvin Cohen had traded opposing gang hand signals with the occupants of a passing car when they opened fire, leaving him dead on the street in September. While residents of gang-plagued neighborhoods say they cower nightly to the sickening rhythm of gunshots, most people here, especially in the better-off area to the west, feel scarcely touched.
"Some people think it's a black issue, but it's everyone's problem," Mr. Nawojczyk said. "How many of these kids do you think have health insurance?" he asked, noting the burdens the violence was placing on city emergency rooms and the enduring expenses of those disabled by gunfire. He also noted that one of the most violent gangs is composed of white middle-class children in the southwest part of town.
Sharon Priest, who just stepped down as Mayor, said, "When you have kids shot in a drive-by shooting, that tends to get your attention." In 1991, as the violence rose, Governor Clinton called a meeting of civic leaders, and the county and city started several new youth programs as well as community policing. But the gangs were already well entrenched.
Mark Stodola, the chief prosecutor of Pulaski County, said his office had identified 41 named gangs in the county, most involving young black men but including at least two female gangs and a few white gangs. His new gang unit has identified 500 members by name, but thousands of teen-agers and young adults are believed to be involved to some degree.
With organized gangs so new here, most members are still young, with an average age of 16 or 17, as against 26 in Los Angeles, Mr. Nawojczyk said. Many say they were first drawn in at the age of 12 or 13. Some drop out of school or are expelled; others join their "home boys" after school.
The groups have neighborhood names, like Oak Street Posse, but most also identify with famous big-city gangs, taking on their colors, slang, secret rituals and hatreds. About half the local gangs identify with the Crips or their rivals the Bloods of Los Angeles, and half with the Folk Nation or rival Vice Lords of Chicago, Mr. Stodola said. In turn, the Crips and Folks, and the Bloods and Vice Lords, have formed alliances here.
For these youngsters, abstract rivalries take on mortal meaning. "The Slobs and Vice Lords are our natural enemies," said one 16-year-old, a member of a Folk Nation group, who therefore is forbidden from calling Bloods by their proper name.
Facing an attempted-murder charge, the youth attends Changing Directions, a special school for delinquent teen-agers run by the county juvenile agency. He admits to shooting two people, once in a car theft and once because "I was just being bad." He said he had always carried a gun on the street. "Somebody could end up doing something behind your back," he explained.
While the Little Rock gangs identify earnestly with big-city gangs, organizational ties between cities are often loose if they exist at all, Mr. Stodola said. A Los Angeles Blood may move to Little Rock or come for the summer, sent to stay with relatives by parents who thought they were removing him from trouble, only to form a new group here.
But in some cases, Mr. Stodola said, the big-city gangs use local affiliates as distributors for crack, which sells here for twice what it does in Los Angeles. The chance to make hundreds of dollars a day. enough to pay for clothes and jewelry and cars, is one of the prime appeals.
Gang members have disdain, though, for the "fiends," as they call their addicted customers, who include both whites and blacks of all income levels. Many gangs prohibit their own members from using crack.
Guns are widely owned in Arkansas, and gang members say they have little trouble getting them. Some steal or borrow a parent's weapon; others trade crack to addicts for guns obtained through burglary or bought legally. Gangs have obtained whole caches at once by crashing cars into pawn shops.
 
The Tilt of a Hat Can Prove Fatal
 Talking with gang members and those trying to turn them around makes it clear that the gangs offer what many teen-agers have missed in their own childhoods: family, rules to live by, power, respect. Boys who will kill without remorse use the word love to describe their bonds with their street friends.
Yet as exciting and expansive as it may seem to the members, the gang world is one of narrow horizons, bound by rigid adolescent notions of honor and retribution. An 18-year-old chief of a Vice Lord group described how easily a conflict can begin.
A few members might be sitting in a restaurant when a boy walks in with the brim of his cap tilted to the right -- a possible sign of Crip or Folk loyalty. "I'd say to him, 'Why do you wear it like that?' and ask him to straighten it or tilt it to the left like mine," said the 18-year-old, who would only give his street name, Kee Kee. If the boy gives the wrong answer, "there would be a battle."
What if the other boy was first to pull a gun? "If you're there for your cause, you don't think about that," Kee Kee said. "One day you're going to die anyway."
Kee Kee used to deal crack and served probation for robbing a boy of his jacket at gunpoint, then did community service for threatening a rival with a gun. But he decided to straighten out, he said, when he saw how his mother wept after his second arrest. Now he is back in high school, a senior, and works 30 hours a week at a Kmart for $4.55 an hour. "It ain't nothing compared to what I used to make," he said, "but I don't have to look over my shoulder."
He says he avoids criminal activity, but he remains in the gang and says he cannot make the others stop selling crack. As he spoke on a recent day, his Washington Redskins stocking cap -- two feathers in the team symbol form a Vice Lord "V" -- was carefully placed with the symbol to the left.
 
Last Stop Before Prison
 Carol Carlan, a former police officer who teaches "life skills" in the Changing Directions school to teen-agers who have been referred by the courts or expelled from school, describes her program as "the last-ditch effort before these kids hit the penitentiary."
No officials here have any doubts that for the most hardened youths there is no alternative to incarceration. But no one believes, either, that prison does more than keep them off the streets for a time; inmates often return to the community with deeper gang ties.
Social workers argue that most gang members are victims of circumstance themselves and that with enough close attention at least some can be helped to change.
Robert S. McCathern, who heads a youth project with New Futures, a nonprofit community group, took a group of gang members on a camping trip two years ago after a friend was killed. "They were seen as incorrigible," he recalled. But in unfamiliar terrain, with a sympathetic leader, their shells began to soften. "Beneath those hard exteriors were vulnerable children," he said.
Now, several young men from that original group work with Mr. McCathern trying to coax youngsters into legal, safer lives. Through group activities and therapy, Mr. McCathern said, they try to provide the emotional support the youths get from gangs.
"What scares me is that we no longer see the 13-year-old as a kid," Mr. McCathern said. "We just see the shootings.
The search for solutions is crippled by dismal economic conditions. Even without the allure of drug sales, minimum-wage jobs, which are all that many poorer youths think they can hope for, hold little attraction, and poor neighborhoods offer few good role models.
A visitor asked seven gang members from Ms. Carlan's class whether any had a brother, father or other male relative with a regular job. The question brought out nothing but embarrassed giggles until one gang member said he had an uncle who was planning to build a restaurant.
Those who go through Ms. Carlan's class have a standing offer of a job, at a local car wash. "They look at the wages and ask why they should work at a car wash or a McDonald's," Ms. Carlan said. "We say, Yes, but look at the outcome if you don't."

HEADLINE: Failings but No Solutions for Hartford Schools

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON

 BODY:
IN six weeks of testimony in State Superior Court in West Hartford, civil rights lawyers have presented a compelling case that something is deeply wrong in Hartford's public schools. In a state that prides itself on the quality of its public education, the capital's schools are failing to educate large numbers of children.
The lawyers do not blame Hartford. In a suit known as Sheff v. O'Neill, they name the state as defendant because it, not individual towns or cities, is responsible for public education under Connecticut's Constitution. And the state, they say, has not protected children in Hartford from the consequences of racial and economic segregation so extreme that 90 percent of the city's enrollment is black or Hispanic, and 63 percent is poor. 
 "You have the poorest of the economic poor, with the worst of the educational worst, in the highest of high racially impacted districts," a lawyer for the Sheff plaintiffs, John Brittain, said on the first day of the trial, Dec. 16.
But in a case that raises the prospect of a school-desegregation order covering the entire Hartford metropolitan area, the lawyers have yet to answer the question of what should be done about Hartford's segregated schools -- or, more to the point for many city and suburban parents, of what a plan linking Hartford schools to suburban ones would look like.
Instead, as the Sheff lawyers end their testimony and the state begins its defense, issues raised in court have been left to reverberate in an anxious debate led by radio talk-show hosts and contributors to letters-to-the-editor columns.
If one goal of the Sheff suit was to use a trial to educate the public, the lesson is in danger of being lost on many people who readily deplore the conditions in Hartford's schools, but who cannot comprehend solving in their own children's classrooms the social and economic problems that divide American society.
 
Problems Defined
 "They are spending an enormous amount of time and energy on defining the problem, but they have carefully avoided addressing the solution," said the chairman of the West Hartford Board of Education, John W. Lemega.
"To state there's a problem -- of course there's a problem," he continued. "It's the failure of the plaintiffs in Sheff to offer a solution that has significantly undercut the impact of their case."
Much of the testimony offered by the Sheff lawyers focused on the shortcomings in Hartford's schools: overcrowded buildings and classrooms with broken equipment, outdated textbooks and few supplies. Looming over all were stark measurements of failure: scores on state mastery tests and Scholastic Aptitude Tests that put Hartford at the bottom of the state's districts. The suit is named for the lead plaintiff, Milo Sheff, a 13-year-old Hartford eighth-grader who was the first student to testify at the trial.
Yet Hartford, unlike troubled cities in many other states, spends more per pupil than most of its suburban neighbors: $7,746 in the 1990-91 school year, $904 more than the state average. All that money produces so little, testified sociologists, teachers and principals, because so much must be spent not on education, but on addressing the poverty of Hartford's children.
 
Compensating for Poverty
 An undue share of the budget goes to psychologists, social workers, special education and bilingual teachers, health clinics and other special needs, many of which are required by the state, they testified. Even then teachers confront classrooms full of children who come to kindergarten already behind in their development, change schools frequently, and are often hungry or depressed.
"Children who are suffering from poverty bring other kinds of problems to the school system that we must compensate for," testified Hartford's deputy superintendent of schools, Charles Senteio.
"What we can do depends greatly on the children that you give me in my classroom," he said. "Hartford provides the best that it can with the resources it has. But it is impossible for us to provide what I'm going to term education at its fullest."
This dismaying catalogue of deficiencies had to be presented, to support the lawyers' contention that Hartford children are denied the equal educational opportunity promised by the State Constitution. And the issue of poverty was central to their argument that providing more money for the city's schools is not enough; the burden must be shared by more districts.
The effects of concentrated poverty are so disruptive to a classroom, witnesses said, that teachers cannot teach effectively. "Even when I had just 19 children, I had 19 problems," testified a retired bilingual teacher, Gladys Hernandez.
The plaintiffs and their lawyers acknowledge that by focusing on the city's problems they risked creating a portrait of schools so troubled that no parents would want their child to attend them.
 
Beyond the Courtroom
 The state itself has seized on the issue of poverty. If the poor outcome of Hartford's schools is the result of social and economic factors, its lawyers argue, a realistic solution cannot rely solely on schools; the proper forum is not a courtroom, but the General Assembly, which can also address issues like housing and transportation.
And while Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. has proposed that towns and cities across the state draft their own regional integration plans, lawyers for the state will have experts testify that mandatory desegregation plans drive middle-class white children out of public schools. The result is greater segregation not only by race but also by class, as those with the means to leave do so, while the poor remain.
The plaintiffs' lawyers have presented testimony from education experts on why Judge Harry Hammer should find in their favor, and testimony from desegregation experts on different kinds of plans that have been tried elsewhere.
The plaintiffs' lawyers have avoided outlining a plan themselves, in part perhaps because the numerous civil rights groups involved in the group are not in agreement on their ultimate goal.
 
Better Schools, Not Racial Balance
 The suit, after all, seeks two results: a better education for Hartford children by providing more resources, and a better education for all children in the metropolitan area by linking city and suburban schools. Many people in Hartford believe that winning better schools for their children is more important, if it comes to that, than winning integrated schools.
The plaintiffs also fear that offering a specific proposal would narrow, rather than open, public discussion on the issue. They do not want to be sidetracked by a hue and cry against forced busing, when that is their last choice, too.
In the end, outside the courtroom, they will have to make a sophisticated argument to self-interest: that Connecticut cannot afford to continue failing poor children in cities like Hartford, and that committing enough money to regional plans will improve schools for everyone. The goal is not racial balance, they will say, but better schools.
"We're sophisticated enough to say, if you just throw poor kids and rich kids together, that's not enough to make it work," said Jeffrey Forman, the assistant to Hartford's superintendent of schools, Josiha Haig. "The state will try to make it seem like that's all a judge can do."
 
Basics of the School Case
 At the heart of the school desegration suit known as Sheff v. O'Neill  are provisions of the State Constitution that guarantee equal rights, that allow people to sue if their rights are violated, and that make public schools the responsibility of the state. Here are the those provisions:
ARTICLE FIRST: Declaration of Rights.
Sec. 1. All men when they form a social compact, are equal in rights; and no man or set of men are entitled to exclusive public emoluments or privileges from the community.
Sec. 10. All courts shall be open, and every person, for an injury done to him in his person, property or reputation, shall have remedy by due course of law, and right and justice administered without sale, denial or delay.
Sec. 20. No person shall be denied the equal protection of the law nor be subjected to segregation or discrimination in the exercise or enjoyment of his civil or political rights because of religion, race, color, ancestry or national origin.
ARTICLE EIGHTH: Of Education.
Sec. 1. There shall always be free public elementary and secondary schools in the state. The general assembly shall implement this principle by appropriate legislation.

HEADLINE: THE GAY TROOP ISSUE;
After Just 11 Days, TV Issues Verdict on Clinton

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

 BODY:
If all honeymoons were like this, heart-shaped pools might never have been invented.
Just 10 days ago, Bill Clinton took the oath of office in a warm, exuberant burst of television coverage complete with blue skies, fluttering flags and gauzy shots of the Capitol dome. But no sooner had the President hung up his formal wear than the glow of the inauguration gave way to cold assessments of his first 100 hours. 
 After what may be remembered as one of the shortest grace periods in Presidential history, many in the news media were already pronouncing Mr. Clinton's Administration in serious trouble before he had even had a chance to unpack his position papers.
"From up close, the Clinton White House has looked like the 'Not-Ready- for-Prime-Time Players,' " Lisa Myers of NBC said two days after the new President was sworn in.
"He hit the ground back-pedaling," Fred Barnes said on CNN's "McLaughlin Group" after three days.
"It is just the first week of the Clinton Administration," Dan Rather said on CBS after seven days. "But oh, what a week."
 
A Rush to Judgment
 Gauging by the tone of the coverage, it took just a bit more than a day for Mr. Clinton to be converted from the inspiring leader of a new generation to an old-fashioned, embattled incumbent. This rush to judgment was apparent both in the print and the electronic media. But it was especially pronounced among the television pundits who, it seemed, could barely conceal their impatience for an opportunity to evaluate Mr. Clinton's performance.
Fortuitously, such an opportunity arose within 48 hours of Mr. Clinton's swearing in, when Zoe Baird, his choice for Attorney General, was forced to withdraw her nomination. The President had suffered his first official embarrassment. Among the pundits, Ms. Baird's sudden departure prompted much talk about how Mr. Clinton, once so attuned to his middle-class constituency, seemed to have lost touch with popular opinion.
Ms. Baird had not yet been forgotten when, appearing Sunday on the NBC News program "Meet the Press," the President's Treasury Secretary, Lloyd Bentsen, said that the Administration was considering a broad-based energy tax to reduce the deficit. This provoked much head-shaking over what appeared to be the President's backing away from his campaign pledge not to raise taxes on the middle class.
By Tuesday the debate about energy taxes had already been eclipsed by the growing public outcry against the President's efforts to allow homosexuals in the military.
On Wednesday, it was time to look back on the President's first full week in office. A casual viewer tuning into these sober retrospectives might have been forgiven for wondering if, like Mel Gibson in "Forever Young," he had somehow been frozen and missed the entire Clinton Administration.
In a feature titled "Reality Check," Eric Engberg of CBS, reviewed the President's first seven days, one blunder at a time. Mr. Engberg's conclusion: Mr. Clinton's "promise to focus on the economy like a laser seemed to come unstuck in the Washington centrifuge."
The political panel on NBC's "Today" show had a similarly gloomy assessment of Mr. Clinton's tenure.
"Well, if he's trying to get the Republicans overconfident, he's succeeding," said Al Hunt of The Wall Street Journal. "I think it's been a rough six or seven days."
To be sure, even at the end of the President's first seven days, there were those who said they did not yet have enough information to reach a conclusion about the new Administration. "This is not, it seems to me, a signature for the next few years," Tom Brokaw of NBC said. "We ought to judge him week by week."
But it was a sign, perhaps, of just how harshly Mr. Clinton was treated last week by the news media that it was left to Ross Perot, his once and potentially future rival, to offer the most vigorous defense of the new Administration.
Appearing on the CBS program "This Morning," Mr. Perot was asked by Paula Zahn whether he thought Mr. Clinton was faltering.
"I think it's too soon to tell," he replied. "You see you're up there all alone. You're like being inside of a barrel with everybody beating on it with sticks and hammers, and I'm sure he is just sort of stunned now with everything hitting him at once."

CORRECTION-DATE: February 7, 1993, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about television commentary on President Clinton's first 10 days in office referred incorrectly to "The McLaughlin Group." The program appears on some NBC and some PBS stations, not on CNN.

HEADLINE: 4 Upstart Carriers Find Niche at Newark Airport

BYLINE: By BARBARA STURKEN

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
INSPIRED in part by the economic woes of the major airlines, four new carriers have suddenly made an appearance at Newark International Airport in the last four months.
 Most of the newcomers -- three of which are already operating daily jet flights, with the fourth set to begin in March -- offer cheap fares but few frills; some even charge a fee for checking bags and encourage customers to take their own food aboard. And many of the new entries' employees once worked for airlines that no longer exist. 
All of which is reviving memories of People Express, the low-fare maverick that in the early 1980's transformed a shabby, underused terminal at Newark Airport into a mecca for affordable air travel.
 The airline was wildly successful at first, spawning a host of imitators, most of which later followed People into aviation history. The conventional wisdom since then has been that small airlines cannot survive in an industry dominated by a handful of huge companies like American and United.
 That assumption was called into question last fall when two new companies, Kiwi International and Skybus, began discount flights from Newark. Houston-based Ultrair, on the other hand, is offering what is billed as first-class service at coach prices. Family Airlines is scheduled to start cut-rate flights to the West Coast on March 1.
 Newark is the airport of choice for this new breed of airline for several reasons, including the size of the potential market. The New York-New Jersey metropolitan region "has the largest concentration of people who use air transportation in the world," with an estimated 68 million airline passengers a year at Newark, Kennedy International and La Guardia, said Robert Iverson, chief executive officer of Kiwi International.
 An upstart airline would have virtually no hope of obtaining landing rights at saturated La Guardia in Queens. Kennedy Airport is not considered a feasible alternative, Mr. Iverson said, since it is used mainly for long-distance and international flights.
 The new airlines face uncertain prospects.
 "History has shown that it is extremely difficult to make it in the long run," said Vincent Bonaventura, general manager of Newark Airport.
 For one thing, travelers are often leery of trying an unknown carrier. Glori Barchenko, a travel agent with VTS Travel in Secaucus, said that so far most of her clients had avoided the new lines. "They don't want to take a chance," she said.
 But the upstarts have some advantages. The large airlines have been losing record amounts of money, and of necessity are expected to increase their fares, while small airlines have lower costs and can afford to charge less. Most of the new airlines are staffed by airline veterans who contend that they have learned how to avoid the mistakes of their predecessors.
 The airline industry's current woes have, paradoxically, produced the most favorable climate for starting a new airline since the early 80's. The recession caused many aircraft to be idled, causing a 50 percent drop in the cost of leasing a used jet. New airlines can also draw on a vast pool of experienced employees who lost their jobs in the recent wave of airline failures.
 The price of jet fuel, another major expense, has dropped steadily in the last year or so.
 Regular users of Newark may benefit from the selective price cuts that typically follow a newcomer's arrival as established airlines rush to protect their share of the market. Soon after Kiwi started service to Atlanta, Chicago and Orlando, Continental and Delta lowered prices on flights to those destinations.
 
Kiwi International
 Kiwi International is the only one of the new airline companies that is based in New Jersey. On Sept. 29 it began operating three daily weekday round trips from Newark to Chicago and two from Newark to Atlanta and Orlando. It offers a reduced schedule on weekends.
 Kiwi advertises a "simplified" fare structure. For example, it charges $119 one way to Chicago, withno restrictions. One the same route, it also sells booklet of six one-way trips for $590, or $98.33 a trip.
 The airline's name, a reference to the flightless kiwi bird, is an in-joke of sorts. The airline was founded by a group of former airline workers grounded by airline failures. In 1989, Mr. Iverson, an Eastern Air Lines pilot for 18 years, joined other Eastern pilots in honoring a strike by machinists against the airline. Eastern went bankrupt and shut down altogether in January 1991.
 Kiwi's initial capitalization was about $7 million, all privately raised from employees. An additional $2 million has been raised from outside investors. Kiwi also received a $1.7 million loan guarantee from the State of New Jersey. The airline now employs 300 in the Newark area. Its headquarters are across from the airport.
 The airline has four Beoing 727 planes, formerly in use at Lufthansa German Airlines, which are configured to hold 150 seats, instead of the normal 177 for that type of jet. It plans to take delivery of more jets this year and to start service to Dulles Airport in Washington and to Buffalo.
 Mr. Iverson's strategy for avoiding the airline graveyeard is to limit service to a level that the larger airlines will tolerate. He says that because his airline's costs are abou 40 percent lower than those of the large airlines, it does not have to fill as many seats to break even. Recently, it had to fill only 75 to its 150 seats to start making money, he said.
 
Family Airlines
 Most of the pilots and flight attendants at Family Airlines, which is based in Las Vegas, Nev., hail from Pan American, which stopped flying a little more than a year ago. Barry Michaels, a former chiropracter who specializes in backing new companies, is the chairman. The airline is scheduled to make its debut tomorrow with nonstop flights from Newark to Los Angeles for $249 round trip and to Miami for $149 round trip.
 The airline will be using the jumbo Boeing 747's, redesigned to hold 500 all-coach passengers rather than the usual 400 or so in the three-class format.
 People Express tried the same strategy when it flew from Newark to London and Los Angeles for rock-bottom prices.
 Family can keep fares down by charging extra for meals and other amenities "that drive up operating costs," said Alan Loflin, a company spokesman, who is a former Pan Am official. Passengers who resist the extra charge will be allowed to take their own food aboard.
 
Skybus
 Skybus, which is run by Richard Dent, a former Pan Am pilot, began flying daily between Newark and Fort Lauderdale, Orlando and Tampa, Fla., on Sept. 30, with one-way fares of $99 or $119, depending on the time of the flight. It charges $1 for coffee or soft drinks and $5 for a sandwich. It is actually a charter operator, contracting with an airline called Private Jet Expeditions for use of a fleet of MD-80's that hold 165 passengers.
 Skybus, which is based in Fort Lauderdale, has applied to the Transportation Department for authority to become a scheduled airline. That will allow it to selel tickets through travel agents.
 
Ultrair
 Founded by Barney Kogen, formerly had of the Houston-based Lifeco Travel Agency, Ultrair is taking on Continental Air Lines by providing a more luxurious level of service at regular coach fares on two round-trip flights daily between Newark and Houston.
 The airline, which started out on Jan. 17, is putting only 89 seats on its 727's. There are two classes of service, coach and "ultra class." In coach, the rows are separated by 37 inches, versus 30 inches in standard coach seating. Meals are served on china, and passengers can choose from several entrees like a 16-ounce steak or grilled swordfish. Doggy bags are provided
 There are no discount fares availabel on Ultrair. The coach fare is $590 coach way, which is comparable to the full fare charged by the amjor carriers serving the route. If those4 fares are too steep for vacationers, that is the intention: the airline has advertised that it wants to offer a haven for business travelers from coach cabins crammed with families and crying babies.
 
Other Airlines>
 Yet another airline may soon arrive at Newark. Air Margarita, a Venezuelan line that currently exists only on paper, has asked the Federal Transportation Department for permission to start scheduled service between Newark and Margarita Island, off the Venezuelan coast.
 And then there is Carnival Air, which began service several years ago an a affiliate of Carnival Cruise Lines, carrying guests from Miami to the cruise line's resort, the Crystal Palace, in Nassau, the Bahamas. Carnival established a five-day-a-week service from Newark to San Juan, P.R., in 1991 and last month started scheduled daily flights between Fort Lauderdale and Newark for $99 one way.

HEADLINE: Helping the Homeless Believe in Tomorrow

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: HARRISON

 BODY:
THE homeless men in the shelter joked and bragged at the kitchen counter while dinner was being prepared. Talk was about the future. It had been a long time since this group had some real successes to boast about, much less futures to look forward to.
The men were former addicts, derelicts who once roamed the streets at night looking for crack and alcohol -- who no longer have "to duck the light, or duck anything or anybody," as one of them said. 
 Steven Rowe was behind the counter, a cook's apron around his waist. "A lot of people don't realize they're only a paycheck away from being here," he said. "Things can change very fast in life."
Mr. Rowe is 37 and has lived in the shelter for more than a year. He remembers his two children, a life that once held promise and a downhill spiral that finally put him on the street. Now he has gained control over his problems and has begun to plan for a job and living independently.
The good cheer and optimism in the 60-bed Volunteers of America shelter at the County Airport that afternoon was a feather in the cap of Westchester's social services system, which in recent years has stepped up efforts to return some of the county's homeless population to productive lives.
The Volunteers of America is one of more than 20 nonprofit organizations under contract with the County Department of Social Services to provide assessment, shelter and counseling services for the homeless in Westchester.
 
'Better Than Our Sister to the South'
 As New York City and the state come under fire for failing to deal adequately with the problems of homelessness, Westchester, too, has been struggling with the issue.
"I would not say we've solved the problem, but I think we're doing better than our sister to the south," said County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke.
The county's rate of homelessness last month -- 1 in 250 people -- was higher than New York City's, which was 1 in 306. But Westchester officials are developing a plan that they say holds promise for reducing its numbers -- in part because it offers the legions of homeless who seek refuge in the county's shelter system more than what social workers often refer to as "three hots and a cot."
Or as Mr. O'Rourke said, "You can't just stack up people like hardwood and give them a place to sleep, because they will still be there in the morning."
Although the county does not have figures for all of the homeless in the so-called assessment centers who have later been placed in permanent housing, statistics from the airport shelter suggest that the county's plan for rehabilitating the homeless may be working. Nearly a third of the 363 single men assigned to transitional housing there last year were able to move into permanent housing and resume their lives, said Catherine J. Marsh, director of the local office of the Volunteers of America.
"What we're trying to do," Ms. Marsh said, "is to get people to change the behavior that brought them to a shelter in the first place. Otherwise, they will continue to be homeless -- if not on a constant basis, then at least cyclically."
Despite the high rate of homelessness, the county cites a downward trend in recent years: 3,850 homeless people in shelters last year compared with a high of 4,553 the year before.
"We are beginning to get a handle on the situation," said Mary E. Glass, Commissioner of the County Department of Social Services. "But is it enough? Of course not."
Despite Westchester's $55.2 million budget last year for the homeless and the county's programs to address the underlying causes of homelessness, the county has been stymied in efforts to find enough permanent housing for many who are ready to leave shelters.
Part of the problem, Commissioner Glass said, was created in the 1980's, when the value of real estate in the county soared, and many rents hit levels that were beyond the reach of welfare recipients. The current housing allowance for a family of four is $393 a month, while the average two-bedroom apartment in Yonkers, for example, is $819 a month. In White Plains, that figure is $1,050, according to the Westchester County Department of Social Services. In addition, Commissioner Glass said, the State Department of Social Services has not increased shelter allowances for public assistance, and the county is now suing the state for higher allotments.
The latest figures for the homeless are still more than three times higher than in 1985, when there were 1,173 counted in the county.
 
'A Frail Group'
 Officials say that domestic violence, alcohol and drug abuse, lack of job skills or education and mental illness -- along with social and economic factors, including the recent recession and the county's shortage of affordable housing -- are the major causes of homelessness.
Officials also say that among single homeless men, like the group that gathered in the shelter's kitchen here, the problems are especially acute.
"They are a frail group," Miss Glass said, "and generally speaking, 65 percent of them are not going to walk off readily into the sunset, although some will be able to change their lives."
Of the residents in transitional housing at the airport shelter last year, 56 percent had mental disorders like schizophrenia and paranoia, according to the results of interviews and tests.
In drawing the profile of typical residents at the airport shelter, the Volunteers of America reported that 63 percent were 18 to 35 years old. Among those 18 through 21, 61 percent had been in institutions or had had foster care as children and 83 percent had spent time in jail.
 
Testing Is Required
 Although many of the men need drug and alcohol counseling and some must take medication for psychiatric problems, most are not dangerous to themselves or others -- and therefore they do not meet the state's criteria for institutionalization in mental hospitals, Ms. Marsh said.
Because of cuts in state-financed mental-health programs and the reduction of available psychiatric hospital beds, Ms. Marsh said, shelter systems statewide have "de facto become the mental health system" for the state.
Although the county runs drop-in shelters that can accommodate people on a short-term basis, Westchester requires all homeless who seek long-term shelter to enter an assessment program, which can include physical and psychiatric examinations, intelligence testing and job-skills evaluations. Placement is based on the results of those tests.
For example, after his evaluation by the Department of Social Services, Mr. Rowe was assigned to the airport shelter. And like the other men there, he is driven each day to one or more places like a mental health center, a work program, or meetings of Narcotics Anonymous or Alcoholics Anonymous.
 
Different Profile for Families
 As social workers attempt to address the needs of single homeless men, they say that a different profile emerges when they work with homeless families.
Sojourner McCauley, director of family services for the shelter operations division of the nonprofit group Westhab, said that caseworkers are seeing both one- and two-parent families, many of whom are victims of the recession and have lost their jobs and fallen behind in their rent.
They have also noted an increase in the number of single fathers, who have taken over the care of children after their wives leave home.
"But basically, the face of homelessness among families has not changed over the years, although some things are more pronounced lately," Ms. McCauley said.
 
Basics Are the Same
 Whether dealing with homeless singles or families, the county's philosophy is the same. "They need to learn life skills and money-management skills," Ms. McCauley said. "And sometimes they need treatment for substance abuse. In other words, they need to tackle the problems that made them homeless in the first place, so those problems don't resurface."
Like the Volunteers of America, Westhab is also under contract with the County Department of Social Services to provide for the homeless. It runs three shelters for homeless people -- the Vernon Plaza in Mount Vernon, the Westhab Family Shelter in Elmsford and the Westhab Employment Residence in Greenburgh.
From June 1991 to July last year, Westhab's assessment center in Elmsford had a caseload of 174 families -- among them 38 families with 2 adults present, 126 single-adult families and 10 single-male households.
In addition to its airport shelter, the Volunteers of America operates a 30-bed emergency shelter in Valhalla for homeless people who do not want to enter an assessment program and often look for housing on a night-by-night basis and the Huston Cortez Residence in Valhalla for 13 people infected with H.I.V, the virus that causes AIDS.
Other providers of services for the homeless in the county include Cluster Inc. in Yonkers, the Grace Church Community Center in White Plains and Westhelp in Mount Vernon and Greenburgh.

Shaw, the Eternal Schoolmaster, Can Still Be Wise

BYLINE: By A. R. Gurney

 BODY:
This season, two of George Bernard Shaw's plays will open on Broadway within weeks of each other -- not a common phenomenon. A revival of "St. Joan" by the National Actors Theater opens this afternoon at the Lyceum Theater, directed by Michael Langham and starring Maryann Plunkett. In March, the Roundabout Theater Company will mount Shaw's romance "Candida," directed by Gloria Muzio, with Mary Steenburgen in the title role. In this article, the playwright A. R. Gurney, who has two new plays opening this spring, "The Fourth Wall" in Chicago and "Later Life" at Playwrights Horizons in New York, reminisces about the Shaw he has known for a lifetime. 
 Several months ago, I received a letter from a professor in Virginia who pointed out that "1992 marks the 100th anniversary of Bernard Shaw's first play, 'Widowers' Houses.' " This means, he said, that we are celebrating "the 100th anniversary of modern drama in the English language." The professor was organizing a conference and planned to present a paper on Shaw's effect on American drama. He wondered if I had any thoughts on the subject. "As an educated American," he wrote almost pleadingly, "you must be familiar with Shaw." When I was a teacher, did I ever teach him? As a playwright, was I at all influenced by him? Did I have anything special I'd like to say about him now?
The letter reminded me how much Shaw and his plays once permeated my consciousness, and how little I have thought about him in the last 10 or 15 years. He was, of course, a dominant literary figure during the first half of the century, receiving the Nobel Prize at the peak of his career in 1925. Still alive and writing when I was a child, he was invoked and referred to simply by his initials: G. B. S., like F. D. R. or M-G-M. I recall hearing him discussed at the dinner table with some irritation by my father, and with considerable appreciation by my mother. I also remember seeing him in a Movietone newsreel, clowning for the camera in front of his cottage at Ayot St. Lawrence in England on one of his birthdays -- a spry old man with a scruffy beard, an Irish accent and a twinkle in his eye. He died in 1950, when I was in college.
By then I had already read several of his works and was fast becoming a convert. To a 20-year-old, he seemed startlingly fresh and exciting, as well as something of a wise guy, which was right down my alley. I had collaborated in writing two student musical revues, and had become so entranced with Shaw that I proposed to the head of the drama department that for my senior thesis I write and run the whole show, which would be a musical version of "Pygmalion." The idea was summarily rejected as unworkable, so I ended up doing a study of "The Winter's Tale." But Shaw stayed in my blood.
His plays were being produced all over the place in those days. His bright, quirky wit and passionate intelligence seemed to cut through the smug, self-congratulatory attitudes of the postwar 50's, challenging and engaging audiences in just the way he would have liked. I myself was bowled over by two particular productions: the first, "St. Joan" in 1951 with Uta Hagen, at City Center in New York, was simply the most stupendous thing I had ever seen. All I wanted in the world was to write a play like that -- strong, funny and moving, all at the same time, with a gutsy heroine dying defiantly for a brave cause, while everyone else told us what it meant for European History.
The other production that hit me where I lived was a touring company of "Don Juan in Hell" that same year. This was the third act of "Man and Superman," performed by Charles Boyer, Agnes Moorehead, Charles Laughton and Cedric Hardwicke, who all stood at music stands in elegant evening clothes, half reading, half reciting their sumptuous parts. I was entranced by the language and the ideas, and by the thought that you didn't have to have scenery or even much of a plot to hold an audience spellbound.
Shaw was well served then. It seemed that a year didn't go by without some all-star production of one of his plays ("Heartbreak House," "Major Barbara") sailing majestically into New York, with actors like Laughton, Maurice Evans, John Gielgud and Pamela Brown tossing his dialogue around the infield. "My Fair Lady" musicalized and popularized him, and the LP chattered continually in the background of parties. A Shaw festival sprang up at Niagara-on-the-Lake, near my hometown, Buffalo, and, after I saw my parents, I could see Jessica Tandy or Zoe Caldwell or Douglas Rain doing the great parts to a turn.
Even the movies did Shaw justice. Not only were the classic English films of "Pygmalion" and "Major Barbara" regularly revived in art houses and libraries, but now there was "Caesar and Cleopatra," with Vivien Leigh and Claude Rains, a refreshing antidote to the sodden historical extravaganzas it seemed to parody. Shaw was a little too subversive for Hollywood, but still one studio managed to release an independent version of "The Devil's Disciple," with Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas, and Laurence Olivier cleaning up as Burgoyne. There was even a production of "Androcles and the Lion," with Jean Simmons -- or someone who should have been Jean Simmons -- playing a gorgeously doomed Christian.
Movie stars returned to the stage in Shaw (Ingrid Bergman and Greer Garson both took a crack at "Captain Brassbound's Conversion"), and stage stars fell back on him (Katharine Cornell revived and toured both "Candida" and "The Doctor's Dilemma") because he always seemed to work. Amateur and college theaters did Shaw constantly (particularly "Arms and the Man"). Plus, we saw a lot of Shaw on "Hallmark" and "Philco" and "Playhouse 90," in the days when television had cultural aspirations.
By then I was teaching in the department of humanities at M.I.T., and I'd squeeze Shaw into a course whenever I could. Several times I ran a full semester seminar confined strictly to his plays and prefaces. Most of my students, committed as they were to future careers in science or engineering, embraced and enjoyed him. His sharp intelligence and utopian aspirations were exactly what they wanted. Besides, there was just enough absurdity in his plots to make him seem fresh and contemporary, not far removed from writers like Beckett and Ionesco, who were coming into vogue.
Then gradually he slipped away from us. My students didn't buy into him as readily and I found myself apologizing for him in class. The prefaces seemed increasingly strident and tiresome, the tone of the plays themselves felt smug and self-congratulatory. And he was performed less and less on the stage. Now -- except for such star-studded triumphs as the recent London production of "Heartbreak House," the occasional revival tends to evoke bemused pats on the head from the critics, and no major stampedes. Why not? What happened?
Part of the problem is that most of Shaw is expensive to produce. Economic considerations have a lot to do with whether a nonmusical play is done these days, and late-20th-century playwrights are as restricted by the balance sheet as Aeschylus once was by religious traditions. Even as popular a playwright as Neil Simon pretty much confines himself to a single set.
But Shaw is different. Most of his plays call for sizable casts and a number of detailed, realistic settings. You can cut him a little, you can even try to eliminate a character or two (as the Circle in the Square did in a production of "Heartbreak House"), but to mess around with the scenery can be tricky because his sets so strongly reinforce his theme. The set progression in "Major Barbara," for example, as we descend from an upper-class drawing room through a Salvation Army relief center to a housing project for a munitions factory, reinforces his argument about the underpinnings of industrial society.
In Chekhov, the characters seem to dissociate themselves from their milieu, and so, when his plays are revived today, the sets may be abstracted and simplified. Shaw's people, on the other hand, are very much committed to the environments they have made for themselves, and much of the action in his plays has to do with their difficulty in changing and living in new places in a new way. The steam goes out of his work when designers, in the interest of economy, make the setting insubstantial or abstract -- there's nothing for his characters to push against. Occasionally, producers find a way of doing him simply -- as they did with "Don Juan in Hell" -- but most of his plays work best when they're staged in the solid surroundings he calls for.
Yet production difficulties might be surmounted if Shaw hadn't come to seem like such a cold fish. His treatment of human relations, particularly between the sexes, strikes audiences today as arch and intellectualized. Freud, his contemporary, opened a number of closets, but Shaw doesn't show much interest in peering into any of them. Audiences nowadays, when they pay homage to the fathers of modern drama, seem to prefer the warm baths of Chekhov or the steam rooms of Ibsen and Strindberg to the bracing cold showers of Shaw.
Besides, he's long and "talky," people say. Shaw would be the first to agree with that, but he'd argue that his talk is exceptionally good. He also might add that much more happens in his plays than in either Chekhov or Ibsen or even Neil Simon, all of whom are talky, too. After all, even in as languid and garrulous a play as "Heartbreak House," there are sudden burglaries, accidental explosions and far-fetched recognition scenes. Most drama is talk, Shaw would say. The issue is what's talked about.
And here may be the real reason why Shaw is no longer so popular. Unlike any other major writer in the 20th century, Shaw, at least until the last years of his life, thought he had an answer. By the time he was 40, he had managed to fabricate for himself a philosophy that seemed to synthesize a majority of the major ideas of the 19th century and tie them together so that everything came out right in the end. Most of all, he fell in love with the concept of evolution, but to him it was conscious, creative and purposeful. To Shaw, for example, giraffes had long necks because they wanted to have them to reach higher leaves, and those with this will to reach higher would pass on this characteristic to their progeny. (Darwin, of course, argued that long necks came by genetic accident, and subsequent long-necks survived simply because they happened to be more fit to survive.)
Shaw grafted his notion of creative evolution onto Nietzsche's ideas of the Superman and the Will to Power and Hegel's sense of the dialectic. To Shaw, Caesar and Joan and even Napoleon were examples of the superman struggling to improve human events, and his fictitious heroes like Jack Tanner or Henry Higgins or Dick Dudgeon were more comic versions of the same. He persuaded himself that the world was being nudged forward by a Bergsonian elan vital, or Life Force, toward a higher consciousness and a more just society. Our job as responsive Shavians was to plug into this force and translate it into action. And his job was to write plays that dramatized these forces and made them accessible to us. Shaw was a good enough playwright to recognize that audiences needed story, suspense, conflict and humor when they went to the theater, but you always have the sense that he's got the answer in the back of his book.
There is nothing remotely tragic in Shaw's vision, and he was very uncomfortable with the sense of anxiety or despair that pervades so much modern drama. Even in his "St. Joan," which has the most serious ending of any of his plays, he has to tack on an epilogue where his heroine returns bouncily for a congenial discussion with all the people who let her down. What angers Shaw, and depresses him later on, is not that people are cruel or evil or arbitrary, but rather that they simply don't learn fast enough. He is the schoolmaster, his plays are the lesson plan and audiences are a recalcitrant group of students who have to be lectured, cajoled, entertained and reprimanded into doing homework. Yet underneath there seems to be the cheerful assumption that we'll all ultimately graduate with high honors.
Possibly, then, it is this fundamentally jaunty belief in ultimate human progress that has lately caused students and audiences to shrug him off. For all his passionate indignation at the evils of modern society, and for all his deep concern for such contemporary issues as feminism and internationalism and disarmament, there remains in Shaw the feeling that underneath all our 20th-century turbulence is an evolutionary net that will catch us when we fall. He may amuse us now and then, but since we no longer can subscribe to such a buoyant philosophy, we can no longer embrace him with the enthusiasm we did in our youth, when the century was still young.
In these pessimistic days, I am almost tempted to argue that Shaw is really not the father of modern drama in English at all, but rather a quaint and quirky throwback to an almost Dickensian sensibility where all the knots had to be tied up in a happy ending.
Yet maybe, like Dickens, Shaw is to be considered one of those writers who transcends their own limitations. Certainly we can find elements in many of his plays that seem to go against the grain and give him a surprising thickness and ambiguity. Several of his villains and naysayers, for example, have such seriousness and persuasiveness that they tend to steal the show. In his later plays, when even his heroes begin to lose their faith in the improvability of the world, this countercurrent of pessimism becomes increasingly poignant, couched as it is in the rich Shavian style that he forged from the rolling cadences of the King James Bible and his oratorical experiences at Hyde Park Corner.
Ultimately, Shaw should speak for himself, as he always did. In "Too True to Be Good," a defrocked minister frantically tries to hold onto an ideology that is slipping away:
"I stand midway between youth and age like a man who has missed his train: too late for the last, too early for the next. What am I to do? What am I? . . . I am by nature a preacher. I am the new Ecclesiastes. But I have no Bible, no creed: the war has shot both out of my hands. . . . I must have affirmations to preach. Without them, the young will not listen to me; for even the young grow tired of denials . . . the preacher must preach the way of life. Oh, if I could only find it. . . . And meanwhile my gift has possession of me: I must preach and preach and preach no matter how late the hour and how short the day, no matter whether I have nothing to say . . . ."
